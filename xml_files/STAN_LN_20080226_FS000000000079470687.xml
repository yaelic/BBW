        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon Hong Kong.  Good morning London.  Could I apologize for my voice.  Actually it's a bit throaty this morning, because I was cheering for Spurs at the weekend.  Richard also has a bad throat infection, so the good news is Peter Sands is in good health.  His voice is very clear.  And then I'm going to be really corny and say that these results speak for themselves.  I'm generally delighted to report that Standard Chartered and profit in 2007.</p>
          <p>Showing the results of our investment program over the last few years in our key growth markets of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.  Profit before tax rose 27% to US$4.04 billion.  Income increased 28% to $11.07 billion.  Normalised earnings per share climbed 16% to 197.6c.  The Board is therefore recommending an annual dividend of 79.35c per share.  Now these outstanding results are a reminder of Standard Chartered's transformation over the last few years, but also of its enormous potential.  Peter and his team have done a great job in delivering these numbers against the backdrop of turmoil and dislocation in the global financial markets.</p>
          <p>Now, these are extraordinary times to be Chairman.  And it has been a very unusual time for the banking and financial services industry, unprecedented losses, huge volatility, recapitalization of major banks, no securities firm, investment company, insurance company or ourselves included has been unscathed.  And my reflections as a Chairman are that the industry as a whole has learnt firstly the overwhelming importance of liquidity.  Secondly, the need to price properly for risk and thirdly the danger of over complexity.</p>
          <p>The financial services industry has on occasion become too leveraged, too complex and no one really understood the embedded risk.  I am often asked for my views on what this turbulence will mean for our markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle-East, and the degree to which they have decoupled from western markets.  What is clear is that the US economy is now facing a period of weaker growth.  Whilst there is some evidence of decoupling across our markets, a US slowdown will impact the rest of the world, dampen global growth, slow the pace of trade and will take the heat out of the commodity markets.</p>
          <p>If we look back at the last US slowdown in 2001, the export orientated economies of Asia such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia were significantly impacted.  Although growth rates in Asia will also slow this time, the region now enjoys a degree of insulation and resilience due to stronger domestic demand, economic resurgence in China, growing trade links within Asia and strong policy response from government and central banks.  It is easy to focus on China as the growth engine but we should not underestimate the diversification of the Asian economies, the catch-up potential of India, the huge wealth creation in the Middle East and the infrastructure boom across the regions.  The emergence of sovereign wealth funds in Asia and the Middle East is emblematic of the shift in wealth that is underway.  So while we forecast the GDP growth rates will soften slightly in these markets in 2008, these economies will remain robust and their growth will be significantly higher than that expected in the US and the Euro zone.</p>
          <p>Last month I was in Abu Dhabi and I was struck by the enormous wealth creation and extraordinary vision and confidence in the Middle East.  I hosted a breakfast for Donald Tsang, Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR.  On that trip, he was on an official trip to the Emirates, surely that sums up Standard Chartered and the world in which we operate.</p>
          <p>The group today is extraordinarily well positioned to seize these new realities, thanks to its growing geographical reach and the scale and breadth of its products and capabilities developed in recent years.  We have a loyal and supportive shareholder base and in my view an exceptional management.</p>
          <p>In May, we welcomed John Peace to the Board as Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director, and Sunil Bharti Mittal as an independent Non-Executive Director.  We also welcomed Gareth Bullock who is in the front row here to the Board as Group Executive Director in August.  In September, Kai Nargolwala stepped down from the Board after eight years.  I would personally and on behalf of the Board like to thank him for his significant contribution to the Group's success and I wish Kai every success in the future, but not too much.</p>
          <p>We are also very grateful that we will get back to Kai.  We're also very grateful to Sir CK Chow, who will retire from the Board this year after 10 years as a Director, Non-Executive Director, and my personal thank you to CK, fantastic Non-Exec.</p>
          <p>In my last report to you I was cautious about the outlook but I did not anticipate such extremes as we have seen since then.  In the past six months we witnessed big upheavals in our sector.  At Standard Chartered we know that complacency kills.  We are operating in a period of sustained uncertainty.  We have learnt lessons in recent months.  We have made difficult decisions and we are constantly reminded of the importance of our liquidity and our capital strength.  So my message to you overall is that banking remains a risk-based industry and we therefore will remain prudent in our management and pricing of risk.  But we are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities that will undoubtedly arise.</p>
          <p>Standard Chartered has shown how it's positioned in the world's growth markets and the strengths of its balance sheet can deliver record results during turbulent times.  We are not complacent about the future, but we are confident that we will deliver another strong performance in 2008.</p>
          <p>Thank you.  I'll now pass over to Richard Meddings.  Richard?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mervyn, good afternoon Hong Kong, good morning London.  As indicated in our pre-close trading statement the Group has continued to perform very strongly, building on an excellent first six months.  Standard Chartered has continued to accelerate growth and the performance of the Group is strong as we enter 2008.  And there are many notable highlights in 2007, record levels of performance with income exceeding $11 billion and profits in excess of $4 billion, both for the first time. Broad-based headline income growth of 28% with like-for-like organic income growth continuing to accelerate now at 23% for the year, a record high.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong has delivered over $1 billion of profit and both India and our MESA region have comfortably exceeded $0.5 billion of profit for the first time.  We have continued to invest in the franchise whilst at the same time delivering good EPS growth of 15.8%.  Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong.</p>
          <p>Now, let me take you through the numbers, starting with the Group as a whole.  At the Group level, income has grown 28% during the course of 2007, despite the challenging market conditions wholesale banking income growth has accelerated to 37% in the second half of the year from 30% in the first half.  Given this strong income momentum, we have continued to invest in the franchise, costs rising 30%.</p>
          <p>There are a number of items of a singular nature in these results.  There were two one-off items that in aggregate add approximately $215 million to income, comprising a one-off foreign exchange gain on the repatriation of capital in the Singapore branch following changes in regulation and the valuation gain on shares held in Visa, held by the Group.</p>
          <p>More than offsetting these two gains are a number of charges to income.  The two Whistlejacket vertical slices have resulted in a $116 million charge to income, the effect of an accounting mismatch on economically effective hedges in Korea ended the year at $155 million, and this is $22 million higher than at the pre-close trading statement.  A total cost of $166 million on our asset backed securities portfolio of which 131 million was to income.  The strength of the Group's performance has been such that even having taken the net negative impact of all these items, totally over $200 million, we have still surpassed $4 billion of profit before tax for the first time, up 27% on 2006.  And this performance excludes as we mentioned at the pre-close, income of approximately $120 million from the previously anticipated sale of our asset management company in India.</p>
          <p>The picture on an underlying basis by which I mean excluding Hsinchu, Pakistan, the increased stake in Permata and the three small acquisitions we closed in the second half of 2007, is also very strong.  With income growth at 23%, broadly flat jaws and profit before tax growing 27%.</p>
          <p>As seen in recent years it is the organic franchise that continues to drive performance.  Of the total income growth of 28%, approximately $2.45 billion over 1.94 billion or some 80% comes from the organic business.  The underlying rate of income growth of 23% is a record high accelerating again on the momentum seen over the previous three years of 13%, 14%, 18% and now 23%.  Our disciplined investment program is paying off.  What is also pleasing is that we have two strong engines of growth with each business contributing well over $1 billion of incremental income.</p>
          <p>Geographies, trading conditions in the Group's main operating markets generally continue to benefit from strong economic conditions, abundant local currency liquidity and benign credit environments.  Moreover in many geographies we are now seeing a clear upwards repricing of risk.  Hong Kong had a great year with income growing at a seven year high of 28%.  Operating profit in Hong Kong was up 34% year-on-year and the businesses have real momentum.  Singapore income was up 43% year-on-year with strong contributions from both businesses.  On a headline basis Korea's income was up 3% but profit before tax fell by 29% and I will talk in more detail about Korea later.</p>
          <p>Other APR, which includes geographies such as Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and China, saw income growth of 52% or 27% underlying with China and Indonesia performing particularly well.  Profit before tax increased significantly representing a strong bounce back following the credit issues in Taiwan during the first half of 2006.</p>
          <p>In India operating profit was up 71% driven by excellent income growth of 60%.  Consumer banking income &#x2013; Consumer Banking sorry, grew income strongly.  Wholesale Banking in India delivered an outstanding performance.  Peter will give you a more detailed insight into what is now Wholesale Banking's most profitable geography.  Middle East and other South Asia or MESA, which includes Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Gulf region, had very strong income growth of 33% on a headline basis or 26% underlying.  Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan all saw income growth exceeding 30%.  You'll notice that the Americas, UK and Europe region is showing a substantial loss for the year.  You should bear in mind that this geographic segment includes charges relating to Whistlejacket and the asset backed securities portfolio which I will come to later.  Expenses in this region have grown by 30% reflecting increased levels of head count and compensation costs as well as new investment.</p>
          <p>China.  China is beginning to power through in other APRs numbers.  Income in China increased 73% from $288 million in 2006 to $498 million in 2007 with about three quarters of income being generated by the Wholesale Banking business.  As one of the first four international banks to incorporate locally last April we are investing in a business of meaningful scale and breadth.</p>
          <p>In 2007 we have more than doubled the number of permanent staff from 2100 to over 4300 and our local network has expanded from 21 to 38 outlets.  We invested over $60 million in the Consumer Banking business alone in 2007 and this high level of investment resulted in a loss of the operating profit before tax level for Consumer Banking.  Nevertheless, profits in China overall increased by 72% in 2007 and are now some $180 million.  And these numbers ignore the effect of offshore income representing deals done on behalf of Chinese clients booked elsewhere in the network which increased 43% year-on-year to over $60 million.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk about the performance of the Consumer Banking business.  On a headline basis Consumer Banking delivered income growth of 24% and expense growth of 28% with operating profit before tax growth of 27%.  Underlying income growth is good at 15% reflecting continuing strong growth in Wealth Management and SME.  As we continue to invest strongly across our franchise, costs have grown faster than income and as expected Consumer Banking produced negative jaws of 4%.</p>
          <p>Income.  Consumer Banking income growth is increasingly well diversified with 9 individual markets now contributing $200 million or more in income with two markets contributing over $1 billion each compared to only 5 markets in 2005 and at that point no individual market contributing over $1 billion in income.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management income now contributes over 45% of total consumer banking income.  Other APR with an income growth rate of 60%, MESA with 38% and India with 26% have all performed particularly well.  Singapore, Malaysia, Africa and the UK business also grew income by over 20%.  Hong Kong saw strong double-digit income growth of 17% reflecting strong growth in SME and Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>Turning to costs, Consumer Banking expenses were up 28% or on an underlying basis 20%, and if we focus on this underlying 20% then almost half of this increase is attributable to accelerated investment in future growth.  We have invested in distribution capabilities key for both SME and Wealth Management with over 70 new branches in Pakistan, China, Korea, Africa, and Hong Kong.  Over 30 new SME centres in Hong Kong, Pakistan, India, and the UAE, 20 new consumer finance outlets in Korea, India, Hong Kong and China, and over 600 new and upgraded ATMs.  We have pushed on with product innovation and our Private Bank has now been rolled out in a total of 11 locations.</p>
          <p>We are both investing hard but also managing our BAU costs well.  BAU costs represent only 7% of the total 20% increase in underlying expenses.</p>
          <p>Turning to impairment.  The Consumer Banking loan impairment charge has increased marginally from $721 million to $736 million.  If you take account of the most recent acquisitions which have contributed a year-on-year increase of approximately $160 million and the reduction in Taiwan, where following the 2006 credit crisis impairment has returned to more normalized levels, there was a small net increase in loan impairment of some $50 million.  The issues in the UAE have been contained and Thailand is controlled but stubborn.  There has been some stress in India related to the consumer finance portfolio and in Pakistan we face a risk of higher delinquencies if the political situation deteriorates and December delinquencies did deteriorate sharply.  However, the sum total of these amounts is not material in the Group context and the overall delinquency indicators for the Consumer Banking portfolio continue to improve.</p>
          <p>To summarize for Consumer Banking overall, we have maintained double-digit income momentum.  Growth is broad-based reflecting the breadth and scale of our franchise.  We have a confident investment agenda for future growth and the asset quality is excellent.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Wholesale Banking.  Wholesale Banking has had an outstanding twelve months.  Across the spectrum the wholesale banking business whether viewed by product, by customer segment or indeed by geography is firing on all cylinders.  Income accelerated in the second half and grew 34% year-on-year and is underpinned by strong growth in client income of 37%.  We continue to deepen client relationships, increasing cross-sell and our shift to higher value products is delivering strong returns.</p>
          <p>We are becoming a core bank to more of our clients.  We have increased by 93% the number of clients which generate over $5 million income per annum and by 59% those that generate over $1 million.</p>
          <p>Expenses grew by 31% year-on-year reflecting higher levels of performance related pay and continued investment in extending our product range and capability.  Operating profit before impairment grew by an excellent 37%, so broad-based income growth and strong income momentum.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking had another impressive performance on loan impairment with a net charge to the income statement of $25 million.  New provisions remain low and recoveries in the leases continue to be achieved albeit as we predicted at much lower levels than 2006.  The quality of the corporate loan book remains strong and our forward-looking indicators remain robust.  Early alerts are stable at very low levels and the cover ratio remains high at 75%.</p>
          <p>Risk weighted assets grew by 16% against growth in client income of 37%.  We continue to be disciplined in managing the relationship between risk weighted assets and income growth with an ongoing focus on origination and distribution of assets.  During 2007 we more than tripled the distribution of Wholesale assets with 40% of this distribution being achieved during the final quarter of the year.  Our markets are very much open for business and we exit 2007 with very strong momentum, but as you would expect, we remain vigilant of the external environment.</p>
          <p>Income, the 37% growth in client income is driven by strong growth across all client segments and has been strongest in our key geographies.  From a product perspective Trade and Lending income grew by 23%, Cash Management and Custody grew 31% and Global Markets achieved 41% growth with strong growth in a broad range of products.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking expenses were up 31% on a year-on-year basis and 29% on an underlying basis.  Of this 29% increase in expenses in Wholesale Bank, 5% relates to incremental investment for future growth, 5% to increased spend on regulatory and control infrastructure and 19% as the direct result of business and income growth.  We've achieved productivity increases with BAU expenses growing far more slowly than client income and we are continually looking to improve the flexibility of our expense base.  Performance related compensation now constitutes over 40% of total Wholesale Banking staff costs, up from 24% in 2004, 31% in 2005 and 35% in 2006.</p>
          <p>Turning to loan impairment, Wholesale Banking loan impairment was a net charge of $25 million to the income statement.  New growth provisions remained at very low levels, although slightly up on the levels seen in 2006.  Recoveries reduced significantly year-on-year reflecting in part a declining stock of distressed assets.  We remain vigilant and have benefited from proactive and robust risk management and an outstanding performance in securing recoveries.  Although we remain mindful of the external environment, portfolio indicators remain strong and early alerts are at historically low levels.</p>
          <p>Overall, Wholesale Banking has performed strongly with record levels of income growth, well controlled investment and focused management of risk.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our recent acquisitions, firstly Korea.  On a headline basis, Korea's performance shows income growth of 3% with operating profit falling by 29% year-on-year.  To better understand the actual momentum of both businesses in Korea, I will strip out some of the headline level noise.  Taking account of three items, fair value adjustments of $98 million in 2007 against 106 million in 2006, secondly, the accounting asymmetry on economically effective hedges of $155 million and a charge in the low tens of millions following the recently enacted legislation in relation to dormant accounts.  Adjusting for those three items income grew by 15%.</p>
          <p>Consumer Banking income was flat year-on-year on a published basis, but up 10% on an adjusted basis with strong growth in SME and Wealth Management, partially offset by a fall in mortgage income.  Wholesale Banking performance was up 10% on a published basis but up over 30% on an adjusted basis.  Wholesale Banking income momentum has good traction as the investments in people and products begin to pay off.</p>
          <p>Expenses are up by 18%, which includes a full allocation of central business expenses which accounts for 6% of that increase.</p>
          <p>And now to Taiwan and Pakistan.  Despite the uncertain political environment, Pakistan's economy has continued to expand and this is reflected in our performance.  To give a sense of momentum by adding the Union Bank financials into the 2006 comparative period, income has grown 17%.  We have had particular success in cross-selling Standard Chartered products such as Islamic Finance, commodity products, and export finance capabilities into the Union customer base, with our market share of the export business increasing to 10% in 2007, up from 3% prior to acquisition.</p>
          <p>Pre-provision profits increased 19% year-on-year.  However, profit before tax on the same basis fell 17% reflecting rising impairments, as the political uncertainties impacted on the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Following the amalgamation of Hsinchu and SCB Taiwan, we've been able to press ahead with selling Standard Chartered products through the Hsinchu distribution network.  Income in the second six months of the year was 10% higher in Hsinchu than in the first six months reflecting the ability to sell Standard Chartered products through the Hsinchu platform.  Expenses have increased half-on-half from 119 million to $135 million.  Hsinchu came in well ahead of our expectations at the operating profit before tax level.  And we remain confident that Hsinchu will be EPS accretive and deliver double-digit return on investment in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Group's balance sheet.  The Group remains strongly liquid, both in part and as a whole with a diverse and growing funding base.  Current accounts and savings accounts or CASA grew by 21% year-on-year or 29% excluding Korea and growth was particularly strong in Hong Kong, Singapore, India and MESA.</p>
          <p>The ratio of customer loans to customer deposits is a healthy 86%.  Approximately 24% of assets are held in cash, net interbank placements, and marketable assets.  The Group remains a net interbank lender with approximately $9 billion in net interbank placements at year end.  We have a strong liquidity position.</p>
          <p>The strength of our deposit franchise has underpinned the increase in loans and advances to customers which grew by 12% year-on-year.  The loan book remains conservative.  32% of total Group customer loans and advances are mortgages with an average loan-to-value of 51%.  And nearly 80% of Wholesale Banking's loans and advances have a duration of one year or less.</p>
          <p>Let me now provide some specific comments on our asset backed securities portfolio.  The slide shown here represents the entirety of our asset backed security exposures.  Total exposure of $5.9 billion is modest in comparison to the Group's balance sheet, representing around 2% of assets.  You can also see we do not have material exposure to the asset classes that have driven the dislocation across the sector.</p>
          <p>Let me give you some headlines on the total portfolio, looking at the total column.  33% of the total portfolio is in RMBS, weighted average rating AAA at the end of December, geographically diversified with limited US exposure.  Average mark-to-market at the end of the January was 98.  19% of the total portfolio is in CMBS, weighted average rating AA at the end of December; no downgrades, very limited US exposure and average mark at the end of January of 95.  36% of the total portfolio is in other ABS, spread across credit cards, future flow transactions, student loans and auto loans.  These are AAA rated at the end of December with an average mark of 95 at the end of January.  12% of the total portfolio is in CDOs where we have written off 100% of the ABS CDOs in the ASG portfolio.   The other CDOs remain AAA at the end of December with strong credit enhancement and an average mark at the end of January of 93.</p>
          <p>Let me reiterate at this juncture and as we previously stated, the Group has no direct exposure to US subprime and extremely limited in direct exposure.  Apart from our involvement with Whistlejacket, the Group has no exposure or commitments to SIVs, SIV-lites or conduits.</p>
          <p>If you look at the Asset Securitization Group or ASG portfolio, you can see that 8% of assets or some $218 million are held in ABS CDOs.  We've written off 100% of a number of CDOs, including all CDOs that have any exposure to the US subprime sector.  These write-offs totaled $122 million.  In addition to the $122 million charge, the mark-to-market loss in 2007 across the balance of this whole portfolio is $44 million on the trading book and $38 million on the AFS book taken to reserves.  Given this significant dislocation in the external market this relatively small charge is testament to the strength of that ASG book.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the ex-Whistlejacket assets which all reside in our available for sale portfolio, we purchased approximately $1.7 billion of ex-Whistlejacket assets as part of the deleveraging of the fund between August and November 2007.  We have subsequently sold over $500 million of these ex-Whistlejacket assets resulting in the year-end position of just over $1billion.  You'll remember that alongside other capital note-holders we transacted two vertical slices during November and December, where we exchanged our holding of Whistlejacket capital notes, very representative portfolio of Whistlejacket assets totaling $3.3 billion.  These assets were acquired at market value and the acquisition resulted in a fair value adjustment taken against income for a total of 116 million.  The ex-Whistlejacket assets have no direct exposure to subprime.  There is some limited indirect exposure included in the $169 million of CDO ABS assets.  And this $169 million exposure had already been written down by around 20% on acquisition.</p>
          <p>Between the acquisition of these assets and 31st of December there was a further mark-down to reserves of $45 million.  To-date there has been no impairment of any ex-Whistlejacket assets and the weighted average credit grade of the entire portfolio is AAA rated.  The vertical slicing also resulted in around $1.27 billion of financial institutions paper been taken on to the Group's balance sheet.  These are large US, European and Australian commercial and investment banks and non-monoline insurance institutions with a weighted average credit grade of AA minus.</p>
          <p>Let me just summarize what I've told you in terms of the impact on the income statement and reserves.  This slide splits the impact on P&amp;L and reserves in both 2007 and up to 31st of January 2008.  And as you can see, despite the market dissipation, incremental marks taken until the end of January 2008 have been minimal and reaffirm the confidence we have in the quality of this portfolio.  You can see the $116 million loss on the vertical slices.  You can also see that in 2007 the impact on P&amp;L and reserves of the whole portfolio separate to the $122 million charge was a total of $83 million to reserves and $44 million to P&amp;L.  In 2008 the impact until the end of January was $13 million to P&amp;L and $36 million to reserves.</p>
          <p>Capital, you can see that we have continued to strengthen our capital ratios in the second half of the year and are comfortably ahead of our target ranges with a total capital ratio of 16.7% and Tier 1 of 9.8%.  Standard Chartered transition to Basel II on the 1st of January 2008 and if the 2007 year end position were calculated on a Basel II basis, the Tier 1 and total capital ratios would be 9% and 15.2% respectively.</p>
          <p>Outlook. We ended 2007 with strong momentum in both businesses and the Group has had an excellent start to 2008 particularly in Wholesale Banking, which had an excellent January.  The bank is in great shape.  The foundations are firm.  We are extraordinarily well placed to capture the huge opportunities in our markets.  There is more breadth and scale in the Group and our strong performance in 2007 is well spread across multiple products and multiple geographies.</p>
          <p>The level of risk and uncertainty in the external environment however makes the horizon more difficult to read.  So attempting to provide precise guidance on our outlook is more difficult this year.  We know what you expect us to deliver, double-digit income growth, double-digit earnings growth and mid to high teens ROE.</p>
          <p>Over the last few years we have been building a track record of consistent delivery of superior financial performance.  And we are committed to keep building on that track record.  We will not stop investing, given the opportunities we are seeing in our markets and we will continue to flex the pace of investment to insure costs grow broadly inline with income growth.  We will remain vigilant in our management of risk.</p>
          <p>2007 was a year of strong performance, a year of delivery despite the external turmoil.  We enter 2008 amid almost unprecedented market volatility and uncertainty but in great shape with great momentum.  Thank you and I'll now hand over to Peter.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Richard.  Good afternoon Hong Kong and good morning London.  2007 was my first full year as Chief Executive of Standard Chartered.  It's been quite a year.  Given the scale of the storms sweeping through financial markets, I'm delighted with what we've achieved.  Despite all the turbulence, despite the financial shocks and uncertainties, we have once again delivered record profits, a great set of numbers.  And, we haven't done this by slowing down or by squeezing the business.  We have invested in both our businesses at record levels.  We've stepped up the pace of organic growth.  Underlying income growth at 23% is faster than we have ever achieved.  And we continued to make acquisitions, six since our last set of results.</p>
          <p>We have not been unscathed by the financial crisis nor do we expect to be immune as it continues to unfold.  But our disciplined approach to running the bank, focusing on our strategic priorities has stood us in good stead, and will continue to do so.  We start 2008 confident but not complacent, acutely aware of the dangers, ready to grab the opportunities.  The bank is in great shape.  Both businesses have begun the year well.  2008 will undoubtedly be testing, but it will also be exciting with new opportunities emerging alongside new challenges.</p>
          <p>Our performance in 2007 was underpinned by firm foundations in the way we manage our liquidity, capital, risk profile and costs.  We are a very liquid bank with a well diversified retail funding base and a conservative balance sheet.  As Richard said we continued to see strong growth in customer deposits.  We have a healthy A/D ratio, the ratio of customer loans to customer deposits at 86% and 24% of our assets are in cash, net placements and highly liquid securities.  Many years of managing in highly volatile markets mean we have always taken a proactive approach to managing our liquidity.</p>
          <p>We're also very well capitalized.  Our ratios are well above our target ranges reflecting deliberate and effective management of the capital base.  In September 2007, we raised 2 billion of Tier 2 capital.  Despite stressed market conditions, the issue was more than five times oversubscribed.</p>
          <p>We are disciplined on the risks we take.  We have no direct subprime exposure and very limited indirect exposure to US subprime assets.  Our entire exposure to all asset-backed securities including CDOs amounts to less than 6 billion.  We have faced challenges and taken some losses as a result of the financial turmoil.  On Whistlejacket and on our asset securitization portfolio, the profit and loss impact was 300 million in total.  On the other hand, we've had an outstanding performance on the corporate loan portfolio and kept a tight grip on consumer credit.  We've also had to take some very difficult decisions such as on Whistlejacket.  We worked very hard for several months to find a viable way forward for Whistlejacket and are disappointed that we were unable to do so.</p>
          <p>Overall, I am confident that our risk approach, our strategy for balancing risk and return and the systems and processes that underpin this are working well.  We are disciplined and selective in the risks we take.  We are alert and anticipatory in our actions and because things always change, no one really predicted what has happened over the last few months.  We learn fast from our own mistakes and from those of others.</p>
          <p>We also take a very disciplined approach towards the management of our cost base.  We continue to drive for greater efficiency in everything we do and to manage our investment program on a dynamic basis.  We are not going to stop investing for growth.  The opportunities in our markets are hugely exciting and now is the time to grab them.  But as always we will pace and scale this investment taking account of changes in our markets and in our own performance.  These firm foundations will prove critical to our continued success as we face the challenges ahead.  The turmoil in financial markets is far from over.  We expect further shocks, further surprises.  It would be na&#xEF;ve to pretend to know what is going to happen, foolhardy to assume we are going to be immune.</p>
          <p>We also anticipate strains in the global economy with the slowdown in the US having at least some effect on our markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  How profound that effect will be, we don't know, but we are certainly anticipating some degree of stress in certain countries and certain sectors.</p>
          <p>We also see a range of political risks in our markets.  Kenya and Pakistan are two examples.  Yet as a bank that has grown up in the emerging markets over more than 150 years, we have plenty of experience of dealing with such issues.</p>
          <p>Alongside these external challenges we also face one big internal challenge that of managing extremely rapid growth.  This is all about attracting and developing exceptional talent, ensuring our culture and values remain robust, ensuring our control systems and infrastructure keep pace with the growth of our businesses.  In these sorts of markets it's absolutely vital that the pursuit of growth doesn't undermine our control and our discipline.</p>
          <p>Alongside these challenges new opportunities are emerging.  We're hiring excellent talent from our competitors, who are attracted by our strength, brand and growth potential.  We're seeing a flight to quality with a good inflow of deposits and we're seeing better pricing and differentiation of risk.  The return of more rational pricing of risk is undoubtedly good for us and for the industry.  And we're seeing opportunities to deepen our relationships with our customers.  It's at times like these that it's critically important to be clear on your strategy and priorities.  We are, we have a consistent clear strategy, well understood by staff, customers and investors.</p>
          <p>Back in 2003, we said we wanted to be the world's best international bank leading the way in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.  That is still our aspiration, and we're making good progress on that journey.  And our near term priorities remain consistent.  This time last year, I laid out a management agenda for the year ahead.  It's the same agenda this year.  The only change is that last year the first item was accelerating organic growth.  We did exactly that with an increase of underlying income growth from 18% to 23%.  This year I'm being perhaps a bit more conservative, simply saying sustained organic momentum.  We want to continue to grow the business at pace.</p>
          <p>Let me talk a bit about how we did accelerate organic growth in 2007, starting with our biggest business, Consumer Banking in Hong Kong which delivered a 22% increase in profits on the back of a 17% increase in income.  This is the first time in six-years that this business has delivered double-digit income growth.  What drove this performance, a strong growth in Wealth Management with income up 25% and in our SME business up 36%.  We have opened two dedicated SME banking centres and now have nearly 40,000 SME customers.  We stepped up investment in Consumer Banking in Hong Kong during 2007 and have seen immediate results.  We will continue to invest in this business.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking in Hong Kong also had an outstanding year with profits up 50% and income up 46%.  In fact, Hong Kong as a whole, with profits up 34% to just under 1.2 billion, made more than the entire Group did in 2001.  But the individual business that contributed the biggest increase in profits was Wholesale Banking in India where profits were up 299 million or 91% to 626 million on the back of an 82% increase in income.</p>
          <p>Now, Wholesale Banking's largest business, this is a superb franchise.  We have added more than a thousand clients over the last three years and have more than a hundred relationships generating income of more than $1 million.  We're investing in front line staff and new products and in infrastructure, seizing the opportunities emerging from India's rapid economic growth and the dynamism of its corporate sector.  With 83 branches across the country, Standard Chartered has the largest network of branches among foreign banks in India.  Including our global shared service centre in Chennai, which provides operational and technology support to our businesses across the world, we employee 18,000 people in India, making it by far our largest operation anywhere.  Overall, including Consumer Banking, India broke through $1 billion in income for the first time in 2007, growing 60% to 1.3 billion with profits up 71% to 690 million.  In fact, India has generated more profits in 2007 than in 2006 and 2005 put together.</p>
          <p>But it's not just in our biggest businesses and markets that we've seen accelerated growth.  We're also seeing the benefits from investments we've made to build new engines of growth.  Richard has already talked about China, where we are investing heavily and seeing very rapid growth in income, up 73% and profits up 72%.</p>
          <p>Nigeria is another example.  Nigeria is a country with around 6% GDP growth, 140 million people and a rapidly growing middle class.  Over the past three years we have invested in building a full range of products in both Consumer and Wholesale Banking.  In 2007, we doubled the number of branches to 12 and now employ about 350 people.  As a result of this investment, our income in Nigeria increased by over 62% to over 140 million and profits by 87%.  In 2008, subject to approval, we plan to double again the size of our branch network in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>Another new engine of organic growth is The Standard Chartered Private Bank.  Launched just nine months ago the Private Bank is making excellent progress.  With 11 offices across 7 markets and a 118 relationship managers, the Private Bank has 10 billion of assets under management, AUM, of which 28% is from 1,300 clients who are entirely new to Standard Chartered.  Whilst it's still very early days, we are seeing that our unique combination of local heritage and international capability, our ability to offer a broad range of onshore and offshore wealth management products, and our distinct brand are proving enormously appealing to our customers.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of American Express Bank, AEB announced last September will turbo charge the growth of our Private Banking business adding over 22 billion in AUM, new booking centres, additional products and capabilities and another 120 experienced relationship managers.</p>
          <p>The second item on the management agenda for 2007 was delivering on acquisitions.  This will remain a top priority for 2008.  2007 was undoubtedly a challenging year for our business in Korea.  Whilst externally reported performance was adversely affected by a number of one-off items as Richard has described, the fact is we are still not satisfied with our performance even after adjusting for these effects.  I have changed the management team in Korea and we are now executing a range of strategic initiatives to reshape the business, to accelerate income growth, to improve productivity and to enhance return on capital.  We are confident that SC First Bank is fundamentally a great business, a large growth platform in a very big, growing economy.  It will be a powerful engine of sustained profit growth for the Group.</p>
          <p>In Pakistan, we have made rapid progress with the integration of Union Bank.  Today, we are the sixth largest bank in the country in terms of profits with over 170 branches in 39 cities.  However, the political environment has had a negative impact, particularly on loan impairment and we're entering 2008 with a somewhat cautious stance.</p>
          <p>In Taiwan, we've made good progress since amalgamating the businesses in June.  We are on course to meet our target of delivering double-digit return on investment and earnings per share accretion in 2008.</p>
          <p>While our acquisitions in Korea, Pakistan and Taiwan were primarily about achieving critical mass and distribution in key geographies, the rationale for the acquisition of AEB was to reinforce our capabilities and scale in two key businesses across the world, Private Banking and Financial Institutions.  I've spoken already about Private Banking.  In Financial Institutions, AEB will double the size of our dollar clearing business and give us direct yen and euro clearing capability, as well as a sophisticated sales and service model.</p>
          <p>AEB will also extend our reach into a number of new countries.  Following completion of the transaction, Standard Chartered will be represented in over 70 countries.  We expect to complete this transaction shortly and look forward to welcoming AEB's 2,800 staff into Standard Chartered.  Our detailed planning for the integration is going well and has confirmed our initial view of both the scale and cost of the integration task, as well as the magnitude of the cost and revenue synergies.  This is a highly complex integration spanning 47 countries and involving the integration of high volume transaction systems but the prize is also very significant.  We anticipate that 2008 integration costs are likely to be around 150 million.  So, the acquisition is likely to be slightly dilutive this year, net of underlying earnings and early synergies.  We remain confident that AEB will be earnings accretive in 2009 and will deliver a double-digit return on investment.  This is a great deal, strategically compelling, financially very attractive.  We're bringing on board some highly talented international bankers with a strong cultural fit.</p>
          <p>In the second half of 2007, we announced four other capability driven acquisitions, all much smaller than AEB.  Pembroke, a specialist in aviation finance, which will reinforce our ability to play a part in the rapid growth of aviation across our markets.  Harrison Lovegrove, an oil and gas advisory boutique, which adds to our existing strength in the energy business.  Third, rather oddly named, A Brain, a fund administration company in Korea which brings new capabilities and customers to our securities services business.  And UTI Securities, an equity brokerage and advisory firm in India which will enable us to provide a broader range of Wealth Management products to our retail and private banking clients.</p>
          <p>In January, we also announced the acquisition of the Yeahreum, a mutual savings bank in Korea which will enable us to broaden yet further our product offering.  We completed this transaction yesterday.</p>
          <p>The logic behind all these capability driven acquisitions is to extend and deepen our product range and expertise, enabling us to serve our clients more effectively across a broader range of needs.  They add fuel to our organic growth.</p>
          <p>So what can you expect from us in the year ahead?  We will continue to stick to our strategy.  We will continue to focus on deepening our relationships with our clients and we will continue to be proactive and disciplined in managing our liquidity, our capital, our risk profile and our costs.</p>
          <p>We will keep investing to sustain our organic growth momentum.  In China, for example, we started 2007 with 21 outlets and ended with 38.  By the end of this year subject to regulatory approval we anticipate having at least 60 locations.  This year we celebrate 150 years of being in China and India.  We have deep roots in these markets and they are a huge part of our future.</p>
          <p>We will deliver on our acquisitions.  We'll get Korea back on track.  We'll deliver earnings accretion in Taiwan.  We'll complete the AEB transaction and drive the integration.</p>
          <p>2007 was a great year for Standard Chartered.  We weren't unscathed by the financial crisis, but we delivered record results.  2008 will not be smooth sailing for the banking industry.  The sea is rough.  The winds are strong.  We do anticipate further challenges, new shocks and surprises.  We do not expect to be immune.  We will be confident but not complacent, bold yet vigilant.  We have weathered many difficult periods in our long history as a Bank.  I can assure you we have never been in better shape.  Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mervyn, Richard and I will now take questions in London, Jaspal, Ben, Nick and Julian will take your questions in Hong Kong.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the overall levels of growth, we're taking about &#x2013; in revenues it seems a bit picky to sort of argue about the adjustments and what should be in and what should be out.  I'm just looking though in terms of what's building in terms of the cost momentum, particularly in the Wholesale Bank, because we go into this year, seas are rough, we could easily see contagion from the US slowdown hitting some of your Wholesale markets.  I'm just interested in how much flexibility you would have in the cost line, if there was a more severe slowdown in revenue than you are currently expecting.  And, I have a second question please on Whistlejacket, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I answer in some general terms in there.  We are very conscious about this point, but we can't take for granted revenue momentum in 2008.  The businesses are in great shape and have started the year very well.  But it is a very uncertain environment out there.  So, we are managing our cost base with great focus, and obviously &#x2013; the obvious levers we have are one, the pacing of our investment programs in both businesses and second, variable costs, and particularly variable compensation in the Wholesale banking business.  Richard do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Peter.  I gave the stats around variable compensation and the extent to which we now have a higher again proportion of performance related pay with our Wholesale.  I think it's also important when I shared with you, I think that out of the 29% underlying increase in Wholesale cost, 19% I described as volume of BAU.  I think it's relevant that Wholesales head count increased by 23% during 2007 up to just over 11,000 people.  So, we clearly are mindful and managing the levers.  Within Wholesale again, we would estimate that around 30% of cost base is variable and flexible if you take non-FT investments, travel and entertainment, consultancy and then all types of spend that we will get.  So, within that there is enough picture I think for us to be able to pull levers and if we see incomes, though consumer on the picture again there is a more aggressive investment program within consumer in quantum. So that tends to be a significant element of our cost management against income.  So as you saw us do in the first half of 2006 when the Taiwan credit crisis came upon the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.  Just on Whistlejacket, I think in terms of economic damage immaterial, just in terms of reputation damage both with investors in the capital notes and also maybe in the wider, sort of credit markets, or particularly in the structured credit markets.  I mean do you think there is any risk of sort of permanent damage to reputation from the whole affair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, these are very challenging markets and all of us, I think in the financial services industry face difficult decisions, difficult trade-offs to make.  We are acutely aware that some of our clients as capital note-holders have taken losses as a result of their investment in Whistlejacket as have we.  We are concerned about the impact on them.  We are disappointed with the outcome and we place huge value as a bank that has been operating for over 150 years, we place huge value on our reputation and long-term relationships.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's John-Paul Crutchley from Merrill Lynch.  I have got one question on Whistlejacket and a couple on margins points too.  I just wonder if you can tell us in terms of accounting what sort of happens next to Whistlejacket, because clearly the assets over time unwind.  And, what that does in terms of fair value adjustments which have been taken?  Should we expect any unwind of that or is there anything to bear in mind there?  The second was just two questions on margin, firstly Hong Kong margin fairly flat, well obviously a very interesting interest rate dynamic with the Fed cutting rates, so I was wondering if you can tell us how the balance sheet is positioned there and what we should expect in terms of &#x2013; whether that will have an impact on margins for the year ahead?  And, secondly in India where there has been a very sharp rise in your margin over the course of the year which I assume has been one of the key drivers behind the increase in profit we're seeing there, I was wondering if you can comment on the sustainability of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there are some Richard's, question to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we will pass those to Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say thank you very much guys.  Carling Cup, <mark type="inaudible" />.  First of all on Whistlejacket, I think with regard to the main fair value adjustment through income that we took of a $160 million.  We said at the time that we remain and we do remain very confident of the underlying quality, credit quality of the assets and therefore in holding those assets, that one would anticipate that that could come back through to income over future years.  So I think it's also important when you look at the, again the portrayal of the Whistlejacket portfolio and the ASG portfolio actually, the underlying quality that you are seeing both in terms of current marks as by way of indication and also the weighted average credit rating.  So we remain confident that the 116 would come back through income over future years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Duration of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The vast majority will come back in three to four years, but there is a tail which is significantly longer, but it's a small tail.  Can I then take India first and then I will come back to your broader interest margin point.  On India most of the rising margin came on liability side actually where you saw the rate environment move through the year.  We had significant advantage through our Indian business attaching to liability spreads.  In terms of how it feels for the future, on the asset side, asset margins in India across all classes saw a downward compression of margins but again relatively small. Nothing like we were seeing a couple of years or so ago, so small numbers of basis points.  And so most of the pick up is in Indian liabilities and you'll have to repeat, as I thought Peter or Mervyn would take it.  The second question JP I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just with falling interest rates obviously, Fed cutting rates and the Hong Kong balance sheet is obviously fairly liquid, maybe to expect lower interest rates in terms of the economy to have in an impact in terms of your outlook for margins and momentum of the top-line in Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a lot of moving parts here, broadly speaking, we're fairly balanced as a business in reaction to any movements in interest rates.  We tend to lose a bit on margin on particularly dollar liabilities, but then gained somewhat on the asset side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only thing I would add which is actually unusual phenomenon at the moment.  In a lot of the markets in the areas today you've got very low interest rates.  And then you travel around Middle East and increasingly Asia, you've got quite a lot of inflation creeping into the system and inflationary pressure, high commodity prices, overnight we are seeing weak prices going up.  So, I think one of the challenges at the moment is judging how this all fits together, low interest rates and low inflation in the west, but a financial market dislocation and then in the East, high growth rates or higher inflation.  So, I think overall we would say that the powerful economies are still in reasonably good shape in Asia or in the Middle East.  But we have to take account of the fact that there is a bit of inflation creeping into the system and that could impact a lot of markets and increasingly a bit of currency pressure around it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Hong Kong there is an expectation that negative interest rates will clearly drive higher spending rates and higher property prices into the immediate term, that I think will help the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Ian Smillie from ABN.  Three questions please.  The first one in Korea, looks like the balance sheet went backwards on both sides in the second half again, and you've talked about repositioning the business for future growth.  Should we expect a further rebasing down before we find that new core level and the revenue uplift that you talked about Peter, will we see that this calendar year or is that more of a next calendar year issue?  So, that's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, I'll do the Korea one.  I mean in Korea, we had a situation where both sides of the balance sheet had elements to them which frankly weren't delivering an economic turn.  We had liabilities which were priced in a way that was unattractive and we had certain portion of the mortgage assets which weren't giving an attractive return.  And so we've been in the business of reshaping the balance sheet.  Much of that has been done.  I think there is still work to do in terms of getting greater efficiency at the balance sheet and thus driving a better return on capital.  In terms of the outlook for '08, we would be disappointed not to deliver double-digit income growth in Korea in '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The second question is on deposit growth in the second half which was very strong across the Group.  It looks like about a third of that came through in the UK piece, I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of color as to exactly where that's coming from and what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly we adopted a broad stance across the Group in terms of deposit, sorry, in terms of deposit gathering.  As we saw the second half turmoil, financial turmoil in the markets un-roll and we early on established a very strong view with regard to deposit gathering across the franchise.  Much of the growth in CASA from a Group prospective first, you will see that that was part of a &#x2013; a key part of our overall strategy in any event, but I would say accentuated and emphasized through the second half.  With regard to the UK, at the moment actually I can't think what that specific answer would be.  I just want to apologize for that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  And the third question is on Hong Kong.  Peter you mentioned Wealth Management revenue is extremely strong.  Can you give us a bit of color as to how we should think about that this year, if stock market activity levels are to continue to slowdown in the way that we've seen year-to-date relative to last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I think you've highlighted a good point.  One of the reasons why we find it difficult to be very precise on guidance for '08 is that there are a lot of external factors.  One of them that JP highlighted was movements in interest rates.  Second is sort of the changing fortunes of stock markets and certainly, NFI in wealth management was a significant contributor to consumer banking growth, particularly in Hong Kong.  And, if sentiment changes for the year as a whole, one would expect NFI to be somewhat affected.  Now, there are other things going on that may give greater opportunities, say, on the asset side of the balance sheet.  But certainly, if you've got a weaker stock market performance you would expect that to flow through a little bit to a weaker NFI performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you would encourage us to think about that as being at least somewhat flow dependent rather than annuity type of non-interest income if you like?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

On the other hand, the market is quite turbulent out there.  We've got to make sure that we carry on investing for the future, because this is a huge scalable business opportunity.</p>

          <p>One more on the wholesale revenue side.  Throughout the text you made constant reference to the strengthened structured credit as being a driver of revenue in 2007.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to help you.  I tend to think of structured credit as being CDO and CLO type transactions.  Structured finance is any transaction where you put some sort of structure and wrap on hedging around a financing transaction.  The latter is what we do a lot of, the former we don't do much of.</p>
          <p>Can I just build on the China point, because I do think, I mean we have put the numbers out here for the first time.  The thing I would just caution you is I wouldn't expect &#x2013; I wouldn't want you extrapolating that as a sort of smooth trajectory of anything growing at 70%.  China is a market that is evolving incredibly rapidly.  We are investing very heavily in this market.  It was about 25% of CBs total investment, Consumer Banking's total investment in 2007.  It will still be the largest single place in which we are investing money in Consumer Banking.  So, it will have a very and heavy investment profile, revenue growth might &#x2013; will not necessarily translate into corresponding profit growth.  But in terms of creating shareholder value, we think it is unambiguously a good thing to do to invest heavily and build this business.</p>

          <p>Derek Chambers from Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research.  Can I ask a few questions in the area of private equity related business? One is you are showing $270 million of dividends from unlisted equities and an MDO book value of unlisted equities of $790 million.  I wonder if you could just say, is that related to the private equity portfolio or, and what is the outlook for that?  Secondly, I am not sure that you have specified anywhere where the Visa gains are.  Could you say which area they come from?  And in terms of private equity overall I think you highlighted that it was quite strong in Singapore and Korea, could you just say if there are any other geographies and what the outlook is and perhaps give us an indication of the size of the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll let Richard talk a little bit more detail about composition of private equity income and also answer the point on the Visa shares.  The thing I would say about private equity is not only has this been a good business for us, but you should expect it to be a growing contributor to our income.  We are building out our private equity and we are investing more, significantly more than we are realizing.  Now the nature of private equity as a business is that in any one period the amount that we realize in terms of profits is going to move a bit.  It isn't an &#x2013; it is never going to be a totally smooth progression but you should expect it to be on an upward trajectory given the focus we've put into building what is now a broader based principal finance business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On private equity, the realizations were broadly in India, Korea, Singapore, and China.  The deltas to help in, the material deltas year-on-year would have fallen in Singapore and in India with regard to where private equity was realized '07 on '06.  With regard to Visa which is in other operating income and you can see it in note 4 that has been allocated into those markets where the most &#x2013; the Visa cards are the most substantive elements of that franchise.  The two markets which have benefited most from the allocation of Visa will be Hong Kong first and Singapore, and then a very small amount into the UAE and an even smaller amount into Malaysia. But predominantly in Hong Kong and in Singapore and other operating in CB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just comment on the dividends on unlisted equities and what that relates to, is it private equity or is it something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the dividend.  I think if I'm looking at the right note &#x2013; that you asked about the dividend income. It really reflects structured transactions, where you basically got the flows either in interest or in dividends.  Here you see the dividend income being received on those structured products.  It's important to recognize that the interest expense actually lies pattern to the same transactions lies in the net interest expense line.  So, this is the income as an offsetting net interest expense within net interest expense line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we think of this as perhaps recurring income, but it might appear under a different caption, another year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you should.  We've done an incremental volume akin to the rest of wholesale banking portfolio.  It happens in terms of how the products fall in this year in the structures, to have more significant element lying in dividend as opposed to income flows, but the breadth of that business and the momentum of it is sort of inline with Wholesale growth, yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me, yeah, morning it's Sandy Chen from Panmure Gordon.  My question is on impairments, looking at obviously the second half, the impairment charge looked quite a bit lighter once you strip out the impairments on say ABS etcetera.  I wanted to look at the restatements that had been made in the '06 results because it appeared that NPLs were restated upwards quite a bit as well as the forecast provisioning against those NPLs both in the wholesale and the retail customer loan books.  How did that flow through, say P&amp;L and balance sheet in the '07 numbers because I noticed the restatement happened in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I'm not sure this microphone works all the time when I operate it.  I think what you're referring to is essentially adjustments made through to Hsinchu and Taiwan and essentially what you're seeing there is loan adjustments as we came to the end of the fair value period.  And so no impact from that in terms of P&amp;L.  The adjustments you see will be in the fair value adjustments attaching to the loan portfolio of Hsinchu.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so the goodwill portion on the balance sheet would have increased by roughly a 100 million-ish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of that not much is loans.  You'll find about 89 million of it I think from memory attaches to an employee benefits program and if you look at the underlying note you will see that there is an increased attaching to the liability to fund benefit scheme in Taiwan for the employees.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just a follow-on on the impairment charge, what's your outlook given that you're forecasting significant pullbacks in GDP growth in say, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  On the Wholesale Banking loan impairment charge, the gross new provisions have been, for the last two years have been at extraordinarily low levels.  And I think it would be unwise to assume that those can persist indefinitely, particularly in an environment where economic growth is slowing somewhat and we are seeing strains in the world economy.  That said, the condition of the book is very good and there is no deterioration in the forward-looking indicators.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Arturo De Frias from Dresdner Kleinwort.  Two questions, one on currency and one on outlook.  The currency one, some of the most important currencies you're operating have been appreciating versus the dollar substantially during the last two or three years, so obviously that will have enhanced to some extent your dollar growth.  Obviously it's quite difficult to get the currencies right, but there is a lot of people who thinks that the dollar depreciation long-term trend could be over or could be close to being over.  So, I would like to know first of all your view on that.  Secondly, given that you're operating in so many different currencies, what would be kind of net overall sensitivity of your P&amp;L to dollar?  I'm sure you have done some exercise of your sensitivity there.  And if you were to think that the dollar is not going to depreciate more, would you consider some kind of hedging somehow if that's possible.  I know you move a lot of volumes in different currencies.  So, it might be too expensive, I don't know if you would consider that.  And the second question would be on the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's about eight questions in one.  It's the future outlook for the global economy here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question would be more specifically on your outlook, not on the global economy.  I think Richard mentioned mid to high teens ROE when he was talking about outlook.  Given that 2007 was 15.6% which is obviously the lower part of that range, should I assume that you are expecting ROE to grow, to increase in 2008?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What should we do about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you probably you'll get three different answers to that question &#x2013; those questions.  So you start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just very quickly do the specifics around the currency impact on our numbers.  What you will see is that we have benefited overall from appreciating currencies in our P&amp;L between 1 and 2% at both income and profits line.  The predominant countries that drive that, India, which won't surprise you and Singapore and actually a little bit from Malaysia.  Korea also contributed again a relatively small amount.  We were however disadvantaged by the Zambian Kwacha and the Botswanan Pula, but not to the sense that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to make an admittance here that there was a little bit of wager if Richard didn't mention the Botswanan Pula.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the outlook for the dollar, I think it is very, very difficult to predict at the moment.  I think the Standard's prediction is that there is likely to be further volatility and that trying to sort of predict a sort of secular trend at the moment is extremely hard.  In terms of our exposure or vulnerability, we obviously do look at all our structural positions in terms of invested capital and different currencies.  We are managing that actively all the time, either hedging or not hedging.  Actually the main thing as far as we're concerned is that we like volatility.  Volatility is good for our business both in terms of the trading businesses and also because it drives an underlying customer demand for risk management products such as swaps hedging and so on.  So, that is a good thing as far as we're concerned.  It doesn't really &#x2013; it's not that powerful a driver if the dollar goes up sort of 1 or 2% against our currencies.  A very large proportion of our business is denominated in dollars or dollar pegged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other thing I would add, actually I think people are finding it difficult to really bring all of these factors together in the outlook.  I mean you have got the emergence of the sovereign wealth funds.  You have got high energy prices, high commodity, bit of inflation in the system, we talked about earlier.  You have then got a bit of pressure on GCC currencies, bit of pressure on REMB which we would assume would appreciate.  So I think when you put it all of that together with uncertainty about the US, I think people are therefore not sure what's going to happen currencies into the outlook.</p>
          <p>I think where we are positioned as a bank is in we are positioned in markets which have huge potential.  And, yes there maybe some short-term currency issues, but overall the next 5, 10, 15 years we've got to make sure, which as the team has demonstrated is doing, is investing the right amount because they've got great potential.  Yeah, over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we'd just continue to say mid-to-high teens ROE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Robert Sage from Bear Stearns.  I was just really wondering whether you could comment on the likely trajectory between the different businesses, Consumer versus Wholesale in terms of income and profits.  One of the things that was quite notable was the continuation of the much higher level of investment being put into the Consumer Bank versus the Wholesale Bank. So presumably at some stage you should begin to sort of see the two harmonizing together.  It's very eye catching that, was it 5% of your growth in costs that was actually put into investment, you're getting this sort of over 30% growth in income in Wholesale Banking. A related question that I guess is, can you sort of give a flavor of what in particular you think will be driving your Wholesale Banking income streams as we go through the course of this year?  Is it sort of more volatility, very much replay of last year?  And I guess the third question, which is related, is that you've probably quite rightly made a virtue of your funding and capital strengths.  Do you think this sort of underpins opportunities specifically within Wholesale Banking?  And I guess you might also want to comment on just whether or not you could use that for acquisitions which seem to be quite the theme of your presentation today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then whatever I forget to answer. In terms of Consumer Banking and Wholesale Banking, I mean we have two strong engines of growth.  Wholesale Banking has performed particularly strongly in terms of the momentum and growth in 2007.  We don't have a particular bias towards one on the other.  We actually think there was great strength in having a balanced business and we want to continue to build both businesses strongly.  They have somewhat different risk dynamics and P&amp;L dynamics.  Consumer Banking tends to be more P&amp;L intensive in terms of investments in it because you have to build infrastructure and then you build an annuity business.  Wholesale Banking tends to be more intensive in its use of balance sheet capital.  So they have different and complementary dynamics and we will continue to invest in both of them and grow them both strongly.</p>
          <p>In terms of drivers of WB, Wholesale Banking income growth in 2008, I anticipate it will be very much what drove it in 2007, which is actually not so much about volatility and stuff.  It's actually been primarily about deeper client relationships.  If you look at the sort of maths of what we've done in the Wholesale Bank, the big driver is that we have more clients out of which we are generating substantially more revenues.  That's a question of depth of relationship more than numbers of relationships.  And I anticipate that that will continue to be the primary driver of Wholesale Banking growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of sort of liquidity and capital, I certainly didn't want to over emphasize acquisitions.  As Richard said right at the beginning, 80% of the income growth in 2007 was from organic growth.  Organic growth continues to be our primary focus, that's why we're spending &#x2013; we talked so much about investments in China, Private Banking, what we're doing in growing the Wholesale Bank and so that is the driver of the business.  We always are looking at the potential opportunities to complement that through acquisitions.  Whether we will see ones that are value creating in 2008, I don't know, <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>Let me just pick up on capital and liquidity.  We are I think as Peter said in great shape.  Let me just move across to something we have commented on which I think our capital liquidity helps, which is frankly the opportunity to continue to service our clients well and in particular in markets, where we are seeing, as we mentioned, upwards repricing of risk.  So actually, we now have an ability I think through that strength to participate in many of our markets where we are seeing returns particularly in Wholesale moving up.  And they've been moving up over the last three, four months across multiple products and multiple geographies.  So, I think that sitting here, Peter is absolutely right.  I think the pattern will be the same, it will be the same in Wholesale.  When the business is growing as strong as it is, in all customer segments across all its products, and in its key geographies, that pattern was to be continued as multiple strength.  And the Bank's underlying capital liquidity means that we're well positioned I think to continue to service our clients and need to grow and to take advantage I think of upwards pricing of risk, now increasingly evident across our markets.</p>

          <p>I think actually, if I may just, not for us, but I think there are a lot of the institutions actually at the moment, for ones that are in Wholesale and Consumer, that the Wholesale, which is not the case for us.  But, where Wholesale suddenly comes under pressure.  The danger is actually to the culture of the company, that suddenly one part of the bank's looking, and the other one is saying, no, it's no good in this and this and this and this, and starts criticizing it.  I mean we're in a very nice position where we have a very well balanced bank.  And, I think but inevitably depending on the cycle, one business might have higher growth rates than the other, and that's very important for the shareholders to understand.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the other point is we're getting better and it's something that started under your leadership.  We're getting better at getting the businesses to work together.  And Private Banking is a good example of this.  In the Private Banking, the primary source of new Private Banking customers is our Wholesale Banking customer base.  And also the Wholesale Bank provides a chunk of products in terms of structured deposits and treasury related products to our Private Bank.  And so we are getting better at getting the two sides of the bank to work together.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> at Lehman.  Can I have a couple of questions on the Consumer Bank, and then run a bit of detail on the Wholesale area?  In the Consumer side one of the features has been the strength of revenue in the second half in Hong Kong and Singapore.  Could you comment on the sustainability of that?  Secondly, I think in the past, you've given us some indications about the outlook for impairments in the Consumer Bank where you have some visibility of it.  Can you give us some feel for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I take, I mean just a <mark type="inaudible" />.  I think one of the answers I think to the second half picture on Hong Kong and Singapore relates to the answer I gave you around where Visa spreads.  So don't forget that within the Hong Kong income and the Singapore income, and broadly actually it was about 40 to Hong Kong and 35 to Singapore.  And therefore the lion's share of the Visa income fell into those markets.  So just in terms of the clarity of the underlying percentage growth in income, that should help you to get that picture.  Even having adjusted for that you'll see that the CB income growth pace remained very, very strong in both those markets, and they are broadly based.  I mean both with Hong Kong Wealth Management and SME in the main, in Singapore Wealth Management, SME and they also benefited again from the mortgage margins sustaining at the levels that they repriced up to in '06.  We also grew the mortgage book well in Singapore strongly.  So SME and Wealth Management in Hong Kong, SME, Wealth Management and Mortgages in Singapore, yeah, looks good, looks good in both businesses.</p>
          <p>On impairments, I think well I said in my script that the overall loan impairment indicators with the Consumer Bank are improving and they are, and we've highlighted I think the only four areas where we do see, where we saw some stress.  We have highlighted that UAE was a particular vintage in '06 which we have now brought under control and the underlying impairment is reducing period-on-period.  So I think that that goes away as an issue.</p>
          <p>Thailand is stubborn.  It was the phrase I used, again it's '05, '06 vintages, but impacted by regulatory changes, again first half, the minimum payment requirement was increased.  And in the second half, the regulators intervened on collections ability, both in terms of rules how you collect the scrip's and so on.  And that was an impact in the third quarter, this simply meant that those vintages remained stubborn, but stubborn is 10 to 15 to $20 million of increase, and I'm not anticipating it deteriorating.</p>
          <p>Pakistan is perhaps the most challenging one to read.  We saw a spike in the impairment rate in Pakistan in December.  When you collect, you got and get promises through the first three weeks or so of a month and then you collect on those promises in the last week.  And actually in December, the tragic death, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto as you know known happened on the last week of December, and frankly, collectors were unable to go out on the street and it caused a spike in our impairment rate which worked through to the paper.  And so we saw about a 25 million impairment rise in Pakistan, specifically I think attaching to that.  We would just be thoughtful about Pakistan as we look at it, but we're not seeing rising stresses in it, it's just one that we need to remain vigilant on.</p>

          <p>Robert, you had a question on wholesale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just about the asset-backed area, I mean you've given us a lot of detail on that, and can I just cover off a couple of areas which have been issues for banks as a whole?  You mentioned ramps in your CDO portfolio.  Can you give us your monoline exposure and also in terms of leverage loans in developed markets, do you have any exposures there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Monolines, our total exposed to monolines in this portfolio is about $700, just over $700.  It is predominantly actually where we have wrapped the future flow of transactions within other ABS.  As we look at the portfolio, we price those essentially against the monoline as opposed to against the underlying instrument. And in underlying instruments in all cases are performing very strongly, I think far higher than the monoline price would suggest; so, about $700 to monoline.  We have no western leverage loans.  We do have leverage loans.  Our total exposure is about 3.5 billion.  None of that is to private equity with the exception of one trade which is to our own private equity business.  And it is all to corporate clients where we're supporting their own acquisitions of divisions.</p>

          <p>Hi good morning, it's James Jinline here from Dresdner Kleinwort.  You're clearly seeing the benefits of previous investment you bring to the business, but you're also talking about the fact that you managed a broadly flat jaws.  So, I'm just wondering if you feel there is quite a bit of good investment that you're leaving on the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an interesting question.  Actually, given the pace we're growing, one of the other constraints we've got is just making sure that we don't trip up, that we grow our infrastructure controls, that we train people and develop them at the same pace as we're growing the front-end of the business.  So, even if we had a sort of an open wallet, I'm not sure that we could grow much faster than we're growing at the moment.  We have some real practical constraints on what we can actually put on the ground particularly in some of our most rapidly growing markets such as China where the constraints on the pace of growth in China is not money, it's making sure we do things properly and get everything in line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And truthfully, I think from a Board perspective, given my role, I think that's something the Board would look at in a broader way in terms of, there are just as many problems in coping with high growth as there are with shrinking difficult businesses.  And we have to make sure, and in which Peter and the team is, and doing a great job with that is that we manage the growth well that we don't stumble.  So I think that these are very high growth investment rates, and I think everybody is comfortable with these, but to go much beyond that would could be a struggle for the company just in terms of recruiting the people.  Last question.  No?</p>

          <p>I am sorry, just looking across, I'm sorry on the deposit piece, if you look across the liabilities growth you do see a higher pickup in liabilities in the UK, Europe region than you see across the rest of the piece.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yeah it's Abi Worth from Credit Suisse.  Could I just have a couple of questions, kind of bring you back to Robert's point on consumer impairment, and just invite you to comment on the India consumer business. Because you saw quite a sharp tick up in impairment H2 on H1?  Have you seen stabilization in that?  And also I just wanted to invite you, I had to kind of ask this question just on Temasek and your note issuing status in Hong Kong.  Obviously there has been a lot of speculation and they are approaching over the 20% limit that the HKMA has put in place there.  So if I could get your kind of comments on both of that as well please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On India, if I look on India loan impairments, it's a, the loan impairment rises from in India from our consumer finance book.  We've essentially stopped the model for the moment.  I think as we looked to the model, we found, I think there are many other competitors in India.  It's quite a difficult market to real consumer financing.  The size of the book is very small of itself, it's some 10s of millions of dollars.  We've taken a significant impairment against that book, but essentially stopped &#x2013; but essentially stopped what was we think the model for consumer financing in India.  So you wouldn't see any further coming through from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we've learned is that we bought PrimeCredit in Hong Kong, which has been a very successful consumer finance business.  A direct translation of that model to India simply didn't work and the increasing loan impairment is partly due to the fact that the model didn't work, and probably due to the fact that consumer finance in India as an industry is going through a pretty challenging period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean on Temasek look, I am reading a lot about in the newspapers, but they are very supportive shareholders.  They have been genuinely very, very supportive.  We treat them the same as any other shareholder and we're great, it's great to have them on board.  It's also great to have the note-issuance status, the recognition of it in Hong Kong.  And as you see in these numbers, we've had a spectacular performance in Hong Kong.  So, I wouldn't read too much into what you read in the newspapers.  We follow it just like you do, but all I will say is that we have a very good relationship in Hong Kong and a very good relationship with Temasek, long lay continue. Let me sum up, I would like you to take away a few messages.  I mean I think that this has been a very strong performance in 2007.  It's been an exceptional year, I think it's excellent because it is a strong broadly based growth story, both Consumer and Wholesale.  I think we are a bank which has a history of strong liquidity, and we have a strong capital base.  But I think it's also notable this year that we have got growth happening in a range of markets, whether you pick Hong Kong, India, China, right across the Middle East that there are many growth options with the bank.  We are taking the opportunity, Peter and the team has taken the opportunity rightly to invest very heavily for the future, but at the same time making sure that this is a bank that continues to deliver for today.  So, overall, we are in great shape and we've had a very strong start to 2008.  Thanks for your support.  Thank you.</p>
