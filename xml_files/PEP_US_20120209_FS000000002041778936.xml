        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jamie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us in person here today. My goal is to cover five topics this morning. I'm going to very briefly cover 2011 results and take a little journey back over the last five years and tell you what we've accomplished. And then, we'll give you an overview of PepsiCo and outline our strategic priorities very briefly. We're then going to spend quite a lot of time reviewing the results with a comprehensive review of our businesses that we recently completed. Then, we'll provide you our financial outlook for 2012 and beyond and then introduce to you a scorecard, which we will use to measure our progress.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me start with our 2011 performance. We issued our 2011 results this morning and I'm not going to spend too much time going into the details, except to tell you that 2011, on balance, was a good year.</p>
          <p>Snacks volume grew about 8%. Beverages volume grew about 5%. Net revenue was up 14%, and both core division operating profit and core EPS grew 7%. We had broad-based gains in Snack and Beverage volume and net revenue, and we were able to achieve net price realization that partially offset the extraordinary commodity inflation we faced.</p>
          <p>More importantly, in 2011, we made disciplined investments in the business to generate long-term growth. We drove productivity through cost management and, more importantly, we were able to offset the impact in some of our markets' skittish economies, natural disasters and political unrest with gains from some selective disposals of non-core businesses. And of course, we benefited from the acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, which is a critical addition to our Russia business that further strengthened our already strong position in this key developing market.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we also continued to generate strong cash flow. Management operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion and, as a result, we were able to return $5.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.</p>
          <p>So that's 2011, but 2011 really caps a five-year performance that delivered core net revenue compounded growth rate of 13%, core operating profit growth of 9% and core EPS growth of 8%. This performance also drove terrific cash returns. Dividends per share grew at 12% annually and our cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases totaled $30 billion over the past five years.</p>
          <p>This is the financial scorecard. What's not evident from the five-year financial performance is the incredible transformation that took place in PepsiCo during this same time. When I came into the CEO job in late 2006, I realized that PepsiCo had to make some bold transformative moves to remain successful well into the future, because most of the tailwinds in the first part of the decade were not going to be around in the second half and, in fact, some of them became headwinds in the second half of the decade. So we got to work.</p>
          <p>Starting in 2007, we began to scale up our emerging and developing market business. In fact, our emerging and developing markets revenues went from $8 billion in 2006 to $22 billion in 2011, with the mix increasing from 22% of revenues to 34% of the revenues over that same timeframe.</p>
          <p>Over that period, we also addressed a number of business issues that faced us. First, we had to reconfigure our North American Bottling operations in order to address the serious structural issues of not having an integrated bottling operation in the increasingly diversifying, but slow growth, Liquid Refreshment Beverage market. We had to restage the Gatorade brand and return it to growth following significant volume declines in 2007 to 2009.</p>
          <p>Then we had to restructure and re-franchise our Mexican Beverage operation to create a single entity with capable partners so that we could restore that business to growth. And then to kick-start the China business to a level &#x2013; Beverage business to a level that was higher than the past, we re-franchised our business to Tingyi, which is now in the midst of government approvals, and with this partnership, I think we really take our whole China Beverage growth to a whole new level.</p>
          <p>I think all of this creates tremendous vehicles for sustainable profit growth across many of our markets. But beyond that, we also increased our investment in R&amp;D by 50%, boosting our core capabilities and making substantial talent editions and partnership investments in areas such as advanced treatment technology, packaging, where we came out with the first 100% plant-derived bottle and equipment innovation, where we're going to be alpha testing a very exciting foodservice beverage dispenser in 2012.</p>
          <p>In 2007 to 2011 period, we also significantly expanded the Health &amp; Wellness offerings of our portfolio. And I know some of you have expressed some concern whether the pendulum swung too far in this direction and whether we took our eye off the core offerings. What I'd like to tell you is that the direct answer is this is an and game, not an or game. We have to focus on both growing the core, which is the Fun-for-You products and the Better-for-You products and step up our investment in Good-for-You products and I assure you that that's what we've done and will continue doing.</p>
          <p>So let me provide some context for what we've done in the whole Health &amp; Wellness space. First, we increased the permissibility of our core Salty Snack and Beverage products by reducing sodium, frying them in heart-healthy oils, using natural ingredients and reducing sugar and reducing calories. The second thing we did was dialing up the sales of our baked products and snacks and zero-calorie beverages, which is really capitalizing on a sustainable consumer trend. And the third thing we did was focus significant attention and resources on our Good-for-You businesses to make sure that we're fully capitalizing on their global growth potential.</p>
          <p>In North America, for example, we've been very successful in restoring momentum to Gatorade. We've made good progress with Tropicana and the next one we have to address is Quaker Oats, especially North America. Internationally, we've had strong double-digit growth over the past five years for both Tropicana and Quaker and we've expanded, as well, through juice and dairy acquisitions. Importantly, we've targeted resources working on nutrition platforms globally, the benefits of which we will start seeing over the next few years.</p>
          <p>As a result of these efforts, we've enhanced our core offerings in our Good-for-You portfolio and the Good-for-You part has now increased its share in our portfolio from 17% to 20% of our revenue over the past five years. So that's our narrative on our product shift.</p>
          <p>The other thing we did over the last five years was continue our investment in SAP. And we did that without taking any charge to the P&amp;L. We just kept investing because we believed that we had to really fix the technology base of the company so that we can have more opportunities for productivity improvement.</p>
          <p>And beyond financial investments, we made a major commitment to start shifting the culture of the company. The first thing we did was put in place an organization structure that leverages the scale of PepsiCo in a much more substantial way. And I believe the change was absolutely necessary. Because with this shift, we've gone from decentralized silos, decentralized regional silos, to what I would call now is much more of a connected autonomy structure. And if you look at the chart, the primacy of the P&amp;L still stays with the regions, the geographies. And that's the fundamental principle of PepsiCo. But we began to connect important elements of the enterprise to much more effectively leverage ideas, capabilities and scale across the globe.</p>
          <p>But this organization shift was just one piece of the culture change. We began to address other aspects of our culture that just absolutely had to change. We're evolving from being developed market dominant to having a truly global mindset in the company. We're also moving from a trade spending push model of selling to a more balanced, push/pull model of both marketing and selling. The other change is that emerging markets in the first part of the decade used to largely be a pay-as-you-go approach. That doesn't work for emerging and developing markets, which take a lot of time to build. So over the past five years, we made deliberate choices to step up our investments in key emerging markets because I think it's absolutely necessary to fully capitalize the growth opportunities and keep PepsiCo growing well into the future.</p>
          <p>And lastly, over the last five years, we started to change our talent development process from a traditional model, which has been very effective for us, to a more strategic approach to build, buy and bond talent to the company.</p>
          <p>We have tremendous talent within PepsiCo and we're absolutely committed to developing the talent. But it's also important to note that, as we implement some of the changes in the company and to our portfolio, we need experienced people with different skills to help us navigate through this new, volatile environment so that we can remain a growth company.</p>
          <p>Now I want to mention to you that the portfolio changes, the transformation, the culture changes, all of these changes are affected in a difficult macro environment. So on balance, I believe we've done many of the right things over the past five years to improve the business and position us for sustained growth and attractive financial results for years to come.</p>
          <p>Now let me be clear on one thing. I'm not suggesting we executed everything perfectly over the last five years. Could we have done some things differently or better? Sure. But we've gone back and looked at every one of our decisions and said what could we have done differently? Let me give you some of these things that I think we could have done differently. First, I think we could've used the synergies from the bottling acquisition to invest more in growing the top-line rather than committing to flow it through to the bottom-line. Second, I wish we had stepped up our overall brand support, especially in North American Beverages, earlier. Third, had we anticipated the commodity volatility that we saw in 2010, 2011, and going into 2012, we could've gone after productivity much more aggressively sooner to help cushion some of those commodity cost increases.</p>
          <p>I also think some of the people moves that I made perhaps could've been made a bit earlier, so that we could have gotten on with this program faster. And lastly, I think we could've done a better job establishing performance expectations with you, our investors, at a level that we could absolutely deliver on. And I think some of these topics addressed earlier or more effectively would have resulted in an even better operating performance and, as a result, better stock price performance, an area that I know has been frustrating for many of you in this room and this morning.</p>
          <p>And to be honest, the reason I didn't take some of these resets earlier is because a CEO gets a chance to make a reset once every 10 years. And you only make a major reset when you have a clean line of sight to a bounce back. And I didn't feel I had that clean line of sight the last five years. We have it now. And that's why we're doing it today. And that's why today, as you see in the press release, we are taking clear action, right now, to step up brand investment, increase productivity, reduce capital spending and improve shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>So as we pause to look at PepsiCo today, I think we are extremely well positioned. We generate $66 billion in annual revenue. We are the second largest food and beverage business globally. We have operating margins of 16%. We have net ROIC of 17% and we have return on equity of 31%. Our mission for the company is clear and focused. We want to captivate consumers with the world's most-loved and best-tasting convenient foods and beverages.</p>
          <p>And we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this mission, based on the significant structure and capability advantages that we possess as a company. We compete in categories with attractive growth margins and returns, whether it's Snacks, Beverages or the Nutritional category, because all of these categories have global growth of 5% or more. Our core businesses of Convenient Foods and Beverages are highly complementary. They share not only common consumers and customers, but they also share resources and capabilities, like agro sourcing, R&amp;D capabilities, packaging, flavoring, go-to-market systems, finance, HR talent and all the G&amp;A functions. And I think our businesses will continue to benefit from global megatrends like on-the-go lifestyles, a rapidly growing middle class in emerging and developing markets and consumers seeking a repertoire of products that spans Fun-for-You to Good-for-You.</p>
          <p>We have a very broad and powerful brand portfolio that connects with consumers, including 22 iconic $1 billion brands, a number that's doubled in the past 11 years. And these brands span everything from Fun-for-You to Good-for-You. And all of our brands are typically number one or number two in their respective categories. I don't know if you know this little factoid, but Lay's is the number one global food brand. Lay's is the number one global food brand and Pepsi, as you well know, is the number two global beverage brand.</p>
          <p>We also have a truly global footprint, with trends in more than 150 countries and, as I mentioned earlier, we have a $22 billion emerging market business. And we have tremendous go-to-market reach, which is largely enabled by our DSD systems, which have been developed over many, many decades. And they're all tailored to suit local market dynamics so that we can efficiently and effectively reach millions of points of sale every day and billions of end consumers.</p>
          <p>And we leverage all of these strengths to deliver against our five strategic priorities, which we've been focused on for the past several years, to build and extend Macrosnacks globally. As most of you know, we have a 10 times relative market share in salty snacks globally and have been growing the core or extending to adjacencies. We just keep growing this Macrosnack business.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are the number two player in beverages globally, and our goal is to sustainably and profitably grow this Beverage business worldwide. Third, we have three of the top brands in Health &amp; Wellness. We're going to leverage these brands and the Health &amp; Wellness category momentum to grow this Nutrition business.</p>
          <p>The fourth strategic priority is to leverage the coincidence of consumption between snacks and beverages and capitalize on this cross-category presence to grow our scale in individual countries. And lastly, we will manage the financial results and position of this company in a prudent and responsible way.</p>
          <p>These strategic priorities have not changed over the several years and we will remain focused on them going forward. Taken together, we believe our mission, the strength of our portfolio and strategic priorities will enable us to generate top tier financial results for investors over the long-term. Revenue growth in the mid-single-digits; we expect balanced growth between Fun-for-You, Better-for-You, Good-for-You, and this growth will be predominantly organic. And we expect to continue to benefit from an increasing emerging and developing market presence, and this portfolio translates to high single-digits earnings per share growth, with increasing margins and return on capital and leads to free cash flow growing in line with net income, which in turn, enables strong cash returns to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>So the key question that U.S. investors have asked us is, can this portfolio generate these kinds of returns on an ongoing basis? And that's what prompted us to undertake a comprehensive review of our business. We looked at every aspect of our portfolio and operating practices. And what I'd like to do is to share with you the scope, findings and the go-forward actions now that the review is complete.</p>
          <p>And the first area we examined was our portfolio. We began with a question that's been speculated upon a lot in the recent months. Should PepsiCo split its Snack and Beverage businesses? And the overriding findings from our portfolio analysis is that PepsiCo's value is maximized as one company because the current structure does three things. First, it provides compelling cost leverage across the value chain from an R&amp;D, procurement, consumer inside sales, merchandising, back-office functions and provides compelling scale and cost leverage. Second, it enables us to accelerate in-market growth because in-market, we benefit from the coincidence of snack and beverage consumption occasions. We benefit from the commonality of consumers and the opportunity to cross-merchandise and promote our products.</p>
          <p>But in emerging markets in particular, our Snacks business benefits massively from the scale of our Beverage business, which can be scaled up very quickly, and without the presence of our Beverage businesses, our ability to establish and grow Snacks businesses in emerging markets would be significantly reduced. It will take much more time and require a significant amount more of investment. That's the second reason.</p>
          <p>The third reason is that our operation as one company enables us to share capabilities across geographies and sectors and allows us to attract better talent. This is important everywhere in the world, but particularly in emerging and developing markets, where the combined scale of our two businesses helps us be the preferred company to work for. I can tell you that in emerging markets, and I travel there all the time, Pepsi is such an iconic brand that young people want to come to work for Pepsi. You bring them into Pepsi and a little while later, you put them into Lay's and <mark type="ph" /> Frito-Lay (21:15) and those products, so that's the virtual circle how it works.</p>
          <p>We estimate that simply on the cost side of the equation, the benefits of having an integrated company are somewhere between $800 million to $1 billion, primarily related to in-country G&amp;A, procurement, shared distribution and infrastructure, corporate G&amp;A and financing cost. And this does not take into account the profitability associated with top-line synergies. And it does not factor in the massive disruption that would surely occur if we tried to separate these two businesses.</p>
          <p>So net net, based on this exhaustive analysis we undertook as a management team, with external advisors, with the involvement of our Board of Directors, we are absolutely convinced that PepsiCo's value is maximized as one company. But we didn't stop there. We started our portfolio review to dig deeper into our portfolio of countries and businesses. And we asked ourselves the question, what is the performance trajectory of the individual businesses and countries and how can we sustain or improve well performing businesses? And what can we do to fix the few under-performing businesses we have? And we looked at what additional options exist to strengthen the portfolio and the optimal portfolio configuration to maximize shareholder value.</p>
          <p>And to answer all of these questions, we mapped our businesses across two dimensions: margin and growth performance, with performance relative to each business' respective market and whether the business is related to our mission. And what we found is that, for the most part, our businesses are highly related to our mission and are generally performing well.</p>
          <p>So this chart shows how our division operating profit falls across these dimensions. 75% of our profits comes from businesses highly related to our mission and performing very well. Non-core businesses comprise a relatively small percentage of the overall portfolio, about 5%, and these are well-performing businesses. The gray box down there represents less than 1% of our profit and we largely address these opportunities and I'll tell you what they are. And that leaves 20% that are related to the mission but with some opportunity to improve their growth and/or margins.</p>
          <p>And we are absolutely clear on what needs to be done in each of these quadrants. High performing rated business will be sustained, invested in and supported. Higher performing but unrelated business will be managed judiciously and will be divested only if it makes financial sense because most of them contribute positively to our returns and cash flow. Lower performing unrelated businesses should be divested and will be divested. And lower performing related businesses will be operationally improved to drive better growth and returns, with clear timetables for improvement. And if the underperformance cannot be addressed operationally, then we will seek structural solutions to improve return or reduce our exposure. And this quadrant is clearly a major area of focus for us.</p>
          <p>So let me give you examples of how our businesses map across these quadrants. Clearly, on the upper left, you see Frito-Lay North America, our Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade businesses, many of our International Beverage and Snack businesses. On the upper right, you find some of our Central Store food businesses, which are pretty small compared to the size of our portfolio. And while they don't really relate to our Convenience mandate, they are prolific cash generators with very high returns and will be dilutive to our returns and earnings under any divestiture scenario that we run. In our lower right box, there are a couple of very small businesses, Kretschmer's Wheat Germ, Coqueiro, a fish business in Brazil, and they've all been divested now.</p>
          <p>Finally in the lower left, we find a couple of our emerging market Beverage businesses, our North American DSD Beverage business and some emerging market Snack businesses. And we're making great progress in addressing each of these businesses. One of the businesses that was in this box was Mexico Beverages. By re-franchising and then creating a very strong entity with two highly capable beverage partners, I believe we've addressed the Mexico Beverage underperformance issue.</p>
          <p>In China, the growth of the market is explosive. Our growth was explosive but we needed a partner to really kick-start this growth. We now have a transaction with Tingyi pending. Tingyi will be our franchisee. It's pending regulatory approval and will create an anchor bottler in China that will really help PepsiCo take its Beverage business to a whole new level.</p>
          <p>We have a few Snack businesses in emerging markets, where I believe the natural growth of these businesses will improve the results and the operating margins of those businesses. That leaves the North American DSD business &#x2013; DSD Beverage business, which accounts for lion's share of the profits in this quadrant.</p>
          <p>So I want to set the context for North American DSD beverages. It's a large, highly-profitable category, North American Beverages. It's important to retailers because of its ability to generate shopper traffic and because it's profitable and an excellent cash generator, even to retailers.</p>
          <p>At PepsiCo, we have a very good competitive position with the number one share of the Liquid Refreshment Beverage category in retail. And most importantly, we own three of the top five LRB trademarks with Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Gatorade. And with Mountain Dew, we have the fastest-growing major CSD trademark in the industry.</p>
          <p>However, there are some issues. Category growth has been challenging. The marketplace is intensely competitive. Commodity inflation and volatility have made this market that much more difficult. And let's not forget, we do face a competitor who's emerged from a major reset that they undertook between 2004 and 2008. And I will tell you that in 2007 and 2010, we did lose some market share.</p>
          <p>Recently, our share trends have begun to improve, but we are not happy with the pace of improvement and recognize the need to accelerate progress. One of the reasons we bought the bottlers back was because we wanted to address the share issue in this business.</p>
          <p>So against this backdrop, we are totally committed to actions to improve both the growth and returns of our North American Beverage business. So what are we going to do? We're going to significantly step up our A&amp;M support to re-engage consumers with our terrific brand, focusing on our most important brands to drive the maximum impact from our investment.</p>
          <p>What's interesting, over the last five years, North American A&amp;M did not decline, but the spending was supporting too many brands and was spread across too many agencies. We allowed non-working A&amp;M to squeeze out working A&amp;M. So we went to work and we cleaned house. We reduced agency relationships in North American Beverages from 150 to about 50. So it's not just a step up in A&amp;M. The impact of shifting non-working A&amp;M to A&amp;M will be significant. And this whole A&amp;M spending will be amplified.</p>
          <p>We're also accelerating our innovation across product and package, with a very special focus on revenue management. For example, Pepsi Next is a great example of leading the market with product innovation. Thanks to the investments we made in long-term sweetener technology, we're launching a product that delivers the great taste of Pepsi with 60% less sugar.</p>
          <p>We also want to step up our package innovation. And great examples that will drive our revenue management agenda are the 24-ounce Dew can, which will drive further growth of this $1 billion brand into new occasions. And the Starbucks Refreshers launch in a 12-ounce slim can. Grab a can of that Mountain Dew as you leave and the Refreshers are out there in the lobby.</p>
          <p>We're also going to capitalize on the Foodservice opportunity, especially local and regional Foodservice. As many of you know, this was an area where we had a structural disadvantage relative to our largest competitor prior to our acquisition of the bottlers. We've made the appropriate changes and we're making good progress in Foodservice.</p>
          <p>We're also dialing up our excellence in execution by shifting distribution systems that will improve performance. A good example of that was moving Gatorade to DSD in small format. But we're not stopping there. We're looking for other opportunities to leverage the right distribution system for the right product.</p>
          <p>We're also going to use our Snack business to drive greater frequency of coincidence of consumption. And linked to our overall productivity efforts, we are stepping up productivity to improve margins and create additional funding for future investment. We intend to take out about $500 million to $600 million in costs of the North American Beverage business by 2014.</p>
          <p>We are also accelerating R&amp;D in key break-through areas like low-cost natural sweeteners, more packaging innovation and Foodservice improvement innovation. So a lot is happening in North American Beverages, all focused on one thing: to hold or increase value share in this market. And while we work through these operational improvements, we're simultaneously exploring structural options to jump-shift PepsiCo's return from capital that's deployed into this business.</p>
          <p>So that's a summary of the overall portfolio look that we undertook, but our operational review of the last six months went beyond a high-level portfolio analysis and really took a deep dive on the supporting fundamentals that drive our business. We know that success of PepsiCo is dependent on world-class brand-building and innovation, is dependent on excellent execution every day and every moment of truth, achieving the right cost structure and the optimal capital structure and, most importantly, being a great place to work. We went through and looked at how we stack up against each of these requirements. Let me walk you through the conclusions of our review on each of these items, what we found and what we'll be doing as a result.</p>
          <p>On brand management, in PepsiCo, our marketing approach has historically been highly decentralized, with each country introducing brands as needed. To prove the point, it may surprise you that we have more than 400 brands in our portfolio, and this brand proliferation over the years has diluted the incrementality of our initiatives. And there's no point stepping up the A&amp;M investment if it's going to be fragmented across 400 brands, so we knew there was a consolidation opportunity here.</p>
          <p>So as a result of our deep dive, we'll be refocusing and streamlining our brand portfolio, sharpening the positioning with consumers, herding a lot of the new innovation to the big brands and slowly start shifting volume from the tail of the portfolio to the core brand portfolio. We're going to invest and drive growth behind 12 mega brands: Pepsi, Dew, Sierra Mist, 7-Up in international markets, Gatorade, Tropicana, Mirinda, Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, Lipton, Quaker and the Sun brand. These 12 brands will have aligned positioning globally. They'll have consistent campaigns and scaled innovation platforms. For example, we'll be launching the first global Pepsi campaign in the summer of this year, with common iconography, a common approach and common positioning, the first global Pepsi campaign in PepsiCo's history.</p>
          <p>We're also stepping up our investment, our A&amp;M investment, behind these 12 brands by $500 million to $600 million in 2012, which represents about a 15% increase and because North America is such a large market, it will receive a disproportionate share of this increased funding.</p>
          <p>And while we're increasing the A&amp;M, we're also streamlining our agency relationships. Today, we have about 300 relationships with strategic vendors across the globe and we're looking to reduce that number by more than half, driving greater efficiency of spend. But spend is one thing. We're also introducing joint performance metrics with our partners and are implementing a pay-for-performance model, which makes sure that we get the best talent in agencies devoted to PepsiCo's businesses.</p>
          <p>So what all of this will do is allow us to shift more of our overall A&amp;M from non-working A&amp;M to working A&amp;M, which means reduce what we spend on production cost and agency fees to actually consumer-facing A&amp;M. And this targeted shift of spending to more working A&amp;M will add considerably to the brand presence consumers will feel than just the $500 million or $600 million in incremental spending.</p>
          <p>And beyond just the spending increase and the shifting of A&amp;M, we have developed one common way to measure brand equity across the world. And our goal is to track the brand equity evolution of each of these global brands regularly and intervene, when appropriate, to make sure we hold or increase the brand equity with our overall consumers in every one of the key countries in the world. That was all the brand work we did.</p>
          <p>The next area that we reviewed was innovation. And innovation is our lifeblood. We need that to keep growing, but as we dug deep into innovation, no surprise to you, the consumer environment has changed radically. Retail shelf space is scarce. Consumers have become more demanding. Competition has intensified, especially with the emergence of pure play competitors fragmenting the market a lot.</p>
          <p>PepsiCo is a prolific innovator and there's a lot about our innovation that we should feel great about and you should admire. IRI consistently ranks us as a leader in innovation in their Pacesetter Report. And in 2011 alone, we have 11 of the 15 top-selling items in C-stores and a lot of them were new products that came into the market in 2010 and 2011. But the problem is that, yes, we're a prolific innovator, but the staying power of these innovations can be much better. Some of it relates to the quality of the innovation. Sometimes, it also relates to our lack of patience, and a bit of Darwinian mindset that's engendered by the DSD go-to-market system. So as we sat back and looked at all of our innovation, we realized that something had to change in what we were doing in PepsiCo. We don't believe we're delivering enough incremental innovation and we can do better. So we are rebalancing our approach.</p>
          <p>We have now set very specific goals for three innovation types: refresh innovation, which is mostly line extensions; reframe innovations; and breakthrough innovations. And our goal is to drive a higher mix of reframe and breakthrough, which have the potential of being a lot more incremental. For example, the reframe innovation will be Trop50, which has brought back users into the Juice category, who left the category because of the high calories of juice and Tostitos Scoops!, which solve the issue of getting dip on your tie or dress when you eat a regular Tostitos.</p>
          <p>An example of breakthrough innovation would be products based on the work we're doing with natural zero-calorie sweeteners. Our belief is that when that's commercialized, which I hope is pretty soon, we will really start reframing the Carbonated Soft Drink category. And to enable all of this, we've improved the stage gate process to allow for greater incubation of new products. And we're doing one more thing. We are leveraging a Frito-Lay North America best practice. They have something called a new growth ventures model. They incubate products in a second distribution system and when it reaches a certain size, bring it into DSD if necessary. We're going to lift and shift that idea to North American Beverages because I believe we have a lot of great innovation which are smaller volume and tend to die in the DSD system if you put it in there right away. We're going to incubate it into a second distribution system in PepsiCo and then bring it into DSD.</p>
          <p>More importantly, the fact that we've now created the horizontal structures with the global groups is enabling the creation and development of more innovation platforms, as opposed to products, and it also enables now to lift and shift ideas across the globe so we don't keep repeating what we're doing, country after country.</p>
          <p>And the other amazing thing is in somewhat of a role-reversal, we're explicitly taking innovation from our developing markets, especially the great work on value innovation and bringing it back to developed markets. Stila bars and Quaker Cookies from Mexico is one example of a developing market innovation that's being launched very successfully in North America.</p>
          <p>The last thing we've done on innovation is we've restructured our relationships with our consumer insights providers and what we've told them is we're going to pay for insights, not data. So we've given them specific questions and we want them to answer those questions, as opposed to just buying data and allowing us to troll for it. So our priorities here are to drive higher top-line, get better price utilization, but, most importantly, increase our value share. And that's the result of our brand and innovation look.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the third area we looked at in great detail, which is our execution. Some of you asked in the reports you wrote or in meetings we've had with you whether we've lost our execution edge, especially here in North America. I would say no, but we went back and looked at it in great detail anyway. Generally speaking, this is an area where we are very good at and, in many cases, I'd argue we are best-in-class at execution. Frito-Lay North America, in particular, is awesome at execution. But we have to push the boundaries and not just be complacent that they're very good. And we also have to learn to share best practices across the company. So in the case of our North American Bottling, this is going to be a renewed area of focus, having just spent the last two years with an appropriate focus on getting the integration complete and delivering against the synergy targets.</p>
          <p>And we know there's a lot of best practice sharing that can go on between North American Bottling and Frito-Lay, both ways. So our execution focus going forward has several elements. In terms of driving inventory share in the store, our Beverage business as one company is beginning to align marketing and sales to one set of programs on promotional inventory. In terms of ensuring perfect orders and on-time delivery, our Beverage business will be creating a centralized dispatch headquarters in order to use sophisticated dynamic routing algorithms currently being used by Frito-Lay to improve service levels and reduce costs. And in terms of new product execution, our Beverage business will start to deploy Frito-Lay's industry-leading tools to ensure disciplined, store-level execution and tracking of all new products. And these programs respond directly to the measures most important to our customers and they have the highest correlation to increasing sales.</p>
          <p>We're also going to leverage data we've collected for our top accounts across both Snacks and Beverages to drive continuous improvement and perhaps stimulate some healthy internal competition to ensure that we're best-in-class in this critical area. And the last thing we're going to be doing on execution is driving and tracking coincidence of purchase between Snacks and Beverages. We've told you many times that our Snacks and Beverages are highly complementary and are consumed and purchased together. For example, 30% of CSD shopper occasions include a salty snack purchase and 30% of salty snack purchases include a CSD. So the opportunity for PepsiCo is tremendous, as we drive incremental co-purchases. And every point of additional share is worth $120 million in retail sales. So we intend to exploit this coincidence a lot more.</p>
          <p>Finally, now that we have Foodservice in our control, we are increasing our push on gaining both local and regional Foodservice accounts. And in 2011 we made real progress. We gained two points of market share in Foodservice. I mean, that's a lot in this business. We converted key accounts from our primary competitors, Papa John's, Chuck E. Cheese, Tim Hortons to name a few. And most importantly, we achieved a 98% contract renewal rate for our existing customers.</p>
          <p>We launched new product innovations in Foodservice, for example, Oatmeal at McDonald's and Burger King, and culinary innovation at Taco Bell via Fritos Burritos. I hope you've had a chance to enjoy the product. And we acquired 35,000 new Foodservice accounts, as a result of expanding the use of broad-line distributors to secure new, local and regional beverage accounts in all of our field acquisition efforts.</p>
          <p>So let me assure you if you had any doubt, execution excellence is what we're about, what we're really good at. And we will ensure that we drive ourselves and each other to be best-in-class uniformly. That's execution.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the whole area of costs and productivity, which is another area that we spent a lot of time on as part of this operating review. PepsiCo has always been known to be a highly productive and cost-efficient company. And we aggressively manage our costs year-in and year-out. We know that we're in a new environment with tremendous macroeconomic volatility, including commodity cost volatility. So we knew that we had to get even more productive to create the breathing room to deliver our numbers.</p>
          <p>So let's just take a quick look at our cost structure. About 29% of the cost structure is raw commodities. A little over 5% is A&amp;M. And 50% is manufacturing and SG&amp;A, excluding A&amp;M, which results in this operating profit of 16% of revenues. Our goal is to increase that operating profit number. So let me just walk you through each of the pieces.</p>
          <p>From a commodity cost standpoint, the way we manage risk is through systematic forward-buying so that we can get more cost certainty and increase cost visibility. But we're going to keep reviewing our commodity procurement approach to make sure that we have the optimal balance between risks, management and visibility. On A&amp;M, we're going to grow it from 5.2% of sales to 6% of revenues by 2015. And in 2012, with the increase in A&amp;M, it'll actually go up to 5.7% of sales.</p>
          <p>So the focus then is on this 50%, this big bucket. Our goal over the next three to four years is to take out 250 to 300 basis points of costs from this bucket. And today, we announced a three-year plan to double our ongoing productivity, which will generate over $1 billion in cost savings in 2012 and $3 billion by 2014. And $1.5 billion of the $3 billion is incremental productivity versus our historical run rate.</p>
          <p>These productivity initiatives are multi-functional, cross-sector and they're going to be delivering benefits throughout the entire value chain. Our plan will become the new norm for PepsiCo, by create an ongoing global productivity culture. And this productivity program just didn't happen. It's been months of effort across people, across the world, across all of our businesses, involving all of the functions, all of the businesses, all of the sectors. We're taking actions to significantly reduce our G&amp;A by implementing simplified organization structures. We're going to wider spans of control, fewer layers of management. We're consolidating facilities.</p>
          <p>We are accelerating the development and deployment of global projects impacting our products, packaging, manufacturing, transportation, how we crew our various factories and much more. We set up a Global Operations group and that's been a critical unlock because they've been able to coordinate all of these new ideas and facilitate the lift and shift of current best practices across all of our businesses. And we have a Program Management Office to track each of these initiatives, monitor progress, manage priorities, review achievements, identify key risks and develop mitigation plans for the Global Leadership team.</p>
          <p>A critical aspect of this program is a focus on increasing operational productivity into three key areas of make, move, and sell. And what we plan to do here is to drive world-class efficiencies through the deployment and execution of what we call Global Playbooks, because these Global Playbooks are targeted to positively impact areas such as yield, change-over times, labor and asset utilization across geographies and key lines of businesses.</p>
          <p>Now as I mentioned to you, the financial results of all of this work is that we're going to take out 250 to 300 basis points of operating costs over the next three years. Now, these productivity efforts will impact about 8,700 associates worldwide. Let me tell you the most difficult part of this whole productivity program has been the fact that we have to take out people. It's never easy when we have to take out people from the organization. The 8,700 people represent about 3% of our workforce and we have to make these tough choices if we are to create the breathing room to keep re-investing in the company.</p>
          <p>And the other thing we did, just to give you comfort, is that we were very careful to make sure that we were not impacting the core operations of the business in taking out these people. We looked very carefully to make sure that we had all of the right functions staffed with the right people and have the right resources so that we can keep the growth of the company going in the future.</p>
          <p>Well, we didn't stop just with productivity on the P&amp;L. We also looked at capital productivity. Over the last five years, CapEx has been about 5.5% of revenue. For 2012, we reduced CapEx to 4.5% of net revenues. Now, some of you might say, oh, you must have just cut it. Now, we reduced it. We took a very granular approach to understand where the capacity was in the organization, where the under-utilization was. How can we get lower capital into emerging markets so that we can match capital costs with the economics of that marketplace? So we took a very granular look at our capital and that's what allowed us to cut the CapEx in 2012. And our goal beyond 2012 is to run our business with a CapEx level of about 5% of net sales.</p>
          <p>But it's not just capital expenditures. We're also looking at working capital. We believe we do a pretty good job with our cash conversion cycle. But again, as we looked at our cash conversion cycle in a lot more granularity, we think there's improvement in our days in inventory, DSO and DPO days. And we think there's an opportunity to reduce this whole cash conversion cycle by 10%, which will actually generate about $200 million of cash annually, incremental cash. And to institutionalize capital productivity in the company, we're going to implement an easier approach at the operating unit level, an economic value-added approach at the operating unit level. So each of our businesses can see the direct cost of the capital they deploy, whether it's normal capital expenditures or tuck-in acquisitions they propose. This is going to be part of our ongoing Performance Management System and all of these efforts are designed to increase management operating cash flow and improve ROIC.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me come to the last and most important part of our operating review, which is our organization and people. We looked at every aspect of the company in terms of morale, succession, organization structure. We looked at everything. And let me start by telling you that PepsiCo is, and will always remain, an academy company. We're a highly desirable place to work. And, in fact, according to the Chief Executive Magazine, we just moved up on the list of leadership companies from number 17 to seven and we've been named to Fortune's top 10 companies for leaders.</p>
          <p>But as a company, we don't just rest on those laurels. We actually assess the morale of the company every year because we conduct an annual organizational health survey, which we then augment with a mid-year pulse survey just to get a sense for how people are feeling. Then we compare it on a cross-sectional basis across the company over years. We look at it by function, across genders, ethnicities, and we benchmark ourselves against a peer group of companies who conduct similar org health surveys.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report to you that our org health survey results show that, by and large, we are doing better than the peer group and the basic morale of the organization is pretty good. So from an organization perspective, we feel good about where we are.</p>
          <p>From a succession perspective, for the top 200 roles in the company, we have a five-deep bench. We identify people who can fill their job if somebody is hit by a bus, ready in one to two years or ready in three plus years. And coming out of this exercise, we've identified 500 high-potential executives who we are going to &#x2013; we've developed 10-year development plans for them, and we'll accelerate their progress through the company.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly touch on CEO succession. CEO succession at PepsiCo started day one when I became CEO. We've updated our Board of Directors every year. And we provide mid-year updates, as necessary, on the topic of CEO succession. This is very much on top of my priority list, has been since 2006, and I believe we have outstanding leaders running each of our major businesses who are all CEO capable. So from an organization perspective, from a people perspective, succession perspective, we feel very good about where we are.</p>
          <p>So that was the summary of our detailed operational review and a look at all the drivers of our performance. Once again, based on this very detailed look, we are comfortable with our long-term targets: grow revenues in mid-single-digits, deliver high single-digit EPS growth, grow free cash flow in line with net income and deliver attractive cash returns to our shareholders. This performance will be balanced across our geographies and our categories and, as you can see, we plan to do a lot of things differently in 2012 and going forward.</p>
          <p>We're going to increase A&amp;M spend by $500 million to $600 million and total marketplace spend by $600 million to $700 million. We're going to focus our brands, reduce the number of agencies and strategic partnerships we have. We're going to focus on improving brand equity for our key brands, and you're going to start seeing stepped-up innovation levels in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>We will deliver incremental productivity of over $500 million this year and a total of $1.5 billion of incremental productivity over the next three years. We will reduce CapEx to 4.5% of net revenue, which is about $300 million lower than it was in 2011, while still growing the top-line. We will generate more than $6 billion of management operating cash flow and return $3.3 billion in dividends, which is about $100 million increase over 2011. And we'll repurchase at least $3 billion in shares, which is an increase of about $600 million over 2011. And we'll do all this while navigating through incremental commodity costs &#x2013; or additional commodity costs of $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, in terms of operating and reporting transparency, historically, we've provided you data on Pepsi Americas Foods, Pepsi Americas Beverages, Europe and AMEA. Going forward, we will provide additional data on Global Snacks and Global Beverages. And within that, we will provide you top-line numbers, volume revenue on our Global Nutrition business also. So that's the comprehensive summary of our operating review, the findings of what we're going to do differently going forward.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Hugh Johnston to talk in detail about 2012 and go through all of the financial information. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As discussed earlier, 2012 is a year of transition, with EPS down 5% on a core constant currency basis. As we compare 2012 to our high single-digit long-term growth targets, there are several key drivers for this gap. I'll cover them briefly here and then we'll look at each individually.</p>
          <p>First, we face another year of higher than normal commodity inflation, driven by the lag effect of our forward-buying program. This negatively impacts our EPS growth by nine points. Second, extraordinary investments we are making in the marketplace, both A&amp;M and to a lesser degree in racks and routes, drives another eight points of EPS gap. To help offset this marketplace investment, we are, as Indra mentioned, embarking on a multi-year productivity effort, which is expected to deliver over $500 million in incremental productivity savings in 2012 for cumulative incremental productivity of $1.5 billion through 2014. This initiative is expected in 2012 to contribute seven points of EPS growth.</p>
          <p>Below the line pension costs will increase, as a result of the lower discount rate we use to calculate pension expense. And finally, our net interest costs also rise as we increase our borrowings and term out debt in a low interest rate environment and our tax rate will be slightly higher at 27%. The net impact of the latter two items is a reduction of three points. Note at this point, based on market consensus forecasts, we anticipate FX to be a three point headwind in 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to take a moment to go a little bit deeper on some of these. Overall, we are anticipating 7% commodity inflation for this year. Our commodity spend consists of three components: raw commodities, which we purchase via a systematic forward-buying program; raw commodities for which there is no active traded market; and then finally, costs our suppliers incur to convert raw commodities into ingredients and packaging materials. On non-traded raw commodities, we will have moderate inflation of 4% this year. And on conversion costs, we are actually benefiting from 5% deflation, as a result of value engineering and productivity efforts with our suppliers. But we are facing a steep 16% inflation in market-traded commodity purchases. Because we secure coverage in advance of the start of the year via our systematic forward-buying program, 35% of our commodity purchases were already locked by July, 2011, more than 40% by September and almost two-thirds by the end of December, 2011.</p>
          <p>As a result, we are not fully benefiting from the recent declines in raw commodity prices yet. While this program proved to be very beneficial to us in the past two years and over a cumulative period we are still ahead of the market, our costs for traded commodities are unfavorable to the market in 2012 on a percentage basis. It's important to note, though, that we expect our actual prices to be at or below the market prices on many commodities, but the rate of inflation will be higher because of the different prior year bases.</p>
          <p>The commodity inflation is highest in the first quarter and mitigates as we move forward through the year, as you would expect with the lagging effect. Regarding our productivity program, as indicated earlier, we expect to deliver $3 billion in savings over the next three years, which is double our historical productivity run rate. Our productivity program will touch virtually every aspect of our business, including manufacturing, distribution, and SG&amp;A. Specifically, we are heightening our ability to execute best practice sharing across our organization, leveraging new technologies and processes across our entire cost structure and will increase yield and throughput and reduce waste throughout the value chain.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are consolidating a number of manufacturing, warehouse and sales facilities. And we're implementing a more simplified organization structure, with wider spans of control and fewer layers of management, which will enhance our cost competitiveness and drive more effective accountability. The restructuring actions will have a one-time cost of about $910 million, of which about $750 million is cash. As mentioned earlier, overall below the line costs are a three point drag on EPS. Our pension costs are increasing by almost $100 million this year, as a result of a decrease in the discount rates. This is after a $1 billion discretionary, pre-tax contribution to the pension and retiree medical plans, which reduced the expense by $100 million.</p>
          <p>In addition, our net interest costs are increasing by about $200 million, as we term out debt to benefit from long-term, low interest rates, borrowing increases generally in line with cash, which sits internationally. All other corporate G&amp;A costs are flat, as reductions in corporate G&amp;A are being redeployed to support the global productivity initiative.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital allocation and cash return, we announced this morning that we will increase our dividend by 4% to $2.15 with the June dividend payment and we intend to step up our share repurchase program to at least $3 billion in 2012.</p>
          <p>Simultaneously, we will term out debt, taking advantage of that low interest rate environment. This will increase our leverage, which we are comfortable with because we intend to limit both our number and size of tuck-in acquisitions and to do them only in emerging and developing markets. Net, we expect to increase our borrowing, but again, it will only increase in line with our growth in cash. This cash is largely offshore and is therefore tax inefficient to repatriate. With this, despite a year of earnings decline, we expect to return about $6.3 billion to shareholders this year, up from $5.6 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning to the portfolio review, I'm sure many of you focused on the lower left quadrant of the matrix that Indra showed you earlier, and have questions about how we will scorecard that. For these businesses, we expect them to hold or grow share, begin to achieve profitable growth and improve their ROICs within a 12 to 18 month timeframe. If they don't, we will seek structural solutions as an alternative: collaborations, JVs, re-franchisings or divestitures are all on the table, all with the objective to improve PepsiCo shareholder value creation.</p>
          <p>Summarizing 2012, we're targeting EPS to decline by approximately 5% on a constant currency basis. Based on current market consensus ForEx, this is a three-point headwind, resulting in an 8% decline in EPS on a USD basis. As you model out the quarters, please keep in mind that commodity inflation is steepest in the first quarter. And consequently, we anticipate first quarter earnings to decline high single-digits. We expect CapEx to be approximately $3 billion, a 10% reduction from our 2011 CapEx level.</p>
          <p>Management operating cash flow is targeted at about $6 billion, an amount similar to our 2011 management operating cash flow, despite an earnings decline in 2012. And we have plans in place to return over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Long-term, as many of the headwinds we are experiencing in 2012 moderate, and as our A&amp;M investments take hold, we anticipate returning to our long-term target of 6% to 7% core constant currency growth in division operating profit; core constant currency EPS growth in the high single-digits; CapEx investment of no more than 5% of net revenue and core management operating cash flow growing in line with net income on a rolling three-year basis.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to how we'll measure progress on our performance scorecard. We will measure our performance along eight key metrics, four of which relate to what we do to deliver results and four of which reflect the results of what we do. Let's talk first about what we do, or what I call our input metrics, which include brand strength, execution, cost and CapEx efficiency and innovation. For brand strength, we expect brand equity on our top 12 global brands to improve year-over-year. And we expect A&amp;M spend as a percentage of revenue to increase or stay flat after 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of execution, we will track two key measures: inventory share and coincidence of purchase. These each have a strong correlation with sales growth and do so in a cost-efficient manner. Cost and CapEx efficiency are critical to our ability to deliver profit and returns to shareholders. We are confident that our productivity programs in both P&amp;L and CapEx investments will enable us to deliver on these targets.</p>
          <p>Last, we'll measure the success of our innovation, defined as new product sales as a percent of total PepsiCo sales. While we expect the first three metrics to deliver in line with our long-term target in 2012, we are not counting on an increase in innovation as a percentage of sales in 2012. For these metrics, we expect to share our performance with you on a semi-annual basis and we expect to perform against these targets beginning in 2012.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we'll also measure our performance against key output metrics that are highly relevant to investors. The metrics are value share, EPS, ROIC and operating cash flow. Our guidance and performance targets are consistent with these long-term targets and we'll continue to report them to you as we currently do.</p>
          <p>Because 2012 is a transition year, however, we expect to achieve only the value share targets in 2012. We believe that this scorecard is well connected to both operating performance and shareholder value creation and will enable you to clearly understand our results.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Hugh. Thanks to all of you for your attention this morning. And before we open it up for questions, let me just recap the key points we'd like you to take away this morning by returning to one of our earlier slides. We're excited about the initiatives we shared with you this morning and look forward to sharing with you our progress as the year progresses. And as I said as I closed my talk this morning, you should expect to see the following: a substantial increase in our brand support and focus; improvement in our brand health; delivery of significant incremental cost productivity; greater efficiency in capital spending; strong cash flow generation and attractive cash returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Now, as I turn it over to you for Q&amp;A, if I could just have John, Zein, Al, Saad join me here on the podium and we will take questions from you. And then we'll toss it to our sector heads so that they, too, can share their thoughts with you.</p>
          <p>So with that, it's over to you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah? Hang on. I think they're getting a mic there for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indra, how do you know this is enough? And I say that in the context, particularly around the spend back. So $500 million, $600 million A&amp;M only gets you kind of halfway to where you were at the beginning part of this decade, even if you pull out <mark type="ph" /> UPS (69:00) and Wimm-Bill-Dann. How do you know that's enough? And in particular, what does it tell us about the ROI of the overall business and the trend of the ROI of the overall business? As you're spending more and more and more, you're doing more and more but you're getting to the same number from a growth perspective. How should we feel about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I'll make a couple, three comments and then I'm going to toss it to Al to talk about how they're re-orienting the advertising spending, especially &#x2013; you're focused more on North America Beverages, right?</p>
          <p>Let me start by saying to you that over the last five years, the A&amp;M has not been cut. That's the interesting part of the whole North American Beverage discussion. So the dollar amount has not been cut. The non-working A&amp;M squeezed out the working A&amp;M. That's the big issue. What you see is measured media. We look at total A&amp;M in the North America Beverage business. Nothing has changed.</p>
          <p>The thing to be careful about, Gatorade, for example, the working media that you see, the ads, are a very small portion of Gatorade. A lot of Gatorade is more what they do with sideline presence and what they do with athletes and what they do to market the product to them. So you'd want to look at the overall A&amp;M bucket. Over the last five years, the single biggest trend is that we had non-working A&amp;M squeeze out working A&amp;M because inflation in contracts. And we had too many agency relationships.</p>
          <p>And the second is that we supported too many brands. In North America, because we are a total beverage company with a large portfolio of non-carb and carbonated brands, we supported too many brands.</p>
          <p>So the first thing we're doing is first focusing our effort behind a few brands. And Al's got a list of brands he's really going to focus on. And by shifting more non-working to working A&amp;M, what you're going to see is the 15% to 20% increase in visible dollars that we're talking about is going to feel like hell of a lot more in North America. So that's the top-line number. But that's not enough. If you don't support the A&amp;M with innovation and execution &#x2013; you can talk about the brands all you want, but you need news to drive incrementality.</p>
          <p>So that's why we're going to focus a lot more on innovation. And, Al, maybe you can talk about some of the innovation, the second point. And execution on the ground is going to really go up when we start tailoring assortments by store so we can actually get that incremental growth. Lastly, on total growth, the marketplace and North American Beverage business is only growing 1% in volume and in value maybe 3% to 4%. In the last four or five years, the new entrants and the pure plays have taken a lot of the growth and the big two, two and a half, three have not really had as much of the growth as the pure plays.</p>
          <p>So we have to figure out how to be a pure play within our own company and it's not for not having the innovation. We've had tons of innovation. We just kill it too fast. And this new growth venture that Al is setting up now, mirroring what we've done at Frito-Lay, will allow us to incubate these new products so that it doesn't always have to be a $50 million, $100 million case innovation the first year. We can actually start smaller and build up the business. So let me turn it to Al to give you his perspective. Al, it's all yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Indra has mentioned already &#x2013; spent the money on many brands, not the five core brands, so this coming year you'll see on Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana and Lipton substantial increases, not the usual just double-digit increases in these campaigns. And the campaigns are not going to be just increases in media television. Also digital is &#x2013; shows tremendous promise. I think not just digital but customer digital. Some of our customers are on the leading edge of digital show some remarkable new ideas that we could probably tie into and drive our business much more directly and focused to those consumers. So if we're looking at selling Gatorade to athletes or families that have young athletes, we can get to these consumers much more directly by using, let's say, the Safeway Card and the digital approaches that they use.</p>
          <p>But let me go back on a couple of the key things that we're going to be working on at PepsiCo Beverages North America. I don't believe, my observation is the business is not broken. It needs to be, I would describe it as a focus on the back-to-basics. And that means investment, substantial investments in the top five brands. And then, the other thing we need to do is significantly improve the innovation that we have going into the marketplace, both on Healthy and core. So this year in 2012, you're going to see a substantial improvement in innovation, but the 2013 pipeline is the one that we really expect to see some really big gains.</p>
          <p>But this year, as well, you'll see things like this that I would call, not giant innovation, but we've worked with customers on this particular product right here. It's a 24-ounce can of Mountain Dew. Our initial test market we blew out every can that we made. And it appeals not only to Mountain Dew users, but also to energy drink users that normally pay $2.99 for a can like this. This would be a lot less.</p>
          <p>Then I'd call it mid-type of innovation, like Pepsi Next. And Pepsi Next will have 60% less calories than a normal Pepsi. And I'd ask you to try some of it on your way out. I think you'll find that it tastes exactly like a regular Pepsi. I'm a regular Pepsi drinker and it really is the same. We've made substantial progress on that product.</p>
          <p>And then big innovation is all-natural sweeteners, big break-through in fountain equipment and those things are towards the end of this year and really into 2013. And we'll have the &#x2013; what I would call the proper investments against those brands.</p>
          <p>One last thing I'd mentioned, putting a local structure in place that allows us to get the most out of these big national ideas, but also to capitalize on these granular opportunities that exist in the marketplace. Today, I believe we call too many of the plays out of the center, meaning in my group. We're going to have a structure that's announced very quickly here, where we'll have General Managers in the marketplace that'll have regional resources for marketing and will be able to work with our customers on things that are going on specifically in Los Angeles. I just don't think we're able to make these calls out of the center as good as the people who are down in the marketplace in the California's and the Texas' and those kinds of markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add one last point. As I said to you in the opening comments, this is the first time we're going to have global management of big brands. It might seem unusual to you, but Pepsi was never managed as a global brand. It was managed in a much more fragmented way. Brad Jakeman, who joined us six, nine months ago, is doing a fabulous job thinking about Pepsi as a global brand. And you'll start seeing the results of the global brand work in summer of this year.</p>
          <p>And so the leverage of all of this investment is what gives us confidence that &#x2013; at first test, whole share starts slowly moving this value share to pick it up. And then with the technology break-through, really start thinking about how to gain share. But the real important thing in all of this is to play in this market in a responsible way. I think this category has been played in interesting ways by the competitors, too much pricing action even when commodities have gone up. So it's very important that pricing is responsible and that's what we have been trying to do in the last six, nine months. Go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A couple of questions. One is on China. It's such a strategically important market for long-term growth, and having met with Tingyi over the last couple of years a number of times, they've always said we don't think carbonated soft drinks are a good business in China. People like teas. People like this. So there was &#x2013; I don't know if they've changed their tune, but it scares me that that's been their attitude in the past.</p>
          <p>So my question would be I see the short-term benefit of getting losses off the income statement from the re-franchising, but what are the measurements that you're putting in place to make sure that Tingyi doesn't do a blast it out, get all the volume benefit, but actually delivers over time in this critical market? And then a question for John, just on the volume growth at Frito, which was the slowest it's been the last, as I remember, the 1%. What do you think it looks like over time and why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Saad, do you want to take Tingyi question because you meet with Chairman Wei on a regular basis, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, we're extremely very pleased about the alliance approved by the Chinese government with Tingyi. The CSD category in China has been growing and, in fact, in 2011, has grown faster than NCDs, and Tingyi's investment portfolio doesn't have that. So our alliance with them actually is complementary. It will give us access to white areas where we don't have production facilities with them so we will expand our CSD business there. It's an alliance between the number one ready-to-drink tea, the number one &#x2013; also the number one calling the number one flavors. So I think now we've set and transformed as a group by the Chinese government this alliance, our Beverage business on trajectory for growth for many, many years to come.</p>
          <p>How are we going to measure? The performance of Tingyi going forward, we have a joint plan with them. We operate as we operate with the franchise there, bottler. Every year, we set up the annual operating plan. We measure it quarterly. We adjust where we need to adjust and then so forth. Most of our people running our business will be working with Tingyi on it, so there is no change. So it's not like giving our business with his people. Actually, we're moving a lot of our people in the operation for Tingyi. The beauty about this alliance is we get access to distribution points. We get access to white areas where we've never existed before. There was a structural disadvantage on operating plants. We had 22, both have 34 with this now. Probably we will be set for good for sustainable growth. And once approved, we will be the number one actually Beverage company with Tingyi overnight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Caroline, that's a great question, and we went into the alliance with Tingyi, I mean, we've all had a chance to meet with Chairman Wei who we adore. All I would tell you is that was a thing we worried about the most, and what we found that was refreshing was Chairman Wei, actually, I don't know what he told you, but he sought us as much as we sought him. He wanted this business because he realized that this business had more price incrementality than tea, where there's so much local competition. So this actually gives him some insulation. PepsiCo also provides him a lot of best practice sharing from all of the stuff we do around the world with this marketplace investment, how we drove the business, how we put in coolers, how we put in the routes. There's a lot of sharing of knowledge and know-how.</p>
          <p>And he genuinely believes that carbonated soft drinks will actually grow as a percentage of sales in China. May not be to the U.S. level, but it will grow. It's about 20% today. It will grow. So this was a mutually sought after marriage, and we feel very good about the prospects for this business. So now let me toss it to John to talk about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two weeks ago I gave a big speech to an industry conference of the Food Marketing Institute, and I was challenging the group on how to rethink growth, because if you look at all food and beverage in the fourth quarter of 2011, volume declined 1.5%. Revenues grew 5%, but there was almost seven points of pricing behind that 5% revenue growth. So I look at Frito-Lay North America and say 1% volume growth in the quarter compared to everyone else declining 1.5%, I think is pretty good. And the algorithm for the quarter of a 1.7/10, I would say is world class. Ongoing, when you took, as you know, almost six points of pricing and drove 1% volume growth in that business, ongoing, we said for Frito-Lay is a low single-digit volume growth company. We expect a positive spread between volume and revenue and a positive spread between revenue and profit. And that's our expectation. We're very proud of Frito-Lay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just in terms of commodities, the $1.5 billion step-up in 2012, a little bit more color just in terms of maybe key inputs or by product categories, where you're seeing the most pressure? And then as related to that, the inflation impact for 2012 that you won't be able to cover with pricing just seems a little bit larger. So is it really a consumer issue? Is there an element of brand equity issue that you're really trying to address here? And then how much is also driven by perhaps maybe your hedged position being a little bit of a disadvantage versus your competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So in terms of the key commodities, obviously, we tend not to talk about specific commodity pricing, for obvious reasons. That's information we'd rather not share with competitors. What I would say to you, though, Judy, is it is very much driven by the lagging effect of the timing of purchases. We do think, based on the pricing that we have and we obviously have knowledge of what the marketplace prices are, with one or two notable exceptions, the pricing that we're paying is better than what's in the market or equal to what's in the market right now. Relative to competition hedging strategies, that's hard for me to speculate on. Obviously, it's just difficult to say what competition is doing.</p>
          <p>We've seen obviously, a number of CPGs come out and start to share guidance. And I think we've seen people talk about anything from low to mid-single-digits. Obviously, the number that we shared is a notch above that. I guess, generally speaking, the more you're exposed to agro, you probably have a bit more commodity inflation, as opposed to being exposed more to energy. So the food and beverage companies probably a little bit higher than the HPCs. And the longer you tend to hedge, and we've been pretty open about the fact that we tend to work about nine months out, the more the effect will hit in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of pricing behind the brands, we actually lead pricing in many parts of even North America. None of our Snack businesses are an issue. But in Beverages, we've been trying to take pricing up. It is a very competitive market out there. And if the marketplace behaves in a sensible way, based on commodities, I think the pricing will go up. This has nothing to do with our brands. One example I'll give you is in the cold channel. And, Al, you can talk about it. We've taken pricing up and it stuck. And our cold channel volume is up significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our cold channel business right now for probably the last 12 weeks is very solid and a good indicator of the brand strength as we put some programs in place on Mountain Dew and Pepsi. But the pricing in the marketplace, even on large format, is rational right now, which is a good thing for all of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take a question here and then come there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Indra, could you talk about why you have a line of sight now and it's the right time to reset? So why do you have it now? Why didn't you haven't three years ago? Is it due to the macro? Or can you just explain that a little further? And then I have a follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. And I'll tell you 2007, 2008, let me just &#x2013; typically, when you see us come, we just like to throw everything in the kitchen sink and reset. I was looking at the portfolio and saying, hey, you can reset all you want, but developed markets are getting a little soft. Don't have much emerging and developing markets in my portfolio. And sometimes when you have a problem in the portfolio overall, you take a gigantic reset. The issues that I was facing at that time required transformation, which was going to take several years.</p>
          <p>I'll be honest with you. Had we not had this macroeconomic meltdown and this commodity cost volatility, this whole reset would've happened earlier. And the transformation could've happened earlier. The problem is we faced the worst crisis and we had to reset in the middle of this crisis. The other problem was any time you wanted a reset for North American Beverages, there was this giant sucking sound where the bottling system took out all of the extra funding and demanded bottler funding, okay?</p>
          <p>And so we had to address that structural problem we had with the bottling system, so that we didn't have two companies fighting over a shrinking profit or a flat profit pool. So I had to wait for that bottling system integration to happen, okay? And so finished the bottling system integration in 2010; in 2011, brought the management of all of it under one person, Al Carey. And said okay, now's the time to go off and make the reset happen because now we know that every dollar of shareholders' money we put behind the reset will actually yield results, as opposed to you put the money in &#x2013; as I said, every CEO gets an opportunity once in a decade to make a reset. You know it's like running a car race. You've got to take a pit stop at some point and you don't get too many chances to take a pit stop and then still win the race. We want to win the race. So this was the pit stop and we had to take it very strategically. So that's what we did.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Indra, two questions, one on North America Beverages, you talked about the opportunity through structural change to jump-shift ROIC. Could you elaborate on that comment? Are you rethinking about how you're thinking about wholly owning the bottling assets for the long-term? What did you mean by that comment is question one. And then question two, is if you think about the larger organization, the whole of PepsiCo, and as the Chairman of the company and its CEO, how do you think about: A, internal versus external candidates for key leadership roles; and B, how are you thinking about those two roles being occupied by one person?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Uh huh. Let me first turn to Hugh on the structural issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, as we laid out in the scorecard, I think we were open about how we are going to look at the business. Regarding alternatives to increase returns, first of all, from an operating perspective, we're obviously going to be looking at capital investments with extreme scrutiny when the business is challenged from a growth perspective; working capital, the same. We do think that there are lots of opportunities to manage inventory more tightly and, as Indra said, to reduce days, both on the payables and &#x2013; or on the receivables side and increase on the payable side. From a structural alternative perspective, I think it's fair to say that there's a variety of items on the table. And we're going to look at each of the options and determine what makes sense if we don't see internal operating performance of the business and the returns of the business improve over time. That can be anything from collaborations right through to a whole variety of other options, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk to you about organization. We do a great job developing our internal talent for succession at the senior-most level. We see an outstanding group of leaders there, who have all grown up in the PepsiCo system, do an outstanding job. But I think the mark of a good company is to be able to bring in external talent, when needed, at the right level, whatever the level of the company is, if the belief of the leadership of the company is that this external talent will significantly improve the thinking of the company and help us position ourselves to perform in a new and changing environment. I think all of us are in an extraordinary period of change. Many of the skills we had over the &#x2013; that we learned over the last 10 or 15 years don't apply in the future. So very often, you have to buy some of this talent to just improve the overall knowledge base in the company.</p>
          <p>I mean, I'll give you an example, Enderson Guimaraes, where are you, Enderson? Enderson came to us from Electrolux and he was running a big piece of Electrolux, now is running Global Operations for PepsiCo. The thinking that Enderson brings to us challenges the way we do things in PepsiCo, which is great because it makes us all a better company, a better group of leaders. So I think any good company, the mark of a great company, is to be willing to be open to bringing in external talent where needed, assimilating them, learning from them and then getting better as an overall company.</p>
          <p>On the last thing on the Chairman and CEO roles, look, I've been Chairman and CEO and I've seen the benefits of being both the Chairman and CEO being able to manage the board, external constituencies and be able to run the company. If you have a Chairman and CEO that runs a very flat organization, twenty reports and they're not of the caliber of being Chairman and CEO themselves, then you have a problem. I have the unusual benefit of having four sector heads, who, each of them can be Chairman and CEO in their own right and a phenomenal CFO. So I look at my team and say, I work for them. They're all Chairman and CEOs in their own way and so I think in PepsiCo, this role combination actually works, okay? I promised to come here, yes.</p>
          <p>Right here in the first row.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Indra, could you discuss your level of confidence that you'll get returns behind this marketing spending in Beverages? And also, as we look at 2013 and 2014, I'm assuming that your EPS growth will be in line with your long-term goals. Why would that be if you're getting a return on the marketing investment in 2012, because it's depressing your earnings base and you've also got incremental cost cutting in those years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question is why isn't it higher in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, what we've given you is a long-term algorithm. It's at high single-digits. We'll come to the 2013 guidance as we get to the early part of 2013. Let's see what the environment is like, what all of the costs situation looks like. Why do we believe that we'll get a return on investment? I'm going to use Pepsi MAX as an example. We invested heavily behind Pepsi MAX in the re-staging of Pepsi MAX last year and this year. Pepsi MAX is up more than 50% in volume between last year and this year. Now it's off a small base. But it's up 50% and it's almost one share of the Carbonated Soft Drink business.</p>
          <p>So you can't run 20 brands and try to invest behind all of them and expect them to cut through the clutter. But if you take a focused group of brands that will actually belong in different aisles in the store &#x2013; look at the brands that Al talked about. We've got Pepsi, Dew in the CSD aisle. You've got Gatorade in the sports aisle. You've got Tropicana sitting in the refrigerated aisle. If you invest behind each of these, sitting in different parts of the store, and put the appropriate media wave, our testing shows that you can actually get growth in each of these brands. And that's the model we've been using. We have tested that and we believe we will get a return on it, okay? I'll have to go with a question, Dara. Go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One, just implied in your long-term model, is there an expectation that gross margins will expand over time or is all of the leverage going to be below the gross profit line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hugh?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be perfectly candid, a little tough to say, given commodities have been so volatile. We will clearly see margins below the line improve or the impact of lower cost below the line. MVA, which is the non-commodity portion of cost of goods sold, we clearly expect to see productivity there. How commodities shake out and how that balances out to me is very much an open question. Under normal circumstances, yeah, I would expect to see gross margin improvement as well. But...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you'd expect to be able to start to or be able over time to cover some level of commodity inflation with pricing, I guess is my &#x2013; has this company lost pricing power is what I'm asking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's &#x2013; the way I think about it is when I think about commodities, I tend to think about them longer-term, growing roughly in line with global GDP. And so somewhere in the 3%, 3.5% range. And at that level, certainly, we would expect to be able to price to cover it. What happens in any individual year? Tough to ascertain further out than a few months before the year begins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing to be careful about &#x2013; and just to say on pricing &#x2013; be careful about assuming that the brands don't have pricing power. I'll tell you why because this is a tough economy. It's not that the brands don't have pricing power. Consumers don't have the buying power, okay? If you had a normal year, we would be looking at a very different dynamic. In countries where consumers have buying power, the emerging markets of AMEA, Asia, Middle East, we have been able to price. We are getting the value &#x2013; the volume growth and the value growth, not an issue.</p>
          <p>The last thing I'll tell you is on gross margins, as the mix of countries changes and as we get more growth in emerging and developing markets, which is what all of us should want because that drives long-term growth, sometimes the gross margin picture starts looking muddy, because in those markets, we're still in the early stages. So the gross margin's a little bit lower and then they ramp up. So when you have a large company and you're looking at a combination of different businesses, categories, countries with different dynamics and a combination of franchise and operating business, there's not a linear relationship on the gross margin. So it requires explanation. And we'll provide it to you in our quarterly calls.</p>
          <p>I'll take a question this side. Is there question this side? No. Go ahead. I'll come back to that side.</p>

          <p>Hugh, thank you so much for your commentary around balancing your leverage increase in tuck-in acquisitions. If I could just dig into that a little bit. When you look at your short-term borrowings and your access to commercial paper, do you see a need to maintain Tier 1 CP access or could you look for increased balance sheet flexibility by moving towards Tier 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. At this point, in terms of commenting on specific ratings, it would probably be inappropriate for me to do that right now. We've shared with you what our plans are and what our leverage roughly looks like. Beyond that, I'd probably rather not get into it. I wouldn't necessarily take anything off the table, though.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just wanted to ask you, you have an increased budget for advertising, just wanted to know which sectors are you targeting? Are you moving more or less toward the Internet or print or TV? And also, do you have any hand in the Olympics with your Gatorade drinks and so forth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The advertising spending is broad-based. As Al mentioned, it's a 360-degree activation. So each of those elements you talked about will get an increase in advertising spending. And no, we are not in the Olympics. We were the proud sponsors of the NFL and the outstanding Super Bowl we just witnessed, where we had phenomenal results with our advertising campaign, and that's what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So you talked about one of the targets that you are going to keep for 2012. You had those targets and you talked about the bottom of the page. One of them was value share growth. So going back to Dara's question, I guess, historically, advertising takes a little bit of time to seed, and so can you talk about what you see as the key drivers of that value share growth? So advertising takes a little time to seed. The innovation is a little back-end loaded. Taking less price relative to raw material inflation sounds like we could actually see price gaps widening from that standpoint. So how much of that short-term value share growth do you think comes from potentially widening of price point gaps? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>John, from that standpoint, we &#x2013; and let me focus more on North America because that's sort of the more logical area of emphasis. We really did get our pricing inflation in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Beverage business, and we're comfortable with where we are right now and I think we'd expect to see that stay roughly where it is right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Indra, just a two-part question, just give us your global perspective in terms of what's happening around the globe currently. What do you think of each market in terms of is it getting better or worse? And then, I don't know if I missed it, but if I look at your goal for Good-for-You, the $30 billion by 2020, is that still a target? And since you sort of said no big acquisitions, do you think you can still get there with organic or mostly organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to answer that question and then what I'm going to do, Damian, is give you a gift. I'm going to have Saad, Zein talk about their regions, and then I'm going to have John and Al talk about Latin America because they also cover Latin America. Currently, our Good-for-You portfolio is about $14 billion in PepsiCo. That market category is growing between 8% and 9% globally. If we just keep growing at that rate between now and 2020, we will be a $30 billion business. So we don't need any extraordinary intervention to grow that business. What we need to do is to invest, to grow in those markets we are in and go into new markets. We just got Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade, and, where appropriate, our Naked Juice brands. So we're not looking at any dramatic expansion through acquisitions, at this point.</p>
          <p>So let me turn &#x2013; Zein, let me turn it to you to talk about what you're seeing in Europe, especially Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern. Give us your perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly you all read the news, Europe is going through a lot of challenges and you almost see either issues unfold by the week or some issues just repeat, repeat by the week. I think one of the things about our business in Europe is it's very finely balanced between the East and the West. We're pretty evenly split between the emerging markets of Europe and the developed markets of Europe. And what that tends to do for us, is in good times allows us to accelerate growth and move ahead of the pack. And, obviously, in more challenging times when the developed markets tend to be more stable, it allows us to hedge against the challenges.</p>
          <p>So even in a very difficult year like 2011, we still delivered very solid top line growth. I would say, looking back, 2011, obviously the developed markets were more stable and performed better. Russia had a particular challenge. You would have heard that from many food and beverage companies from many FMCG companies, not so much driven by their economy where they actually had good GDP growth, but much more driven by the excessive inflation in the country because they suffered both from the global inflation but also, particularly in Russia, a very severe crop shortage in 2010 as a result of the very hot summer that played out into basic commodities, hurt consumers really in terms of their basic purchases, and you saw a decline in disposable income.</p>
          <p>Now we do see that normalizing in Russia. And we do see the market coming back and we will see a stronger performance in Russia in 2012. Now again, having said that, we're very pleased with the top line performance of our business in Russia going double-digits in 2011, and again the wonderful hedging of that business across the multiple categories in which we compete.</p>
          <p>Following the Wimm-Bill-Dann acquisition and the integration, we're nearly 12 months into that now and the integration of it into our business. I can tell you, we've gone in 12 months from essentially serving consumers between about 12:00 midday to through about 6:00 in the evening. We're now serving them from the moment they wake up to actually the moment before they go to sleep. And the traditional drink in Russia before you go to bed is a glass of kefir, which is a fermented yogurt drink. It's a digestive. It helps you sleep, and that's actually one of the fastest growing beverage categories.</p>
          <p>When you talk about snacking, and we all tend to think of that nutrition versus Fun-for-You, well one of the fastest growing snacking areas in many of these emerging markets is as the meals deconstruct and as people move from formal breakfast at home before they leave home to needing that mid morning snack or that second breakfast. And again, products like value added dairy play very, very strongly in that segment. I mean a challenging macroeconomic picture in Europe, challenging consumer picture but we've always, I think, said to you that the good news is people have to eat and drink. The really good news is we have a balanced portfolio both geographically and in terms of the categories and the consumer needs and occasions that we service.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want three-quarters of the profit <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:40).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're working towards that. And I tell you, we called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:43:45) for growth for PepsiCo for a reason. First of all, the economies are growing. We're in China and India, they're growing to at high single-digit GDP. The population is young and the per capita consumption of both snacks and beverages has &#x2013; is a fraction of the developed world. So we have a huge runway to go in both businesses, and we are poised to capture that growth.</p>
          <p>We have outstanding businesses in beverages and in snacks and I just tour around the area with you, area by area. So if you take the Middle East, we are the overwhelming choice of consumers there in beverages and in snacks, but that's been happening lately in the Middle East while it will set us back a little bit for a year or two, however for the long term it's great because it will bring a lot of transparency in governance and will bring a lot of employment. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:44:44) to all our businesses and we are very well positioned to capture that growth.</p>
          <p>India has been great. We have fantastic businesses in Beverages and in Snacks. In fact in 2011 we outgrew our competitor by six, seven factor points in LRB. Our Snack business is close to 100,000 tons and doing great. And we are capturing on the growth of the GDP. You know it's slowed a little bit down, but not to the level that really worries us. There is a lot of consumers coming in with purchasing power into that as in China.</p>
          <p>In China our Snacks business is doing great, we are growing in high-teens. And in the Beverages, when the government approves the alliance with Tingyi we have really set our Beverage business on a sustainable growth path. As I said earlier, we are aligned with the number one tea and the number one water, we'll be the number one cola and the number one flavors. So coming together we put that business on a trajectory to growth. And with Snacks it's a very fragmented market, and we are very well poised with the capability of people that we have there to grow.</p>
          <p>Asia Pacific is a mixture of countries there; we have developed such as Australia, like the other developed worlds, there have been functioning there but we are managing these challenges and actually we are growing this nice business. And we have a lot of emerging markets that we are doing extremely well, such as Vietnam where actually we are the choice of consumers there for both snacks and beverages; Pakistan which is part of the Asia-Pacific there is also growing.</p>
          <p>So overall, we have the great businesses in foods and beverages. The economies are growing. The population is young. And we are very well poised to capture that growth for the future.</p>

          <p>John, can you talk about Latin America but stay with the macroeconomic comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Latin America remains 3% to 4% GDP growth. Obviously that's driven by Mexico and Brazil. Mexico for the year was around 3%. Brazil slowed some, but I think as you look forward you've got to believe that that economy is going to continue to grow 4%, 5%, maybe 6% going forward with the Olympics and the World Cup coming there. And our business collectively grew volume about 5% during the year, so strong. And in Brazil our Snack business was up 8% and I think its, to Indra's point about the dissynergies of the two, it's one of our best markets with the power of one where we leveraged the Frito-Lay system to distribute many of the beverage brands. So very optimistic about Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for allowing me to ask a question. Indra, two questions: one, I didn't hear a lot about mix on a consolidated basis. I think you touched on the fact that emerging markets are a negative to mix, but if you're no longer doing as much M&amp;A I would assume that's no longer going to be as much of a drag. And if you're focusing on the top 12 global brands I assume they typically have a higher-than-average mix benefit. So maybe you could touch on those? And then I'll follow up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, mix I think our expectation, again depends on how the economies evolve, Eric, but right now emerging markets, emerging and developing markets are about 35% of revenue of PepsiCo. We think it will get to 50% by the end of the decade. Okay. That's the range. And it takes that long only because our developed market business is also growing. Okay. So that's how we think it will evolve. The good news is in emerging and developing markets, once they get to a certain scale, their margins escalate quite fast. The best example is Sabritas in Mexico. It's a developing market, but if you look at the margins we get in our Sabritas business, it's very attractive. So because we have scale, we're the largest salty snacks player there.</p>
          <p>So I think it's a couple of dynamics, one we'll keep moving the emerging and developing markets up, get it to half and half. They should be even more skewed to the emerging and developing markets based on the world population, but let's start with 50/50 and then hopefully some time around 2015 the profit acceleration from emerging markets will start picking up even more because the investments to build scale now are returns from the scale investments. So I hope that change will happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in looking at that Four-Quad grid that you put up, so basically in the top left quadrant it was 74% of the business and the other 26% had issues one way or the other. And I'm wanting to think about that &#x2013; or how should we think about that relative to the Power of One? Because it seemed like the top left quadrant was what really benefited from Power of One whereas the others were more difficult to see where the benefit comes in there. And then to the extent that you get a 1% lift from the Power of One quantified, I guess, in like $120 million in sales, I mean, you're talking relative to a business that's got $60 billion, $70 billion of sales. So how is that incremental?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Eric, the Power of One increment &#x2013; we're talking about in North America. All right. That number was a North American coincidence number increasing about 1%. Believe me, our normal businesses grow. Frito-Lay grows. North American beverage grows. Over and above that, if we can get an additional $120 million sales, two or three points from that in North America, that's a bonanza. I mean to get $300 million, $400 million from an over the top co-merchandising activity, co-promotion activity is gigantic for an overall food and beverage business, a market that's not growing as robustly as it used to grow.</p>
          <p>I look at the portfolio differently. Actually when putting it together I looked at it very carefully. The businesses on the lower left quadrant, okay, some of the emerging market snack businesses, they're only there because we don't have the scale as yet. We're going to use the beverage business to pluck up their scale. They'll quickly move into the top left quadrant. Okay. But we need to make sure that we manage that business to drive the growth, make sure that we leverage the beverage business to drive the growth, get the right people in. We have to do that. That's why we put it there, honestly. Some of the emerging market beverage business, we've done the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:51:32). We've looked at each of these businesses and said do we have an operational line of sight to get to the top quadrant?</p>
          <p>Or do we have to consider structural option, as refranchising into a well capitalized bottler who has a reason to refranchise it. Let me speak to that a little bit. In the past, one of the mistakes we made as a company &#x2013; I'll go back. When we gave Mexico, Russia to PBG &#x2013; all right, we gave it to them because we felt they needed a growth market. But one of the big lessons, Eric, was that you give a growth market, which is not the whole market to a bottler, only they have reason to combine with something else they have and get scale. You just don't throw a growth market to them. And that's why the whole international experiment with PBG wasn't widely successful.</p>
          <p>So when we think about refranchising some of these emerging market beverage businesses, we have to find a bottler who has other businesses so that they can leverage the scale, like AmBev in Brazil is a great example. And they have partners like that in Asia Pacific. I look at that Japanese bottlers who are absolutely terrific bottlers taking them to other parts of Asia Pacific. I think there are lots of opportunities there to think about how to move emerging market beverage businesses to the top box.</p>
          <p>The biggest elephant there is North American DSD in that bottom box. If commodity inflation wasn't prevalent, we wouldn't have put it in that bottom box, because margins for that business normally are in the teens; shouldn't have been a problem at all. And when we bought the bottlers back, I mean we were thrilled at the synergies and what we can do. What we need to navigate through now is how do you manage a beverage business which is not growing too much with a lot of commodity inflation? How do you reset that whole business? And if you can't reset it through a technology breakthrough, through a different way of operating it, through innovation, through brand building, then you have to think about structural options. And that's what we're going through.</p>
          <p>So what I would suggest is to focus on the percentage of profitability from North American DSD beverages that belongs in that box. The rest of it will take care of itself because of the growth and the way we are managing it today.</p>
          <p>John, I think we have to shut it down, but one last question. Go ahead.</p>

          <p>It will be, well, a good two, for Al, or maybe both for Al. Feet on the street. You've got a lot of layoffs coming. How do you feel about the capability of the Pepsi system right now? Do you need more people rather than less? And the other is, do you think you should be doing more targeting Hispanic marketing given the growth rate in consumption of beverages by that consumer group?</p>

          <p>Those are good questions. Let me just say, with the layoffs that will occur at Pepsi North America, very few will be at the front line. Most will be focused on middle and above management. So I'm not worried about the feet on the street. But as time goes on, there are a few gaps in service, and those are being taken care of, I believe, in customer service, just like at the Frito-Lay system. So I feel very good where we are there.</p>
          <p>On the Hispanic opportunity, I think probably more than 60% of the growth in the category is going to come from the Hispanic consumer, and I've seen some estimates that are quite a bit higher than that. And this whole local campaign that we're putting together in our local region markets, very focused on that as opportunities come up in the Texas, Florida, California market. And actually, that opportunity is becoming bigger in almost every city, not just in those Southwest cities that we typically talk about.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Caroline. So let me just close by saying thank you again to all of you for coming to our meeting this morning and thank you for your attention over the past couple of hours. We look forward to seeing a lot of you over the next few weeks and certainly re-connecting with all of you at CAGNY later this month. But as you leave, I just want you to take a picture of PepsiCo back with you. $66 billion of revenue, 16% operating margin, 17% net return on invested capital, 31% return on equity, a prolific cash generator and a company with 22 brands, each one generating over $1 billion in retail sales, and a company with terrific people and great growth prospects. So with that, thank you for your time and hope to re-connect with you soon.</p>
