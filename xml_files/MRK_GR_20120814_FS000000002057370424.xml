        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Anne-Marie. Thank you and welcome to Merck's second quarter 2012 earnings presentation and conference call. My name is Joshua Young and I'm Head of Investor Relations for Merck. And joining me on today's call are Matthias Zachert, Chief Financial Officer; and Udit Batra, Head of our Consumer Health Division. Additionally, Stefan Oschmann, the</p>
          <p>Head of our Pharmaceutical Business Sector and a Member of the Executive Board, will be available during our Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin by stating that we will be referencing a slide presentation as a part of our prepared remarks today. These slides can be downloaded from our Investor Relations website. In addition to the slides, you can download our quarterly financial reports and our Q2 financial statements in Excel.</p>
          <p>I'd like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during today's presentation. Please review our disclaimer about the risks and uncertainties of such statements on slide 2. In particular, all forward-looking statements reflect current business conditions as of today, August 14, 2012.</p>
          <p>During today's call, Matthias will provide an overview of our financial and operational performance during the second quarter. Udit will then speak about the actions we're taking in the Consumer Health division to improve our profitability and shape the future direction of the division.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn the call over to Matthias Zachert.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to the conference call on the second quarter of Merck. I would start the presentation with the key highlights on page 4. Overall, I think it can be stated that we are on the right track. Sales have improved in all divisions. And, of course, currency helped, so that we were able to increase our sales to up to &#x20AC;2.7 billion which is a reflection of around about 11% growth rate.</p>
          <p>This carries down to our operational key performance indicator, EBITDA pre, where we achieved an over-proportional profitability increase to roughly &#x20AC;750 million. So, in a time where we are taking actions on changing the culture, changing the Group, we don't let go of good operational performance.</p>
          <p>The drivers are, in all respects, associated to all financial statements. So, as far as the P&amp;L is concerned, you do see that the top line performance is coming from all divisions but, of course, more pronounced, especially from Merck Serono and Performance Materials. Currency, notably the U.S. dollar contributed.</p>
          <p>The good sales performance is yielding results also on the profitability indicators, i.e. gross profitability and EBITDA, so increased operating leverage and more focused spending and first initial cost savings, of course, trigger the improvements.</p>
          <p>But we are not only improving the profitability, but also leave our mark on the cash flow is visible if you look at the free cash flow, where basically better profitability and better working capital management increased the second quarter operational cash flow quite nicely.</p>
          <p>As communicated in the Capital Markets Day on the 15th of May, we have tried to incur the lion's share of the one-time costs within the second quarter. Of course, it needs to be stated that also the next quarters will be burdened by one-times but no longer in the same magnitude.</p>
          <p>With this, I turn the attention to page number 5. No difference to other European pharmaceutical and chemical companies. Our sales are impacted negatively in the European environment, notably through price erosions and in the chemical sector through volume declines. This has left its mark also in the turnover that we generate in these respective markets with minus 2%.</p>
          <p>We alluded; however, in our Capital Markets Day already towards the strong presence that we have in the emerging markets, especially Merck is better positioned here than other players. And with our around about 35% of sales being in the emerging markets, we could benefit nicely, especially through good volume momentum. And here, we posted 10% organic growth.</p>
          <p>As far as North America is concerned, that makes around 20% of our total sales. You see that with respect to pricing initiatives that we took not only on Rebif but also on other products, we were able to post a very solid growth in the second quarter. So, these two elements, volume in the emerging markets, pricing in North America, we're clearly able to overcompensate the decline in Europe, which I think shows a difference towards other companies and towards the approach we've taken in the past.</p>
          <p>I now go to page number 6, where we've given you more clarity with a new slide format on the organic growth rates and currency. And here you do see that Merck Serono, the new management team is posting good results on the top-line and I will come to the P&amp;L in a moment. So, the 7% organic growth, I think are a clear mark of Stefan's handwriting. And also, in the Performance Materials, you do see that's been a difficult environment, the 4% standouts. Noteworthy, the currency impact that helped us nicely in Q2 2012 was &#x2013; we were penalized in the reference quarter Q2 2011 when the U.S. dollar but also the Swiss franc were in different territories.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to page number 8 where I will quickly address the four key performance indicators of the group. Sales, we have explained already and I will come to that further on when I address the segments. You do see that the good sales momentum and the tight cost trend control leads positive results in the absolute EBITDA that could be increased by around about 14% but also structurally, we upgraded the business slightly by around about 70 basis points in the gross margin.</p>
          <p>EPS, adjusted for one-timers, is reflecting 20% growth and some are seasonally, we were able to post a very strong operating and free cash flow. Normally, Merck has a very weak second quarter because in this quarter, dividends are being paid, interest payments are being done, and, also, boni for the managerial levels worldwide are cashed out. Different to the past, we were able to post underlying good free cash flow, thanks to the better approach on working capital whilst sales went up. This was triggering a net debt reduction to below &#x20AC;3 billion. So, this is the first time that we were able to post net debt deleverage below &#x20AC;3 billion after the Millipore transaction.</p>
          <p>I now allude to page number 9 and come to the biggest division, Merck Serono, where I think in all areas of the P&amp;L you'll see that we advanced in the right direction. So, top line is developing strongly thanks to the solid organic growth and also partly driven by currencies. The currency has, of course, a nice positive implication also on the royalty income, which we receive in U.S. dollar predominantly for the biggest drugs, and therefore we had automatically a positive conversion on the total revenues line.</p>
          <p>Gross profit increased as well. I would like to indicate to you that in the gross profits some of you had potentially some questions on could it be higher, can it be lower? Please take into consideration that our sales in Europe have gone down, which normally has a higher profitability margin compared to the emerging markets which of course have grown nicely. So, this is something that should not surprise you.</p>
          <p>That we manage our costs in a very focused approach you see on the marketing and selling line, while sales go up marketing and selling are tightly managed. So, this is clearly the approach of the new management team. And don't assume that we cut our marketing and selling now to the bone. Of course, now, on the back of Q1, Q2 good results, we give a little bit more money into this P&amp;L line in the third and fourth quarter in order to keep our sales moving in the right direction in the future.</p>
          <p>Royalty and commission expenses move up on the back of the Rebif price increase that led to a nice sales momentum in the U.S., and therefore, of course, we have to here book the respective commission expenses to our co-promotion partner.</p>
          <p>As far as other expenses is concerned, we took out of the around about &#x20AC;375 million one-time charges, the lion's share in the Merck Serono division. The rest we've still kept at group level for the announced programs that are now trickling through respectively in the division and in the country P&amp;Ls.</p>
          <p>As far as amortization cost is concerned, please take note of the fact that in Q2 2011, we have written off safinamide and a project called IMO that is leading to a high base in Q2 2011 whilst amortization for Q2 2012 is on regular terms. So, all in all, this is driving the profitability increase by 20%, leading also to a margin expansion to 28%. I think it can clearly be stated, Stefan and his team make the difference.</p>
          <p>On page number 10, we would like to give you clarity &#x2013; more clarity on our fertility business. It's not often looked at in detail because people focus a lot on Erbitux and Rebif. But on our fertility franchise, it needs to be said that we made very nice introduction of a family of pens that is being used with all our respective products. We train the nurses respectively, so that this is yielding ongoing good momentum. So, we make use of our very, very good market position of our franchise, in order here through smart life cycle managements and rollout plan to support our franchise in the running year and in the years to come. With this setup, especially as far as the entire family of pens is concerned, we consider ourselves as well positioned.</p>
          <p>Slide number 14 (sic) [number 11] (11:45) shows you Consumer Health. It's a business where also Udit will talk about in a few moments. He is heading this division in the Merck Group and we've indicated in our Capital Markets Day that this is something of interest for the second half and today's conference call. We want to talk and give you some further clarity on what Udit plans to do in this division going ahead.</p>
          <p>So, while the business here was showing a reduction in sales and profitability in Q1, we are now able to post slight organic growth rates. But I think the emphasis here should be also made on marketing and selling, which we manage with a better resource allocation approach. Other expenses have moved up because of taking, first, one-time charges. For that very reason, EBITs reported is at previous level while the operational performance is visible at EBITDA pre.</p>
          <p>So, also here, it can be said that we move in the right direction; however, my statement of Q1 holds. Again, Consumer Health has started latest with the new management team, and therefore, 2012 is clearly a transition year. So, please understand that we will continue getting some volatility or some volatility cannot be fully ruled out also in the forthcoming quarters. But the business, overall, is going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>On page 12, I would like to now comment on the Performance Materials, of course, predominantly is all about Liquid Crystals. I know that some of you are always expecting that in the next quarter this business will tumble. But again, I have to confirm that the business performed very, very healthy driven by further technology upgrades that we have achieved in IPS that is especially found in the tablets and smaller devices arena strong support by our customers. So, for that very reason, we performed extremely healthy in this area. And also, further advancements in PSVA have led to a further expansion on our market share again after we have had some trophy quarters in the quarters before and could therefore improve in the second quarter the product line which has, of course, good margins as well.</p>
          <p>So, here please understand that this business has a seasonal component, a cyclical component. So, Q2 was very, very sound on volumes. We do expect not as good a quarter in Q2 and Q3, but Q3, also the order book looks healthy. However, the fourth quarter will clearly soften because a lot of replenishment on stocks and sales have been advanced in Q2, Q3, take note of the fact that we also had here a good inventory or television sales, not only in volumes, but overall in light of the soccer and the Olympic Games, and therefore, do expect softness in the fourth quarter, which you should not take as a surprise as the entire chemical industry is turning softer at this point in time.</p>
          <p>What I would also like to allude to is the other income. We had a capital gain in Performance Materials, and that's the reason why we have posted &#x20AC;11 million positive income in the second quarter. Of course, this has been restated under the other time &#x2013; under the one-time items. So, you see that here we've stated &#x2013; we stated a special capital gain in order to make apples with apples comparable. So, underlying this business is continuing to deliver, and as we have communicated in March, we foresee with the cyclicality of this business that also in the next few years we will perform reasonably well with this Performance Materials segment.</p>
          <p>This brings me to page number 13, and here to Merck Millipore. This business is on track. We've always communicated that Merck Millipore posts an underlying decent momentum. In the second quarter, we predominantly got the benefit also next to organic growth from the currencies. But as you can see from the gross profits, we are also here moving in the right direction. We take here deliberate decisions on fueling the growth for the years to come. So, in the marketing and selling we are reinvesting because we are launching some new products that today post little sales but, of course, in three, four years from now should generate further sales. And at this point in time products that are named worthy are the product Muse for instance that has been newly launched but also the products that we acquired with our bolt-on acquisition last year. Amnis, we are trying to position nicely in the market in order to get these products going for the years to come.</p>
          <p>In R&amp;D, the increase is predominantly associated to Process Solutions, so here is less bolt-on feasibility, bolt-on acquisition potential. So here we do a lot organically and notably behind the Process Solution business where our view is in 2015, 2016, 2017 the markets should be posting additional volumes due to biological drugs and biosimilars. So, all in all, here you see that the EBITDA growth was 15% is also showing nice profitable growth over proportion to sales.</p>
          <p>With this, I move to free cash flow on page 14, net income of profit after tax. We start from this basis, of course, like last year impacted by the one-time charges. You see the difference that we are making on the working capital, so please take note of the fact that working capital we generated, we reduced while sales move up. I think this is a nice situation. Even though I would clearly like to put &#x2013; pour some water into the wine. We have done here on the working capital also some factoring in the second quarter in order to improve our receivable situation and to make a nice risk management to balance the risk in the Southern European countries. So, here, by and large, we have had a favorable impact around about &#x20AC;100 million.</p>
          <p>But this is not all, we also improved our inventories. And this is something we would put more focus on especially in the Merck Millipore division and in the Performance Material division in Q3 and Q4. So, we clearly want to get further inventory improvements which, however, in return leads to higher idle costs, that is expected into our guidance. And the Merck Serono, as you can see from the guidance that is given later on, we assume ongoing good momentum, so receivables will increase again. So, the &#x2013; this both elements should balance each other.</p>
          <p>As far as changes in other assets and liabilities are concerned, also this is something being discussed in course of today, is driven predominantly by taxes. So, two elements, A, driving this increase versus previous year of &#x20AC;70 million, we had a phasing in one of the Southern European countries where instead of in Q3, we paid in Q2. And the other &#x2013; other elements is driven through the fact that not all one-time costs could be for statutory purposes being used in the tax profitability and for that reason, underlying profitability has been sound. So we had been taxed accordingly, which led to tax outs  of the second quarter. But of course, here in the future, we will make sure that the one-time costs will also help us on the tax side.</p>
          <p>So, this, in all, in essence explains the cash flow improvements, and I think the most important element is on page 15. We indicated that already in May that we would directionally like to put further focus on working capital. And as you can see, sales move up, while in March and June, our working capital has now reached more acceptable standards. I think the industry is operating in areas to &#x2013; working capital to sales which are somewhat around 25%, 30%, so we move in the right direction.</p>
          <p>With this, I'll pass on to Udit Batra, who is leading the business unit since 3rd September, 2011. And please go on, Udit.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Matthias and good afternoon, everybody. I'm thrilled to be here today and have the opportunity to share with you about what we're doing in the Consumer Health division at Merck. As Matthias said, it's been a bit less than one year since my arrival at Merck following my previous experiences at Novartis, McKinsey, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. At Novartis and McKinsey, I helped in particular lead transformation programs of global businesses and executed large restructuring programs. And one such program was Project Forward in Novartis in 2007, which ended up leading to a &#x20AC;2.3 billion savings over a two-year timeframe.</p>
          <p>When I accepted the role as Head of Consumer Health Division, I was attracted in particular by the structural health of our business and the untapped potential the division had to become more competitive, particularly in terms of its profitability. As a division, we have gross margins that are competitive with industry average. We have strong brands and a good presence in many emerging markets. However, we have lagged the industry in terms of operating profitability, and I will speak more about that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>With that, let me take you to slide 17. You will see that we have a good base of building a strong business. The OTC sector will remain attractive with a 4.5% annualized growth rate. And strong players in this market have EBITDA margins between 15% and 25%.</p>
          <p>Now, focusing your attention on the left-hand side of this chart, you'll see the OTC market was roughly an &#x20AC;84 billion market in 2011 and can be broken down into six categories. On the right-hand side, we have listed our brands that are in the three largest categories of the market. And all of these categories are growing nicely.</p>
          <p>The key success factor of a successful Consumer Health business is having leading brands that consumers can recognize. And we are fortunate enough to have brands that hold a top three position in each of their categories. Our eight strategic brands are shown on the right-hand side of this chart. You can quickly see that we have leading positions in a number of important countries.</p>
          <p>Another important takeaway from this slide is that we have a major presence not only in Western Europe which represents nearly 60% of our business, but also in key emerging markets like India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and Poland. So, in a nutshell, we are in an attractive sector that is growing, and we have a good foundation with strong brands in key countries around the world.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to slide 18, for those of you who have followed our division, you're aware that over the past five years the division has done an effective job of growing its top line but has not translated the growth and good gross margins into competitive levels of operating profitability. During this period we averaged more than 4% growth per year.</p>
          <p>In addition, the competitive gross margin illustrates that the division has sufficient scale to operate profitably. Rather, the clear challenge we faced as a division is around ineffective resource allocation. The division has been suffering for years from a lack of operational discipline and a lack of focus. For instance our marketing and selling investments were too high and not focused on core brands and geographies. Our R&amp;D investments were made only in Western Europe and these investments were not productive and not always aligned with market and consumer needs. Compounding these challenges was a lack of transparency and accountability in our organization which has contributed to our back office growing too quickly and has resulted in high G&amp;A costs.</p>
          <p>The result as shown on the right-hand side of this slide was that Consumer Health was an underperforming organization where we were higher than our peers on just about every single expense category. Now while we are on an improvement path, our EBITDA pre margins today are still only 12% and this is well below the 20% average of our peers. There are several underlying causes for this inefficient spending and these are shown on slide 19.</p>
          <p>Firstly, we have had weak operational discipline as I mentioned before. Historically the division did not have full responsibility of it's P&amp;L because Merck had a business model where country managers made the decisions, decisions that impacted spending and resource allocation for the division. This meant that spending decisions were made but nobody was held accountable for the results. Incentives for the division were highly skewed towards top-line growth with little to no incentive on profit and cash flow. As a result, managers pursued top-line growth at any cost and this hurt operating profitability. And finally, we had no uniform approach to how we invested money into geographies and brands. For example, Consumer Health entered markets without sufficient analysis of the resources required to launch products so we ended up spreading our resources too thinly and across too many markets. This resulted in suboptimal penetration into markets that truly had the potential to make a difference on our operating performance.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the slide, I'd like to outline what actions we have been taking to address these problems. As a first step, we will improve our resource allocation especially in marketing and selling but also in R&amp;D. This better resource allocation is already leading to lower spending, which has been the main driver of our higher profitability through the first six months of 2012. We're now focusing our resources on the strategic brands in markets where we already have a strong position.</p>
          <p>The consequence of concentrating on investment on strategic brand is that we will exit small, local brands that are unprofitable. As a result, you should expect that Consumer Health will report a top line growth that is lower in the next one to two years than the market growth that I referenced earlier. For example, we decided to close our operations in Canada where we were operating with just one single brand. We also exited other subscale countries where we are now working with distributors, which is helping improve our profitability.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're bringing in a new wave of outside talent into the organization, which is helping to change the culture of the division. Nearly all of my direct reports in the past year are new. Once we have this focus in 2013, we will aim to strengthen our regional setup and to invest into markets where we can make a clear difference.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, I show what all this will mean for the financial performance of the Consumer Health division. We are taking decisive actions over the next one to two years, which will lead to &#x20AC;25 million of net cost savings by 2014. I show the breakdown of the savings by year on the right-hand side of the slide. The savings would be an important component to helping to improve the division's EBITDA pre margin by 300 basis points to 500 basis points.</p>
          <p>For purposes of clarification, let me state the &#x20AC;25 million in net cost savings and the margin targets were already included in the 2014 guidance targets for the division that we shared with you on May 15. They are not incremental to the targets. The initiative I outlined earlier will lead to restructuring costs of roughly &#x20AC;40 million.</p>
          <p>On the left-hand side, you will see the four levers I already mentioned previously. In the short term, we've acted decisively to implement a new business model, optimize sales promotions on &#x2013; sales promotion on brands where we can win and refocus R&amp;D on high value initiatives. In the mid-term, we're continuing to address the resource allocation in marketing and selling but also consolidating assets and implementing a culture of increased efficiency.</p>
          <p>So, let me close on slide 21 by restating that we are relentlessly focused on catching up with our industry benchmarks during 2012 and 2013. Our primary focus will remain, raising our profitability by working on each and every item of the P&amp;L. Once this is well under way, we will ensure that the basics of the Consumer Health business model are implemented. For instance, innovation will be tied closely to solid consumer insights, and we will build further our consumer marketing and point-of-sale skills.</p>
          <p>Finally, the theme of focus will continue where we'll selectively pick investment of growth markets like Brazil and India where we already have a solid set of brands and good fundamental growth prospects.</p>
          <p>We believe that the business is healthy, and the problems we face are straightforward to fix with focused management. We look forward to reporting on the progress we make over the next two years.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call back over to Matthias.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Udit. And now, let us go to page number 22 where we give an updated guidance. Assumptions have been explained. So, we assume current economic environment remains unchanged and on the basis of this, of course, we would like to reiterate the statements that we've made on the Capital Markets Day that majority of the costs have now been incurred in the second quarter, there will be still leftovers also depending on the negotiation that we are doing country by country, and leftovers mean that can be between &#x20AC;50 million, &#x20AC;70 million, &#x20AC;80 million as one-timers as we go into third and fourth quarter. The number &#x2013; the precise number and the time when we take these costs a little bit also depend on if we advance in the one or the other direction in the country. So, do assume that there will be some further charges but that the lion's share of one-timers for this year are dealt with a around about &#x20AC;375 million we've taken in Q2.</p>
          <p>As far as tax rate is concerned, nothing has changed. And as far as currencies are concerned, we changed the assumption for the U.S. dollar where we originally guided with $1.35. We've now move that to $1.25 for the remainder of the year, i.e., for Q3 and Q4, whilst the euro, Swiss franc currency gross rate remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to move into the guidance for the Merck Group. And here for the divisions &#x2013; so as far as Merck Serono and Consumer Health is concerned, you clearly see that the second half that we forecast is more ambitious than the first half. So, here especially as it relates to Merck Serono, of course, the reasons behind that are the adjusted momentum that we see organically. Hence  that has &#x2013; it has come through from the business in the third quarter &#x2013; second quarter, but also, of course, the efficiency that will yield results in third and fourth quarter that had been initiated in the &#x2013; especially in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health has also more aggressive second half compared to first half. So, also here, we factor in what Udit has just said. But as far as Performance Materials is concerned and Merck Millipore is concerned, please let me make the following statements. Performance Materials, the momentum right now in the chemicals is still sound but it's somewhat getting weaker on the volume side. And therefore, that is something that we factor into our guidance.</p>
          <p>Predominantly for the fourth quarter, we, however, forecast a softer volume quarter and that is something that is clearly visible in the order books and in the communication that we get out of the market. So, here, we are not blue eyed. We take in what we see in the industry. And I think it shouldn't come as a surprise because all &#x2013; all other chemical companies are foreshadowing this as well.</p>
          <p>Millipore, like last year, will not have the same strong first half. So, here, normally the second half is a little bit softer, and this is also stemming from &#x2013; predominantly from the European basis. So, we see that &#x2013; so the second half will be a good second half Millipore continues on its track models. But of course, in profitability terms, it will not be as strong as the first half.</p>
          <p>What I would also like to say for both divisions that you need to factor in, we will work on the inventory side. So, in Performance Materials, as well as in Merck Millipore, we will in, predominantly the fourth quarter, close some of our plants to optimize our inventories in the fourth quarter in order to come to more acceptable working capital numbers overall.</p>
          <p>This explains the total revenues at group level. So, here, total revenues is guided to be at &#x20AC;10.7 billion which is an increase of around about &#x20AC;200 million versus our previous guidance. And respectively, we've adjusted the EBITDA which has now been moved upwards for both the lower end of the corridor and the higher end of the corridor, so we basically make an upgrade in this regard as well. So, this is all we would like to say on the second quarter and the company guidance for 2012. And now the floor is open for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. This is Liav Abraham from Citi on behalf of Andrew Baum. Two questions, please. Firstly, on the Fertility franchise, given your focus on this franchise, should we anticipate significant business development going forward and in line with recent BD that you've done in the MS and immunotherapy for cancer spaces? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And second question is regarding the ONO compound. You've stated that you're evaluating whether to take this compound into Phase III. When can we expect a decision to be made in this regard? And what will constitute the basis for this decision? Is it data specific to the compound or relative to the &#x2013; to the competitive environment and competing products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Stefan Oschmann. I'm going to address your questions both on Fertility and on the ONO compound. We are very happy with the performance of our Fertility franchise. We see a global trend in this direction given the demographic challenge we see in &#x2013; in many countries. We see other societal trends, i.e., that women want to have children later &#x2013; later in life. And all of these mega trends influence our business profitably.</p>
          <p>If you look at the structure of the business, we see that there are basically three players in that &#x2013; in that market with us in the leadership position. You should not expect significant, i.e., let me call it transformational business development activities for &#x2013; for Fertility. We don't think that this would make any sense. We also don't expect a high-level R&amp;D investment in this area. What we are looking into is smallish bolt-on type of BD things. We see that there is opportunity for innovation in the area of providing solutions to fertility centers on top of purely &#x2013; of purely drugs. But at this moment, we have no plans for any major BD activities.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the ONO compound, we are acutely aware of the need to put a program together to &#x2013; that provides a significant chance for the product to be differentiated from &#x2013; from competition. Gilenya patent will expire depending on &#x2013; on the definition in either 2017 or 2020. So, that plays a major &#x2013; a major role. Currently, we're generating a comprehensive clinical and non-clinical data for ONO-4641. We're focusing on cardiac safety and on a pharmacokinetic-efficacy model. And we need to look at a broader dose range.</p>
          <p>The evaluation of these studies will hopefully provide us with more information on the efficacy, safety of this &#x2013; of this product and will provide us with a solid basis for a decision as to whether to move this drug into Phase III in 2013. That's the timeframe we are envisaging.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Graham Parry from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my questions. The first one's just on the guidance upgrade for 2012, of the &#x20AC;50 million EBITDA upgrade. Just looking at the sensitivities you gave us in the third quarter from FX, it looks as if about &#x20AC;50 million underlying would come from pre-FX &#x2013; from FX pre any hedging losses. So, I was wondering, could you quantify hedging losses and what the actual underlying upgrade is? Presumably it's somewhere in the &#x20AC;25 million to &#x20AC;30 million range or so.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, of that underlying upgrade, how much is just dropping straight through from the Rebif sales upgrade? And how much of that sales upgrade is due to pricing? And on that note, could you just comment on how you see pricing into next year with the products like BG-12 and Aubagio launching into the market.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly on Liquid Crystals, clearly, you're making some fairly cautious comments around order book for fourth quarter. I'm just wondering how we should think about that into 2013. Should we think about key for annualizing into 2013 or, perhaps, even margins going down into 2013 for Liquid Crystals? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Graham, let me address the guidance, first of all, and then take them in sequence. As far as the FX sensitivity is concerned, we provided last year our sensitivity for the U.S. dollar where we stated $0.01 up or down moves the profitability, i.e. EBITDA up or down by around about &#x20AC;6 million, &#x20AC;7 million. This is unchanged and covers basically everything transactional, translational. So, for ease, we gave this clarity last year in the second quarter in order to make things more transparent to you.</p>
          <p>We equally gave at that point in time our sensitivity for the Swiss franc. And these two currencies eventually are the drivers on the currencies whilst the other currencies, Taiwanese dollar, Japanese yen, do not play such a significant role.</p>
          <p>So here, you can see that when we look at &#x2013; I just give now the example specifically for the U.S. dollar. In the U.S. dollar, we gave guidance with Q1 that we foreshadow the remaining three quarters at $1.35 and we now do that at $1.25. So, there's a $0.10 delta, which on a yearly basis, should lead to $60 million, $70 million EBITDA enhancements.</p>
          <p>And here the big point I would like to indicate, of course, we make risk management, so we introduced last year, when we saw the dollar at $1.40, $1.45, we introduced the three years risk management horizon, so we already started hedging last year. And we currently have a U.S. dollar hedge position of around about 50%, which are at forward rates of around about about $1.35.</p>
          <p>So, of the $60 million, $70 million profit I alluded to earlier on, on a yearly basis, only $35 million are truly hitting the P&amp;L on a full-year basis and now you can basically take an equal chunk of that on a quarter-to-quarter basis and you would come to something like &#x20AC;15 million that you have indicated earlier on. This is the FX sensitivity. Now on Rebif, the feedback is on the U.S. sales, of course, we have a co-promotion agreement with Pfizer so here it's a 50-50 split on the respect of profitability, which we share in the P&amp;L or show in the P&amp;L under commission expenses. So, of course the momentum in the U.S. was healthy on Rebif and for that very reason, of course, we posted an increase on the commission expense line.</p>
          <p>As far as pricing is concerned, I think you should take into consideration that all other players have taken similar pricing initiatives and what 2013 will be, Stefan and Bharat have clearly pointed out the approach that has taken on Rebif that we defend our franchise but where prices will be in 2013 depends, of course, on competitors entering or not entering and also on market's dynamics and therefore, let's look at Rebif and what we do there pricing-wise in 2013, let's first of all it gets now the Rebif products into the markets the way we would like to handle it and talk about 2013 when the year has started.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as the last question is concerned on Liquid Crystals, so here it's &#x2013; there's nothing negative that we see in the markets besides that of course we are coming out of strong volume quarters. And chemicals move with GDP, move with the cycle, and therefore, you do see that the chemicals industry and the consumer electronics industry is softening. And whilst we still have a strong order book now in Q3, which is not as but quite as healthy as Q2, here we have normal &#x2013; the normal seasonality that we have after good quarters especially when the chemical segment softens, that the fourth quarter will soften. So, this is something that we hear from the industry. We hear in our key accounts and for that very reason, we are trying to be as transparent as we can and, of course, factoring also then the higher idle costs that we'll have through putting some inventories down and that is making the guidance for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as 2013 is concerned, that pretty much &#x2013; your question on the margin pretty much depends also on where the cycle will go. Beginning of the year, there was the assumption in the chemical industry that the second half will stabilize and improve whilst the first half will be rocky. As a matter of fact, it has turned exactly the opposite. First half was, volume-wise, relatively healthy, the second half is now becoming more rocky and as far as 2013 is concerned it's &#x2013; our current view is that in 2013, we will not have a new technology entering the Liquid Crystals domain. So, for that very reason, we will not have pricing upgrades in 2013 whilst we continue working hard on the two new technologies that we are exploring. Our view is they will not come into the market in 2013. We are still testing the technologies and for that very reason, the margin will truly depend on where the volumes will go. Should the volumes be healthy, we will maintain somewhat in the area that we currently have posted. Should volumes in the chemical segment go down, we will, of course, face some volatility here. Whilst overall, our &#x2013; because very clearly the Liquid Crystals will stick around and whilst it has been considered as a business that would go southwards, operationally, it will remain healthy.</p>

          <p>You're most welcome, Graham. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Jo Walton in Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wonder if you could explain a couple of comments or around Performance Chemicals your comment, the division expects some normalization with high market share in the second half of the year. I understand a lot of your comments about the general market environment, but if you're normalizing market share, presumably, someone is going to do better than you in the second half, I just wonder if you could help us on that.</p>
          <p>And then in Merck Millipore, you have an impact of &#x20AC;7 million in lost sales from the non-renewal of an insulin contract. I wonder if you could just explain to us a little bit some of the barriers to entry, it was my understanding that once you had a product approved with some form of technology associated with it, it was really incredibly difficult and certainly not cost effective to change that process at some point going forward. So, is this a development stage project that isn't going forwards or is there more competition and more ability to shop around in that Merck Millipore business?</p>
          <p>And my final question, look at your hedging, you've given us some help here, should we assume that the hedging at $1.35 to the dollar runs out some point next year so that if everything were to be equal, if currencies were to stay where they were today, you would actually get the full benefit of that currency some time in 2013 where clearly, you're deferring that benefit at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo, thank you very much for all these questions. So, let me address them again one by one. And here, as far as the hedging is concerned, we are currently, for 2013, having around about a hedge position of 30% that we equally have around the $1.35, $1.34, $1.33, so slightly better compared to running rates for 2012 but, of course, at a lower hedge position.</p>
          <p>So, should everything be equal, should currencies remain at $1.25, of course, there will be some benefits associated to this in 2013. But who knows where currencies will be in 2013, we don't have a crystal ball on this. If we would have one, we would concentrate on doing &#x2013; investing all our money on the crystal ball. And for that very reason, my honest feedback is virtually all things being equal, of course we would have a more higher benefit in 2013, but it's, I think, premature today make calls on where the currency will be in 2013.</p>
          <p>So, then on the second question on the insulin this was a change of ownership, change of control clause that was triggered on one of our products, which was a trading business. The insulin is not a pure consumables or device business. It's a trading business that we were doing in our Process Solutions business, in our upstream Chemical business. And for that very reason, it's clearly not part of our normal business model where we clearly differentiate through our business model through innovation. And for that very reason, that has &#x2013; this change of control clause was used by a competitor. And for that very reason, we were not booking anymore. We were booking the sales incrementally last year and Q1, Q2 have therefore tougher comparable base, whilst in Q3, Q4 2012, we will now enter a normal comparable base because the customers last year did a nice pre-ordering is that we're informed about this change of control that has been taken.</p>
          <p>Now, I come to the market share for the Liquid Crystals. If you look into Q1 and Q2 communication that we have done, we posted even a stronger market share in 2012 first half than in the last two years. So, we went market share wise in an area where we know that some of our customers normally think they should not be that pronounced with us. And for that very reason, we simply assume that the market share will remain high but will be somewhat more balanced like we've seen in 2011 and 2010. And for that very reason, we already factor that in because also our customers like us as the majority leader but don't like us to be its &#x2013; just as an example, to be the sole supplier. And for that very reason, we simply factor here in a normal development on market share, which does not really change the competitiveness that we are having in this industry. And with this, Jo, I think all questions have been answered.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my questions. A couple of questions please. Just I noticed a very strong Glucophage number. It was, I think, you have attributed to Latin America strength. Wondered if you could comment on whether there are any tenders in this quarter specifically and how we should think about that franchise going forward. Clearly, it's exposed to the diabetes epidemic globally but some help here on the growth would be &#x2013; growth you expect would be great?</p>
          <p>Second question, just to whether you could update us on your discussions with the CHMP on the lung cancer indication for Erbitux.</p>
          <p>And finally, just an update on when we might be able to hear &#x2013; when the court case might be on the appeal on the Rebif marketing contract with Pfizer? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, I will take the first question, and Stefan will take the question on CHMP and on Pfizer. So, on the diabetes, you are totally correct. We are here in a very nice position, starting position to be present in the emerging markets. And many of the markets, of course, have the respective marketing rights and it's &#x2013; Glucophage is a product that is well-recognized as a product in all of these respective territories where we have posted decent growth rates in the past. So, this is something that continues, of course, now in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>However, the statements, emerging markets do post nice volume growth, so this is predominantly volume driven but, of course, with a certain volatility and you've seen that in the first quarter, there was more softness in the emerging markets on the second quarter, not in all products, but also in Glucophage, we've performed more stronger in our overall guidance Q3 and Q4 &#x2013; we know that there would be not the same kind of momentum, so we remain, for good reason, more humble and that is basically the dynamics behind Glucophage and diabetes.</p>
          <p>All in all, our view is that Glucophage will remain for the future a good product and for that very reason, we put respective money behind some small capacity adjustments in order to have room for further volume growth in the years 2014 and 2015. So, this is how we look at diabetes, Glucophage generally and at the quarter specific.</p>
          <p>And Stefan will address the other two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Hi, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe one more word on Glucophage is it's obvious that we are competing with generics in this space. And the Glucophage business is a mixture of a very, very rapidly maturing business in Europe, where we're losing sales and a nicely growing business in emerging markets in Japan. We don't have the rights to Glucophage to China. They are with our partner, Bristol-Myers Squibb. So, in the first half of this year, there are obviously tenders but there are tenders in other quarters as well. Very difficult to predict, but we expect that this business will grow going forward.</p>
          <p>On Erbitux CHMP, you had correctly quoted me in one of your reports after the JPMorgan conference, in which I've said that the chance for approval of this dossier is below 50%. We're maintaining that statement. In April of this year, the CHMP had requested data from two Lilly studies in non-small lung cancer, and these two studies are being analyzed and we plan to submit our answers in this process to the agency in September and then we expect a final CHMP opinion during the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Rebif, and Rebif and Pfizer, you know that early this year a lower court in the U.S. had agreed with Pfizer and wrote that the Pfizer agreement extends through 2015. We have appealed against this. This is currently before an appellate court. We cannot speculate on the outcome or the timing of this as we're currently in litigation. It's very difficult for us to predict anything, anyway. So, there are no benchmark data on this, but we assume that response on the court is imminent.</p>
