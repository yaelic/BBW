        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the presentation of Inditex Results for the Interim Half Year 2012. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to questions received on the telephone followed by those questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, you have the floor. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim half year 2012. I am Pablo Isla and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO; and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for the first-half 2012 showed that Inditex continues its ongoing global multi-concept growth and a strong execution of the business model. Sales in the first half of 2012 have increased 17%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period. As a result, EBIT has grown 35%. Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our store opening plan and online sales roll-out for the year is on track. We have opened the stores in 39 different markets over the first half, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex's business model. We have also launched online operations in selected new markets in the period. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally. In terms of growth, we have maintained a strong expansion. We now have a global presence and we have further diversified our operations over the period.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Ignacio who will provide some of the detail behind the headline numbers, and I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In the first half of 2012, all declines on the profit and loss account showed significant growth as a result of the operating performance. Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;7.2 billion, EBITDA of &#x20AC;1.6 billion and net income of &#x20AC;944 million.</p>
          <p>Starting with sales, let me tell you our new selling space has contributed 8% to total sales growth in the first half of 2012. Like-for-like sales growth was very strong at 7%. The translation of sales in currencies different to the euro have added 2% points to reported sales growth, due to the high exchange rates versus our reporting currency. Gross profit has increased 19% to &#x20AC;4.3 billion. Gross margin of sales has reached 59.6%.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. Operating expenses in the first half 2012 have increased 14%, mainly due to the growth in this space and available costs linked to the strong sales performance. Operating expenses include all the start-up costs for new openings. Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. The working capital evolution is in line with the trend shown at fiscal year-end 2011. Inditex continues to show a strong financial condition.</p>
          <p>I will now hand you over to Marcos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of space addition, we are on track as we have opened 166 net stores in the first half 2012 to reach a total of 5,693. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 39 markets over the period. Regarding the performance in the first half 2012, the concepts have continued increasing the sales significantly. The differences reflect mainly the comparable base of the previous years.</p>
          <p>I am now handing over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Marcos. Zara is now targeting a global online presence. Following on with its rollout, Zara has launched online sales in China on the 5th of September with a strong reception. We plan to roll out online sales in other selected markets in the near future until we establish a global presence. We continue to identify significant opportunities globally. For the rest of 2012, we will continue to invest profitably, expanding our business in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns through our multi-concept and multi-channel strategy.</p>
          <p>Our store opening program is on track. Our ordinary capital expenditure will be around &#x20AC;1 billion. The acquisition of unique retail premises in London at 333 Oxford Street with New Bond Street has resulted in an extraordinary investment of &#x20AC;192 million in the first half of 2012. Inditex is now present in five continents and in all key markets, showing our global reach. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years. Regarding the start of the autumn/winter season, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1st of August to the 17th of September have grown 17%. And finally, to conclude this presentation, I would like to highlight that Zara's latest image can now be seen at its flagship store at Ginza in Tokyo.</p>
          <p>And this is all from us. We will be pleased now to answer any questions you may have.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, the telephone question-and-answer session starts now. We remind you that online questions will follow. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.

          <p>Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. It's Ben Spruntulis from Exane.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your performance in the Americas, it looks like Americas have moved from 12% to 14% of revenue, which looks like very strong like-for-like performance rather than store growth. Is it reasonable to assume that your online business in the U.S. is the major driver for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know that we prefer not to elaborate very much on the evolution of sales in any particular geography, in any case until the end of the year. What we can say is that we have had a strong performance globally, as you see with the results with 17% sales growth, 7% like-for-like sales growth. And it has to do with the evolution of the business, with the business model, the flexibility of the business model. So, I wouldn't highlight any specific area or any specific element involved in the performance in any of the different regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask maybe just a follow-up then just on the gross margin across the first half? Could you just comment on whether there was any benefits [due to a] markdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know also the gross margin &#x2013; as we always say, the gross margin is a combination of many different things. It has to do with markups, markdowns. It has to do with currencies, fashion trends, product mix, product management. It has to do with many different things. We are happy with the evolution of the gross margin. We also &#x2013; well, at the beginning of the year in the full &#x2013; in the 2011 full-year results presentation, we were talking about the gross margin for the full year. We were saying that we were seeing a stable gross margin for the year 2012. We maintain at this stage of the year the same vision, having in mind that for us it's stable, it's always plus or minus 50 basis points. So, we are happy with the evolution of the gross margin, but we always prefer not to isolate any particular element in the gross margin because it's a combination of many different things. And it mainly has to do with the very strong like-for-like sales growth, with the flexibility of the business model. This is the main driver of the gross margin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>My question is very simple, which is that I think in your Annual Report you talked about Zara having a million visitors a day to its website. I was wondering at what point that was, and what number it would be now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the number now is higher particularly we have in mind in the last 10 days after the launch in China. Now, we are talking about &#x2013; around 1.3 million visitors per day.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to all. And just a question in terms of net cash position and cash evolution. I was expecting an acceleration in this first half. Can you point if &#x2013; given that net cash is more or less flat year-to-date, can you point if apart from the investment in the UK store, if you had some seasonality in terms of other factors such as some cash-outs in the first half that justify this? I know that the second half is...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Because there is a problem with the line with &#x2013; I think it must be with your line because we cannot hear you very well.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry? Yes, I'm sorry. Good morning. So, my question is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Rito, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. My question is in terms of net cash. I was asking in terms of if you see some one-offs in the &#x2013; in this first half in terms of cash-out because net cash is more or less flat year-to-date. I know that the cash generation is strong in the second half, but apart from the investment in the store &#x2013; flagship in UK, if you had additional one-offs in the half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, but it's impossible to &#x2013; there remains all that noise in the line. If I have understood what you were asking about &#x2013; but it was very difficult to hear you, about CapEx and the acquisition in Oxford Street?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And also in terms of if there is any one-offs because...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One-off, okay. What I can tell you &#x2013; sorry, because it was very difficult to hear with this problem in the line, but if I &#x2013; if we have understood properly your question, what I would say is something which is not different from what we have been saying recently of course. Most of our expansion plan is based on having premises on a leasehold basis. And there could be &#x2013; when there's a very, very unique opportunity, there could be an exception to the general rule, as has been the case. It was the case in Fifth Avenue. It has now been the case in the store in London in Oxford Street with New Bond Street. Well, it's something very exceptional. It could happen in the future but on a very exceptional basis.</p>

          <p>Well, you know &#x2013; but for us, as we always say, the inventory is not the best way to measure the evolution of our business.

And what we can say is that it's very much in line with what has been the case in previous seasons.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Could I just ask a bit more about the launch in China, particularly the logistics model? Are you supplying individual orders from Spain or are you using a third party, as you do in the U.S.? And can you also talk about the terms for delivery in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. What we can tell you is we are using exactly the same model as in the U.S. or Japan. So, we have an online store in China for the Chinese market and then we have free delivery above a certain level of price, it's RMB300. We have different delivery times depending on the areas of the country. The country is divided into three areas because our &#x2013; in the first area, which is mainly related with the cost &#x2013; with the coast, you have deliveries in two days. Then it's a little bit more in the other two regions. Well, we think we have a very competitive proposition from that point of view and we are using an external supplier for the logistics part of the business, as it is the case in the U.S., very similar, or in Japan.</p>
          <p>You know that our online business where we say that it's very scalable because, for us, this is something &#x2013; we are so used to sending twice per week garments to all our stores in the world that the online stores is something similar to that. We are sending clothes twice per week or every day if it is necessary to this online store, as we are doing to all our stores in the world. So, it is very much integrated with our business model. We think that this multi-channel approach makes a lot of sense. It's been very, very helpful. When we talk about, for example, deliveries, in-store deliveries are very relevant. When we talk about returns, 80% of the returns are in-store returns, which is something extremely positive, because this means also a lot of people come into our stores. So, this multi-channel approach and at the same time having in mind our business model in which we are used to twice-per-week deliveries to all our stores in the world is making a lot of sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the &#x2013; that number, 80% of returns in stores, is that a global number?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a global number of 80% of returns going to stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a global number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could I also just ask that presumably the smaller concepts will be entering China in the not-too-distant future?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the online, sorry; I was not understanding. We will have to see. Our idea progressively is to have a global online platform for all the brands in all the different markets. For example, now in the month of October, we are planning to launch Massimo Dutti and Zara Home online in the U.S. So, our idea is progressively to have global online presence with all the different brands.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone; a question again on the online. We have seen that Zara has had a very strong performance versus the other formats, which coupled with a very strong performance in the Americas, which was already mentioned so far, lead us to believe that the online could have played a very important role in your strong like-for-like. Could you provide a little bit more visibility on what could be the weight of online stores &#x2013; of online sales in the Americas region or overall for the group already? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Filipe. I would like to clarify one thing. I mean, when you have the level of performance that you see in your results, 17% sales growth, 7% like-for-like, you cannot attribute these to a &#x2013; the single factor. It's not one geography trading significantly better than other. It's not online offsetting the performance of the stores. It's very much the strong execution of the business model across the board. This is the main driver of the results. This is why I believe it's much more relevant to focus on the execution of the group as a whole than to enter into one geography or another, or whether online is producing this. It's not &#x2013; simply not possible to deliver 17% sales growth, 7% like-for-like, without the business model executing very strongly over the period.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much. My question is about the margin. I know when you talked about the sort of 50 basis points plus or minus over a given year, that's clear. But if we think about your growth in EBIT margins over the past two-and-a-half years, it does seem to look like there's been a significant step-up over that period versus the prior decade. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about to what extent you think that is cyclical or is that a step change that's happened in the business that should be sustained at this new higher level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would answer to your question is that this evolution of the EBIT margin has a lot to do with the like-for-like sales growth that we have had during the period. So, the 7% like-for-like sales growth is something that we can consider very exceptional, and then it has a lot to do with the evolution of the EBIT margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the first half. But if you think about your EBIT margins over the past two-and-a-half years, they're significant higher than even the long-term margin over the prior decade. So, I'm just thinking about, if you think about that two-and-a-half year period, is that a sustainable step-up that we've seen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that if you've been following Inditex for a while, you see that the company is very much focused on the sustainability of the business model and the margins in our profit-and-loss account. So, what you are seeing in terms of margins is very much the result of very strong topline performance. And this is the main driver, right. So, for us to sustain the fundamentals of the business, the flexibility is the key thing.</p>

I think on the website you're talking about a &#x20AC;450 million investment in Spain for logistics. I just wanted to be clear that that Spanish investment was captured within ordinary CapEx or whether you think about that as a &#x2013; as an additional investment?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>No, it's included. It is included in ordinary CapEx. It is included, yes. And part of that investments are taking place this year, part of that investments are going to take place next year. But it is included in the ordinary CapEx.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've got a question about online. And in the countries where Zara has been selling online for more than two years, what is the percentage of sales from online? Would you be able to tell us that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, we continue very focused on the execution, and on the online launch in the different markets we prefer to not to be very specific about the information of the different countries regarding online. You have seen that the roll-out process is going ahead. We did &#x2013; last year we launched in the month September in the U.S., then we launched in Japan. We launched all the brands. This year we have just two weeks ago launched in China. So, what we can say is that online for us, as we have said previously, is very relevant from two different perspectives. One has to do with the evolution of online sales, of course, and the other has to do with very, very relevant tool for us to communicate with our customers, to show the &#x2013; what we call the books, the coordination to show the product. So, it is &#x2013; we were talking before about the visits to the Zara webpage. What we can say is that we are satisfied &#x2013; very satisfied with the evolution of our online activity, but at this stage we prefer not to be very specific about figures and to remain focused on the execution, customer service and the progressive launch in the different markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up about the sale of Oysho products through ASOS in the UK and Amazon in Germany, is that the beginning of a wholesale strategy online for the non-Zara concepts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Anne, this is clearly a one-off initiative for Oysho in which a limited number of designs have been made available through Amazon in Germany and ASOS in the UK. But bear in mind that in neither of these markets is there a physical presence. So in both cases, this minor initiative is useful from an information-gathering perspective. We also have retained the absolute right of approval of our images, models and product presentation. So, I would say that this is a small thing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. Just going back to your guidance of stable gross margin for the full year, up or down 50 basis points, I mean effectively that implies a worse result in the second half. So given the current momentum in trading, I just wondered why we should expect to see a lower gross margin result in the second half. Would that be because of currency or pricing effects for instance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our guidance remains unchanged, which &#x2013; what we are targeting is what we were expecting, as we have mentioned, is a broadly stable gross margin for the full year. So to &#x2013; that means 50 basis points higher or lower, doesn't change our view. So basically, we don't have a target for the gross margin over the second half, is very much that &#x2013; our vision for the year remains the same. Right now we've...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously probably you've been running well ahead of that, haven't you, so far on year to date? So, that's more the sort of annual guidance, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's the same. It's the same guidance that we had in February, keeping in mind that in the gross margin there are many components, the markups, the markdowns, the mix, the currency, the comparable over the second half of the previous year as well. So based on that, we reaffirm our vision right now of a broadly stable gross margin for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Are there any &#x2013; just on that, apart from the comparable, are there any significant negative factors that you see on gross margin in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, but given the different components of the gross margin is &#x2013; it's almost impossible to get into &#x2013; to break it down to the different pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Just as a follow-up on that, what was the percentage of sourcing from proximity areas in the first half including Turkey please? How did that compare with last year's?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our sourcing is very similar to the one in the previous year. We maintain more than 50% in proximity, then we have very relevant part which is Turkey, which is close to proximity, and then in Asia around 30% of our total sourcing. So, it remains very much the same for us. As we have said before, to maintain the flexibility of our business model is something extremely relevant, and that is what is the key element for us in terms of managing the company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So, including Turkey then it's probably what, 60% to 65%, something around that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, around 65%. Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Rod Whitehead here. Zara's sales were up 20% with store numbers up only 6%, so that's about 12% like-for-like growth ex-currency. And you said it's not just about online, so presumably there was some very strong product performance. Would you be advising investors to expect dramatically lower growth in 2013 against those very tough comparisons or do you think that you're going to be able to build further on that step-change in sales per square meter?</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody. We are now going to go over the questions that have come in through the webcast platform. As always, some of the questions have already been covered during the conference call. We have &#x2013; our first question is from Francisco Riquel of Nm&#xE1;s1 Securities.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on the impact of VAT in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we can say is what we announced publicly, that we are absorbing the impact of the VAT. We are not translating it into margins, as it was the case with previous VAT increases in different countries in Europe. And we think we are going to be able to compensate that through efficiencies in all the lines of the &#x2013; in all the elements of the profit and loss account. So, we are maintaining our prices and we are not transferring this VAT increase into our prices, as I was saying, as we have done previously when there have been VAT increases in different countries.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we can say is that we are a global company. We have presence in 85 different markets in the 5 continents and we see strong growth opportunities in all the different markets. So, it would be very difficult for me to identify one country or other country. We see strong growth potential in the different markets in which we are present, thanks to our global presence.</p>
