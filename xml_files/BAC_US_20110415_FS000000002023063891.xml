          <p>Good day, everyone and welcome to the Bank of America first quarter earnings review. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. I will be standing by should you need any assistance and it is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Stitt. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Chuck Noski begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results. And that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations, and these factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry, and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>
          <p>And also, joining us this morning as he did last &#x2013; three months ago, will be Neil Cotty, our Chief Accounting Officer. With that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Before we get started this morning, I wanted to spend a couple minutes on the announcements that occurred this morning other than earnings. Obviously we will cover in this call the announcement with the FSA, Assured, on the monoline. But on the leadership side, I just wanted to talk through what we've done there.</p>
          <p>Last year, Chuck came to me and due to an illness of a close family member in California where he has lived, it was going to be clear that he may not be able to move and we decided to continue to talk about the situation. He made a commitment to move at the end of the school year, obviously, because he had a daughter who was a senior in high school, but with that, it became clear as we moved through this quarter that Chuck could not move. So I asked Chuck take another leadership position that could help us work on some matters in the mortgage company and help with the transition to a new CFO.</p>
          <p>What we announced this morning was to have Bruce Thompson take over for Chuck as CFO effective &#x2013; that transition will be completed by the end of the second quarter and Chuck will continue to use his great judgment and perspective to help Bruce continue to learn the tasks. Chuck has served as the CFO at a time when we had tremendous transformation in our financials. He's been a great partner and we are glad that we came up with something that will work for everybody.</p>
          <p>Bruce, many of you know. He has been a Chief Risk Officer. He has done a great job for us since last year doing that. He ran our Capital Markets for Tom and ran leveraged finance and many other things of the company over his 15-year career here. As Chief Risk Officer, he managed us through a difficult situation including, as you'll see in some of the pages later, a great reposition of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In addition to those two changes, we also announced that Gary Lynch will join us as Global Head of Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Relations. My judgment was that we wanted to continue to add to the quality and capabilities of our management team. As Gary became available, his reputation on the Street, in legal circles and regulators is well known. He's also been the head of the enforcement at the SEC and the relations he has around the world, he spent the last couple of years in London, will help us outside of the United States. He will join us when his garden leave expires.</p>
          <p>So with the management changes behind us, let's shift to the quarterly results. With that, I'll start on slide 4. Rather than get into some of the detail on the page, let me just give you the themes for this quarter which are similar to those related to you in early March. The franchise that we've built over the last 230 years in this company continues to deliver and you can see that in numbers and the statistics this morning. Obviously, the mortgage business is still in need of continued repositioning and we continue to work on that. But what you have seen is solid customer activity across the board.</p>
          <p>Our focus on changing the strategy in the consumer deposits business led to the first quarter of net checking account growth, a return to profit in that business, improved customer satisfaction across the board, the best retention of customers in that business in many quarters.</p>
          <p>In other areas, we continue to grow our FA head count. We've had strong referrals in the businesses to each other. The deposit growth through the whole franchise has gone over a trillion dollars in total deposits and as the economy has improved a bit, we are starting to see some loan growth on a core basis in the middle market basis with David Darnell. We'll touch on some of that later, but the key theme is the franchise continues to deliver.</p>
          <p>As you back up to the second point, revenue rose from last quarter, expenses were flat on a gross basis at $20 billion including goodwill and I will cover it a little later, up $500 million more in the core business, but the absolute levels are elevated and I am going to talk about what we're doing about that in a few minutes. Overall, earnings improved to $2 billion or $0.17, but were still impacted by charges as we continue to pull out through the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>We had $5 billion in charges this quarter that we absorbed and we also had $3 billion between reserve releases and higher private equity to the good side. When we talked to you at investor day we said we were shooting for pre-tax, pre-provision profits in the out years &#x2013; as we normalize to $45 billion to $50 billion. This quarter Chuck will walk you through the one-time items, but if you adjust for those, you'll get to a number of approximately $10 billion which is up from last quarter and I think puts us in a position that we can see clearly how we build a bridge to the $45 billion to $50 billion level as we normalize.</p>
          <p>That normalization requires the interest rate environment to change more fundamentally to a more normalized environment. We've got to take the costs down across the board and as the economy continues to plug away, we'll continue to make progress in other revenue sources.</p>
          <p>In addition, one of the themes we talked about at investor day was the need to continue to drive down the legacy assets and risk in the company. During this quarter, we took care of one of the monoline exposures. We absorbed the home price falloff and we also continue to have our loan portfolio run off across all categories of portfolio that we identified for you a couple quarters ago.</p>
          <p>This quarter that portfolio ran down by about $6 billion excluding the government insured loans which you show you in the appendix. The cost of that to the P/L was about $1.9 billion pre-tax this quarter. Again, Tom and his team did a good job reducing legacy trading assets and we continue to make progress in that area.</p>
          <p>When you look at the balance sheet, we continue to position the balance the sheet. Our reserves, even after release, remain strong, 4.3% to loans, 1.63 times trailing charge-offs. We made progress improving the capital ratios, lowering our risk-weighted assets again, growing liquidity and reducing long-term debt, all those important metrics we identified for you a few months ago.</p>
          <p>We also continue to move forward to take advantage of the opportunities we identified for you. We have a great opportunity as a company in the affluent and mass affluent segments and between Joe Price and Sallie Krawcheck and the team, they continue to see good growth there. We continue to have opportunities on our international capabilities and I will describe the work we have done there over the last quarter, and we continue to have opportunities with business that will rebound as the economy continues to moves forward in the investment management and capital markets areas and we had solid quarters there.</p>
          <p>And again, this quarter, we continue <mark type="ph" /> efforts (7:16) to simplify the franchise. This quarter, we made progress. We sold a European small business card portfolio. We have Balboa under contract. That'll close late this quarter, early next. In addition, we continue to reduce our private equity positions across the board and we continue to sell some other small pieces to continue to fine tune this franchise.</p>
          <p>When we get to the broader economy this quarter what we saw is that the customers' health continues to move forward. Delinquencies were down across all portfolios; consumer spending continued to increase this quarter over last, in 2011 over 2010. In March, it increased 7% to give an example, about 1.5% of that would have been gas price increase, the rest is sort of fundamental customer purchases moving forward.</p>
          <p>We see loan demand in select areas and loan stability across the board absent the runoff book. Our affluent clients continue to take more risk in the market and we have seen growth in the area there and the capital markets remain robust.</p>
          <p>With that, let's drop to page five and get into some of the specific results for the quarter. On slide five, you can see that we can start with the capital ratios. We told you at the conference that our shareholder return model requires us to focus on building our balance sheet with a strong reserve position, driving optimization of our risk weighted asset position and building capital through 2011-2012 as we move from Basel 1 to Basel 2 to Basel 2.5 to Basel 3. This quarter reflects the continued progress. The Tangible Common Equity Ratio increased to 6.1%, above the level we believe that &#x2013; of the risk inherent to run the company.</p>
          <p>A focus that we also shared with you is driving tangible book value per share. We moved that to 1321 this quarter as you can see in the upper, right-hand corner of the slide. Our regulatory cap ratios continue to improve. We had a fairly sizable change in the DTA allowance period for regulatory capital treatment that caused 27 basis points decline before we got the quarter started. But even with that, we still made progress. The Tier 1 Common Ratio was up four basis points, or 31 basis points not taking into account the adjustment and the Tier 1 was up eight basis points gross.</p>
          <p>On the lower right, you can see we made progress by continuing to reduce RWA. And as we've talked to you, we have significant mitigation coming later in the year in Basel calculations after planned implementation of technology, risk models and other risk management opportunities that we have been working on for the last couple of years. All this is critical in our ability to meet the Tier 1 Basel 3 Common Ratio goal of 8% at year-end 2012 as if Basel 3 was fully implemented and to move forward on capital management later this year and next year.</p>
          <p>Let me go to page six and just to step back and think about the progress first quarter of 2010 versus 2011 in the core balance sheet of this company. As you can see on this page, overall assets down 3%, our RWA is down 6%, our deposits are up 4% or $44 billion, our long-term debt has been reduced $77 billion which is significant and has a significant benefit in our margin. Importantly, you can see our tangible common shareholders' equity is up $16 billion, our Tier 1 common equity is up $8 billion and you can see the rest of the statistics on this page. So, in a year's timeframe, we have been able to significantly lower the risk, increase the capital and increase the statistics on reserve coverage while at the same time managing the customer franchise.</p>
          <p>As we move to the businesses I just want to reflect quickly on those and then I will let Chuck take you through the detail and the numbers. On slide seven you can see the overall picture. It's a pretty simple picture. You can see all the businesses have moved back to profitability except our mortgage business and we will talk in some detail about that later on.</p>
          <p>As you go in each of businesses, let's first take our deposit businesses starting on page eight. The deposits team produced earnings this quarter of $355 million and that was versus a loss in the fourth quarter. They had higher revenue and lower litigation expense compared to the fourth quarter. Remember that in this business, the fourth quarter was kind of the low point because the regulatory items affecting the deposits business, i.e., Reg E and overdraft, are fully in this business. Our Durbin charge will go into our card segment later this year if it becomes effective.</p>
          <p>Return on tangible equity for our deposits business this quarter was 25%, which is above the rate &#x2013; our hurdle rates, obviously, but we expect to go higher as the business continue to recover. Average deposit balances were up $5 billion or 4% annualized. Cost of retail deposits, both in this business and our wealth management business combined, were down 4 basis points to 33 basis points.</p>
          <p>Importantly, new accounts reflect continued focus on quality relationships and retention. As a matter of fact, we are seeing the lowest attrition in accounts that we've seen in three years or more. This quarter we have seen the first net account growth, based on the change in strategies that Joe Price and his team are accomplishing, in five quarters. Account closures are down and our customer focus continues to work. Early results in our pilot to reposition our franchise based on all the regulatory changes and the customer driven analysis are still in early rollout, but exceeding our expectations. Adding a Preferred Customer Solutions group, or Platinum Privileges offering, as we call it, has worked well.</p>
          <p>On the expense side, the team is working. Branches are down 200 over the last five quarters. Our cost of deposits ratio that we showed you in early March went down from 264 basis points, that's all the cost of operating the franchise over the deposits, to 260, which shows continued growth. Our active online accounts exceeded 30 million, a record for this company. Our mobile users are up 55%, first quarter '10 to first quarter '11 to 6.8 million mobile users.</p>
          <p>As we switch to card services, that business earned $1.7 billion in the quarter on improved credit quality. Its revenue is down as the portfolio keeps repositioning as we continue to run down the books or the ones we don't want in that business, and the lower yields due to seasonal decline in retail volume. The unit did benefit by reserve release but the earnings are normalizing and we will see that happen over the next few quarter. The retail volumes are down from the fourth quarter, but as I said earlier, customer usage of cards has gone up year-over-year by the 5%, 6%, 7% range depending on the month.</p>
          <p>Our net loss rates broke another level here as we filed below 8% for the first time in a while and from the peak of nearly 14% on card losses in the U.S. credit card book. New accounts in our U.S. credit card book were up 26% in the fourth quarter and the highest level in six quarters and credit quality of this new origination is very strong. So as you think about our core consumer businesses, we've returned to profit in deposits and we expect to keep driving that forward and our card business continues to improve and both have upside as the interest rate environment and economy continues to stabilize.</p>
          <p>When you move to the next page, slide 9 and our wealth management businesses, the Global Wealth Management team turned in $531 million after tax, up 69% from solid fourth quarter results driven by an 8% increase in revenue and lower provision for credit costs.</p>
          <p>Our pre-tax margin in this business showing the value of the innovative model across all the various products is reaching nearly 19% and the return on economic equity was 30%. The growth in margin, as I said, is reflective of the loan and deposits growth which grew 5% in the quarter and it demonstrates that customers want to integrate their finances with us and that loan deposit growth led to NII growing 10% in the fourth quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Now many times people ask us if that money is just money sitting on the sidelines, but during this quarter we have also seen the activity related to the investment side of the house grow nicely. Client balances grew 2% and that's on a $2 trillion base to give you a sense, so it's $45 billion in growth from clients and new product flows of about $14 billion in long-term assets under management were all good performance by this unit.</p>
          <p>The growth in financial advisors continues to be steady, 184 new financial advisors were added. We continue to have record low attrition in our advisor force and referrals by this unit, which is sort of a lynchpin to our referral strategy continues to be strong and remains healthy with the other businesses.</p>
          <p>On slide 9, we move to one of the &#x2013; at the bottom of slide 9, we talk about one of the core businesses we have, which is middle market, small business lending which turned in another quarter of $923 million of earning. They're down slightly as they went from a release of provision to actually having provision this quarter. Return on tangible equity of this business is 18% for this quarter. Average C&amp;I balances were up 2% and that's concentrated in the middle market space and offsets declines in the commercial real estate business and dealer financial services business. Average deposits also grew 2%. The asset quality of this business was very strong through the cycle and continues to improve.</p>
          <p>One of the things that you often ask about that we saw here, which is we saw revolver utilization of our companies move from 32% in the fourth quarter to 35% which shows the companies are using credit ever so slightly. Remember that normalized for that level, that is probably in the mid-40s, so we've got work to go ahead of us there still.</p>
          <p>When we move to slide 10, moving to our large corporate and capital markets and sales and trading team and global banking and markets, they earned $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter (sic) [first quarter]. Returns on tangible capital in that business were 28%. The revenue was up 44% from the fourth quarter driven by increases in sales and trading, a robust quarter in investment banking and steady corporate banking revenue driven by treasury management growth of about 5%.</p>
          <p>Corporate loans were up $3 billion for the quarter, about 12% annualized, driven by growth in our international lending business. One of the interesting things here is our international market share in some of our businesses is now stronger on our U.S. market share which shows the effort the team has made to grow across the world with its global clients. In equity capital markets and advisory, we actually had higher shares outside the U.S. this quarter than we did inside the U.S. which shows good progress on our international strategy.</p>
          <p>And now we move to the business that we continue to have to do a lot of work on and that's our consumer real estate services business. As you know, we split this business in two parts to focus the executives in the business to concentrate on two pieces: Barbara Desoer and her team to concentrate on the front end business and Terry Laughlin and the team to concentrate on the legacy asset business and running down.</p>
          <p>In the business, the legacy asset business obviously had a significant loss and the go-forward business had a slight profit and Chuck will talk you through that later. Our production levels in mortgage banking fell to $56 billion but we maintained our market share. To deal with the falloff, we announced today and have been reducing head count by approximately 3,500 people: about 2,000 of those contractors in that business and about 1,500 are teammates. This is all on the good side of the house and Barbara's side of the business.</p>
          <p>On the legacy side, we continue to deploy resources to get through the backlog in modifications and foreclosures. During the quarter we modified 64,000 loans bringing us to over 840,000 loans modified in the last few years. On the legacy side, as you saw in our press release, we settled the exposures with one of the monoline insurers and Chuck will cover that later.</p>
          <p>Again, and after the review the regulators conducted late last fall and our self-assessment, we made significant progress implementing the changes to solutions on short sales, deeds in lieu and foreclosures and completed about 70,000 of those in this quarter. The costs of delaying foreclosures and assessments related to that is reflected in the P&amp;L this quarter, as is increased servicing costs in our MSR valuation.</p>
          <p>As we move to the subject of costs, which is something we focus on, you can see on slide 12, that you can see that we have laid out for you sort of the fourth quarter and the first quarter in terms of the overall costs. There's about $20 billion of reported costs but on a core basis, we had about a $500 million increase from quarter to quarter. We know that we need to do more on costs and we're continuing to work on those.</p>
          <p>If you look at the base run rates, approximately $17 billion and this is a run rate that we have been facing consistent with what Chuck told you at the investor day about a $70 billion number. We have been managing costs to try to run them flat as the incremental one-time costs continue to hit us in a given quarter, but the way we are managing that has been managing head count. Overall head count grew on a point-to-point basis from December 31st to March 31st about 0.3%. That's 0.3% or 2,700 people across our 285,000 &#x2013; 288,000 people with the mortgage business and the legacy side adding 2,700 people and the rest of the company going down by 2,000. That 2,000 reduction is even with the investments we're making in small business bankers and international capabilities, financial advisors and many other areas.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency ratio is at 75%. It's down from 92% in the fourth quarter, but that is not the progress we would like to see. We expect that to continue to recover as the legacy assets and some of the charges go down in the high 50s, low 60s which is where we were earlier in 2010, but we need to do more to ensure we can hold expenses flat or reduce them as revenue rises to deliver the returns in this business and the company we need to do.</p>
          <p>To do that, as we told you at investor day, we continue to finish off with all the integration and that will give us in time the so-called peace dividend and the effort continue to drive this company forward. We told you we could get back to the 55% efficiency ratio.</p>
          <p>We have launched an effort this week using outside teammates that worked at other companies in a significant amount of internal team called New BAC, which will continue to work &#x2013; to take all the work in this company, examine it and see the work that doesn't add value to our customers or teammates and move it out of this company. We will work on this effort for the next several months. It takes two phases and leads us all the way into 2012. The first phase will be completed late this fall and we will continue to implement immediately thereafter to get the expense savings and keep the run rate down as the revenue and the economy recovers</p>
          <p>With that general overview, let me turn it over to Chuck to take you through the detail of the quarter. Chuck?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brian. I appreciate your kind words and I'm looking forward to continuing to work with you and the senior management team in my new role as Vice Chairman. I think Bruce will do a great job as the next Chief Financial Officer and also Gary Lynch, who will be joining us later in the year, will be a terrific addition to Bank of America. As some of you may know, I worked with Gary during the five years I served on the board of directors at Morgan Stanley and I found him to be a first rate executive</p>
          <p>With that, let's turn to the slides and begin on slide 13. For the quarter, as Brian said, we reported $2 billion of net income, or $0.17 a share after preferred dividends. There were several significant items during the quarter which are detailed on slide 14.</p>
          <p>Representations and warranties provision in the first half was $1 billion of which slightly more than half was associated with the GSEs and the remainder was related primarily to recent experience within monoline. The provision related to the GSEs was driven by higher estimated repurchase rates along with the further deterioration in the Home Pricing Index, which we call HPI, in the quarter.</p>
          <p>If you recall, when we announced our agreement with the GSEs earlier this year and adjusted the liability for future losses, I noted that there could be further refinements from a number of factors. A major factor in our estimate of the liability for future losses is the performance of HPI, which declined this quarter and impacts the severity of losses in our reps and warranties liability.</p>
          <p>The credit mark on structured liabilities under the fair value option resulted in a negative adjustment of $586 million, reflecting a tightening of our credit spreads compared to a negative adjustment of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and is reported in other income. Equity investment gains during the quarter included a $1.1 billion gain from an investment in connection with the related IPO in the first quarter and reflected both the sale of shares as well as the fair value mark on the remaining shares we still hold. We had $546 million in gains on the sale of securities during the quarter. Trading related income included a negative DVA impact of $357 million, due to wider debt spreads.</p>
          <p>Excluding fees paid to external legal service providers, litigation expense this quarter, was $940 million, principally associated with mortgage-related matters. During the quarter there were various mortgage assessments and waivers accrued for several areas of exposure driven by the foreclosure delays which totaled $874 million including $548 million for compensatory fees that we expect to be assessed by the GSEs as well as costs incurred during the foreclosure process that we do not expect to recover.</p>
          <p>Also included in the first quarter, as Brian mentioned, was approximately $1 billion of expense related to retirement eligible stock-based compensation awards, so-call FAS 123(R) that we have every year at this time. And merger-related and restructuring charges were $202 million.</p>
          <p>Credit loss reserves were reduced by $2.2 billion in the quarter versus $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The current period reserve number included $1.6 billion of reserve increases related to the purchase credit impaired portfolio.</p>
          <p>One item not on this slide but which I want to highlight for you is our effective tax rate that this quarter was 26.3%. At this time, we would expect the rate for the rest of year to be around 30%, plus or minus unusual items like the charge for the U.K. rate reductions expected later this year or more valuation allowance release benefits like we have seen during the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>You may recall that we wrote down a portion of our deferred tax asset last year in the third quarter due to the 1% U.K. tax rate reduction resulting in a charge after tax of nearly $400 million. It looks like the U.K. is considering two more 1% tax rate reductions, which could impact the third quarter of this year. So we are expecting a charge income tax expense of nearly $800 million upon enactment of those rate changes. Because we would just be reducing deferred tax assets that are disallowed at the margin, the $800 million charge would not affect our regulatory capital levels.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, you can see that average loans were down $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter while average deposits increased more than $15 billion. Deposits remains a good story of growth as consumer balances grew, wealth management clients continued to do more business with us and commercial customers continued to prefer to hold rather than invest cash. In line with our comments over the past few months, ending long-term debt dropped $14 billion and we expect that decline to continue.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 16, loans at the end of the quarter excluding net charge-offs and runoff activity were up $2.9 billion. Consumer loans were relatively flat. Commercial loans ex-real estate were up $3.5 billion, or 1.4%, driven primarily by growth in Asia and EMEA and commercial real estate loans declined $2 billion, or 4.1%, as reductions in high risk assets continue to offset new originations.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to net interest income on slide 17. Net interest income on an FTE basis was $12.4 billion, down $312 million from the fourth quarter. The impact of lower hedge income, lower consumer loan balances and yields and fewer days in the quarter were offset partially by a reduction in long-term debt and other items. Our average earning assets for the quarter were down $14 billion mainly due to reduced customer financing activity in the repo area.</p>
          <p>Average consumer loans were down as additional runoff in the card and home equity portfolios more than offset retained mortgage originations. Average commercial loans were relatively flat as decreases in real estate and U.S. commercial were partially offset by increases in both core loan and trade finance activity in our non-U.S. corporate banking business reflecting our growing international footprint.</p>
          <p>As we have said for the past few quarters, we expect net interest income to be down again in the second quarter and anticipate stabilization in the second half of the year. We are also on track to lower our long-term debt footprint by 15 to 20% by the end of 2011 relative to third quarter 2010 levels.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 18, card revenue is down almost $300 million from the fourth quarter results due mainly to the seasonal decline in interchange. Decreases in retail spending were 6% versus the prior quarter and versus the prior year reflected an increase of 6%. Card revenue is down 7% from a year ago due to the impact of the CARD Act as the provisions became effective throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we show service charges were flat with the fourth quarter but down 21% from a year ago due to overdraft policy changes, which as you know, were fully embedded in our results as of the fourth quarter of last year. Let me say a couple things you should note before we move away from retail banking driven revenue.</p>
          <p>Consumer spending is up. Account closures are down. Quality sales remain strong. Deposits grew. And employment levels are higher, which all point to improving performance in our retail businesses in future periods.</p>
          <p>Mortgage banking income on slide 20 improved by $2 billion from the fourth quarter as lower reps and warranties provision was partially offset by lower production volumes and margin as well as less favorable net MSR head results. Production volume in first mortgage of $57 billion was down 33% in line with the drop in the overall market size from the fourth quarter while LOC volumes were down 45%. MSR performance, net of hedges, was negligible this quarter versus a positive $257 million last quarter.</p>
          <p>The capitalization rate for the consumer mortgage MSR asset ended the quarter at 95 basis points versus 92 basis points in the fourth quarter. Given the level of interest rates and our lower LOC pipeline, we forecast production levels will be lower over the near term.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 21, you can see the total reps and warranties provision in the quarter was $1 billion, down from $4.1 billion from the prior quarter. Much of the decrease was due to the impact of our agreements with the GSEs in the fourth quarter. The $1 billion provision in the first quarter dealt principally with the GSEs and recent experience with the monoline.</p>
          <p>On that note, as Brian made reference to this morning, we announced an agreement with Assured Guaranty to resolve all of the monolines outstanding and potential repurchase claims related to alleged reps and warranties breaches involving certain first and second lien residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts where Assured provided financial guarantee insurance. The agreement covers a combined original collateral exposure of approximately $35.8 billion with the combined principal at risk of approximately $10.9 billion.</p>
          <p>The agreement includes a cash payment of approximately $1.1 billion to Assured as well as a loss sharing reinsurance arrangement that has a current estimated fair market value of approximately $500 million. Approximately $1.1 billion of that was reserved for these potential repurchase claims at the end of December, with the remaining liability recognized in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>This settlement gets behind us a sizable piece of home equity exposure along with some first lien exposure. We currently estimate the upper end of the possible loss range related to non-GSEs to remain at around 7 to $10 billion over existing accruals and a reduction in our previously disclosed estimated range resulting from reserve accruals in this quarter were largely offset by the impact of HPI deterioration during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, this estimated range does not represent our estimate of a probable loss and is based on current assumptions that are necessarily subject to change. The liability for reps and warranties ended the quarter at $6.2 billion compared to $5.4 billion in the prior quarter. Our unresolved repurchase requests increased $2.9 billion to $13.6 billion due to an increase in submissions from the GSEs on both remaining Countrywide originations not covered by the agreements we announced in January and legacy Bank of America originations. Part of the increase was the result of lower submissions in the fourth quarter as we finalized the GSE agreements.</p>
          <p>On slide 22, we have outlined in more detail the organizational changes we announced in the last quarter for our former home loans and insurance business and on slide 23, we split out for you what we now call Consumer Real Estate Services into three pieces to provide a way to better understand the financial results and track our progress in those activities.</p>
          <p>Home loans and insurance, as you can see, made $130 million this quarter and includes loan production activities, our servicing of current loans, insurance operations and consumer real estate services, home equity portfolio not included in the legacy asset servicing portfolio. Insurance earnings drove the results given the low levels of customer mortgage application activity in the quarter and the costs we incurred to fulfill the outstanding pipeline leftover from the fourth quarter's low rate environment.</p>
          <p>Legacy Asset Servicing lost $2.5 billion and is responsible for servicing delinquent loans and managing the runoff and exposures related to selected residential mortgage, home equity and discontinued product loan portfolios. The LAS results represent the net cost of legacy exposures including reps and warranties provision, litigation costs, financial results of the home equity loan portfolios allocated to Legacy Asset Servicing and financial results of the Legacy Asset Servicing portfolio service for others. The LAS portfolios include both current and delinquent loans that met standards defined for inclusion in Legacy Asset Servicing.</p>
          <p>The Other column is essentially the results of management of the MSR and includes the change in the value of the MSRs net of hedges. We will continue to refine how we present this information going forward.</p>
          <p>Okay, now back to earnings on slide 24. Our activity with wealth management clients is producing revenue that achieved post-merger highs which is where we generate the bulk of investment and brokerage revenues. Investment and brokerage revenue was up $222 million, or 8% from the fourth quarter due to higher market levels, long-term assets under management and higher transactional activity. Asset managed fees were a report $1.5 billion, up 6% from the fourth quarter and brokerage fees were also a record approximately $1.6 billion, up 9% from the fourth quarter. Total client balances including Merrill edge grew $47 billion to $2.3 trillion during the quarter as a result of market activity and strong flows into long-term asset management products.</p>
          <p>Sales and trading revenue, on slide 25, of $4.9 billion, which includes both net interest income and non-interest income increased approximately 93% from the fourth quarter but was down around 30% from last year's record quarterly results.</p>
          <p>FICC results more than doubled from the fourth quarter led by credit products and rates and currencies.</p>
          <p>Equity revenue was up 60% to $1.2 billion from the fourth quarter driven by increases in all major lines of business. An improved trading environment and client activity helped the equity derivatives businesses while increases in both the S&amp;P and Dow and had a positive impact on the cash equity business. Average VAR in the period increased 17% from the fourth quarter to $184 million versus a drop of 33% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Investment banking results on slide 26 were relatively flat with the fourth quarter but compared to a year ago, revenue increased 27%. Our overall fee ranking remained at number two globally. Results versus a year ago were driven by increases across all major product categories, particularly M&amp;A and equities. We were involved in numerous high profile transactions during the quarter, several of which were outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Turning to expense levels on slide 27, total expenses excluding the goodwill impairment charge last quarter increased $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter. As I discussed earlier, $874 million of the increase was due to several areas of exposure driven by the foreclosure delays. Personnel expense compared to the fourth quarter is up approximately $1.4 billion reflecting, again, the impact of retirement eligible stock-based comp awards along with higher performance-based incentives in GBAM related to stronger results.</p>
          <p>Higher levels of head count and expense in consumer real estate services were related to default management staff and other loss mitigation activities in that business and as we mentioned earlier, litigation costs of $940 million in the quarter dropped from $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As we told you last month at our investor conference, we expect our expense levels for 2011 to remain elevated as we work through these issues and continue to invest in the franchise. Highlighting what Brian said earlier, we have launched a comprehensive initiative focused on improving our financial performance by reducing expense levels and producing higher revenue.</p>
          <p>Moving to asset quality trends on slide 28, as they did through most of last year, delinquencies excluding government-insured FHA loans, net charge-offs, criticized balances and non-performing assets continues to improve.</p>
          <p>On slide 29, the improving credit performance in most of our portfolios drove the decrease in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $6 billion decreased $755 million compared to the fourth quarter, consumer net charge-offs were down $509 million reflecting improvement in most products and commercial asset quality also improved as net charge-offs dropped $246 million or 26% from the prior quarter with the biggest drivers being U.S. C&amp;I, including a legal settlement recovery in commercial real estate.</p>
          <p>The increase in net charge-offs in non-U.S. commercial was due to a couple large legacy credits and even with the decline in reserve levels, the ratio of allowance for loan losses to annualized net charge-offs was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter at roughly 1.6 times.</p>
          <p>In thinking about credit costs for the rest of 2011, we think provision expense should continue to edge down through the year as charge-offs continue to move lower, primarily in the consumer businesses. We expect loan loss reserve reductions will continue as long as portfolio performance and the economy continue to improve and our other credit metrics warrant lower reserves.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 30, our purchased credit impaired consumer loan book which is comprised of discontinued real estate, residential mortgages and home equity was $28 billion including the allowance. We increased the reserve by $1.6 billion to reflect a more negative outlook for home prices.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 31, let me add before closing that we recognize that there are a number of items in the quarter that make your analysis a bit time consuming. From our view, the positive underlying trends are improvements in credit, capital, deposits, and progress on redesigning our franchise to best serve our customer base. We believe the interest rate environment will remain challenging and don't expect the mortgage picture to improve significantly for several quarters. However, as you heard at our investor conference, we have articulated our strategy and we are executing against it.</p>
          <p>So with that, let's now open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>[Operator Instructions.] We'll go first to the site of Glenn Schorr with Nomura. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks very much. Maybe if we could just take a minute to expand a little bit. You just mentioned and you have it in slide 27 that the program to increase revenues and take out costs to drive profitability, and I think later on, you said something about material benefits in the second half of '12 on the expense side. Can we talk maybe a little bit about the largest contributors or the largest buckets that will see that expense savings over the two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it, think about two different things going on, Glenn. First, the largest improvement you are going to see over the next 24 months will be as we crest over-go over the crest on this mortgage servicing side for the delinquent assets and start to take those costs out and likewise, other places in the company that similar costs exist. So that, if you remember what we showed you, is we showed you we had 70,000 human beings dedicated in the mortgage business including the contractors, 50,000 full-time employees. We have gone from about 5,000 to 8,000 people who service six days and out loans to a total of 30,000 over the last several quarters and again, 2,500, 2,600 &#x2013; 2,700 this quarter.</p>
          <p>So one of the things you will see as we continue to get through the bubble of foreclosures is delinquency come down, you really have a body of work to get through. We had to stop the foreclosures. We restarted them and as we get through that, that will come down over the next several quarters. What we are talking about, we knew we were going to get that and so that we have identified; that's why we isolated it and we will get that out.</p>
          <p>What we also need to do is just continue to look. We sold 19 or 20 different pieces of the company off. We have built up a lot of stuff for businesses that no longer here. We have built processing stuff when the company was a different company. We brought in a lot of new enterprises, our Six Sigma capabilities that we have put in because we brought in over 100,000 different associates who are new to all of that.</p>
          <p>We had to step back and take a look at every aspect of work in the company. Work that doesn't benefit the customers or associates has to be taken out. That process is a process many companies use and I have used early in my career. But the process is in two phases. The first phase finishes late this fall, the second phase finishes early in the spring and so we'll begin implementing as soon as we have ideas. That will take a little longer as we go through.</p>
          <p>That is not stopping us from also doing things like in the branch team that I talked about. We are down 200 branches, down 50 this quarter. Round numbers the cost of deposits ratio that we showed you at investor day dropped 260 basis points which we thinks leads the industry by a lot. That includes the FDIC expense, the whole nine yards in there. So as you think about continuing on the core aspects we do on costs, the other benefits will come through a little slower as the bad assets get better and the work gets done in the program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I very much appreciate that, Brian. On the mortgage servicing side, it's a whole lot of people and I think we get that, but in general, I think we saw through J.P. Morgan's results and I'm expecting through others, in general, the cost of servicing mortgages is still going through the moon on a run rate basis. Is that thought process included in your cost <mark type="ph" /> savings (42:27) second half of '12, and does that have anything to do with the MSR on where you mark the MSR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the valuation of the MSR for the last couple quarters has been a charge to increase servicing costs which decreases your cash flow, Glenn, and that's embedded in that valuation. We're carrying 92 basis points or so which is a conservative value, we believe, but embedded in that in the performance in that last couple quarters has been roughly $0.5 billion each quarter or $450 million or so each quarter for that. So in that, we have to price through to the Street, for lack of better term, because the increased amount of work you have to do to service a mortgage loan, ultimately, you have to get paid for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. All right, last one. On reps and warranties, I think following the partial settlement with the GSEs, I and others might have thought with $5 billion plus in reserves, we might see a leveling off on the provision. But another $1 billion with over half going to the GSEs, I'm assuming that's for the Fannie stuff that wasn't settled. And just curious on how you think about that as a, you know, an annoying run rate that's with us for a few more quarters or you feel like what percent of the pipe are you through now on the GSEs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chuck?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Glenn, there's a couple dynamics going on here. We saw a slowdown in new repurchase requests from the GSEs in the fourth quarter, as you might imagine, as they were going through the settlement process, so there's been a bit of a backlog that built up by them in the fourth quarter that I think we saw hit us in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>They also seem to be devoting more time to submitting claims and less time to resolving claims, which has tended to create a bit of an elevated level at the end of the first quarter. So there's a bit of that going on. A substantial portion, though, of that &#x2013; of the provision associated with the GSEs is related to HPI deterioration, which was kind of funny. Most of that &#x2013; I should say most of the submissions I have been referring to, were Fannie rather than Freddie.</p>
          <p>And in terms of where we are on the overall pipeline we said last quarter we were at 70 to 75, I would say, in terms of being all the way through with respect to GSEs. My guess is we're probably at the high end of that range now.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>And we'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look at the mortgage the way it hits in the first quarter, are there any estimates of what the impact will be from Wednesday's regulatory enforcement actions that were announced in terms of whether it's valuing the MSR or just higher foreclosure costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Think about that order as being announced on Wednesday but actually the work took place in October, November, December. The assessments and the supervisory works we've implemented and that's why we have been adding people. The single point of contact, the requirements on the signing of affidavits in the foreclosure process, that's been embedded in our run rate as we have been building up. And so that did impact in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter, the valuation of the MSR because we already were getting ahead and these were things that we identified in the work that we did in self-assessment and the regulators identified other improvements. So the run rate aspect that will have some elements to it, but a lot of it is in the system as we speak today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so outside of potential penalties for you and all the other banks as part of this, you don't expect material costs related to the enforcement actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; outside significant penalties is the question and then remember, this is a bank regulatory environment and we will have to make assessment as we get to the other people, if we get there, what other servicing requirements they may put on, but the core of what the bank regulatory requirements do, the look back and the other things are fairly consistent in our dialogues. But we'll see in terms of run rate costs based on that but from a standpoint of the bank regulators, the piece left open is the CMP question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the separately but still staying on the mortgage topic here, you know, as we think about the sensitivity of some of these mortgage hits outside of credit to HPI declines, you know, how much sensitivity is there, for example, if HPI is 5% worse than expected? What do you think that would mean to the mortgage put-back hits and the litigation hits and some of the other moving pieces?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, HPI is going to impact us in several areas. One of them being the PCI, Purchased Credit-Impaired, it will impact us in terms of reps and warranties and then it also impacts us on the credit side with our residential mortgages that are 180 days past due. You know, it really is difficult to do it on the purchased credit-impaired because as you know, it's a fair value of a life alone and it not only requires what's going to happen to HPI this year, but also assumptions about how long a recovery takes. But if you get a shock this year of roughly 4% over all those portfolios I just mentioned, it would be probably about $1.5 billion. But again, it assumes on purchased credit-impaired that you got the shock of 4% this year with a gradual increase in home prices over several years, but again, not returning to a 4% increase in home prices until well into the second half of the decade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about for the other buckets, like the mortgage repurchases and litigation, how much sensitivity is there to those areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was in there as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just separately, the last thing, as we look at the net interest margin for the second quarter, I think the guidance in March had been you'd bottom out around 2.5%. Obviously, 1Q came in a lot better than that. Just wondering what the outlook is on the NIM percent and net interest income dollars for Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, we think it's-- we obviously think that the second quarter will be down. Not clear that we're going to go down another 17 basis points to 2.50. We did have, frankly, better performance in the first quarter than we expected.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>And we'll go next to the site of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. Couple follow-ups on the Assured: I wanted to understand, you know, how much of the Assured relationship that you have has been settled at this point? I mean, you mentioned first and second liens were in this discussion, but it looked to me like maybe you only settled on the 21 deals that were first liens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, we have basically resolved virtually all of the controversies between our various companies and Assured, and that's contemplated in this settlement. Probably the only thing that is not contemplated would be those instances in which Bank of America or Countrywide or one of its affiliates might have sold a loan to another institution that then securitized that in a package of mortgages and then sold them to &#x2013; then had them wrapped by Assured. So the way that transaction would occur, Assured would actually go to that third party and Assured potential reps and warranty claim and then that third party, in turn, can come back to us. That aggregate exposure in terms of mortgages is about $1.5 billion. That was not addressed in this. Nor have we really had much, if anything, in the way of claims asserted in that regard. But beyond that, we and Assured are basically done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is the &#x2013; do I interpret, therefore, that in your settlement there's very little exposure, or there's very little claims that you're making good on with regard to the seconds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. With respect to the seconds, we're done. We had provided almost $1.1 billion as of the end of December relating to second lien exposure and we settled at basically what we had reserved for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as we look towards the remaining claims that are outstanding, you indicated $7 billion to $10 billion is still your figure. On a total basis, if we look at 4Q plus 1Q, the exposure would be higher by about $1.6 billion, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the way to think about that, Betsy, is that we have reassessed what the overall exposures to the non-GSEs. You would expect with a settlement and with additional accruals that that $7 billion to $10 billion would go down. That has largely offset by HPI deterioration.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks. Two questions, the first is, you had good reduction in the loss rate on the credit card business, but I think what's interesting is the industry as a whole is kind of moving faster into lower levels. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the pattern is going to be there over the course of the next several quarters?</p>

          <p>Yeah, credit card specifically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a high level, the team can address the specifics, but from a high level, remember that we were higher than they were and so we're coming down at a good rate. I think we got 200 basis points or more above our peers. We got it to a 14% charge-off rate. So yeah, we have more upside as this keeps coming down. The underwriting we did started changing in 2008 has outperformed in a not as good economic scenario three years later and if you look at our emergence curves and stuff, we are getting strong performance in a lot of our 2008, clearly 2009, 2010, and so I think we have more room to go to improve, frankly, because we had a deeper hole, frankly. I will let Neil or Chuck fill in the exact reasons, but in a broad spirit it is that we were dealing with this issue. We just had a higher number to start from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian summed it up best. Ours went bad first. We tightened the buy box and also came down very fast. Our early stage delinquencies during the quarter continued to improve nicely and we will see continued improvement going forward, but it will be at a slower pace. If you look back over the past four, five quarters, our improvement has been dramatic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you think about it in a broad context, we're high 7s now, and we should look to that to we can hit a target of 5, 5.5 and frankly, the performance of the portfolio we've been putting on in time periods I talked about has actually outperformed that. This should be a continuous move. You know this was $13 billion in a single quarter at one point. We have still got some room to improve, but it's come down dramatically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Kind of on a separate issue. You talked a little bit about the capital generation and the deferred tax asset disallowance in the quarter kind of, you know, keeping that lower than normal, but even absent that, you know, it feels like given the level of earnings, we really would like to see that pace pick up if you are really going to get to that 8%, 8% level in you know, something less than two years. So could you talk a little bit about what plans you have over and above, what you know, the kind of run rate of earnings? It seems like there would need to be somewhat more and related to that, any thoughts you might have on the SIFI [Systemically Important Financial Institutions] buffers that might be assessed on you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the balance sheet that we showed you from last year first quarter, this year first quarter, you can see the RWA coming down, but you have to remember as you think about our company, the issues that we had to face is our Basel 2 implementation is still in process and we had to get this all to work right and that's one of the reasons why we have been pushing your expectations out as to when will this be ready to go to later this year or next year was that we needed to get some work done and part of that work is to continue to optimize the RWA calculation, the risk models and other things that will bring down RWA dramatically in our trading areas and that requires the systems work that's been going in and will continue going during the course of this year and the team working on that.</p>
          <p>That is a major piece of the equation and then there's a lot of other pieces of the equation. If you look at all the legacy assets sold and the private equity business being brought down and so we're continuing to do that each quarter. We have a roadmap and it requires us to keep executing very well and then the earnings generation, remember, what is affecting the earnings is actually reductions in risk of a significant amount in terms of repurchase or even '03 portfolios and things like that. You've got to think of this a little bit in terms of timing. Stuff we're pulling forward and taking now would have been stuff that we would have taken over time, so that helps us out.</p>
          <p>It really comes down to that a lot of this is around the optimization of balance sheet. If you think about us, we run about 65% of RWA to assets today. Our U.S. peers that are on Basel 2 and been optimizing on the risk models and stuff are in the 50s and our outside the United States peers have been on it for a long time are in the 30s. There's a lot of work for us to do and that work is going on this year and that's one of the bridges we have to have completed as we look to do the capital management we would like to do for you as shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the SIFI, any thoughts as to how and when we are going to hear about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When ought to be over the course of the summer here. We've obviously, by using an 8% target, we've sort of said it's going to be something. I think fundamentally, I think I would go back to what we told you late last fall, those of you that saw it at our conference where I talked about this. We will store that capital on the balance sheet, so if it's 100 basis points, it's $18 billion or $1.80 a share. If it's higher than that, you can do the math. We will store that capital on balance sheet and it will be embedded in tangible book value. You can't put it to work because if you do then you have to need more and so if it's a higher number we will have to store more capital but we will let that play out.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the broad policy, I think we have enough risk-based capital in this company and even more than we need, and I think we will continue to work on our discussions in the broader policymakers about what the, quote, "Right answer," is, but in effect, we've sort of accounted for 100 basis points and if it's higher we will be storing the capital, but it's all yours. That's where we've been trying to be clear to you, it's not going anywhere. It's not doing anything. It's not making acquisitions. It's not being put in the business. It's all there and the good thing is even if it is a higher number, what we haven't talked to you a lot about is from &#x2013; we're trying to hit that 8%, you know, our math gets us there at the end of next year.</p>
          <p>So, in essence, if Basel 3 is fully implemented. If you think about a higher level, you really have five, six, seven years to put it in, but importantly what is not apparent to a lot of people is that the amount of optimization that we actually have in latter years is still high because there are certain structured credit trades and certain runoff portfolio still stands about half its balance after a couple years and that will provide additional positive momentum, none of which is core to our business. So we have a roadmap even '13, '14, '15 that there's significant RWA optimization available to us, largely if we can be there in a sense that these structured credit trades that are going to run off and other assets will run off. I think if it goes a little higher, we have other optimization and I think in terms of the shareholder view of that, I think we would manage into it over time, be clear with you how we're building toward it, but we have got the risk capital to run this company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. In terms of the $1.6 billion settlement with Assured, could you just walk me through how that runs through the income statement? I'm looking at page 21, and looking at the repurchase reserve, and I guess it's not clear to me how that is either coming out of the reserve or going through the income statement in some other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, think of this in two elements. We had provided right around $1.1 billion, $1.05 billion for second lien exposure, so that was in our reserve as of the end of December. We will make a payment of approximately $1.1 billion in the second quarter and beyond in order to satisfy that so that $1.1 billion reserve is in &#x2013; was in the $5.4 billion ending balance of the rep and warranty liability and is in the $6.2 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay, so it's going to be netted against the $6.2 billion next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We haven't &#x2013; we did not make the payments as of March 31st. We signed the agreement yesterday with Assured. We will begin making payments coincident with the signing of that agreement and into the future. So that's one element of it.</p>
          <p>We also entered into a reinsurance arrangement with respect to the first lien mortgages. Principally because there's very little experience associated with that. We had some modest reserves set aside for that, for a portion of that, but there's very little experience. Assured has put back to us a relatively small number of those mortgages and so rather than pay for them for something that may never happen, we thought it was more prudent to enter into a reinsurance arrangement where we've taken a view, as they have, with respect to how those drawdowns will occur and how we might participate in those, and we estimated the cost of that reinsurance arrangement as we've said at about $500 million, and that's &#x2013; that was accrued as a part of our consideration of the first quarter rep and warranty liability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then, you know, maybe Brian can put context around this secondary question. I mean, you mentioned that you feel like you're at sort of a core pre-tax pre-provision run rate of about $10 billion and as I go through your non-recurring items, we get pretty close to that number as well, and then I sort of think about looking forward, you know, this was a reasonably good trading quarter. You're going to have some net interest margin pressure, you know, at least in the second quarter and maybe lower net interest income, and then we at least get, you know, about a $500 million or maybe more a quarter hit from the implementation of the Durbin amendment, although, obviously that could get delayed but at this point, I guess we'll see. That sort of brings me down to no more than an annualized run rate of about $38 billion, 9.5 times 4. So it strikes me as a challenge and maybe you can walk me through, you know, in some of the bigger items of how you think you're going to get to a $45 billion to $50 billion pre-tax pro-provision run rate because sort of the middle that range is about a 25% increase from $38 billion. So I'm just maybe looking at context around that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think you got to make sure your timeframe's rate. We said that was beyond the '11, '12 timeframe out there and so think about what would happen between now and then. You would have mortgage costs come down. You'd have the interest rate environment change. So we may do better next quarter, as Chuck said. We're at 2.67 on the margin. We told you it might bottom at 2.50. We may do better mathematically and the numbers would be higher. But if rates rise and I assume at some point the core estimates, the market, our core estimates, rates rise up to modest, you know, fed funds rate of couple percentage points, that is hugely beneficial to our company and ought to push us back up to 275 and higher in the margin. If you start to do the math on our size balance sheet, that's significant.</p>
          <p>So the cost structure comes down and that happens and then on top of that, while we had a reasonably good trading quarter, 4.5 million, that is the run rate that Tom needs to produce on a quarterly basis. If you look at how we're getting that now, it's all core customer driven business that is coming through, coming through. Last year's elevated levels and last year's decline levels have more to do with circumstances outside of the control but that's that.</p>
          <p>Then if you go to the other core businesses, remember, the economy grows, we have had no loan growth, we're continuing to run them down. The runoff portfolio which cost us $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion this quarter, half that number out there. So it's really continued credit costs, continued cost structure improvement. It's really the interest rate environment not going crazy, but just improving a little bit which really helps the core deposit business and then grinding on the growth of the franchise that we see in the revenue line based on the fees and other factors and so the restructuring of consumer deposit accounts which will be effective this year and the next year, you'll see &#x2013; and as we said, you know, the expenses are unavoidable on the mortgage side now, but we'll get those out and we'll work on the rest of it.</p>
          <p>I think it's around rates, expenses and then the economy. If you said economy is going to go into decline, that's a different question. Assume the economy gets up to a trend growth of 3%, 3.5% type of numbers and you will see the general earnings of the company lift because of loans and other things.</p>

          <p>We have not said on the Basel 3 level, but as Basel 2.5 becomes effective, we would be above 8% under those standards at that point, I think is what we said earlier, but we have not sort of given you pro-formas and we'll continue to look at doing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Brian, is there any comment you can make regarding the dividend, the Fed process? Any specific areas where they were looking for more clarity, where they wanted to see things get clearer before saying yes to your dividend increase request?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't ask them for an increase until the latter part of this year because we knew we had to get the work done I mentioned earlier around continued &#x2013; get the systems integrated, the risk management down and frankly, taking care of some of the issues like we took care of this morning and the clarity there and so we continue to make progress in that. That leads to &#x2013; that's really &#x2013; the core issue is just getting a lot of &#x2013; getting the work done that we promised them to do in the context of implementing the risk management standards in the company. They have been agreement with us, our work plans all the way along, and it's their process and how we can resubmit and stuff is up to them. But on the other hand, I would tell you that we have a clear path that we know what we need to get done and we're doing the work and that's why we knew we had no chance and told you back in January we're not going to ask for anything in the first part of this year because we knew we had to get this work done and they knew we had to get this work done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and the last thing here, just could you explain again -- you might have said it -- that the greater disallowance of the DTA in your regulatory capital ratios -- what drove that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we acquired Merrill Lynch, the regulators gave us a two-year look-forward period. Excuse me; three-year look forward period. Last year, it was two years and now it's one year in terms of the amount of, in effect, allowable DTA that we can include in our regulatory capital calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So don't make the same mistake I keep making, if you think we're making it, this has nothing to do with the tax position. This is purely what you can count in regulatory capital and they went back to this &#x2013; during the height of crisis, remember, they widened the standard because the reality of earning streams and now we have gone back to the pre-crisis standard, but the actual tax position is a separate question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which is one year. We're not losing any deferred tax benefits as an enterprise. It's what you can count in the regulatory capital calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, carry-forward from the merger carrying forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This was all contemplated in all the tests and everything we had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, no &#x2013; you don't see risk of this happening again. It's kind of done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're down to the one-year look-forward period which is the more traditional one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Can I ask one more quick thing? On the expenses, Brian, do you have a longer-term target? Is that something that you eventually think you will talk about, whether a $75 billion expense base or a $70 billion or $65 billion is, you know, kind of the right number for the company? You baked something into the investor day when you talked about $45 billion to $50 billion like pre-provision earnings. Is that &#x2013; as you go through this expense initiative and efficiency, you will talk a little bit about what you think the right expense number is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we gave you an efficiency ratio target of getting back down to 55%, and you can see across the quarters that the efficiency ratio is bouncing all over the place right now, 58% second quarter. 100, I think, the third quarter, 92, 75, but this is because of the one times in and out. Remember, we're getting hits to revenue on these rep and warranties. These are actually revenue offsets, not expense, but the goal is, we can see that that just doubles and that pushes you down into the 60s and with all the work we're doing over the next couple years we push down to 55. We expect those efficiency ratios to get &#x2013; you've got to be aware that as revenues rise, we want to deploy the expenses to continue to build this franchise and we want to make sure we're matching the chances on our international capability, the chances to grow small business bankers, the chance to grow more financial advisors to serve clients. We do not want to cut back on that while we're taking expenses out of places that need to have them taken out of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll go next to the site of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few clarifications. So what did HPI do over the quarter, what had you expected and what do you expect going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, as far as HPI going forward, you know, we expect gradual improvement over the second half of the year, further deterioration next quarter, but not dramatic, but gradual improvement over the balance of the year is where we're at. As far as the deterioration in the first quarter, you know, it's on a three-month lag, but off the top of my head, I want to say that we had 1.5% for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, that's what it went down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you had expected, I guess, to be stable or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mentioned a three-month lag so we had some catch-up because of the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as it relates to the dividend, I'm still not crystal clear on exactly what happened. You said all along you didn't expect a dividend increase until late this year. You go ahead and submit a capital plan with the dividend increase and then the Federal Reserve comes back and says you're denied. I guess I just don't understand the procedure aspect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the procedure aspect I have to leave to the people who &#x2013; you know, the Federal Reserve designed the process. But we asked them and you know, I think the idea that approving something six months in advance of when we have done the work we need to do, I think that's what they basically said, keep doing the work and go on. That's why I think it's a little bit hard to explain, but in our dialogues with them, the idea was to get the work done and then we'd get the approval if we get the work done right and continue to improve the company's prospects during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>The process they designed and the answer they gave us was what we disclosed, but I think the theme of it from my dialogues with the team and they have been with us all way is to get the work done and then we'll be ready to get approved, but they weren't going to approve it in advance of that working being done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you can still get your dividend increase by the year end? What -- I mean --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know what the process will be for resubmission, but when we figure that out, we can tell you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would you say there's still a chance for a dividend increase by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We should pull back, Mike, and make sure. I said we got to get the process down with the Fed. But if you step back, what we've tried to make clear to you guys is that for '11 and '12, this is a modest dividend idea because we have to get to that 8% Basel 3 Tier 1 common level, which requires to us to maintain most of the capital, and then after that, we're in a position to start returning the capital. But all the capital we accumulate is in our tangible book value and is on the balance sheet and it's going for the benefit of the shareholder. We're not using it to do anything else. I think whether we get the dividend in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, first quarter, whatever, next year, this year &#x2013; I think what we're trying to be clear to you is that we're doing the work we need to do, we have been repositioning this company and improving it. And as soon as we and the regulators and the process is set, we will let you know where we stand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Last follow-up on that, but you will resubmit a capital plan that would at least propose a dividend increase by the end of the year? The question is whether or not it would get approved</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The capital plans &#x2013; look, we have all the submissions in it for two careers and we will resubmit that when the process allows to you do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, then separately, as far as the peace dividend, you said several times over the call, in a couple years, in a couple years. You have a new process in place to take a look at expenses. I'm just wondering if we will see a little bit more of the efficiency pickup over the next couple of quarters? I know a lot of it is dependent on credit, but aside from credit, you know, what confidence can you give us that you have an eye on expenses quarter after quarter, even after acknowledging the international, small business, FA investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's take a look at the head count across the last few quarters. This quarter on a period to period, we're 0.3% change on 288,000 people. If you look at that, it's 700 total human beings. 2,700 adds in the home loan investment to work on the &#x2013; that we geared up during the quarter to continue to work on that. 2,000 down the rest of the company including net of all the investments we made. We're managing the heads down in the places.</p>
          <p>Barbara, as we talked about earlier, just announced on the production side of the mortgage company that we're down 3,500 people. 2,000 contractors and obviously we will take the contractors first. So as you think about we're managing these expenses down as we speak. But running through the expense lines are litigation expense and other things which throw it off on a given quarter $1 billion, round numbers and some of those items this quarter, and those will come down, you know, quickly, once we sort of get through some of this stuff. The head count we're bringing down, which is the number one thing we can control and drive to while we're making investments</p>
          <p>We added many small business bankers, 200 FAs and things like that in the same quarter where overall heads were flattish and we added 2,700 people. So we're working on it every day.</p>
          <p>We're not waiting for the white smoke to rise from this process and we continue to drive at it. The 50 branch closings in the quarter, 2.60 on the all-in costs of all the call centers, all the online deposits. I would challenge you to ask anybody in the industry if they're close to that. I was talking to somebody who told me they were at 4.25, 4.5 and it's a thing to scale in this business, but we keep driving at that, that's down 4 basis points. Everywhere we can, we continue to work on expenses. What we're now allowing for is a process that will help us accelerate that.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a couple of questions just on trading. Tom Montag talked about being down 15 to 20 at the investor day. You can give a little more color as to what happened in March that you have done a little bit more than that? Which categories changed?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on IB, it seems like your market share and volumes have moved up faster than fees. It seems there were a couple of big deals that you got into and can you talk about what's going on in fees in that respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say as you think about it, you know, 15, 20%, down that Tom talked about off the $8 billion, obviously it was still in the quarter and you had to see what took place in March and there has been some stuff in and out. But on the other hand, also as we went through March, the DVA and other things which were fairly significant, would have been taken the last month of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, if you think about from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we doubled the fixed income revenue and the equity revenue I think went up by 40%, 50%, 60%. So he had a reasonable rebound. When you go to investment banking fees, I only count what people pay us. So the league tables are having had that group for a couple years. I talked about when somebody pays us, I know I've got cash. That's the interesting part of the business. I think we did about $1.5 billion, steady with the fourth quarter of last year which had some good activity and up from $1.2 billion last year first quarter and we continue to have a strong and robust pipeline and as you've seen some of the offerings going out on the comm, IPOs and things like that and we expect us to continue to improve those fees. But we got $1.5 billion in fees and every quarter for the last eight or nine we have been second based on fees received and we expect that &#x2013; my guess is that will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the trading side, Brian, if you break that down a little bit by product, prior products versus rates, FX services, securitized, can you give us some color as to how you did on that year on year, linked quarter and in terms of March, what got weaker, which category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll get Lee or Kevin to fill some of that in for you, but in broad stance, places where we need to make improvements in the commodity business, that's one of the differences between us and some of our peers, but on the other hand, you know, we've done a good job in the rates and currencies and other areas, so it's really one of the big differences between just gross dollar amount between us and others is our commodity business is just smaller and not performing so well, you know, Lee can fill you in on some of the details but overall, that's one of the big easy identifiable differences.</p>
