          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the BAT Results Conference Call. My name is Louise (00.08); I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>And now handing over to Ralph Edmondson to begin today's conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I am Ralph Edmondson, Head of Investor Relations, and welcome to British American Tobacco's Nine Months Results call. With me today are Paul Adams, Chief Executive and Ben Stevens, Finance Director.</p>
          <p>In a few moments, Paul and Ben will give an overview of the results. On our website, www.bat.com, you'll find the slides of the company's presentation, together with the earnings announcement released earlier today. After the presentation there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions. The conference call operator will give you the instructions on how to ask those questions.</p>
          <p>A particularly warm welcome to those listening in South Africa. Earlier this week British American Tobacco shares began trading on the JSE.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Paul, a word or two on some changes in 2009. In line with most UK companies, we'll be moving to interim management statements at the quarter one and quarter three stages, rather than producing a full revenue statement. The interim management statement will contain information about the performance of the global dry brands as well as regional volumes and trends in market share.</p>
          <p>We will, of course, continue to publish full income, balance sheet and cash flow information at the full year and interim stages. Also with affect from January, we will report on the Europe businesses, through two separate regions, Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>As a reporting entity, America-Pacific will disappear and Canada will join the new Americas region, which also includes Latin America and the Caribbean markets.</p>
          <p>Japan will report into Asia-Pacific. We will of course restate the 2008 results on the basis of the new regional structure when we publish the preliminary results on 26th February 2009.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Paul and Ben who'll take you through the results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>Let's first look at the headlines and then some of the detail behind them. 2008 has been an extraordinary year. The financial markets have been in turmoil. Economies have slowed; indeed some are slipping into recession. And confidence in the short-term has been shaken.</p>
          <p>Despite these conditions, 2008 is shaping up to be a very good year for British American Tobacco and quite possibly a vintage year.</p>
          <p>Looking at our key metrics, volume, revenue, profit and earnings, they are all strongly positive helped by favorable currency.</p>
          <p>We have also completed two acquisitions which are both on track in terms of integration and meeting financial targets.</p>
          <p>But perhaps more importantly, our global dry brands have strong momentum and our premium volume growth, at 7%, has been outstanding.</p>
          <p>The headline volume growth includes three months of Skandinavisk Tobacco and Tekel. The organic volume growth is 1.2% ahead, with global dry brands up 17% or 13% excluding brand migrations.</p>
          <p>This is well above our long-term target of high single figure global dry brand growth. Each of the dry brands contributed to this growth, with Pall Mall up 25%, Kent up 21%, Lucky Strike up 9% and Dunhill 5% ahead.</p>
          <p>This growth is a result of continued investment in the brands. The rollout into new markets, our unrivalled innovation pipeline, and migrations. A vibrant brand portfolio, with real momentum puts us in a far better position to face the uncertainties out there.</p>
          <p>Reported revenue, up 19%, reflects favorable exchange, improved pricing, a better product mix and the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Similarly, profit from operations, excluding exceptional charges was 20% higher. Excluding exchange in the acquisitions, revenue would have been 6% higher and profit would have risen 7%.</p>
          <p>Associates do not include Skandinavisk in the third quarter. The Reynolds American contribution at &#xA3;225 million, excluding exceptionals, was &#xA3;5 million ahead at current rates, while ITC was 8% ahead at current rates of exchange.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings per share was strongly ahead, up 17% at &#xA3;0.96, and Ben will take you through the drivers behind this increase later.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at revenue and profit on a region-by-region basis. Volumes were mixed across the group, with both Latin America and America Pacific reporting declines.</p>
          <p>In Latin America volume declines in Mexico and Venezuela offset good performances elsewhere, notably from Brazil and Chile. The ongoing industry declines in Canada and Japan contributed to the 3% fall in volume in the AmPac region.</p>
          <p>In all regions there was a positive price and mix evidenced by the 8.6% rise in revenue at constant rates of exchange, on the back of a 3.9% increase in volume.</p>
          <p>At current rates of exchange there is strong revenue growth across all regions. Although and Europe and Africa and the Middle East benefited from the Skandinavisk and Tekel acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Now looking at profit on the same basis, the Skandinavisk acquisition, favorable pricing, improved mix and exchange rates, resulted in a strong performance from Europe, with Russia, Romania, Spain and Germany in particular performing well. Good performances from a number of countries in Asia-Pacific helped the region post strong profit gains both in current and constant terms.</p>
          <p>In Latin America profit rose 6% at current rates of exchange, but at constant rates was 7% lower, due to Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico. Remember that Brazil last year had very strong profit growth due to price increases taken in anticipation of an excise increase. Venezuela experienced high excise driven price increases in Q4 last year, and Mexico was affected by reduced market share and volumes.</p>
          <p>Africa and the Middle East improved profit both in current and constant terms despite the weakening of the South African rand. The region's very good volume growth was driven by Nigeria, Egypt and the GCC and the addition of the Tekel volumes.</p>
          <p>Despite the reduction in volumes in America-Pacific, the region posted profit gains, aided by positive exchange and pricing.</p>
          <p>Ben's now going to take you through the drivers behind the 17% increase in adjusted earnings per share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul and good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>As Paul has just outlined the strong profit performance at constant rates of exchange was a key driver behind earnings growth. There are a number of adjustments to EPS, which are described on page 18 of the announcement, which net out to &#xA3;22 million.</p>
          <p>Profit performance contributed 6% growth to the EPS, and the acquisition of ST and Tekel, after financing cost, were marginally accretive during the third quarter. Our strong cash flow contributed to a reduction in non-acquisition net finance costs at constant rates of exchange, leading to an increase in EPS of 1%.</p>
          <p>Associates were marginally positive. ITC continued its strong profit growth and its contribution rose 5% to &#xA3;81 million at constant rates. After adjusting for certain exceptional items, the Reynolds American's contribution at &#xA3;220 million was the same as last year, at constant rates of exchange. ST ceased to be an associate at the half year.</p>
          <p>The underlying tax rate at 30.4%, is 0.6% higher than the equivalent '07 tax rate. This is a result of a one-off deferred tax credit in Germany in 2007, not being repeated in 2008. This is partially offset by a reduction of the national tax rates in a number of countries including South Africa, Canada, Malaysia and Germany.</p>
          <p>The minorities charge is slightly higher, due to the good performance from Malaysia.</p>
          <p>During the nine months, 17 million shares were bought back and the adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation is based on 2009 million shares.</p>
          <p>Finally, the favorable exchange accounted for 9 of the 17% rise in adjusted earnings per share.</p>
          <p>In summary, the adjusted EPS reflects an excellent performance driven by the underlying strength of the business enhanced by favorable exchange.</p>
          <p>Thank you and at that point, we will ask the operator to explain the questions and answers process.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Adam Spielman from Citigroup. Go ahead, Adam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you very much. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Adam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask you a couple of questions, please. First of all, are you able to say the actual profit contribution from Tekel and separately from ST, so we can back that out?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I know obviously a lot of people are asking us, can you give us some sort of indication of the split in terms of profit into East and West? I know that's a little bit ahead of time, you're giving us more details in the future, but that will be very helpful now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Adam. Yeah, its Ben here. What we said is that excluding the Tekel and ST, the trends will be very much the same as last year. So, at constant rates, the reported revenue for the third quarter was up 9%, probably 6% excluding acquisitions; and profit up 10%, probably 7% excluding acquisitions.</p>
          <p>But it's getting more difficult to exclude ST and Tekel from the results, because we're actually integrating the businesses as we speak. So that there is the same products flowing through our distribution channels, it won't long before we're making our brands in their factories and their brands in our factories.</p>
          <p>At the full year we'll publish a pro forma P&amp;L account for ST and Tekel, but after that it's going to be extremely difficult to split out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, on the split of East and West, yes, you're right, we don't want to split out East and West until we start splitting out East and West, which will be in January. But to try and give you some flavor. Eastern Europe was a driver of the growth in Europe overall. Volume is up in Eastern Europe, about 4%, and net turnover and profit both grew very strongly.</p>
          <p>So, a lot of the growth driver for Europe as a whole, the numbers are that you're seeing was principally driven by Eastern Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist from JPMorgan. Go ahead, Erik.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Erik.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us a little more color then on how the integration is are proceeding, particularly with respect to Turkey and the prospects for stabilizing those brands and moving that forward? It's quite encouraging to hear that you are well on the way to integration, but if you could give us more detail that would be helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The integration of both acquisitions are going very well and we're pleased. And I would say that in Turkey the integration is going exceptionally well and better than our expectations. We've got the factories up and running, at good efficiencies now. They're producing well and producing good quality product. We've got the people that we need and they're being, obviously, trained in the BAT way of doing things, and that's paying off in terms of the quality and the efficiency.</p>
          <p>In terms of integrating the distribution, we have moved the Tekel volume, or are in the process of moving the Tekel volume into our direct store distribution system, in the cities where we do it. And we have rationalized and integrated the two volumes into a smaller and better group of distributors.</p>
          <p>So the distribution is going much better. And we are able, therefore, to address some of the problems that the Tekel brands had at retail, in terms out-of-stocks and shelf presence.</p>
          <p>And so on those two bases, the integration's going well. Indeed our global dry brands, if you like the BAT brands before the acquisition, are doing very well. In fact we're over 10% share now on those brands, up from about 7.5% 12 months ago. So the BAT brands are doing very, very well.</p>
          <p>In terms of slowing the decline of the Tekel brands, and as you know in our acquisition plan we assumed that those brands would continue to decline, but we will try and slow that decline. Plans are in place, and I've seen them, as to how we might address that. But obviously I wouldn't want to go into too much detail around what and when.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Terrific. And is part of the reason why the BAT brands have been taking share, is that a shift toward premium within the Turkish market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There is a shift towards premium and the Turkish market. One of a number of markets where the premium segment is still growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with respect to the group and spending back behind the brands. Am I correct in remembering that there was an increased spend anticipated for the second half? And can you confirm that that happened, and so that these results are incorporating even a higher spend back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we will be spending more on marketing this year. And relative to last year, our spend as a proportion of the year is slightly less than it was this year, year-to-date. So our spend is going up and our proportion of spend is slightly less this year, for the first nine months, than it was last year. So there has been no reduction in firepower, to the contrary that has been an increase in firepower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eileen Khoo from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead Eileen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Eileen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Morning. Two questions please. The first on Turkey. Does the news that talking about raising taxes on tobacco again, is this much of a concern at all for that market? And also in general, can you talk about any other excise tax increases that might be coming up or any risk of that happening?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on Canada. Could you comment on the prospect of competing against PMI going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OK. Excise, yeah. I mean, I don't think there is any heightened concern around excise. There's nothing out there that is particularly worrying us. As you know as excise shocks that bother us, and it's very difficult to predict excise shocks.</p>
          <p>So I'm not sensing any concern around the patch in terms of excise increases. Obviously it's a risk, as governments become fiscally challenged they will look to increase excises at a more accelerated rate. But we haven't seen that yet.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, yeah, there is talk of an excise increase in Turkey. But we'll wait to see whether that materializes and, as I've explained, we have very good momentum in Turkey, so we'll handle that if and when it comes.</p>
          <p>As far as PMI in Canada is concerned, as you know they've already taken a price increase on the lower priced brands in Canada, which was obviously a pleasing move to see. And we will continue to compete and do what we need to do in Canada. So I am not majorly concerned about PMI taking over RBH in Canada.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead Jon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Couple of things. One, first of all, specific on Russia. Got wind that you're thinking of changing your distribution arrangements in Russia soon. I'm just wondering what's behind that and whether we're likely to see any impact of that in terms of strange shipment or volume patterns in the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And then a more general one.</p>
          <p>I mean if this has a chance of being a vintage year, are you planning around 2009 being perhaps more of a table wine year?</p>
          <p>And I know we haven't seen it yet in the third quarter, but are there any signs at the start of the fourth that things have got noticeably more difficult? Are you seeing your distributors cutting down inventories, things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's talk about Russia. No, there are the, there was review of our distribution arrangements in Russia, but we're staying where we are. We're pleased with our distributor and things are going very well indeed for us in Russia, so there are no plans to change.</p>
          <p>In terms of vintage to table wine, I supposed that is the key question. Undoubtedly, you can't be, you can't ignore the fact that there is an economic and therefore consumer downturn going on. And it would be foolish to ignore the fact that that may well have an impact.</p>
          <p>At the moment we're not seeing that impact and it's difficult to predict what that impact may have, if any, in terms of our business. We have very good momentum on the business in terms of the global dry brands and in terms of our premium volume growth. Premium segment is still growing in a number of important markets for us, such as Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Romania, Russia.</p>
          <p>So premium segment is still growing. So as regards next year, we're not seeing anything in terms of distributors and not really seeing anything as far, in terms of the consumer so far. And so we're not particularly worried but we recognize the risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Davidson from Blue Oar Securities. Go ahead, Bruce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's just a detailed question on the financing. I notice in the notes that the facility taken out in February expires tomorrow. I just wondered what your plans and thoughts were about refinancing and rolling debt over?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're pretty strong on liquidity, at the moment we got a 1.75 billion revolving credit facility which is undrawn. In terms of being able to dip into the bond markets, we'll do them, but not at the rates we see at the moment, I think.</p>
          <p>So we have no need to go into the bond markets at the moment. We've got a very strong position in terms of cash flow this year. We've got a very strong position in terms of our revolving credit facility. So we're not particularly concerned.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, or Hi. Three questions, if I can. Just firstly, on Europe. Obviously, look at the nine months performance, the average sales per unit jumps quite dramatically from the second half, I think 6 to that 9.5, obviously there's STK in there. I just wondered if you can split that out? How much of that jump up in average price in Europe is the STK impact? Or how much of it is just better pricing and mix? And if that is the case, where you seeing that in particular, what are the key drivers?</p>
          <p>The second question was on the premium brand growth of 7%. I don't know if you look at this way, but can you split that out in emerging and developed, I mean is it 140, or is it 77? Just trying to get feel for where that sort of slant is.</p>
          <p>And then the last question, just turning back to the last question we just had about the refinancing. Given the bond market rates etc., the buyback commitment of 400, I think you've only got about forty to go with all the commitments in place, But is that still 400 or do you cut that until we get some clarity as to where exactly these commercial paper type markets get to in terms of availability? Thanks very much</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the buyback, I mean we review the buyback at the end of each year. We've, as you say, got about 40 million to complete this year, which we'll carry on and complete. At the end of the year, we'll take a look at the marginal cost of debt financing. We'll take a look at our EPS estimates. And we'll take a look at what acquisitions write-down horizon, and we'll take a view on the buyback at that stage. So more news at the end of the year, I think.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Europe question, what's driving that growth is principally Eastern Europe and particularly Russia and Romania.</p>
          <p>If you look at Russia, our net turnover in Russia is year-to-date up over 20% and our underlying profit in Russia is up over 80%. We're growing very nicely in Russia, premium brands are up 10% year-to-date and our global dry brands are up, sorry beg your pardon, our premium volume is up 20% year-to-date and our global dry brand volume up just a shade under that, at 18%.</p>
          <p>So Russia is really growing for us and that's helping us in Europe. We took a price increase in the third quarter which has helped drive some of those numbers. So it's Eastern Europe, and broadening that out, it's really the emerging markets which are driving the growth in terms of volume.</p>
          <p>If you cast emerging markets and developed markets aside, our volume was up, around 4% of our overall volume growth year-to-date, emerging markets were up 4.7%, and developed markets were up 0.7%.</p>
          <p>And in terms of profitability, emerging markets were up 16%, 16-17%, and the developed markets were up 26%. So emerging markets growing well for us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Great. And then just to the 7% split. You got that as well, to about 4% total volume growth. The 7% premium growth, is that not dissimilar then?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Two questions please. <mark type="inaudible" /> the good growth of premium cigarettes, but the growth for global dry brands is low, let's say it's from 20% in the first half, to 17% in the nine month period. It's a little bit of a lower brand migration .So any color on this? Or it's more of a normal quarterly fluctuation? So that's my first question.</p>
          <p>And my second one is, could you please comment on the year turnout for central Europe from volume pricing and also your recent market share momentum figure? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>GDB growth, sorry, okay got it. If you look at our GDB growth, you're right, I mean, it slightly slowed in the third quarter. I wouldn't get too excited about that. That really reflects a couple of things.</p>
          <p>Firstly, as you know, what we try to do is to grow our global dry brands by high-single figures, and the third quarter growth was well in excess of that. The other thing to bear in mind is that we're now lapping a lot of the global dry brand activity that we started off this time last year. If you remember, around this time last year we had launched and were rolling out Kent Nanotech, we had launched the Dunhill resealable pack, and we'd just launched Kent Boost.</p>
          <p>So those were very much an engines of growth for us over the last 12 months. But we're now lapping those. And that has slowed our growth. But that was entirely anticipated. So there's nothing macabre in that slightly slowing growth in global dry brands.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Yeah. No, I mean things for us pretty seem stable in central Europe, I have to say. Our market shares in Czech Republic is, our market share is growing; in Hungary, its stable; in Germany slightly softened, but not significantly so. I am not sure of what your definition of central Europe is, but our business is pretty good in central Europe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Just want to get a bit of color I suppose on the isolated Q3 performance. There's organic profit growth at about seven, both for the six months and the nine months. Obviously there was a big swing in LatAm, which is a drag in the first half, and there is a little bit positive in Q3. On that basis it sort of appears as if there've been material slowdowns in the isolated Q3 in various of the other regions, America-Pacific, Africa-Middle East, Europe &#x2013; Europe had a tough comp. Could you maybe go through what's happening in those divisions in Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean it just seems there's a slowdown, and could you just confirm that, or if there's reason why? Maybe go through that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see much of a slowdown in Q3. I mean, if you look at our revenue and profit and adjusted earnings per share in constant, excluding the acquisitions, they're pretty much what they were at the half-year.</p>
          <p>So constant, excluding acquisitions, the numbers are pretty much the same. So we're not seeing much of a slowdown. Yes, there are some ups and downs around the regions. But they net out pretty much as we were at the half-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. For the remainder, America-Pacific seems to gone flat in Q3, the Middle East has gone to like 1% in Q3. Yes. No comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in terms of America-Pacific, sorry, in AME we had, we put some provisions in on for the supply chain difficulties we've had, which would have slowed the profit growth in Africa-Middle East. Canada's trading pretty well, I have to say, in local currency.</p>
          <p>Yes, the profit is down slightly as we said that it would be. Remember that they had abnormally high profits in the first half, or sorry in the first quarter, but those weren't translated into the second quarter or the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So if you're comparing Canada third quarter discreet to the first half, you've lost that first quarter sort of the outperformance. Japan is trading well. We're increasing our share in Japan, our innovations are working well, which is driving that share growth. But the overall Japanese market is down, principally driven by the third quarter last year, where there was a load in the third quarter of last year ahead of an excise increase. So we're tracking against a load last year.</p>
          <p>So you add that all up and there is nothing in trading there that is impacting the third quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And on an accounting point, on the amortization of the new acquisitions, I think its &#xA3;12 million in this quarter. Is that now going to be a recurrent amortization from now on for 20 years?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on the Africa-Middle East region. You've been talking of the good growth of your price mix numbers, but in the Africa and Middle East region I see that there's actually been a decline of about 1%. Maybe if you can just elaborate on that? And then, I see you still refer to Australia where there's some competitor activity. Maybe if you can just give us some feedback on that as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Africa and Middle East. The thing to bear in mind is that the Chesterfield trade mark in South Africa reverted back to the Philip Morris. So we lost 2.5 share points in South Africa as a result of that, compared to this time last year, which obviously affected our volume and revenue in South Africa.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned, we did put some provisions in for the distribution difficulties we're having in Africa and Middle East in that quarter. Both of those would have impacted, but other than that, price mix is pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And at the third quarter, remember you've got Tekel in Africa and Middle East which is why revenue's probably up more than profits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you still referred in the commentary that on the Australian market you still see competitor activity. Now I just want to know if that's eased or what's a situation of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Okay, yeah. There is some discounting going on which we've matched in Australia, which has cost us a little, but it's not escalating and it appears to be easing. So its cost us a little bit, but it's not something that we're overly concerned about.</p>

          <p>Morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of quick ones. First one, Canada. Obviously the industry came to an agreement with the government recently with some sort of payments for the government should they cut down on illicit trade. Have we seen any actions, effective actions from the Canadian Royal Police Force or the Canadian government to try and cut down on illicit trade yet? And also in a sense, same question for Brazil. Is the Brazilian market, how much of that is illicit trade, and is that growing or declining currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You're quite right. We haven't seen any actions yet on behalf of the Canadian government. I think there is increased political receptivity. But something needs to be done which, and obviously we are working hard to bring this to their attention again and get something done.</p>
          <p>But I think this issue is moving up the political agenda in Canada, but as yet nothing has been done. It is a growing problem in Canada. I mean one in three cigarettes sold in Canada now is illicit, and in Ontario and Quebec it's approaching one in two cigarettes are now illicit.</p>
          <p>And as you know the Canadian government very keen to regulate tobacco, and are a world-leader in tobacco regulation, and we keep pointing out to them that one in two of their cigarettes, well half their tobacco industry's not regulated at all in Canada. And that seems to be gaining some traction. But to answer your question, no actions as yet.</p>
          <p>And Brazil, yes the proportion of the Brazilian consumption which is illicit trade continues to come down each year, which has helped Souza Cruz in terms of growing volume and growing share of consumption.</p>
          <p>So the Brazilian share of consumption is now up 1.7%, to something around 63% of total consumption in Brazil, which is good. And that was one of the reasons why we increased direct distribution in Brazil in the fourth quarter of last year, you remember, because we wanted to push further at into the rural areas to pick up that share which was presenting itself.</p>
          <p>So Canada, nothing yet. Brazil continues to be good news.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just secondly on Brazil, just a quick one on the farming. I mean clearly it's been more promise in Argentina really than Brazil. Has there been any sort of impact on the sort of tobacco leaf crop, because of the, well, certainly formerly high prices of other commodities? In other words, has there been a switch of farming within Brazil or does that leaf crop remain very strong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it still remains good and Souza Cruz is able to get the leaf grown that they want to get grown.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking a follow-up. You talked about the increasing macro risks, and I was just wondering is there a rule of thumb that you have in your mind. It goes something like, if the GDP in an emerging market is down 0% or minus two, it doesn't really have a big impact, but if it's, we start to get worried if it's minus 4% or minus 5%.</p>
          <p>Is that, can you just give us some feeling for how bad an economy has to be before it really starts to affect you?</p>
          <p>And as a second, follow-up question, if I may. Could you just give us a feeling for what's happening with your innovations. Whether there's new roll-out of the Boost product? Or whether Nanotech is going into more markets we should be aware of? And any sense of where we are on the whole innovation story? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Adam, as I think I explained at the half year, I mean, we've gone back and we've looked at what happens to our business in previous economic downturns. Principally, we looked at the Asian crisis and the ruble crisis. And it's not really driven by GDP.</p>
          <p>What tends to happen is, if there's an economic pinch consumers will switch where they shop for a brand rather than the brand that they use. So they'll stay with their brands, but they will choose a cheaper retailer. Then if the economic pinch continues, then there may be some slight down trading.</p>
          <p>Now people talk about down trading, but there are many streams of down trading. So you can have down trading from premium to mid-price, but still have up trading from low price to mid.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, you can have, and we've seen this in markets now, I mean, we were looking at the Hungarian figures recently, the premium segment is growing in Hungary. What's happening is that people are trading up into premium, but people are also trading down from mid-price into low-price, so you get a sort of dual economy.</p>
          <p>And this really, and this is explained really by what, when we do tend to get hit is if there a big spikes in unemployment. And so if you're still employed, and you will still continue to buy and you will still up trade. But if you're unemployed then you'll trade down. And it's not really the GDP that drives it, it's unemployment that drives any impact on us.</p>
          <p>The other thing to bear in mind is that, of course, with a third of our volume in premium, a third in mid-price, and a third of our volume in low-price, if there is down trading, we're very well place to pick up that down trading. And one of the other lessons that we got from looking at previous down turns, is that we tend to pick up at least our fair share of down traders. And the reason for that is that we have very strong portfolios, indeed arguably stronger portfolios in mid- and low-price, than we have in premium on a global basis.</p>
          <p>So, it's not really GDP, its unemployment. And the thing to bear in mind is that whilst there may be down trading, there can be different forms of that down trading, and indeed there can be up-trading when there is general down trading in a given market, which I hope I've tried to explain well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I suppose that's incredibly clear in a situation, I mean it's a very clear answer for a situation which is obviously incredibly complicated.</p>
          <p>If I can just get in, sneak in another question. I know that in Russia you've been very explicit about the relative profitability of premium and mid-price and low-price. But if you had to try and say that generically around the world, would you say that premium was, per pack, four times the profitability of low-price, or is there a figure like that that you can give, or is it? I'm talking obviously about relative unit volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, if you look at our gross margins, generally speaking the low-price would be about half the gross margin of premium.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's no rule of thumb...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... because it will depend on the excise structure in any particular market and also on the range of prices in markets?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on innovations, Adam, again we can't get into too much detail as to what and when, but there's a lot we can do in terms of taking the innovations that we've done, and you know what those innovations are in terms of Nanotech, Dunhill, fine-cut, resealable pack, called Boost.</p>
          <p>There's a lot of geography that we have which has not had those innovations yet. So we can roll out the successful innovations that we've had so far, and roll them out to more geography, and then there are more innovations in the pipeline that we can start to put into the geography where we've already got the innovations. The idea is to keep refreshing those brands with product innovations. And that will continue whether it's by brand or by geography.</p>

          <p>Well, as I said, most of the big uplift that we got on the global dry brands was as a result of the activity that has taken place over the last 12 months. So the activity in the third quarter will be less, sorry, was less than it was, say, in first six months, which is why you saw a slight trade off on our GDB growth. But there's plenty more in the pipeline and you'll have to watch this space.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks again. Just following up on that last question, I mean, when you look back at Asia and Russia in those crisis years, what did you find? I mean what were volumes moving from and to in that year of economic downturn? What was sales in local currency moving from and to in that period of extreme financial, sorry extreme economic crisis?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, if I can as well, sorry. I know you've talked before, Paul, about the average price mix which should, at the nine months year-to-date underlying looks about 5%, you talked about geographic mix offsetting underlying mix, and then the price being what drives that 5%. Is that still the shape and can you give us a feel what the geographic mix negative is? I mean is it minus two, minus four? That'll be great. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>No. We didn't work out a mathematical formula from the previous crises that we can apply going forward. So, you can draw some lessons and some learnings, but in terms of using predictive models, we didn't find them terribly useful. That's the first thing to say. So, I wouldn't draw any learnings or lessons, other than the ones I've already given from those reviews. We were asked in South Africa, if we'd also looked at the economic crisis in the 1930s, in terms of applying the lessons, and our records don't get back that far.</p>
          <p>In terms of price mix, I've looked at the absolute numbers and basically our brand mix slightly outweighs the negative geographic mix. Now I don't have a percentage for that, off the top of my head, but I know that in absolute sterling terms our brand mix is more than compensating for the deteriorating geographic mix.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thank you. And just to keep going back to this 98/99 precedent, which I know is difficult to say whether its going to be like that or not this time around, But if you take the Asian performance, let say 98/99, looking at the data, not looking at the relationships, just data, do volumes drop 5% and sales 10, because of the mix that you talked about, or are we talking a 1% drop over what was the previous underlying. I'm just trying to get a gauge for the absolute, rather than the relationship, of what you saw in 98/99, for example in Asia? Is that something you got?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the reason why it was difficult to tease out the variables, because from what were macro impacts versus what were, if you like, trading impacts. If you remember about that time we had a lot of volume out in the Far East that ended up in China. And so that was a variable that was difficult to subtract from any conclusions that one could draw. So no, I don't have an answer to that question.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you very much for your questions. The Investor Relations team and the press office as ever will be available for further questions.</p>
          <p>If I could just conclude with the Chairman's comments in the press release today, on the uncertainty that lies ahead. I think these results demonstrate that there has been no discernible effect on British American Tobacco from the economic downturn.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the impact of any consumer downturn on our business should be mitigated by our balanced and innovative brand portfolio, which cover all price points. In addition we continue to benefit from the extent of our geographic diversity, which will also help to protect shareholders from the impact of volatility in the foreign exchange markets.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much for tuning in.</p>
