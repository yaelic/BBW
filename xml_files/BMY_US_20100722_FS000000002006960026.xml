        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jennifer , and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us.</p>
          <p>We're here to discuss our second quarter results. You've seen the release out this morning. With me today for prepared remarks are Lamberto Andreotti, our Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer.  After the prepared remarks we'll go to Q&amp;A, and also joining us for Q&amp;A are Elliott Sigal, Head of R&amp;D, as well as B&#xE9;atrice Cazala and Tony Hooper, our two commercial leads.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, let me take care of the legal language. During this call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. These documents are available from the SEC, the Bristol-Myers Squibb website or from BMS, Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>In addition any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change.</p>
          <p>During the call we'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to include certain costs, expenses, gains, and losses and other specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Lamberto?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, John.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We have completed another quarter in which our efforts have been successfully devoted to the key elements of our strategy: profitable and quality growth driven by an innovative and diversified portfolio and pipeline, productivity, attention to balance sheet and capital structure, and fulfillment of the expectations of shareholders, customers and employees.</p>
          <p>Our solid second quarter financial results, along with the progress we are making in advancing our pipeline, clearly demonstrated our focus, contributes not only to positive short-term performance but also establishes a strong foundation for future growth and future profitability. Our performance is good, despite the headwinds resulting from the implementation of the healthcare reform in the U.S. and from the economic crisis in Europe. Both have an impact on our prices and our earnings, and Charlie later on will speak more about this impact in his comments.</p>
          <p>For my part this morning, I would like to talk mostly about the significant data reported over the past several months for both inline and pipeline products. They reinforce the confidence we have in our extremely productive R&amp;D as a key pillar to continue to build the new biopharma company that we are becoming. The news from ASCO, ADA and elsewhere was encouraging for several key molecules, including Ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma, SPRYCEL for first-line CML, dapagliflozin for Type II diabetes, and Apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.</p>
          <p>ASCO was a very successful meeting for us this year. First, we presented positive data for Ipilimumab from Study 020 in second-line metastatic melanoma. This study demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival at both one and two years. Based on this data, we have submitted our filing in both Europe and the U.S. The EU filing has been validated, while we are waiting for the acceptance of the BLA in the U.S. In addition, based on the results of a positive Phase II study, we have also decided to initiate Phase III development in non-small cell lung cancer later this year. As a reminder, Ipilimumab is already in Phase III for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, therefore prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>Also at ASCO, in the head-to-head trial comparing SPRYCEL to GLEEVEC in first-line CML, the primary endpoint was met, with SPRYCEL demonstrating superior efficacy compared to GLEEVEC in complete cytogenic response at 12 months. SPRYCEL also showed significantly higher rates of major molecular response, as well as faster responses versus GLEEVEC. Our submission in Europe has been validated, and in the U.S. we have been granted a priority review with an action date of October 28. For the second-line indication that is already approved, we now have positive four-year follow-up results for both overall survival and progression-free survival.</p>
          <p>At the ADA meeting, we presented Phase III results for dapagliflozin as an add-on to insulin in patients inadequately controlled on insulin. Results show that the additional dapagliflozin resulted in significant reductions in both HbA1c levels and insulin dosage. This is the third Phase III study that we have presented for dapa, with two additional Phase III studies to be presented at the EASD meeting in September. The product is shaping up as an important potential new treatment in diabetes, with benefits in glucose control, weight loss and blood pressure control.</p>
          <p>Finally, just last month, we announced the early termination of the Phase III AVERROES trial for Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation. The study's Data Monitoring Committee saw clear evidence of a clinically important reduction in stroke and embolism in patients who have received Apixaban when compared to aspirin.</p>
          <p>Now that the study has been stopped early, we are focused on three items moving forward. First, the initial scientific presentation of the results is scheduled for the ESC [European Society of Cardiology] meeting at the end of August; second, we are working toward the publication of the data; and third, we are assessing our regulatory options based on these positive developments.   In summary, a lot of good and exciting data for many of our products which grow our confidence in our future.</p>
          <p>As you have seen this morning in our release, we, in addition to reaffirming our 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance, we have confirmed our target for a 2013 non-GAAP EPS floor of 1.95. We first provided this guidance in March and that time specifically excluded any impact from U.S. healthcare reform. The effects of U.S. healthcare reform, as well as the deteriorating EU pricing environment, will indeed negatively impact our 2013. However, the progress we have made in our pipeline and an expanded commitment to productivity gives us confidence that in 2013, we can deliver non-GAAP EPS at or above the same floor announced in March. Our press release contains important information regarding the assumptions and exclusions underlying this guidance.</p>
          <p>As far as 2010 is concerned, I'm pleased with the solid second quarter results, including good sales growth and a 13% increase in non-GAAP EPS. We remain in a very strong financial position, with approximately $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. Our priority for capital remains business development, and even though we have not completed any major deals in this quarter, we continue to go after multiple opportunities that can potentially strengthen our late-stage pipeline and/or our business in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>We also remain committed to the dividend, which of course, is a quarterly decision by our board of directors and as an additional sign of attention to our shareholders, during the quarter we have initiated our $3 billion share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>Charlie Bancroft now will provide additional details around the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lamberto.</p>
          <p>We did have another quarter of growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 for a 13% increase over last year, supported by sales growth in our key products and continued expense management. Included in our second quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. I want to give you some brief highlights from our second quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.</p>
          <p>The company reported second quarter net sales from continuing operations of 4.8 billion, an increase of 2%. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.5% negative impact on net sales in the quarter and volume was up 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral compared to last year.</p>
          <p>The second quarter sales performance was driven in large part by strength in our virology franchise and Plavix. Our virology franchise demonstrated solid global sales growth, up 10% from a year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for Reyataz, the Sustiva franchise and Baraclude across both our U.S. and international markets.  Plavix grew 7% in the U.S. in the second quarter as the retail inventory build which we saw in the first quarter was worked down. In Europe, we saw continued erosion of Plavix as generic lopidogrel was available in most of the countries. As we've said, we expect erosion of Plavix sales in Europe to begin to slow but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliates in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., Abilify prescription demand increased 5%. This is 2.5 times greater than the overall anti-psychotic market. The increase in U.S. prescription demand was fueled by our indications for bipolar and major depressive disorder. However, Abilify reported sales in the U.S. were down 5% due to the negative impact of U.S. healthcare reform and the reduction in our share of net sales under the revised contractual terms with Otsuka. Excluding these items, Abilify sales would have been up 11% in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Lastly, divestitures and rationalization of our nonstrategic mature brands portfolio had a negative impact year over year of approximately 45 million. So, U.S. healthcare reform, the Abilify contract extension and mature brand divestitures had a combined negative 4% impact on reported total company sales in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you some highlights from the rest of the P&amp;L. Our non-GAAP gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 73.8% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Improvements in product mix were offset by changes in the way we account for the agreement with Otsuka.  Advertising and promotion expenses were down 12% to 263 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of certain products at the end of their lifecycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain Abilify, SPRYCEL and Ixempra expenses. This was partially offset by increased spending for the Onglyza launch and other pipeline products.</p>
          <p>Equity income from affiliates declined 43%, driven by continued erosion of Plavix sales in Europe from generic lopidogrel, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 23.8% in the second quarter. Our guidance remains between 23 and 24% for the year, assuming the R&amp;D tax credit. As a reminder, we will only account for the tax credit in the quarter it happens.</p>
          <p>In regards to our new $3 billion share buyback program, we repurchased 7.3 million shares in the quarter, at a cost of 173 million.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to guidance. As Lamberto mentioned, the economic crisis in Europe has led to incremental pricing pressure. We typically realize a 2 to 2.5% price decline across our European businesses, but based on various governmental measures implemented, we will see a larger impact in 2010. Despite this pressure, we are confirming our 2010 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance and there are no changes to our line item guidance. There's also no changes to our estimates of the impact of U.S. healthcare reform. However, the European pricing measures, along with the broader U.S. healthcare reform changes, will create a headwind for 2011 beyond what we typically budget as we balance productivity and investment to maximize the value of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In closing, we had a solid second quarter. Double-digit EPS growth, supported by key products and franchises, good management of expenses, a strong cash position and confirmation of our non-GAAP 2010 guidance and 2013 floor guidance.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn it over to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll now go to our first question, from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I have a number of questions, and I was in and out of the call, so if I apologize if you mentioned this in the prepared remarks. But a couple things: first, in terms of the second half of 2010 revenue growth outlook, is it possible for the top line to accelerate from the 2% year-over-year growth that you reported in the second quarter, or is that unlikely, given the FX headwinds?</p>
          <p>And then my second question relates to timing on three pipeline products. In terms of Apixaban data timing, could you provide some color on that? In terms of the first-line ipilimumab data, any update on that timing? And then finally, on dapagliflozin, any update on the U.S. filing timing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll say, Charlie, you should take the first half of the question about sales, and then Elliott you can update David and the others on the products and the timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. I would say for the back half of the year, and for total year, our guidance for total sales remains in the mid-single digit range. FX is always difficult to predict, as the top line will obviously be impacted based on the fluctuations in currencies. However, as we think about our overall earnings, we have hedges in place basically to cover ourselves for 2010. So notwithstanding any changes in fluctuations, we should still be fine on the bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, this is Elliott. You asked about timing for Apixaban studies, Ipilimumab 024, our first-line study I believe was asked, and dapagliflozin filing in the U.S. But we're most excited about the AVERROSE trial, which was done on patients that can't tolerate or cannot take Coumadin, and that's a superiority trial that will be presented in Stockholm August 31 at a late-breaking session, and that's the first of our large A-fib studies: it's over 5,500 patients; it's in a special population. We think it's in an area of unmet medical need, and This was stopped early by an outside group and so we're gathering all the final data and look forward to that presentation.</p>
          <p>The AVERROSE trial is a more all-comer trial for A-fib. It is a broad spectrum of risk factors. That is event driven, and by our best estimate we'll have some of that information &#x2013; we should have that information the first half of '011. The AVERROSE  trial is a very unique part of our program, and I feel that it may give information and confirmation about our overall profile in balancing benefit-risk, targeting unmet medical need, and having the right dose.</p>
          <p>Ipilimumab, of course, the first survival study in pre-treated metastatic melanoma patients, was presented not only in the New England Journal of Medicine but at ASCO, and with that data we have filed in Europe, and that's been accepted. We are announcing today we have submitted, at the end of June, an application for the U.S, and we're working with the FDA to finalize that, and it's up to them to file that data.</p>
          <p>The first-line study for ipilimumab is also event driven, and there's no change in the comments that I've made before. There has been slowing of the events, which is good news, we believe, for patients. Perhaps by the end of the year or early next year, we will see that data.</p>
          <p>Dapagliflozin is progressing well in terms of its emerging profile of the triad of benefits with its novel mechanism; we'll have two important studies presented in Europe. We'll have more studies that we're reading out now that will be presented next year, and we are on track, as an alliance, to file in Europe. We have not performed the analysis that's required in the U.S to determine the filing yet, but this is an ongoing process for this year. We'll have more to say later.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David. Jennifer, can we go to the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to John Boris with Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. First question, just on Apixaban. Elliott, when you originally sat down and met with the FDA on the AVERROSE trial on the design of the trial, obviously the unique design to that trial, was there any agreement that you had with the FDA that if it did demonstrate superiority, that the FDA would be open to, obviously, evaluating that in a meaningful way toward approval, or are you anticipating that the FDA is going to require the second trial?</p>
          <p>Secondly, what percent of patients are considered refractory or intolerant? And then third, in your release you say it has an acceptable bleeding profile. Can you just help us understand what acceptable is? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, thank you for the questions and I'll start answering some of these but I think it's very important to hear from our commercial leaders and I think B&#xE9;atrice Cazala will follow me with some remarks on the opportunity here with AVERROES.</p>
          <p>First of all, I think the FDA will and should keep all options open based on the data, and we're all assimilating the data to be presented, and all I can say about our very, very initial meetings years ago was that this design was recognized as a unique part of the targeting unmet medical needs. We received fast-track status on the basis of the design, but we had intended to have both studies completed around the same time.</p>
          <p>This one, as you know, was stopped early and closed early because of an independent assessment that the benefit far outweighs the risks and all the patients that weren't on Apixaban should be offered that choice. You will see &#x2013; and I cannot preempt the scientists in the data &#x2013; you will see August 31 in Stockholm the design of the trial, the exact number of percent of patients that were refractory or how they were determined to be unsuitable for Coumadin, which is for a variety of reasons. They may have been on Coumadin, couldn't be monitored properly, couldn't be titrated properly, had drug-drug interactions or high risk, or patients that the physician, for a variety of those reasons, felt that it was unwise and they were unwilling to put the patient on Coumadin.</p>
          <p>That data will be presented and the bleeding comment that I made was that I do believe this independent group made sure that it was very clear that the benefit-risk could be evaluated, and you will see what the acceptable profile of bleeding is at the conference. B&#xE9;atrice ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. From the commercial perspective, you can imagine that we are analyzing that situation with a lot of interest. It's a very unusual population, as per your comments. However, it's in our estimation, a very large number of patients and we even believe that through our market research, it's probably more underestimated that we have found.</p>
          <p>We consider that there is at least 40% of patient in that group overall, and there's several sub-segments of this. They are the one that are on Coumadin, as Elliott mentioned, and cannot be controlled or appropriately controlled, but there are also other one that are not treated because they are deem unsuitable both for warfarin and even aspirin. So they are the one on aspirin that are not fully controlled.</p>
          <p>So at the moment, we believe there is a large population there. We are trying to understand our product profile. Depending on what we see at the end of August, can fit the value segment of that market and we are preparing to every situation. There may be some option for us to have that as a commercial launch if things were planning to be positive.</p>
          <p>So interesting situation. Very exciting commercially. Different from what were anticipated originally. But a large unmet medical need in that group, and we are actively looking at it and assessing what could be the response of the market and the prescriber to a different profile, depending on what we will see this in segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the alliance will &#x2013; that we are in with Pfizer will be advising publicly, or filing strategy as all this unfolds in the rest of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Jennifer, can we go to the next question, please?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry. I didn't hear the operator. So just a couple of questions on ipilimumab actually. Can you just discuss the kind of strategies that you might be evaluating relative to &#x2013; assuming that the front line study is successful &#x2013; the strategies in terms of pricing that you're thinking about relative to the differential in the 3 milligram per kilogram dosing versus the 10 milligram per kilogram dosing that you have for second-line versus first-line and how you can deal with that commercially?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, could you just, Elliott, clarify for us the maintenance paradigm in the Ipi 024, the front-line study versus the retreatment paradigm in the 020 study? I think there might be a little bit of confusion out there; I think it would help to clarify that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I will start and I will ask B&#xE9;atrice  to follow. Obviously, pricing of Ipi is a matter of great importance to us. We have initiated that a review of the different options we have, and for obvious reasons we will not disclose much in terms of prices until we are closer to the market. But this is a really different situation from what we experienced in the past with other oncology products because of the emerging profile of these products. So we want to not, we don't want to exclude any possible new approaches to pricing, and we will discuss more about this when we launch. But B&#xE9;atrice, why don't you speak a little bit more about the opportunity that we see for Ipi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, this is working science and new, so we don't really have a comparator in term of standard of care, because many investigational agents are used in that segment. So it create a new set of challenges for us on pricing. And so we are trying some of them with the 3 and the 10 , and we will find a interesting and new approach to solve that. The number of scripts, you know, is 30 to 40,000 annually in the U.S. and EU, and 60,000 worldwide, and we also know from &#x2013; and Elliott will comment more about the schedule and the re-induction &#x2013; but we also know in the second-line setting that most of the patient will be treated with a number of dose and that would be it.</p>
          <p>So it creates an interesting situation for pricing and we are clearly today working very hard on length of therapy, pricing and our overall share to be determine the optimal pricing for the products and to satisfy the multiple stakeholders and the access around markets where we introduce it. So interesting challenges, not unsolvable, second-line setting with a definite &#x2013; it's a definite market, as you know. We know the number of patients; we also know it's a finite treatment in most patients. So those are along the line of what we are working on today.</p>

          <p>So with regard to the maintenance schedules, or the terminology of induction, re-induction and maintenance, in 020 there was no maintenance per se. There was induction and based on physician evaluation, a possible re-induction. The induction is an infusion, in this case the 3 milligram dose, every three weeks for four complete doses. Now if a patient did respond &#x2013; and these are patients that are pre-treated for which there are no approved drug and it is a fatal disease. If they did show some benefit after that induction and then later seemed to deteriorate, they could be re-induced.</p>
          <p>The 024 was a different trial. There is an approved drug, DTIC, and we ran ipilimumab on top of that backbone to see if we could improve against the standard of care in first-line metastatic melanoma. And the protocol for that was at 10 milligram it was the same four doses in the induction every three weeks, and then there was maintenance every three months.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. First question is on EU pricing. As relative to your 2 to 2.5% historic impact on price, could you just clarify for us what price impact you saw in the first half of this year and then give us a little bit more color on what you're anticipating second half, as well as 2011, assuming no further government actions? Could that pricing be double that historic level over that timeframe?</p>
          <p>Second question I had was regarding the emerging markets. Right now we're at 4% of sales. Can you update us on what type of growth you're anticipating, and where you see that as a percent of sales may be going by 2015, and maybe where within the portfolio you see the largest growth opportunities?</p>
          <p>And then finally, generic Plavix penetration in the EU; where are we now? And I think you mentioned share plateauing but is that &#x2013; did we see the share really plateau as we looked at Q2 at this point? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, Chris, this is Charlie. We have been operating in a negative pricing environment in Europe for quite some time and we have extensive experience, unfortunate experience, in understanding these market dynamics. As I mentioned in my comments, we have historically budgeted 2 to 2.5% price declines each year, but as you can imagine, the current situation is more impactful for that. It's a modest impact in the second quarter, and what we see for the full-year is a 1 to 2% incremental impact to historical levels. As we think of the annualization of some of these impacts that have happened during the course of this year, and some still to be implemented effective later this year, for 2011 we estimate these pricing measures will have a incremental, mid-single digit negative impact to EU sales compared to historical levels.</p>
          <p>Let, let me comment on the Plavix question you had in Europe, and then B&#xE9;atrice  can talk about emerging markets. Except for a few countries in Europe, most of the Plavix business in Europe is co-promoted with Sanofi, and in those co-promoted countries, Sanofi acts as the operating partner and books the sales. So we see the impact in the equity income as net to us in our P&amp;L, just as a reminder. What we've seen has been pretty significant erosion on Plavix where generics have entered. So in the U.K. for example, there's been 95% sales erosion. France and Germany, 70 to 80% sales erosion, and then where there's been more recent introduction of a generic clopidogrel, say in Italy, we've seen 30 to 40% sales erosion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can probably make a comment, Charlie, on the emerging markets. It's Lamberto. You are right, Chris: where our sales in the five markets, as we define as our key emerging markets, which are India, China, Russia, Turkey and Brazil; the sales in those markets were 4% of all total sales in the quarter. I'm not going to give you our target sales for those markets, but it is the percentage, obviously, is going to be much bigger than what we have today. To give you a flavor of how those markets are performing, those five markets, their sales in the quarter grew 16% versus prior year.</p>
          <p>And what counts a lot to me is that sales are driven not by older brands, or sales growth not driven by the older brands or by local products. Sales growth comes from Baraclude in China and Brazil, Reyataz in Brazil, Abilify and SPRYCEL in Turkey, Brazil and Russia. We launched Onglyza. So we are developing, and we continue to develop in those markets, exactly the same portfolio that we have elsewhere, and this is what makes our emerging markets strategy probably different from the strategy that most other companies have, and I'm very confident that in those five countries, with big populations, with a growing commitment to healthcare, increasing respect for intellectual property, and an expanding financial trend, our biopharma portfolio can be established, and as I said before, generate a much bigger contribution to the overall sales of Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jami.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you for the question. If you could just review again, I think that you had talked about a 350 to $400 million revenue hit this year for healthcare reform and then double that next year. Yet, the 1.5% hit this quarter would imply a run rate that is below that level of guidance for healthcare reform. So if you could &#x2013; you now obviously have more visibility; where are we with that?</p>
          <p>And number two, Lamberto, the fact that you've reconfirmed your 2013 floor estimates, even with the new headwinds of healthcare reform and your European pricing pressure is obviously very positive. Should I imply by that statement that you expect to replace that with another 700 to 800 million in new product sales? Can you just provide a little bit more granularity around your confidence in the 2013 number, given that obviously revenues will be hit by U.S. healthcare reform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Jami. Yes, let me start and then Charlie can elaborate a little bit on both the impact of healthcare reform and the contribution of new products to overall sales, and in fact, Tony, you can add some information healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>But about 2013, you're very right. With that fact that we decided to confirm, we concluded that we could confirm guidance is because we believe that the newer products can contribute to offset the impact of Healthcare Reform Act, and also the impact of this European pricing situation that is evolving in a negative way for us and everybody else over the last few months. We also said, and I repeat it now, that we will continue to expand our attention to productivity, and it's also that, obviously, the component of our confirmation of guidance, this for 2013.</p>
          <p>Before passing it to Tony on healthcare reform, healthcare reform is still evolving. This huge law has been now translating into a lot of regulations, and each individual state in the U.S. is making decisions on what to include and what not to include in the individual plans. So we are still dealing with a situation that is not 100% clear. And what you've heard and what Charlie will elaborate are estimates of what we expect to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just comment quickly on the impact. So in the first quarter, we saw a $50 million top line impact, and then in the second quarter, 70 million. So that's really related to the Medicaid rebate change as well as some element of managed Medicaid.</p>
          <p>What we see as more accelerating in the back half of the year is the 340B hospitals and the expansion in that arena, as well as probably additional impact due to managed Medicaid. So we still feel comfortable with approximately $0.12 as we look at 2010. Obviously, as we get to the third quarter, we'll have another quarter of experience and we'll be able to give a more firm update as we think about 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So not much to add. It's pretty clear. You can see immediately the impact on Medicaid, as the claims coming from the states. And those vary based on demand as it's flowing to the market, as well as the managed Medicaid.</p>
          <p>Not many institutions have actually identified them yet under the new 340B PHS definition. We do have a clarification now around orphan drugs not being included, so there are a few drugs one can include in that in the future. But we do know that these institutions can identify themselves and then do retroactive claims back to January of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jami. Can we go to the next question, Jennifer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. On Plavix, can you talk about what you expect what Astra's Brilinta might do? What are the biggest unknowns and uncertainties with that product, in your view?</p>
          <p>On dapagliflozin, I think you're implying that there're still some safety discussions that need to be hammered out with FDA in terms of how to address that. Can we &#x2013; without asking what the plan is necessarily &#x2013; can you just talk about what those potential safety issues would be? Is that confined just to infections, or could there be other elements as well, like cardiovascular safety?</p>
          <p>And then the last question is, just looking at pressure, and as it grows in established markets like the U.S., where you have healthcare reform, like Europe, where you have price cuts, a fair number of companies would argue it's for these reasons that you want to be diversified and you want to push into new geographies like emerging markets.</p>
          <p>But Bristol's taking an opposite approach there, which is it kind of pared back a little bit its presence in emerging markets and certainly concentrated just on the branded Rx business. Is there any hesitation internally, as you've seen the pharma landscape evolve, that you're still pursuing the right strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, this is Lamberto. Let me start with a comment on your last point.</p>
          <p>I must tell you not only there is no hesitation, but I think we are very pleased of the choices we have made, because if you think the so-called developed world, in this pricing environment, it is innovation that one needs. And despite all the very negative measures taken in Europe, products still get priced. And we got pricing agreements in the last few countries where we have not priced Onglyza yet. France, Italy, et cetera. So we continue to have products priced and launched.</p>
          <p>As far as the emerging markets is concerned, I think that our choice of concentrating on high-tech products and not competing with local companies and generic companies and low-priced, low-margin, big volume products is, I think &#x2013; for us &#x2013; I don't want to discuss the strategies of other companies &#x2013; a winning strategy. So I'm convinced that our strategy holds.</p>
          <p>As far as Plavix is concerned, and my colleagues will speak about dapa, we will see what the comes out of the outcome on Brilinta in a few days. I'm still convinced, what I've seen is good data there. I mean, what they've announced is good data. But Plavix is a very consolidated presence in a lot of indications. And what we have in front of us between now and the end of exclusivity of Plavix is a huge, consolidated product. And Brilinta, good luck to them. But it is for one of the indications of Plavix, if they get approved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Tim, I just want to be clear that with dapagliflozin, I'm talking about a standard, routine analysis that has been instituted by the FDA over the last year and half to assure no cardiovascular harm can be detected in a large enough patient population with a meta-analysis and pre-described boundaries for that estimate.</p>
          <p>So I'm not signaling any concern. In fact, the benefits from dapagliflozin in lowering blood pressure give us great hope that this, along with its weight loss, as well as control of glucose, will benefit more than just glucose lowering for these patients.</p>
          <p>But there is a protocol that's been instituted and was instituted right as Onglyza was being launched, for all new diabetic compounds to meet a certain requirement that is event-driven, and we're waiting for the number of events to make that calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at CGIT2 as a new class on the commercial side, we are really excited that it's making a reaction, because it's going to really provide a very strong alternative of a product that will be non-insulin-dependent, and a very different mode of action, with additional benefit to the traditionally A1c lowering.</p>
          <p>So all the market research we are doing concerning interest in all the population, as well as sub-segment, and in its dual activity, both on reported patient. And so the next question is was it providing the additional benefit that a lot of the prescriber were expecting beyond A1c2, we learned with the analysis we did of add on to Metformin.</p>
          <p>So we are very excited, and all the database that we are going to now show good receptivity profile, and we will know even more on the CBST. But clearly for us, commercially, it's a huge opportunity. Very, very close to the unmet medical need in the market, once you have started using Metformin, and you have a need of a product. That would be also a novel agent, which is very important for that product. It's not an injectable that someone with CGIT wants. So we feel in that space it's going to be really when we see, once we have re-confirmed fully through the label, and regulatory approval, the profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're cautiously optimistic. I want to interject a fair balance. It represents things we've said before, nothing new. And that, as a new class, when we get the large number of patients safety database integrated, we will go over the usual analysis for safety signals.</p>
          <p>I've been asked most commonly about lower urinary tract infections. In some trials we see no difference from the control. In some cases, we see some elevation. We'll know, when we combine the database, where we stand.</p>
          <p>The concern with these, which are often seen in diabetes patients, unfortunately, and in many diabetic trials, is whether there's an upper kidney urogenital infection, like pyelonephritis. In the last study, I was asked about two cases, but I can tell you that I am not concerned about any imbalance across the program. And we do monitor this very carefully, and we will look at the integrated safety.</p>
          <p>The tolerability issue of having excess glucose is something we're working with patients to deal with, but I think is more tolerability than safety, and that is the yeast infections that can develop in diabetic patients are at increasing rates with this particular agent. But we're working out ways to address that tolerability issue, and hope the benefits far outweigh them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim. I think we have time, Jennifer, for two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We'll now go to Steve Scala with Cowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thank you. I have two questions.</p>
          <p>First, for Elliott, does Bristol have the Plavix CLARINET data in house? And just to confirm, regardless of the data, by virtue of having done the study, you are automatically granted the six month pediatric exclusivity? Asked another way, is there any risk that you won't get pediatric exclusivity based on CLARINET?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, perhaps for Lamberto, Gilead apparently said on its call that it has an option to deemphasize Atripla, presumably when the Sustiva patent goes off. Can you clarify what patent they're referring to, 2013 or 15? And would you provide Bristol's perspective on this option? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elliott?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, you're referring to the pediatric trial that we have an agreement with the Agency that, if completed the way that it was designed, would give us a pediatric exclusivity.</p>
          <p>That's the CLARINET trial, and we are announcing that we have submitted that application, and we do believe we've met all the requirements, so we do expect over the coming months to hear about our exclusivity in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, as far as Atripla and Sustiva are concerned, I think that the comment made by the management of Gilead &#x2013; I'm not sure exactly to which comment you're referring, but I suppose they made comments about not the patent, but their contractual obligations. There is no disagreement with Gilead on for the length of  the patent, and this is something that was not clear in the past but I think it's clear now.</p>
          <p>Now, they have the right to &#x2013; not to support Atripla, according to the contract. And as far as Bristol-Myers is concerned, I think we have committed to Sustiva. We have committed to Atripla. And based also on the recent information I've seen, I'm looking forward to the budget discussion from my team about Atripla in 2011 and beyond. So I think Atripla and Sustiva are going to be some important elements of the HIV therapy for a number of years to come.</p>
          <p>Tony, do you want to elaborate on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, the patents are clearly defined in the Orange Book. And when we look at the pediatric extension, that's six months beyond that. So the contract is clearly linked to the point at which efavirenz will lose patent.</p>
          <p>As I look at the HIV franchise, it's interesting that despite the recent entries of new product into HIV, 7 out of every 10 patients that are naive to treatment are now getting either Reyataz or efavirenz as an initiation, and in fact, these two products have both held their market share growth really well.</p>
          <p>It's all about suppressing the virus, keeping the virus down, and avoiding resistance. And that means you have to talk about efficacy and patient persistence. And when you look at an efavirenz-based regimen like Atripla, it actually has the longest treatment persistence of all HIV regimens. And therefore, I think, with all due respect, given the value proposition to our HIV franchise provide for naive patients, any new products will need to offer disproportionate benefits in order to make significant inroads in our market.</p>

        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Lamberto, single question. I respect the additional buyback that was announced this morning, but does it in any way send a signal about the availability or the confidence in additional business development activity over the near term? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, the answer is no. I think that we still see a lot of opportunities outside there.</p>
          <p>You know that our approach to assessing and acting on those opportunities is very focused, and it's very balanced and disciplined. So we continue to have a large number of opportunities under assessment and I'm confident that we will find the right deals on the right targets, and we have a number that we are assessing. The repurchase of our own shares is just one of the things that we announced and are doing to meet the requests of our shareholders. And I think it's an indication of our confidence in cash availability in the future.</p>
          <p>So we are not giving up on business development. That is our first priority subject to the visions, quarter by quarter, by our board. We are committed to our dividend policy. And on top of all this, we believe that the stock repurchase is something that makes sense and we can afford.</p>

      <speaker id="15">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, thank you for many interesting questions. Just a couple of closing thoughts. First, as our results demonstrate, operationally things are going well and we are glad to confirm 2010 guidance despite the negative impact of both U.S. healthcare reform and pricing issues in Europe.</p>
          <p>Second, as Charlie said, 2010 is just the beginning of the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and of the intensified pricing issues in Europe there, with more significant impact of these global pressures expected in 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>And third and most important, our new quality clinical data provides great momentum for our pipeline and continued confidence in our longer-term strategic vision. We'll continue to invest in helping ensure that promising future.</p>
