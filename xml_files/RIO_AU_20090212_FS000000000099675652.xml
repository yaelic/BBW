      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning to all of you here in London, good evening to all those who joining us from Australia. In fact we have people in a number of different locations this time. And I hope that in the Q&amp;A that follows, we will be able to do justice to all of you.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation will cover both the announcement of what I think is a landmark transaction in our corporate history as well as Rio Tinto's 2008 full year results. The transaction with Chinalco announced today will reposition Rio Tinto both financially and the medium term and strategically in the longer term. It offers significant value to shareholders now and competitive advantage for the future of the business.</p>
          <p>We're delighted to have President, Xiao; and Vice President, Liu of Chinalco with us in this presentation today. Welcome to London to both of you.</p>
          <p>Tom is also here with me in London; and Guy Elliott, CFO is joining us from Melbourne, and Guy can see you very clearly. You are hearing us okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, it's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Very well, thank you. Thank you very much. So the schedule is that we will present first on recommended transaction with Chinalco followed by a transaction specific Q&amp;A session. We'll then take a short 10 minute break after which we will present the highlights version of our usual financial results also with the accompanying Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased to announce today that Rio Tinto has agreed to enter into a pioneering strategic partnership with Chinalco. The proposed partnership will entail the investment by Chinalco of $19.5 billion in our company through a combination of asset level investments and the issue of Rio Tinto convertible bonds.</p>
          <p>The asset investment of 12.3 billion will occur through the creation of three commodity based joint ventures in aluminum, copper, and iron ore while the balance of 7.2 billion will be gained through the subscription by Chinalco for the convertible bonds to which I referred.</p>
          <p>The proposed transaction will deliver multiple benefits to Rio Tinto. Firstly, at premium values and we will discuss that at some length, it will substantially strengthen Rio Tinto's balance sheet, addressing simultaneously both the near term liquidity requirements and our overall level of indebtedness.</p>
          <p>Secondly, strategic flexibility will be restored as the company is able to act on compelling investment opportunities through the economic cycle. Thirdly the transaction will create a unique partnership between Rio Tinto and Chinalco with the ability to capitalize strongly on emerging trends in global resources.</p>
          <p>Specifically, Rio Tinto's traditional strength as a leading diversified miner will be complemented through access to Chinalco's unique insights relationships and capabilities. Taken in total, we believe this partnership will deliver an outstanding value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>It's important, I think to understand that today's announcement is the combination of a series of engagements between Chinalco and Rio Tinto since Chinalco's original investment in Rio Tinto back in February 2008. At that time, we said that we would seek value creating opportunities to work together; and today's announcement is testament to the great potential that exist, an exploring areas of mutual cooperation.</p>
          <p>Following extensive consideration of the strategic options available to Rio Tinto, the Boards have unanimously concluded that the opportunity offered by this partnership is superior to other identified options and offers greater medium-term certainty and longer-term value for shareholders. We believe the transaction will secure for Rio Tinto a leadership position in global resources.</p>
          <p>The transaction begins a pioneering strategic partnership that combines the very best of the developed and the developing world. It is no surprise I think to anybody listening to this presentation that the developing world is increasingly important to the resources sector.</p>
          <p>A fact we believe the current global financial crisis is only likely to underscore. In that context, we believe this partnership will uniquely position Rio Tinto within the sector by allowing us to benefit from Chinalco's market insight, strong Chinese relationships and capabilities.</p>
          <p>Chinalco and I am sure President Xiao will speak to this will benefit from exposure to Rio Tinto's expertise in managing and operating long life large world class resources. As I mentioned earlier, the transaction is value enhancing for Rio Tinto shareholders on a number of levels. Chinalco's cash investment provides us with balance sheet strength and flexibility to pursue our long-term strategy right through the economic cycle.</p>
          <p>Importantly, this cash has been raised at a substantial premium to current market valuations, and Guy will, in his presentation, take you through this. I think it is a rare if not unique achievement in today's current financial environment.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto's standards of governance and first grade operational practice will continue as before. At the corporate level and within the commodity joint ventures, strong governance structures will ensure continued commercial focus and independence in all decision making.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto will run the business according to its established business principles. Current practices will continue at all facilities. And I will say a little bit more about that in a moment. For these reasons, the Board intends unanimously to recommend those transactions to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let me provide some color regarding the two components of the proposed transaction. First, three commodity based joint ventures will be established in aluminum, copper, and iron ore. Each will contain certain Rio Tinto operations in which Chinalco will take a minority or joint venture interest.</p>
          <p>The specifics of the operations involved and Chinalco's interest are shown in the table. Tom is going to go through each of the ventures in more detail later. But I think it is important to highlight that in all cases, where Rio Tinto is already the operator, Rio Tinto will maintain operational and management control of the assets within the ventures. The total investment by Chinalco in these ventures will be $12.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The second component is in the investment in subordinated convertible bonds, and Guy will describe the key features of these bonds in more detail later. But several aspects are set out here. Note in particular that the bonds are convertible at substantial premium to today's share price and the coupon rate of 9% on the PLC bonds, and 9.5% on the limited bonds are very competitive in today's credit environment.</p>
          <p>If they offer reconverted, Chinalco's interest in Rio Tinto will total 18%, including the 9.3%, which was purchased in February 2008. The two components of the transaction are inter-conditional and complementary, and assist ensuring that future partnership co-operation is maximized. Accordingly, we will be seeking approval for both components, it is not an either or proposal.</p>
          <p>Underpinning a proposed partnership is Rio Tinto's long standing recognition of the crucial role China is playing in the global economy. We all know the headlines that the implication of the scale of China's contribution to world economic growth should not be underestimated.</p>
          <p>For decades, only a quarter of global GDP was contributed by the developing world; and China, as you can see in the left hand columns, was only a fraction of that.</p>
          <p>By 2025, the developing world will contribute more than half of global GDP and China alone will contribute around 20%. This is a profound change that will inevitably lead to a transformation in political, economic, and social dynamics.</p>
          <p>The pioneering strategic partnership we announced today is a continuation of Rio Tinto's relationships with China. And it provides us, I think with an unrivaled competitive position in one of the world's key markets.</p>
          <p>Both Chinalco and Rio Tinto have agreed that this partnership must be built on strong independent governance structures ensuring continuity of strategy and continued commercial focus. At the corporate level, Independent Non-Executive Directors will continue to comprise a majority of the Rio Tinto boards.</p>
          <p>Chinalco will be entitled to nominate two Non-Executive Directors to complement the existing Boards, one of whom will be independent under recognized corporate governance standards. These appointments will be subject to approval by the Board's current nominations committee. These specifics and other principles designed to ensure continuity of independent and commercial decision-making have been included in a comprehensive relationship agreement executed between the companies.</p>
          <p>The commodity joint ventures will also incorporate strong governance mechanisms. Each will have a strategic alliance committee responsible for setting high level direction. Voting rights on each committee will reflect the economic interest of each party. And given Chinalco's interests are minority in each case, ultimate control will remain with Rio Tinto, where Rio Tinto is the operator of the relevant asset, existing operational arrangements will be maintained, including a commitment to save sustainable and ethical business practices, which new colleagues from Chinalco are fully supportive off.</p>
          <p>And I think that is a good moment for me to hand over and once again to welcome President Xiao of Chinalco to speak to you. President Xiao?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we made an investment into 9% of Rio Tinto last year. And from then, the long discussions between the two companies started.</p>
          <p>The transactions just outlined by Chairman Skinner I think is a very good testimony to our confidence over the longer term in Rio Tinto. As some may believe this transaction is also going to bring a lot of opportunities for Chinalco both in China and elsewhere in the world. Also we anticipate better return on our investment.</p>
          <p>Given that the partnership is established both at a shareholding -- at a corporate level and at asset level, we believe that this partnership will bring opportunities for additional value creation for both parties. Chinalco is a leading diversified resources company in China. We are ranked number three and number four and number five in terms of the production of aluminum and fabricated aluminum products in the world.</p>
          <p>While spending our businesses both in terms of the commodities and in terms of geography, we've made significant investments in Australia and Peru for example recently. Compared to Tinto, Chinalco is a relatively young company. We were formally established only back in 2001. But over the years, over the past few years we've managed to grow very fast.</p>
          <p>Expanding on our core competence over aluminum we have been expand into other commodities such as titanium, copper and other rare metals. We are also very focused on the environmental protection and our corporate responsibilities towards the host communities. So therefore we enjoy very good relations with all communities we are working.</p>
          <p>We believe this is a major step in developing our international presence in getting the company more familiar with best practices and et cetera worldwide and also we are able to establish corporation with both leaders in the sector. Despite the fact that we are a statements-owned company, I'd like to emphasize that we are run completely independently and commercially. All our decisions related to marketing production and capital expenditure is made by the management team independently.</p>
          <p>I believe that this investment is going to yield a very attractive financial return over the long term. As Tom and Guy will elaborate upon the details of the transactions, I will not delve too much on those, but I would just like to say that given the expertise of the management teams involved here, we are pretty confident that this transaction is only a start that will lead to many more opportunities in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We're announcing a transaction with Chinalco today which is consistent with our long-established corporate strategy. Rio Tinto remains fully focused on maximizing shareholder value, a first-stage developing and operating the portfolio of long life, low cost broad scale assets by maintaining and building industry-leading operational capability and of course by identifying and capturing great opportunities to create value whenever and wherever they may come.</p>
          <p>Our strategic partnership with Chinalco complements the strategy in four different ways. First, it does strongly support shareholder value by raising capital at a substantial premium to current market prices ensuring short-term financial uncertainty is eliminated. It provides us the flexibility to take advantage, full advantage of our unique asset base. This includes reducing the capital constraints that might otherwise limit our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy and being better positioned to respond when the recovery does come.</p>
          <p>We ensure funding remains for new investment opportunities without lowering the high standards we have set as part of our rigorous capital processes. And finally, it does position the company to benefit from the trends that are continuing to emerge for the resource industry, particularly driven by China.</p>
          <p>President Xiao has just described an independent commercial and successful resources company, possessing qualities which we believe make it the ideal partner for Rio Tinto. Generating an outstanding track record of growth and value creating investments, Chinalco successfully consolidated the Chinese aluminum sector. And now it's extending that footprint outside its core sector and geography.</p>
          <p>Starting with a steep downwards in <mark type="ph" /> China, the fastest growing market in the world for our commodities, Chinalco has developed a strong position in developing countries. Chinalco's access to strong financial support has been instrumental in its ability to participate in new opportunities for growth. In addition to this impressive business performance and competitive position, Chinalco's values and objectives are closely aligned with our own. Both Chinalco and Rio Tinto operate through governance process designed to foster independent commercial behavior and ensure commitment for maintaining the appropriate balance between excellent financial returns for our shareholders and sustainable development for the stakeholders and communities we work in.</p>
          <p>Our management teams are both experienced and professional and we are committed to openness including our desire to benefit from transparent capital markets. And finally, it's worth reminding ourselves that joint ventures with major Japanese and Chinese companies have been a key part of our business for over 20 years. The 19.5 billion of cash generated for Rio Tinto addresses our liquidity position, provides balance sheet strength and operational and strategic flexibility.</p>
          <p>Our potential proceeds will be used to meet our commitment made on December, 10, 2008 to pay $10 billion of debt by the end of 2009. Cash remained after this repayment is made, this could be applied to either further debt repayments or for selective investment. Above all, the critical point is this provides the company with flexibility. And these proceeds provided by Chinalco also underpin our progressive dividend policy and the maintenance for the 2008 full year dividend at the 2007 level.</p>
          <p>At this point, I want to talk in more detail about how this partnership will assist Rio Tinto to the greatest extent possible through important trends in the resources sector. Every aspect of the resources sector is becoming increasingly influenced by the developing world, and China in particular. Demand growth for commodity market is being driven by rapidly growing economies, such as China.</p>
          <p>New tier 1 resources were increasingly found in emerging geographies and the resources sector require the geological and geopolitical expertise to secure access to them. In addition, most activity in emerging markets will require a broader range of project execution skills. And finally rapid economic development, together with traditional and continued high savings rates, means the developing world is now an important new source of capital for all companies, not simply in the resources sector.</p>
          <p>Over next decade, access to developing world markets and resources, execution skills and finance will be the difference between the winners and the losers in our sector. There should be little doubt for irrespective of the current economic crisis, we are probably facing a long-term rebalancing of the global economy with the developing world and China playing ever great role based upon fundamental trends, demographics and industrialization. This is not new for Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>It should be recalled that when we established our first iron ore joint venture with China back in 1987, we were the first to export iron ore to China in 1973. We are also the first to recognize and respond to the structural upturn in the Chinese economic growth, by our early expansion in 2003 of our iron ores production in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>So Rio Tinto was only to recognize and welcoming the growing participation of China in the global economy and the opportunities this presents. We do believe that China's crunch more <mark type="ph" /> in driving global commodity demand will continue to grow into the future.</p>
          <p>The forecast in this chart show China's share of total demand and the demand growth in key commodities. Of course this is based upon December and January data that include an assessment of the impact of the unfolding global economic downturn. And it clearly shows the underlying economic forces that work in China, means this trend will not be derailed by the current economic conditions.</p>
          <p>The benefits to Rio Tinto of increasing our expertise in and access to Chinese markets is obvious. For us, volume growth must come from reaching new customers. Our new customers were overwhelmingly relocated in China. Our partnership with Chinalco positions Rio Tinto to benefit from these industry trends. Rio Tinto's knowledge of Chinese markets will be increased through access to Chinalco's insights regarding supply and demand dynamics and the power of potential market impact, our government policies stimulation and actions.</p>
          <p>With the particular useful time, when the Chinese government's stimulus package will be a key driver in global economic performance. Chinalco's assistance will be invaluable as we work to secure new resources in China, a country that's never been fully explored using modern exploration techniques. In addition, Chinalco's expertise, experience and connections in developing nations will assist Rio Tinto to access and develop new resources around the world. Chinalco's skills will added to Rio Tinto's own in developing new tier 1 assets.</p>
          <p>Maybe let's give a few examples. First, Chinalco will share its deep experience and knowledge of logistics in emerging countries. Second, relating to plans to leverage Chinalco's access to Chinese project development and execution capabilities. And third, we also do have a benefit of new technologies to develop in partnership with Chinalco on a commercial basis only. And finally, Chinalco will specifically attempt to <mark type="ph" /> secure capital for major projects or acquisition.</p>
          <p>Both Rio Tinto and Chinalco are very confident that we can work together to Chinese potential benefits and to value for Rio Tinto shareholders. In fact, we are quickly taking specific actions to realize this value. Rio Tinto and Chinalco today announced joint initiatives with some immediate benefits. That may include an agreement to access the potential for joint exploration in China.</p>
          <p>Our memorandum of understanding regarding possible joint development at Simandou iron ore province in Guinea. Other development protocols to share and jointly develop human resources, especially Rio Tinto's operational expertise, pension Chinalco sales and marketing personnel.</p>
          <p>And finally meetings have already been held to senior Rio Tinto's executives and Chinese banking officials to discuss potential opportunities for project-based finance. These have been constructive. We are very confident that Rio access to capital will be achieved.</p>
          <p>We firmly believe these initial examples of how the relationship between Rio Tinto and Chinalco can yield benefits to both parties, providing an indication of things to come. Chinalco's asset stakes purchase, of course means that we receive portion of earnings from the relevant assets going forward.</p>
          <p>On the attributable EBITDA basis and using second half 2008 data to capture the impact of the steep falls in traded commodity prices in the second half of last year. The attributable EBITDA acquired by Chinalco in the transaction represents about 8% of Rio Tinto's total attributable EBITDA. And this is consistent with our view of the MPV contribution made by the stakes transferred.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the details for the commodity joint ventures. Aluminum, as you already know companies have existing interests -- both companies have existing interest in aluminum in Queensland. And through this transaction, Chinalco's investments will be a Weipa, a 30% of the total economic interest with Rio Tinto at 70. Yarwun, 50% for both parties; and just under 50% of Rio's existing interest in Boyne and Gladstone Power Station.</p>
          <p>Taken together, Chinalco's performance interest in these full facilities have been applicable from 1 of July 2008 would represent about 4% of Rio Tinto Alcan's second half 2008 EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Apart from these investments and current operating businesses, Chinalco and Rio Tinto anticipate perusing up a number of further opportunities through the join venture. Including the potential to link forward closely with the adjacent Alcan lease and Weipa and near by resources as appropriate.</p>
          <p>The joint venture, the Chinese refining opportunities subject to Rio Tinto's usual commercial assessment procedures. The development of our human resources proves the comments and exchanges, and finally the use of technology, developed by the join venture at every locations operated by Rio Tinto and Chinalco.</p>
          <p>Rio Tinto and Chinalco have agreed to a number of specific marketing arrangements for the joint ventures bauxite resources, plus Rio Tinto's system requirements are satisfied and those of existing customers. A portion of the existing production at Weipa will be marketed by new joint venture marketing company, including the Chinese customers.</p>
          <p>Marketing of this, other bauxite will be managed by Rio Tinto on behalf of the joint venture. The joint venture will also negotiate at arm's length a multi-year commitment to supply Chinalco's allocation to Yarwun.</p>
          <p>The potential value -- the combination of Rio Tinto's assets and skills, with Chinalco's acknowledged aluminum expertise is outstanding. For copper, Chinalco's investment was a clear economic interest in Escondida, with just over 15% of the total Escondida economic interest, and Kennecott Utah Copper for 25% with Rio a 75%, and at Grasberg with 12% of the total economic interest as you know through the metal strip which is embedded within the Grasberg venture.</p>
          <p>Taken together and assuming that application had been from the 1st of July 2008 by way of example, these interests would have represented 36% of the Copper Group's EBITDA for the second half of 2008. And of course, these shares after the economic interest of the joint venture partners are taken into consideration.</p>
          <p>The joint venture also envisions Chinalco's joint participation in future projects and these include Chinalco's investment has also secured an economic interest and 30% of La Granja in Peru. And Rio Tinto and Chinalco will also discuss the potential to bring Chinalco's freeze <mark type="ph" /> projects into the joint venture. Our current market arrangements remain unaffected. We would anticipate the parties using Chinalco's skills to market La Granja production into China.</p>
          <p>Let's now talk about iron ore. In iron ore, Chinalco's investment will secure a 15% share in the wholly-owned businesses within Hamersley Iron. And had this joint venture been in effect from the first of July 2008, this share would represent about 10% of the iron ore group, product group, EBITDA for the second half of 2008. Chinalco investors have agreed to consider a number of future opportunities including the potential for joint participation and future expansions of Hamersley Iron production and consideration how best to jointly participate in the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.</p>
          <p>In addition, Rio Tinto and Chinalco will form a jointly-owned sales company, managed by Rio Tinto iron ore to market 30% of Hamersley Iron output from China. Rio Tinto will be the ultimate marketer of this product on the behalf of this company similar and consistent with the approach used in our other joint ventures in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>Chinalco's assistance to market Hamersley Iron ore product into China strengthens Rio Tinto's already strong iron ore position enormously. Chinalco's investing in the 100%-owned assets of Hamersley Iron which include an addition to the mines, our two ports and associated rail infrastructure. These are core elements at the Hamersley operations in WA will create a completely new joint venture. It is important to recognize this joint venture sits outside of the other Rio Tinto iron ore joint ventures in the Pilbara, such as So if it is Hope Downs, Channar, and Robe River.</p>
          <p>We know how to manage joint ventures and have decades of experience in running joint ventures with competitors as well as their Japanese and Chinese customers. This is an established part of the mining industry and has always been a source of funds for future mineral development.</p>
          <p>Now let's close by recapping the core benefits of the proposed transaction. First it raises capital at a substantial premium to current market valuations. Guy will go into this in more detail in a minute, but I note at this point that there are several aspects at the Board for asset-level investments and the convertible bonds that are demonstrably favorable. Particularly when considered in light of current economic conditions and the avenue being used by almost all others through this capital. I believe this demonstrates the optionality, the suite of tier 1 assets can give a company both in good times and in bad.</p>
          <p>Second, Chinalco's cash investments eliminates near-term uncertainty regarding Rio Tinto's financial position by steadily strengthening our balance sheet. We are proceeding with our previously announced non-core asset divestment program at a pace which provides best value for Rio Tinto's shareholders.</p>
          <p>Third, the transaction provides Rio Tinto with the flexibility to undertake investments throughout the cycle. And as far as today's announcement, we can confirm that the Yarwun, Kestrel and Clermont expansions will proceed. And work will commence to facilitate an expansion in Hail Creek. In addition we are continuing preparatory activities in respect to Pilbara 320 but we do need to wait for some meaningful and credible signs of the economic recovery. Above and beyond these specific announcements, we have restored our ability to pursue opportunities as they arise. This transaction will alleviate about 2000 job reductions including contractors and projects in Australia, which would otherwise have been difficult to advance.</p>
          <p>Finally, as I have explained this transaction creates a strategic partnership with an unparalleled ability to benefit from emerging industry trends. This is about long-term strategy. We were also able to point to several tangible examples today. We have agreed to jointly pursue possible exploration opportunities in China, and jointly consider how Simandou might be best developed. Further China's -- and Chinalco's relationship within China have already facilitated the introduction of key Rio Tinto executives to Chinese policy banks, which may lead to further access to Chinese funding.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to now turn over to Guy in Australia, who went through some of the metrics for the transaction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. When entering a transaction like this, the Board has to weigh out all comparable alternatives, and this we've done in considerable detail. A large number of options have been reviewed and value has always remained the paramount consideration for the Board in reaching its conclusions.</p>
          <p>Overall we've concluded that this package from Chinalco, given its scale, valuation premium and strategic benefits, represents the most value creating means for the group to meet its financial commitments. We've talked a lot today about the generation of $19.5 billion in cash for Rio Tinto's shareholders through this transaction. But I would like to explore with you some of the quantitative metrics which demonstrate why we concluded this transaction was in the best interest of our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I should highlight as the outset, that quantitative comparisons during a time of severely dislocated, debt and equity markets needs to be made with due caution. With this in mind the overall transaction can best be broken down into three components which can be compared quite readily to objective external data. The prices achieved in relation to asset investments, the price premium at which the convertible bonds convert, and the coupon rate payable on the convertible bonds.</p>
          <p>In each case, we believe that the outcome achieved is a favorable result, particularly given the context in which this transaction takes place. This reflects both Chinalco's recognition of the quality of Rio Tinto's assets and its confidence in the group's prospects. The parties negotiated in agreement for Chinalco to invest in a number of assets for proceeds totaling $12.3 billion. In order to provide transparency on the value inherent in this transaction, we are providing an asset-by-asset breakdown of the value as shown here. This will enable you to undertake a rigorous analysis of the transaction fundamentals. We believe that these valuations speak for themselves.</p>
          <p>This transaction is the best overall package for shareholders for three key reasons: firstly, the commercials terms of the transaction, both in the asset sales and the convertible bonds represent premium value. Secondly, the proceeds of the $19.5 billion completely meet Rio Tinto's financial obligations over the next two years. While the sum may appear large, it definitely removes -- it definitively removes any financial concerns that may arise should the downturn turn out to be more protracted. Finally, the transaction restores flexibility to the group, by allowing us to invest through the cycle and it provides strategic benefits in the form of a deep relationship with the key player in our largest market.</p>
          <p>Chinalco's investments in the commodity joint ventures are at a premium to current implied asset values as measured by Rio Tinto's enterprise value. Simply put, Chinalco has paid 18% of Rio Tinto's current market enterprise value for an 8% share of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>These numbers are based on second half 2008 earnings and market enterprise value is calculated using share prices on the 30 of January 2009 prior to our release disclosing that we are in discussion with Chinalco. This represents a premium of 124% to our current market enterprise value.</p>
          <p>On the same basis of calculation the premium to market capitalization is 287%. The equivalent share price implied by the investments in the asserts is &#xA3;58 or AUD $163 per share.</p>
          <p>The next slide presents a number of details regarding the convertible bonds. Rio Tinto plans to issue two trenches of subordinated convertible bonds totaling $7.2 billion. The first charge convertible at $45 per share will contribute $3.1 billion in funds while the second charge convertible at $60 per share will contribute $4.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The coupon is 9% for bonds issued out of PLC and 9.5% bonds issued out of limited. The bonds are subordinated to other Rio Tinto debt and carry no voting rights until conversion. The bonds have been structured with the aim of achieving 50% equity credit from the rating agencies.</p>
          <p>Standard and Poor's has indicated subject to satisfactory final documents and the amount to be issued relative to the capital of the Group. The bonds would be eligible for intermediate or 50% equity credit. The amount of the equity credit is of course subject to final conformation by the agencies.</p>
          <p>The bonds mature after six years with an option after seven years for Rio Tinto to redeem the bond. After this time, Rio Tinto has the flexibility to refinance the bond to take advantage of credit market conditions. Chinalco has the right to convert the bonds at any time. If fully converted, Chinalco's interest in Rio Tinto will increase from the current 9.3% to 18%. Chinalco's interest in Rio Tinto limited will be 14.9% and in Rio Tinto Plc 19%.</p>
          <p>Now regardless of whether you are considering Plc or Limited, the conversion premium secured in respect of the convertible bonds that Rio Tinto proposes to issue in respect to this transaction are very high. Based on Rio Tinto's share prices on the 30 of January, as I said in the last trading day prior to our announcement that we were in discussions with Chinalco that conversion premium secured range from a low of 68% to a high of a 176% above the share price. Based on the historical records that we've been able to find this is very favorable. As a result, this premium can be seen as a strong signal regarding Chinalco's confidence in the valuation potential of Rio Tinto's assets and prospects.</p>
          <p>Given the size of the convertible note proposed to be issued to Chinalco, the fact that it's subordinated to all other group debt and the attractive terms of the issue, one could quite reasonably expect the coupon to be priced very substantially higher than the current BBB senior corporate bond deal of around 8.5%.</p>
          <p>Comparable securities issued recently have had higher coupons coupled with much lower conversion price relative to market. Of course those of you, who are familiar with the state of the corporate bond markets at the moment, would be aware that an issue of this size would be unlikely if not impossible to perform. The convertible bonds represent very competitive financing terms for Rio Tinto, particularly in current markets and given their subordination.</p>
          <p>As it's customary in this type of transaction, we've agreed a break fee of 1%, which will become payable if the Board change its recommendation that shareholders should approve this transaction.</p>
          <p>There is also an exclusivity arrangement in which both parties have agreed not to solicit competing third party proposals prior to completion. These are inline with market practice and sound fiduciary principles.</p>
          <p>There are a number of pre-conditions before they proposed transaction can close. These are the following: first of all, Rio Tinto shareholders must approve the transaction. This is through a joint elect through vote of Rio Tinto Plc and Limited shareholders at which a simple majority vote in favor must be achieved.</p>
          <p>Secondly, government approvals must be secured including foreign investment reviews as appropriate. Rio Tinto has already begun a cooperative process to ensure that these reviews occur in an open, efficient, and timely basis.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, Chinalco must finalize their own financing arrangements, which they must have committed to do by the 31st of March 2009. We would anticipate closing the transaction late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me hand you back to Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you very much indeed. Before I just finally recap the benefits of this proposed transaction, I want to speak very briefly about the benefits of the partnership for those countries in which we currently operate and those which we will operate in future.</p>
          <p>The proposed alliance sets the platform for relationships with China for the both broader and deeper than today. We feel this partnership will provide examples for others, who seek investment and trade relationships with Chinese firms, not only in the resources sector, but in the commercial world more generally.</p>
          <p>The partnership also represents a very strong link to potential resource sector funding. It introduces a new source of capital at a time when investment capital from traditional partners is scarce. In this way, our stakeholder countries will be able to benefit from continued reinvestment throughout the cycle, and in turn, from greater economic growth in the next upswing.</p>
          <p>We believe access and insight to the Chinese market will assist our stakeholder countries to retain their global market share of resource production. Every new customer Rio Tinto supplies, generates wealth not only for our shareholders, but for the countries in which we operate. Similarly it increases the potential for firms to work more closely with Chinese firms on joint initiatives of common interest, Princo for example would be something to think of in the terms.</p>
          <p>In summary then, you have seen the proposed transaction delivers a comprehensive package of benefits reaffirming Rio Tinto's strength and potential. It strengthens our balance sheet. It gives us the flexibility to understand high value strategic growth at all points of the cycle. And it positions us at the forefront of industry trends involving China and the developing world.</p>
          <p>President Xiao said to you that in Chinalco, we found an excellent partner, and your investment is a clear vote of confidence in our company's strength growth prospects and outlook. We expect to be able to execute the transaction within the timeframe that is reasonable for all stakeholders. We will of course be asking for the approval of both Plc and Limited shareholders, who will receive the Board's strong and unanimous recommendation.</p>
          <p>So at this point, thank you and we will start some question and answers. Nigel Jones, who is Head of Investor Relations is going to coordinate this given that we have people coming from different places and Nigel will ask you to manage the flow of questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start off with people in this auditorium. I can see questions at back. If you just gave your name and institution please. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thanks Nigel. Rob Clifford, Deutsche Bank. Two questions one is quite simple, would you be doing this transactions if you would, so if your balance sheet wasn't so distressed. And the second question probably for Guy. For the assets under consideration -- can he just articulate which ones will be that Chinalco will take an equity stake and then which ones will have strategic alliance note associated with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the why-now; clearly this proposition does a number of things. It deals with the financing challenges the company has had, but it is I think on a look forward basis a great source of the economic opportunity and value creation.</p>
          <p>We have been engaged over quite a lot long period in discussion with our friends from Chinalco, and we are attracted to this opportunity as much by what it will do to create future value as it's moving to deal with financing challenges. So, it's something which in its aggregate deals I think very well with all the issues.</p>
          <p>So I think even if we were not in a position of having to address balance sheet issues, the fact that we are moving through a period, which could not quite a long time have major economic challenge in the world; the idea of striking such a partnership at this time is very appealing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Second order questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going through the whole list and maybe I could come back to on it, but I mean substantially we're looking at let us stop type transactions in the Hamersley and the Escondida case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Sander Cain <mark type="ph" /> from Sanford Bernstein. Just two questions; first, why the size; I mean you are going to take out a couple of these old trenches in addition to capital cash flow that will probably take out another year. So you're going to take out three quarters of your debt load.</p>
          <p>Is this your view of the cycle or was it this size or nothing in terms of the offer by Chinalco. And just in terms of the iron ore sales company, they've taken 15% of the asset, your 30% is going into JV sales company. Why the difference there? And if it's commercially separate, what about doing the sales company at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I will tackle both of those questions. We recognized in our commitment in December 10 that a $10 billion debt payment would address the financial challenges in 2009. I think we've had quite active engagement with economists and also our shareholders recognizing that there is considerable economic uncertainty out there in the world and we could be in for two years of rough water in these markets.</p>
          <p>We'd hope that things will improve before that, but it's very realistic in the uncertainty in the market, and the fact that there could be other shocks coming hopefully there won't be in the financial sector that we still have some rough water. This transaction provides us with the flexibility and provides us with the ability to see through roughly two years of any reasonable person downside scenario.</p>
          <p>On the iron ore sales, again this is consistent with the joint ventures that we've had, and we've worked with for a long periods, literally decades. The 30% number means that 30% of the Hamersley that will be going into the -- roughly into the Chinese steel sector. That compares with the current statistic, which is 56% of the Hamersley business going into that Chinese sales sector. So I think this is -- it is more than adequate headroom in terms of the amount of iron ore produced within the Hamersley business -- the Hamersley iron business for the Chinese sale sector. Again we would hope that over time the relationship with Chinalco will bring new customers into the Hamersley project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Three questions if I may, please. Firstly, I should know, but what is the threshold for the vote for your shareholders to approve of the steel. Secondly, within the minority disposals, will that be once the deal is closed any preemption rights buy Chinalco to actually when Rio Tinto was to be approached in the future to take advantage of that situation. And then just lastly, with regard to your disposal targets, you mentioned before and the non-core assets you still have from Alcan, where do you we stand there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I think first of all -- I think I said this. Correct me if I'm wrong, Guy, that the threshold for the vote would have been a majority 50% plus one.</p>
          <p>The second: within the minority interest, what are the preemptive rates? The only case, where Chinalco has preemptive rates would be in Yarwun, everything else there are no preemptive rights.</p>
          <p>And then finally with respect to disposals, and maybe, Guy, if you want to say anything more about this, I will say that the businesses we've talked about particularly the downstream aluminum businesses, they're not strategic within the Rio Tinto suit of assets. We would see ourselves continuing with those and possibly some others, but maybe Guy, if you want to say anything more on disposals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are continuing with the preexisting, pre-announced disposals that we made -- we listed back at the end of 2007. In December of last year, we said that we were looking at other disposals. Of course, we are making some today, although there are any disposals of interest rather than disposals of businesses.</p>
          <p>I think the Chinalco transaction gives us the flexibility to be much more demanding, and maybe not to sell any other businesses. Although the process of examining whether we should sell our core asset is something that we do constantly. So I think the key point to make is we are finished the disposal of the downstream aluminum businesses and probably some others, but we don't have to do that in such a rush.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think maybe, I just close the buyers with just a point that, two months ago, we announced that we were expanding a list of disposal opportunities and it's fair to say, we had very active discussions with all of the major players in the sector. The Wall A <mark type="ph" /> transaction we announced two weeks ago would have emanated from that active interest. So, we've now been two months into that expanded list. I think we've got a pretty good flavor for interest out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Mike Hatch <mark type="ph" /> from ING. Three questions if I may. I hear what you say about the valuation on the assets, but can I ask why you don't think it suits also and why all of your shareholders to participate for helping to bring the debt down?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I should've done the math, but I haven't, I am sure, Guy has. You are gearing at the end of '08 with 63% following the right bonds. If you treat the bond as 100% debt or as the debt equity hybrid, what happens to that gearing? And what is your current feeling on the optimum level of gearing. And thirdly in terms of the assets being sold, you're selling a higher proportion in terms of earning of copper; does that imply anything about any shift in your view of the strategic benefits of various portions of your group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think let Guy take the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the third one on offering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, you want it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the first question, I mean as I've said, we've looked at all the options that we had worked on and created in recent times. And none of them included a rights issue, where we would appeal to our -- all our shareholders to contribute to the company. And when we evaluated all those options, we did conclude that the Chinalco transactions stood head and shoulders above the others.</p>
          <p>And the reason for that mainly was its comprehensive nature. The premium values that we attained for the assets that we were selling. The premium values that we retained -- we attained through the convertible. And we contrasted that with the big discount that would apply in the event that we did the rights issue. So I think that when we look at the scale and the value attributes, it was very clear, when you then also combine the strategic attributes that Chinalco offered the best option to us.</p>
          <p>On your second question, I haven't done the numbers. I probably should have done on what we will do to gearing, clearly it will substantially reduce it in respect of the asset sales. I think that it is important to understand that this bond does have many equity characteristics and it is, at the very least a substantial timing out of our obligations. As to what our long-term gearing rate should be, there was a time three or four years ago when people said that the company was -- had too strong a balance sheet. Now that certainly wouldn't be said today. I think that what we are looking for and have obtained through the Chinalco transaction is flexibility and that's something that which we do attribute some value to. And it is for that reason that the Board's target of attaining A-debt rating remains in place. Now we got a bit of a work to do to get to that point, but what it tells you is that we will still be working on reducing the level of debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally on the copper question, just due to the importance of KUC and our interest in Escondida and the overall -- our overall copper portfolio, I think it just by it's math will lead it to a higher EBITDA percentage. But that, no way does that diminish my appetite for copper. I think we will continue to pursue a number of copper development opportunities, including ground fields expansions within the businesses that are within the relationship with Chinalco, including moving ahead with La Granja, hopefully bringing the other proven assets at La Granja into that. But I would say from my perspective, I have an appetite for additional copper opportunities elsewhere from a global perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. I would like to pause there for a second and move to secondary, which is the over floor. I believe there is a group who may have some questions. Claire, would you like to take a few questions?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give you some idea whether there is any tax impact or strategy issues with the asset sales? And also in terms of the strategic alliances, are they across all assets within those particular groups or only just the ones related to the transactions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I'll take those questions. I mean there is, there are relatively low to very small tax attributes to this transaction as it happens. We've structured it carefully, of course and appropriately so that that is the case. On the strategic alliances, it's very important to understand that the governance of these joint ventures has been most carefully constructed so that control does not pass, but that appropriate minority protections are given. And those minority protections apply solely to the assets in which Chinalco is investing and they do not apply more widely. Next question please. You are very quiet today. There is one in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, can I ask you a question to Chinalco please; Bill Hairston of Jeff Capital Partners <mark type="ph" />. Part of the rationale for BHP's bid for Rio was the cost synergies in the iron ore businesses. If the iron ore was marketed separately, would you contemplate a merger of the two businesses to try and capture some of those cost synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a fair question, fair comment. First of all, let me say we are very impressed by the low cost nature of the quarter -- of the assets that we are involved in, we're investing in Rio Tinto. And secondly let me say that I have a very optimistic view in terms of the long-term prospects of the sector, including the potential to further reduce cost in the current portfolio. Thank you.</p>

Just what are the framework that's going to govern how that fund works in future?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Guy I will start off with the early comments. Feel free to supplement. Again we've recognized the importance was to look at the aggregate of the transaction, the full size of 19.5 recognized in the bulk of the value would have been in the existing operating assets. But there is a longer term intent to create synergistic opportunities on developments. So what we wanted to do is to again get to our shareholders, get to the market as soon as we could with the full details and the full transparency of the transaction. And it gives both sets of teams time to work out what are those predominant opportunities and certainly they would be of more than fair value for Rio Tinto shareholder perspective.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Glenn Wilcock <mark type="ph" /> with UBS. I've just got two questions. Firstly, I understand your rationale led -- I think I understand the rational for using EBIT, EBITDA to say it was a hard premium sale, mean your EBITDA multiple is severely depressed because of your debt. You've always used that way If I look at previous sales from your last five transactions, I think down at probably against marketing where it's <mark type="ph" /> twice times, three times. This one looks like against what most people had in the market maybe a 20% premium. I would have thought why not just if you're prepared to sell what I would consider tier-1 assets, why didn't you just do an auction to 15% of Hamersley, your half share in Escondida. I'm sure you would have got a much better price than perhaps what you would have got now you're showing us today. The second question is, and no one has asked it and I guess I will, is obviously the Board is unanimous now but there was an issue literally a week ago. I'd wonder if you could make any comment on that as well, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I do with Glenn's <mark type="ph" /> second question. I think these are very big issues and very big choices. It would not be at all surprising to expect in a Board like ours, we would have a very full discussion before reaching a landing point. We reached a landing point and it was one of clear unanimity. There was only one person who started that journey, who felt he couldn't come to the point of alignment with the rest of the Board which created of course a terrible situation. So he tended his resignation which was unanimously accepted by the Board.</p>
          <p>It was a surprise. It was a disappointment, but we are very much in Rio Tinto. And I sense your Board, certainly in the 5.5 years that I've been sharing that Board through Alcan, through the various BHP issues. We have never been other than unanimous. That is our position today. For somebody to arrive, express a view, which is completely discordant with others is inevitably going to produce that result. But we move on, and I'm personally committed to insure that the process that we are describing to you today, reaches a point of positive conclusion and what we planned properly for the next succession.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glen, maybe I will start off with your EBITDA versus cash and maybe, Guy, if you want to supplement that. But, yeah, I think that whether you look at it on an EBITDA basis or a cash basis, and again recognizing there are things we've got so much price volatility over the past six months. There are quite a few views on prices. I think under virtually any view of prices that I have seen this is a strong premium including a forward view of long-term prices.</p>
          <p>I will also say that again we've been -- since the 10 of December had on shortage of expressions of interest and in some cases some serious discussions with the major players about what would be seen as their idea of value and individual assets. And I can very clearly say with the 1.0 referring to that the broad economics, the broad package of the Chinalco proposal is vastly superior here to what we've seen.</p>
          <p>But Guy, if you want to talk about EBITDA versus cash flow multiples.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Glen, of course you are right that MPV is the primary metric, which we use when we look at assets and investments and for that matter divestments. As you know, we also look at the metrics, which we described to the investment community a few months ago, which encompasses different outlooks for price and different views of results conversion into reserves.</p>
          <p>I am not saying that when we look at the prices that we have been offered by Chinalco for these assets, they compare well when we look at that metrics with our own internal net present values for most of these assets. In addition to that, you need to consider a couple of other factors. This is a package, it's not just the asset sales. It's also the convertible. The whole thing comes together. And we think that taken together, this is a compelling combination.</p>
          <p>The other factor, I just leave with you to think about it is that these are minority stakes, no control premium has been paid for these minority stakes and the MPVs may -- you might think that the MPVs that are calculated by the market do contain a control premium, because they are valued for 100% of each of the assets. So I think when you come to consider all those factors, the package, the position in the metrics and the fact the control hasn't passed, you can see that actually this is a compelling value proposition.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Brandon Hass <mark type="ph" /> from Macquarie Bank. Sort of tossing with Glenn's question I guess is, Escondida for instance, an area I am particularly interested in EBITDA or one of those metrics is being completely cruised by provisioning processing and loss on copper contracts in the period.</p>
          <p>So, it's probably not a good guide to the future. But I'm more interested in what you view is on the exploration outside of that asset, particularly in the context of the recent drilling results, and how you achieved value that over and above the existing operation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Brendan, I'll tackle that. Of course in the second half of last year, Escondida was negatively impacted by operating problems, particularly the mill problems, it was impacted by provisional pricing just because the market pricing took the concentrating process, and also some severe hedge losses and that all brought those numbers down.</p>
          <p>So we do have to look also that matter on an MPV basis in addition to on an EBITDA basis and certainly there is a lot of value in Escondida. It's one of the premier copper assets. And I think the evaluations and what Chinalco has provided recognizes that and certainly from my perspective, I do think that that is more than a fair price on Escondida, looking at either on an EBITDA or an MPV basis, including the exploration potential of Pampa Escondida.</p>
          <p>I can remember four years ago with Maria <mark type="ph" /> speaking there I think both Maria and I agreed we need to do some more drilling on Escondida. There was more potential there. And I am very pleased to see the exploration results that they have generated over the past two years, the good exploration effort out there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Jason Faircliff <mark type="ph" /> from Merrill Lynch. I just have a question for President Xiao if I may. Could you discuss the current economics of aluminum production in China, and did you consider an investment into Rio Tinto's outcome assets, and if not, why not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in terms of the first question, total size of the aluminum sector in China is still growing pretty fast. We have some over supply right now. That's why we are seeing pretty low prices last December.</p>
          <p>But the good thing is actually prices are coming back this year. We are seeing somewhere between 15 and 20% rise from the bottom.</p>
          <p>There is a unique nature in the power sector in china, which is cost of power comes down when we move from the eastern coastal region to the inward western regions -- to the inland western regions. So we are seeing a migration of supply of aluminum. Also away from the coastal regions and into the inland regions.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I am very optimistic about the demand for aluminum products, especially when the economy comes back in the near future. We had an excellent year actually in 2007 with 39% growth in production and 43% growth in sales. We don't expect to see something as spectacular as that any time soon, but I am confident that this sector has a whole will maintain a growth rate thrice as much as the GDP growth rate.</p>
          <p>Answer to the second question is very simple. Rio Tinto doesn't want to sell. Otherwise we would very much like to invest. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, with due respect do you mind, what I asked about actually was the economics of the aluminum production in China. Is aluminum production profitable in China today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Production of primary aluminum is due loss making now. The average cost per ton is 13,000 RMB, whereas the price is slightly below 12,000 by now.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" />. Our analysis of the Chinese smelting situation with the downturn in China we have seen power generating capacity moved surprisingly quickly from being in deficit before the Olympics to being in surplus now. So, I think we've seen that having some effect on power rates and that's probably had some effect on bringing down the cost of smelting capacity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay we're going to take just one more question in this session. Sam?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam Catalano, from Macquarie. Two questions; first given your recent flexibility assuming the dealers approved and if you do like further asset sales, will Rio Tinto become acquisitive with that flexibility? And secondly, have your view of the long-term pricing changed in the last six months and particularly since the <mark type="indiscernible" /> was rescinded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you I may comment both of those. I'll put this into personal context. My first call of the day today was with our senior managers in Australia and I'll finish it off with call with our senior managers in Western Hemisphere this evening. I'd say to everyone just because we've announced this deal doesn't mean that the check books are open.</p>
          <p>They've got to keep the capital down. They've got to keep the operating cost reductions in place. We are in two years at very difficult economic times and we have to be very tight in all capital spending and all operating spending in this period of time. I think in terms of the long-term view of prices and how that may have evolved over the past six months, in many ways that is still a work in progress, because what we are seeing is a change in many of the input costs and as you know our long term -- our fundamental approach to long-term price formation is based upon margins over long-term costs.</p>
          <p>So what we've got to do is we got to see how this economic period of difficulty has an effect on long-term costs. Clearly oil price is an example; everyone had a view that the long-term price of oil was much higher than it would be today and that would flow through long-term cost structures and long-term price formation. So I think we just have to see how the volatility in the market plays out over the next year or two, but I suspect that the longer we see a downturn, the more it will drive down long-term cost inputs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks Jim. I think if we may again pause this session now. You'd be aware that we obviously have our annual results coming up in a few minutes. So I would like to sort of stop for five minutes break to anyone who doesn't want to stay can have an a break, so they can be in five minutes with us. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome back to the second part of our presentation today, which covers our 2008 results. 2008 was I think we all appreciate a year of two very different parts. Starting with a continuation of strong demand and prices but finishing with the pick in the last quarter where the rapid sliding prices driven by the collapse in global economic conditions.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the results we announced today reflects strong operational performance underpinned by strong demand in pricing until the third quarter of the year. Underlying earnings set another record, an uplift of 38% to $10.3 billion. The percentage increase in EBITDA was 60%.</p>
          <p>However, net earnings declined 50% reflecting an impairment charge, the great majority of which related to Alcan goodwill and the downstream assets in the Alcan package. But not withstanding current aluminum market weakness, we remained convinced that the addition of the Alcan assets to our portfolio and the integration into Rio Tinto will be a source of long-term value for the company. The combined assets of Rio Tinto-Alcan provide aluminum industry leadership, based on bauxite reserves and resources, a competitive refining capability in low-cost smelting, supported of course by hydro power which will be increasingly valuable in a carbon-constrained world.</p>
          <p>Synergies are ahead of target and our expectation remains to deliver $1.1 billion in 2010. Last year we invested a record of $8.5 billion in capital projects, which will position us well when the recovery comes. While our growth options are valuable long-term assets, we are acting decisively in response to weak market conditions to reduce capital expenditures in 2009 and to drive operating cost reductions across our business.</p>
          <p>Finally as part of our commitment to reduce net debt by $10 billion in this year 2009, we've decided to maintain the full 2008 dividend -- the 2008 full year dividend, the 2007 level of $1.36 per share. And our progressive dividend policy remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>After strong market conditions for most of 2008, the fourth quarter saw a rapid decline in the demand for and the prices of most of our principal products. So metal markets have entered 2009 at their lowest pricing levels for several years with poor near-term demand prospects and high inventories. A number of governments as we know are using a range of fiscal and monitory policies to stimulate activity. But our view is that there is likely to be a delay which perhaps could be extended before these measures have any impact on stabilizing the demand for commodities.</p>
          <p>The slowdown in OECD economies is likely to endure due to consumer and government debt burdens and constrained credit market conditions. But we do believe that the recovery in Chinese economic activity will come through in response to the substantial stimulus package of 4 trillion renminbi announced by the government. Opinions vary on the underlying risks and the likely success of government support measures and there is clearly uncertainty over the pattern of the economic activity over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
          <p>Commodity producers, we included have responded quickly to weak demand in pricing conditions and constrained access to credit. Many mining projects have been abandoned or delayed and this may provide support for prices in the longer term. We expect China's long-term growth to continue as a major driver of demand. But capital metals consumption in China and other emerging economies remains materially below the level in developed economies, suggesting scope for significant incremental demand over an extended period, once the current period of severe cyclical adjustment comes to an end.</p>
          <p>We believe that the fundamentals of the Chinese market and other fast-growing markets like India remain intact and the industry's long-term prospects remain positive. We are focused on the future to ensure we are best positioned for the upturn when it comes. In 2008, we've put important building blocks in place with major development projects, testing technology for automated mines and renewing our organizational structure to maximize the benefits of standardized and shared management approaches.</p>
          <p>And with that introduction Tom, I'd like to turn it over to you. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Safety is a core as you've heard in the past relative to businesses as a value and a key indicator of management's performance. In 2008 we integrated the Alcan safety data with those of Rio Tinto and this led to an overall lost time injury frequency rate and all injury frequency rate to be rebased at a slightly higher level.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to say in 2008, since integrating the safety data, the downward trajectory for our safety rate has continued for the group as a whole. And the safety record as measured by both all-injury frequency rate and lost-time injury frequency rate is improving, and we resolved to continue this improvement trend before Rio Tinto was established over many, many years. These are industry-leading safety data. However, we can not be complacent. We had 18 fatalities this year including ten at a terrible helicopter tragedy in Peru, following year.</p>
          <p>Most in these fatalities were contractors and we are working hard to drive improvement in our contractor management systems. Overall we are committed to working toward a work environment of zero harm.</p>
          <p>In the second half this year, we've seen unprecedented global economic downturn, resulting in a rapid decline in the price environment for our products. We do not know when these conditions will improve and we need to be prepared for two years of economic uncertainty.</p>
          <p>In this context, I would like to reiterate our commitment to reduce our net debt by $10 billion by the end of 2009. Of course the announcement today, of our transaction with Chinalco will over deliver against our $10 billion debt reduction target. This transaction is the best financial solution for the group, with additional long-term business benefits.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, we've been taking active measures since the 10th of December to address our financial position. We are reducing operating expenditures by 2.5 billion in 2010 producing global head count by 14,000 differing and canceling projects, thereby reducing capital expenditure in 2009 to approximately $4 billion.</p>
          <p>These decisions were difficult and the actions even more difficult, but necessary in the current economic climate. We've made good progress since December on these fronts in a short period of time. We've already achieved over 40% of our global head count reduction target with more on the way, and we completed a full review of our capital projects. And just in January we were successful in divesting $1.7 billion of assets including the Corumb&#xE1; iron ore projects in Brazil, our potash assets in Argentina and Canada, and the Ningxia aluminum sponsor in China.</p>
          <p>We have acted early, we have acted decisively and swiftly to assure that we are well placed to operate in challenging markets that we currently face. The actions together with the Chinalco deal will strengthen our balance sheet maximize cash generation and give us greater flexibility enabling us to be well-positioned to resume growth programs when we see improvements in underlying demand trends.</p>
          <p>Since our announcement on the 10th of December, we completed a full review of our projects and either slow to deferred most of them down. Projects that currently expected to continue include projects that will be completed in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2009 such as Hope Downs phase 2 and QMM, or necessarily just the same production levels such as Mesa A and Brockman 4, both in the Pilbara.</p>
          <p>The transaction, which Chinalco will allow us to pursue the development of some of the projects that were at the margin including Clermont, Kestrel and Yarwun 2. We would not have been able to fund these attractive projects without the Chinalco solution.</p>
          <p>The Argyle and Diavik underground expansions will continue albeit at a much slower rate, which will delay production start up when they are ready to go. It is important to note that for all of our projects, we will continue to retain maximum flexibility to bring them back on stream. Of course, we'll use this time to see if we can optimize project design, we visit the costs and reduce further CapEx requirements.</p>
          <p>Turning now to individual businesses; in our IRL Group <mark type="ph" /> in 2008, we set records across the board. Underlying earnings for the year, was 126% supported by higher prices and higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Early in 2008, we committed to selling 15 million tons on a spot pricing basis. We are happy to say that we met that commitment as much as this material -- most of this material being sold in the first three quarters with the differential between spot and contract prices, where that is highest levels.</p>
          <p>Production did ramp up during the first three quarters of the year. It was impacted during the latter months by reduced customer demand and reduced shipments as the global economic shut down and slow down affected global demand. It certainly impacted steel production. As a result, we reduced production run rates in November as announced to align our current customer delivery requirements.</p>
          <p>With the completion of the Cape Lambert expansion to 80 million tons, the Pilbara infrastructure has reached an important milestone with the total shipping capacity of 220 million tons. These projects were completed on time and on budget. In the fourth quarter, we were able to rebuild iron ore stock piles to appropriate levels, current stockpiles and the availability of additional capacity has created a position of flexibility to respond to improvements in market conditions.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our group wide guidance for capital expenditure in 2009, several iron ore projects had been deferred pending marketing improvement, projects that currently plan to continue to include Hope Downs phase 2, which is expected to be completed by this quarter, the development of Mesa A and Brockman 4, which are required to sustain production near 220 million tons per year and the power station in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>Expenditures at Simandou have been scaled back. We remain in dialog with Government of Guinea to resolve outstanding matter related to the concession area. Overall, iron ore is a core element of Rio Tinto's value proposition. Low cost operations with a structural infrastructure and location advantage, existing assets, which are capable of expansion go over both opportunities and a robust long-term demand outlook. These are ideally positioned to deliver substantial value to Rio Tinto shareholders.</p>
          <p>We've recently seen some improvement in the market as Chinese core iron ore inventories have declined more than 15 million tons since the peak in October and currently stand at just under 60 million tons. It is too early to claim though that the market or anything has turned, but this will provide us some support for the stock price.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure and capacity and our system given our recent investment program, we are well placed to restart our production growth when conditions presume.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to aluminum. I will -- certainly less than the first half as one of the lowest cost producers in the sector, Rio Tinto-Alcan had a positive contribution to EBITDA and underlying earnings in the second half of 2008 even if they're in the phase of very challenging pricing conditions.</p>
          <p>Comparing the period on a period of change in EBITDA margins, Rio Tinto-Alcan outperformed its peers given the quality of our assets. And this is an example of the uniqueness in quality of the Rio Tinto-Alcan assets. For the full year, earnings rose 87 million to $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Higher volumes from the inclusion of Alcan were partially offset a higher costs for caustic, coke, and pitch and alloys. Our 185 million write down of inventories to reflect the realizable values at the end of the year and a write off of the valuation costs, primarily to coke and then Melbourne <mark type="ph" />.</p>
          <p>Not included in underlying earnings were 7.9 billion of impairment charges related to the assets of Rio Tinto-Alcan, and Guy will further provide details later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>The investment basis of the Alcan acquisition remains sound. Rio Tinto has a valuable set of assets and the aluminum industry and sources of competitive advantage in the form of massive Weipa bauxite resources and competitive rewinding in Australia matched with low cost hydro power positions available to us in Canada. And of course supported by a proprietary and industry leading AP smelting technology. These assets will provide shareholder value over time.</p>
          <p>We continue to make substantial progress integrated with the Alcan businesses. Following the first four years, we realized $585 million of in period after tax synergies, which is 39% ahead of target. As we previously highlighted, the majorities of these are corporate in nature and appear outside the Rio Tinto Alcan earnings per year.</p>
          <p>And I would like to point out, we remain on track to deliver $1.1 billion of annual synergies after tax in 2010, well above of our original estimate of $600 million.</p>
          <p>The Sohar smelter in Oman started up on time and on budget in June and proceeded on schedule with over 49,000 tons produced in 2008 on a 100% basis, and I was just told Jacynthe on Monday this week that the last part has come into production.</p>
          <p>We've taken rapid and decisive action against the current economic backdrop to reduce production by 11% from a higher scores operations. We've also begun to optimize and further streamline the organizational structure under the new leadership of Jacynthe C&#xF4;t&#xE9;.</p>
          <p>Jacynthe is taking the necessary and difficult steps to reduce cost further to improve our relative cost position in very difficult markets. These changes, while difficult, will position Rio Tinto-Alcan to weather the current economic crisis and set it up to a more stronger when conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the copper and diamonds, low copper growth at Grasberg and Escondida, and lower moli grades Kennecott Utah Copper reduced earnings during the year with gold production being impacted as well as copper. Earnings were also impacted by operational and other difficulties at Escondida and scheduled shutdowns in the refinery, smelter at Kennecott Utah Copper.</p>
          <p>For the last quarter of 2008, the sector-operated environment of rapidly declining copper had moderate <mark type="ph" /> prices. So the impact of earnings and decline in prices was compounded as Escondida by hedging losses and provisional pricing adjustments. We announced significant copper resources at Kennecott, at La Granja in Peru and Resolution in Arizona during the half, and major new nickel resources at Sulawesi in Indonesia. However, as you can imagine in the current environment, we've reduced spending on all non-essential work. At thus world level thus it continues to progress local stakeholder engagement and local project studies.</p>
          <p>Negotiations continue with the Mongolian Government's secured investment agreement for the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold project. A session at parliament is expected to be held in February, where the working group is expected to present with recommendations.</p>
          <p>Turning to guidance; with the reduction in consumer spending in the latter part of 2008, particularly impacting sales of luxury jewelry results were lower due to lower returns. The underground development projects at Diavik and Argyle are well advanced and progressed well through 2008. However, we've announced that both projects will be substantially stored resulting in a delay in the start-up in production.</p>
          <p>Our Copper Group comprises some of the world's very low-cost large scale assets while continue to provide good returns through all parts of the cycle. Looking beyond the near term, the impact of the credit crunch and low prices on the financing of new copper projects will play an important role in determining the shape of the copper price recovery. Overall production expansion is likely to be delayed and with a strong set of existing assets in the suite of high-quality projects, Rio Tinto will be well positioned to take advantage of this recovery.</p>
          <p>Moving on to energy and minerals. Energy and Minerals Group had a very good year in 2008 with record earnings including a 600% increase in earnings in Rio Tinto coal Australia. Substantial higher thermal and coking-coal prices were a result of strong Asian demand, coinciding with constrained supply for the eastern seaboard of Australia. We also continue to focus on increasing volume of coking and semi-soft coal over thermal coal for most of the year to take advantage of higher relative prices. Of course that's changed over the past few months.</p>
          <p>The uranium business saw the benefit of higher realized prices as old contracts continue to be replaced with newer contracts in this higher priced environment. Our uranium business was especially attractive due to the increasing uncertainty of our production increases previously scheduled by some of our competitors. The Group's Queensland coal operations recovered well from the weather-related disruptions in the first quarter and we were able to take up additional port allocation in both Queensland and New South Wales. We were less affected than others by the first quarter rainfall. And this allowed us to see the benefits of higher contract coal prices in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Cutbacks at steel production are expected to reduce demand for metallurgical coals using the production process. The demand level for thermal coals remains relatively resilient and price levels have recently stabilized, although the outlook for coking coal is certainly more uncertain.</p>
          <p>The Clermont project remains on schedule to be production on stream for earlier 2010 to replace production from Pilbara Fall <mark type="ph" />, as it nears the end of its scheduled time life.</p>
          <p>The Group's iron and titanium operations performed well in 2008 from higher volumes and higher prices reflecting strong global demand for these products from developing nations. In December, we produced the first Ilmenite from a 750,000 ton per year Mineral Sands project in Madagascar.</p>
          <p>This will be the landmark project for sustainable development and excellent example of the delivery of the successful major greenfield project in an emerging country. The Group's energy and mineral business is well positioned to benefit from strong markets in the future as a number two fuel and coal producer in Australia and the U.S., the number two uranium and borate producer worldwide and the number one global producer of titanium dioxide feedstocks.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I believe it's now over to you Guy.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you again, Tom. Now let me start with an analysis of how we achieved record earnings in 2008. We have set this out using the usual waterfall chart format. Higher prices benefited earnings by $5 billion, as we experienced strong pricing for traded metals through the first three quarters of the year and of course, large increases in the price of our bulk products in the first half.</p>
          <p>We've included a breakdown of the price variants as an appendix to the presentation. We experienced dramatic swings in currencies relative to the dollar during the year, but the effect on average exchange rates was not very significant resulting in a benefit of $299 million. I'd like to remind you of the natural hedge between currency exchange rates and the movement in traded metal prices.</p>
          <p>The earnings variants attributable to volume increases was $233 million, reflecting in particular strong growth in iron ore and coal volumes in addition to the impact of volumes from the inclusion of Alcan for the full year. This was partly offset by a grade-related decline in copper and molybdenum, with gold volumes also being affected. Again a break down of the volume variants is included as an appendix to the presentation.</p>
          <p>Turning to costs, inflation and energy prices reduced earnings by 336 million and 219 million respectively. Cash cost increases reduced earnings by $882 million. The increase in costs includes the impact of low volumes on unit cost for copper as we highlighted in the fourth quarter operations review and rising input costs for supplies used in running our business. We are now starting to see a decline in input costs, albeit with a lag with further benefits expected to come through in 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally there were some individual tax and other charges which reduced earnings collectively by $1.2 billion. The most significant item was a negative net interest cost variant of $765 million related to the Alcan acquisition debt, as well there was a higher effective tax rate from the absence of the 2007 Canadian tax rate benefit. So this brings us eventually to the excellent annual earnings figure of $10.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our cash flow, the Group's cash flow from operations increased 64% to a record $28.7 billion. This reflects the strong cash generative capabilities of our assets, even under challenging economic conditions during the last quarter of 2008. Cash flows were supported by record bulk prices and good markets for copper and aluminum for the first three quarters. These cash flows supported substantial net debt repayments and a significant capital expenditure program.</p>
          <p>As Tom has already mentioned, the changed economic environment has required us to reflect on each of our projects and we are committed to reducing capital expenditures to approximately $4 billion in 2009. We'll also be maintaining dividends for 2008 at $1.36 per share consistent with our longstanding progressive dividend policy which has either held dividends flat or increased them through all points through the economic cycle. These actions along with a reduction in annual operating cost of $2.5 billion in 2010 and the continuation of an expanded divestment process will enable us to continue generating strong cash flows to meet our commitments.</p>
          <p>The excellent cash flow from operations and divestments resulted in reducing net debt by 14% or $6.5 billion. Our commitment to reduce net debt by $10 billion by the end of 2009 remains fully in place. The sole covenant under the Alcan facilities is a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA of 4.5 times. In 2008, we comfortably met this covenant with a ratio of only 1.7 times. Although the use of our available facilities of $9.4 billion would not assist us with reducing our net debt by $10 billion, it nevertheless provides additional flexibility in meeting our commitments.</p>
          <p>We are not complacent regarding our debt position. With the recent announced operating cost and the capital cost cuts, this year's divestments and of course the announcement today of the strategic partnership with Chinalco, we are over delivering on our commitment to reduce net debt by $10 billion during 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to impairment charges; net earnings of $3.7 billion include an impairment charge of $8.4 billion, of which $7.9 billion relates to the Group's aluminum business. The acquisition price of Alcan anticipated significant growth in smelter and refinery capacity. We're following the recent weakening in economic and market circumstances, many of these growth projects have been deferred.</p>
          <p>These deferrals together with the weak economic environment and increases in input costs have resulted in this impairment charge. Even though growth options contribute limited value in assessing the level of impairment under accounting standards, let me reassure you that our view remains that Rio Tinto would extract significant value from these options in the longer term.</p>
          <p>The weakening economic circumstances also resulted in impairments of other assets and the majority of those related to high smelt in Diavik. On divestments, during 2008, we achieved divestments of $3 billion with the sales of our interest in Cote's <mark type="ph" /> Greens Creek and La Quinta uranium asset.</p>
          <p>In December 2008, we announced our intention to expand the scope of assets targeted for divestment. And in just two months, we've made good progress with divestments totaling 1.7 billion from the sale of Corumb&#xE1;, our potash assets and Ningxia aluminum smelter in China. The prices achieved for these assets definitely represent full value and they demonstrate the depth and quality of our asset portfolio. They also illustrate our ability to unlock value for shareholders despite tough credit markets and economic conditions. We believe that the Chinalco transaction announced today continues this longstanding commitment to value.</p>
          <p>The asset values we are realizing in today's conditions are outstanding and they would have been strong even before the downturn. We remain committed to our asset divestment program but the Chinalco transaction allows us to be selective as we continue with the divestment of our non-core assets. As we have said previously, in all our divestments, we're determined that we will only enter into a transaction at the right price. Value remains our primary consideration.</p>
          <p>Now back to you Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Guy. So in conclusion, while the year has certainly ended on a different note from the beginning, overall the Group put in a strong performance. Underlying earnings were up 38% to a record 10.3 billion, underpinned by strong market conditions at least in the first nine months of 2008.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, the markets that we and everyone else operate in changed dramatically. We have adapted quickly to the rapid decline in our markets and our price, preserving value for shareholders by conserving cash flow and reducing levels of debt. We will not be complacent and we will continue to diligently review our operations and take those necessary and appropriate actions where necessary. At no time have large scale low-cost assets been more important. In addition to the suite of tier 1 assets, product diversity and broad geographic spread of operations, we'll continue to provide strong cash flows throughout the cycle. We will not limit our growth options, these options are being maintained by maintaining flexibility, enabling a quick response when there are positive signs of underlying demand for our products.</p>
          <p>The world economy has slowed much more rapidly than anyone would have expected in the middle of last year. And a sustained recovery is not expected in the near term. However, we do believe the fundamentals in the Chinese and other fast-growing markets like India remain intact and industry's long-term prospects remain positive. Despite these current challenging circumstances and conditions the Group's strategy remains the same; to maximize shareholder value through excellence in mining and operating a large scale low-cost assets with an emphasis on quality. And this strategy will continue to be value generative for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that thank you and I will take some questions. Nigel if you want to step up, it will be great.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's kick off here in the auditorium. First question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sam Catalano, from Macquarie again. Perhaps a question for Vivek just with regards to cost curves, clearly there we mentioned them coming down earlier. I guess which commodities would you see the sharpest decline in the cost curve and particularly the shape of that curve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Your question is which line prices will I think will come down fastest. I'm not going to -- look I don't think, what we probably find is that you will see reductions in average costs across a whole range of sectors. And we're seeing those all the time costs for example explosives, fuel costs and then they just bring down the average for everyone. We will probably also see very big changes in costs which, across the industries which are very challenged at the moment. So for example, with aluminum we would expect to see the low cost -- the high cost smelter shuts progressively over time. And therefore putting up the price so that we get something that's more consistent with a sustainable outcome. So there the relationship between costs and prices might differ a bit. But every sector is a bit different, every cost curve is a bit different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Charles Kernot from Evolution. Actually I had some questions perhaps a little bit more for Chinalco, but perhaps you can help to answer them. First it relates just to the packaging business, clearly packaging or downstream aluminum fabrication is an area in which they are interested. However, it's an area the Chinese development is sort of lagging behind where we are or where Alcan is. Was there any interest expressed in the packaging business by Chinalco, and what sort of discussions did you have on that?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to, and I have had some experience on this in the past to the difficulty in getting NDRC approval from the Chinese authorities, which I think is required to externalize finance. And associated with that why does the break fee in work one way? Wouldn't it be normal in this type of transaction for it to work both ways if Chinalco can't come up with the money on time. And I'll leave it at that Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, I will start with the NDRC point. I thought Guy, then you comment on the packaging downstream and the break fee point. Now as we report, Paul and I within the past few weeks have met with senior officials of NDRC and certainly I think there has been a constructive engagement between Chinalco and the NDRC. In terms of recognizing the importance NDRC has in the approval of any investment, foreign investment within China, and certainly Chinalco has expressed to us and we've reaffirmed for ourselves the NDRC is strongly in support of this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About packaging, in point of fact, Chinalco did not express much interest in that assets sale. So unfortunately, they didn't participate in the presses, which we have been running. And on the question of the break fee, you understand that this is a package deal there also sort of elements in which we've had to give here and take that. And one of the things that we did agree to give up was an attempt to secure a break fee in the other direction. But as Tom has said, while one can never be fully confident of these things, we do -- we have had some very reassuring statements made by a very senior Chinese official. So let's hope that eventuality doesn't arrive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that in all of our receptions with senior Chinese leadership, they've recognized that the world will be watching how this transaction proceeds towards various approvals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any further questions, here? Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nick Moore of RBS <mark type="ph" />. Exploration is almost the future of a company; that's how it grows. We've heard earlier about this exploration initiative and you made a very good point that many of these new mineral resources are in emerging countries. With regard to that, and obviously we went for that situation, where we had a fear of running out of resources is now surplus. But for the long term, this actually could be very exciting initiative. If you do make an exciting discovery within China, do you get sort of first putting on these or is there any requirements to allow Chinalco to run these? How is that going to work? Because this potentially could be a real mineral box for years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Nick. The exploration in China has not escaped my attention. As you know, I've had a long -- experienced a lot of my career equipment first job had been in the area of exploration. We have been exploring or trying to explore in China since 1994. Frankly, it's been very difficult for us to get the access to the ground that we wanted to have.</p>
          <p>And within China, it's not only getting the exploration permit, but also getting the continuation of those exploration permits with what would be assurances to move into mine improvements. And I think that we've had that 10 years of slow experience with we know what we would need to do to have competitive advantage. And I certainly from my perspective, and my exploration background -- again my -- probably exploration very closely ever since the mid-1990s. I do believe this provides us with a competitive edge for exploration. And I do believe that China is under explored and we could opportunities. The fact that the Oyu Tolgoi deposit, which you all know is probably the best undeveloped copper deposit in the world, sits 80 kilometer away from the Chinese border, is evidence of the fact that there is perspective terrain.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam Fischer <mark type="ph" /> Cazenove. I was very confused about the decision to hold the dividend in lights of the capital that you are raising, why didn't you suspend that and so for your answers to Chinalco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make a brief comment and perhaps Guy can come on to that. I think we -- and it's deep in the Rio Tinto culture attaching almost importance to the long term dividend promise that the company has had of progressive dividend policy, which means not going backwards. I think had we moved towards one or two other options we might have looked at that, but in terms of the option, we've decided to go, we felt to hold the dividend was the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>Guy, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there is much to add. I mean I think the integrity of that some have record is something that we felt was very important. It was something just short of a promise to our shareholders that we would maintain a progressive dividend. Of course we debated which assets should be in and which assets should be out of the package with Chinalco. And I think the eventual outcome was one which both sides felt comfortable with. So well I understand your question, I think it has to be in that context.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Guy, while you are -- perhaps you might have to take some questions in Melbourne.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Steve Goodwill <mark type="ph" /> from Goldman Sachs. Just on our -- you have saved an average price issue. I think you said of the $1.18. And given the sensitivities you're giving us and given where stock prices are. And I mean your earnings this year, its spot price is going to be very well indeed.</p>
          <p>Can you just give us some idea, what measures you can take in aluminum, what you will do? And also could you just give us some feel for how costs are going to come down in the aluminum business? Is there a significant like and sort of what percentage of the price fall that we see in aluminum will come through in costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Neil, maybe I will tackle and Guy, if you want to add anything to this. What we saw during the course of 2008 would have been a lagging increase in some of the cost inputs particularly elements around the coke pitch, caustic that drove up the overall cost structure. And again I would anticipate them coming down. But there is a time lag on them coming up, and I think we will see the time lag, we're still seeing it coming down in 2009.</p>
          <p>We've recognized in this $0.60 aluminum price environment that all, but those first and second quartile operations even with rigorous costs containment will be very, very challenged and marginal. We have certainly gone through already two phrases of smelter shut down. We certainly have planning in place for further shut downs.</p>
          <p>And that's all part of the overall sequencing of what any smelting company would be doing in this particular market, and we recognize that this involves that only the aluminum business. But also the impact on stakeholders and local community. So we're quite sensitive to those areas.</p>
          <p>Jacynthe C&#xF4;t&#xE9; has come in a very challenging time in the business and but I am absolutely confident she is focused entirely on the rigorous cost reduction. We've already within our first two weeks in the role she has already put in place very significant overhead and organizational cost reductions. And we are pushing for further cost reductions and efficiency improvements at each of the smelters.</p>
          <p>We cannot rely on the fact that we've cost operations for that in itself puts a close through the storm. We've got to tackle our lowest cost operations as aggressively as our higher cost operations. And again at these prices, we will have some of our higher cost operations, which will be marginal and which will be tested some in the fairly near-term as the conditions dictate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can just add a couple of comments. I mean difficult is the situation is for us. I think we are fairing better than the competition; thanks to the quality of the assets that we have in bauxite, aluminum, and smelting. I'll just add a couple of points. One is that in addition to the fact is that Tom mentioned, there are some other exogenous factors that favor us.</p>
          <p>One is the fall in the oil price, and the others the fall in the currencies in most of the countries that we produce other bauxite or aluminum in. And those effects were not very much until late in 2008. So the costs on average during the year were affected by high input prices and stronger currencies.</p>
          <p>The other thing that perhaps already mentioned is that the synergies, which were still delivering more than expected, again a kick in increasing as 2009 continues. So I'm not saying it's easy and isn't easy, but I think we are doing everything that we can. So next question here in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Couple of questions, firstly with the announcement late last year early this year regarding redundancies that sort of thing in preparing the asset bites for the current economic conditions. Are you able to give us some guidance on what the cost impact of making those decisions might be for this half of calendar '09. Secondly, you had made some substantial final spot sales through the course of 2008. Which spot prices holding up relatively well at the moment would you consider selling into spot market, if there is still some push back on your contracted customers.

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah Craig, I mean we -- as you know, we said early in 2008 that we would be selling into the spot market and certainly it was a lot nicer time to be selling in the spot market $180 per ton than in the 60 $70 per ton range. I am very pleased that we got them out early in the cycle. I think it's fair to say as we said back in November of 2007 that we will always look at a mix of marketing activities, long-term contracts, hybrids spots et cetera. We will continue to explore that mix in this particular market, recognizing first and foremost. We want to look after those long-term contractive customers and that's what we have been doing.</p>
          <p>There have been some lower levels of spot business in these markets, and certainly we recognize that we have seen some of an uplift. We've increased some of our shipments in the past few weeks, I think to some extent the Baltic Index has gone up, because we've probably put on more charted vessels than would have been the case in November and December.</p>

          <p>Craig, I can't put my hands, I'm afraid, right now, on the cost of the redundancies. It was given, if I remember, in the release that we did on the 10th of December. I will give it to analysts when I brief them tomorrow. And make sure that you have had it. I'm not sure we will break it down there by --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was just over $1 billion actually.</p>

          <p>Now on the net interest number, you will see that we have -- you will see while the debt -- if I give about 400 million, it hasn't --</p>

          <p>--the receipt of the 850 million for the potash sale, which was -- which we reported a few days ago. On that, we are paying 3% approximately. That is to say we are paying between the 32 and 42 basis points over LIBOR on the outcome debt. That will change when it is repaid, and it will be substituted impart by no interest, because we'll be using the proceeds of the asset sales. And then it will be substituted by a 9.2% on average coupon under the new convertible bond. So I think that I can't give you a projected average, because I can't tell you the exact date at which this will close, but I think those are the building blocks for that calculation.</p>

          <p>Guy, just to clarify, the revenue in number, the cost is 400 million. I was a bit worried, I thought 100 billion was a bit --</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, quite right; billion was the saving, wasn't it? And I think we should move to Sydney actually. Stephen, you still there?</p>

          <p>One more question here, Warne, <mark type="ph" /> if that's all right, Nigel. Sorry, I cut Warne off; I'm feeling a bit guilty over that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Guy. A question -- actually two questions. One on QMM; this bringing some recent protocol such one risk there. And so whether it's impacted to start up in the operations. And also the trend development that you had a couple of weeks ago, what impact does that market have on shipping the first half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Warne. I will cover both of these questions. At QMM, there have been some social unrest within Madagascar; most of it's been in the capital city, Tana; it has stabilized since. A few weeks ago, it has been unfortunate and we've had seen limited effects within the four to five locations, which is as you know is on the other side the country from Tana. I'd say overall it had no real effect on our start-up timing although and some days we had local residents standing in front of the road going to the site and we've managed that very closely with local Porticon <mark type="ph" /> authorities.</p>
          <p>On the train derailment, it occurred on the double track part of the line. I think it took us about four days to recover one of the tracks in line of and few days after that to recover the second. I would not say that it will have a material effect on first half shipments. Of course as you know, probably what causes the most material effect in the first half would be the cyclone season and unfortunately, we're still in the middle of that. We've been not onward -- not too affected by it so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I have some questions here Nigel. Tim Gerard from Earlstock, <mark type="ph" /> in Sydney. Two questions, the first on iron ore and second on aluminum. With regard to the possible expansion, the 100 million ton expansion, you are obviously very, very circumspect about that and we can understand on a global basis. But given China's reliance on to some extent on the high-cost domestic ore, BHP pushing ahead aggressively with its expansions and Australia's market share in China only about 40% despite the freight advantage. Could you just comment please on why you are not pushing ahead more aggressively with that, especially considering that you're probably going to be getting $5 billion in from Chinalco soon rather than later? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question just with regard to the aluminum smelters, for some reason both Anglesea and Anzus <mark type="ph" /> had a disastrous year because of problems with transformers and I guess it doesn't sound like a big deal, but what kind of risk is there to your other smelters in the Group from underpinning your transformer maintenance programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim maybe I can tackle both of those. First of all on iron ore, if any one had clairvoyance as to how we will come out of this global recovery, whether it gets worse, how it gets better, when it gets better I think we all have more certainty and more confidence in expanding through downturn. The sheer unprecedented nature of what we have been seeing and the contributing causes of this downturn I think poses considerable challenge for industry that global uptake in the global steel markets.</p>
          <p>And at this point in time I don't see what I would call the credible and a meaningful signs of an economic recovery that would cause us to again to make those significant capital investments. So I think that is prudent and realistic in this current capital horizon. Certainly, Tim in my discussion with other two executives and other industries and seeing the global nature of what we are all experiencing, that deal will probably more commonly held than an anomaly. The fact that we have the ability to expand at our election, at our convenience, the fact that the Chinalco transaction gives us the financial flexibility to expand at our election, at our convenience is terribly powerful. Because I do hope to see signs of new economic recovery, we do hope to be in a position to make those types of decisions. But we first need to see some credible signs of global economic resurgence and we all know we have some difficult waters ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Second on aluminum, I think you point out now without a bit of irony that two smelters which have had transformer and rectifier problems have been Australia's inter-smelters and I think it's to say that for many years we had constrained sustaining capital which probably has caught up with us. We do need to recognize that, in Anglesea in particular which we knew had a fairly short shelf life as a consequence of the uncertainty around local nuclear capacity and local power contracts that by the nature would have been good for our business to not necessarily keep those transformers ready to run for the next 15 years, because we know we didn't have 15 years of power contracts and that was treated accordingly. In both the case of the Anglesea and the Anzus power failures, we have taken those lessons learned and apply them through the rest of the Group. And this would be an area I think where the superior technical position and the leading technical position that we -- that came into the Group through the Alcan transaction is probably helping the total global set of smelters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a question here. So we take probably one more question, then we are going to wrap up actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Back there <mark type="ph" />. Pick up the mic please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Paul Mitchell <mark type="ph" /> from Credit Suisse. Happy to be lucky last. Hopefully it's an easy question. Just looking at the regional pricing allocations you may draw in the Alcan acquisition, I note in I think its page 33 of your release that in fact goodwill is written off from 14.5 billion to what was allocated from 14.5 to 20.1 billion. So my question was the subsequent impairment charge that we saw through for goodwill to that 6.6 billion. Is that after that impact, so we actually kind of increased it 5.5 and then wrote it back for 6.5? Am I reading that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I better take that one. Paul <mark type="ph" />, in a way you are right, I mean we -- as a result of the Dodge Phelps activity that took place over the year following acquisition we were able to examine in depth what the value of each asset was and that causes to reallocate as you can see, mainly in the area of tangible assets, but also intangible assets, the fair value of Alcan. The difference was predominantly into goodwill. And then you can see that number rose up to $20 billion. And with the impairment it will obviously reduce again down to a bit less than 14. And the cause is of the goodwill adjustment, though where the ones I explained namely; recognition of different economic circumstances, higher input costs, and the removal from our assessment of value of those projects which we had deferred or chosen to differ. So I think that nevertheless your observation as a quite a lot of merit to it. It is kind of backward than forward or forward than backward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think probably we have to draw the line there unfortunately to keep on the schedule which is rather tight. But just to say thank you all again for being here, and sitting through all this time of being rather extended presentations, but I hope the content was helpful to you. Thank you for coming.</p>
