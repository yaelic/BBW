        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, everyone, to our quarterly conference call. Today, we will be using slides as part of our presentation. And we're optimistic that this new format will enhance the clarity and focus of our messages and ensure that the key issues are addressed effectively.</p>
          <p>I would like to make some introductory comments before the more detailed financial and business review. This quarter, we continue the advancement of our businesses and R&amp;D programs across the world towards our vision of becoming the preeminent global biopharmaceutical company in our areas of focus. We are currently launching three hematology products internationally that significantly impact survival, REVLIMID, VIDAZA and THALOMID while advancing a robust clinical development program to support and expand our commercial opportunities.</p>
          <p>We are also developing new breakthrough products in areas of unmet medical need, creating one of the deepest and most diverse clinical pipelines in hematology and severe inflammatory diseases. All of this is being done in a very challenging global economic environment that is affecting every industry including ours and including Celgene.</p>
          <p>Despite this significant challenge, the strength of our fundamental business and of our vital products remain solid and is based on growing patient demand, setting the stage for continued industry-leading growth. Specifically, our global revenue increased more than 30% year-over-year driven by REVLIMID, which increased 26%. Importantly, patient demand and market share growth for REVLIMID was seen both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter sequentially. Dave Gryska will detail our financial growth and status.</p>
          <p>REVLIMID strengthened its position as the global myeloma revenue leader on one of the largest hematology products. It continues to see growth in all lines of therapy as well as in duration of therapy, both in the U.S. and Internationally. Bob will cover this in greater detail including the important affirmation of REVLIMID as a unique life saving agent by NICE in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to turn to our market leading NVS treatment VIDAZA, which is based on its unprecedented survival advantage continued to grow through market share, patient demand and revenue gains.</p>
          <p>The EU launch commenced during the quarter, starting with Germany and is expected to accelerate in the second half of this year. The unique and breakthrough nature of this drug was elucidated in a major peer publication this quarter. 2009 will feature a substantial number of important milestones. These will include clinical milestones such as the first interim analysis of our first line myeloma trial MM015 and the initial analysis of the major IFM maintenance trial for REVLIMID a trial that could set a new standard for the treatment of myeloma.</p>
          <p>We also anticipate reimbursement approvals in key markets, MDA submissions in the second largest oncology market, Japan, and a host of other key events highlighting REVLIMID's broad clinical activity, including in CLL and in NHO. We also look forward to the presentation of important clinical data for our new promising compounds including the Apremilast in psoriatic arthritis, and Pomalidomide in hematologic malignancies.</p>
          <p>Even in these challenging times, which Celgene is certainly not immune to, our pipeline is advancing, our company is taking advantage of new markets and the importance of REVLIMID and VIDAZA are growing in the U.S. and internationally. Based on potential key catalysts occurring throughout the year, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term vision.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Gryska, who will provide a more detailed view of the financial results.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sol. Now I'll take you through the financial results. Non-GAAP total revenue for the first quarter 2009 was $601 million, a 30% increase versus the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.44. Total non-GAAP net product sales increased 572 million for the first quarter, up 33% from $430 million in the year-ago quarter. REVLIMID net product sales were $363 million, an increase of 26% over the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Based on the first quarter results, REVLIMID continues to be the global myeloma market leader. As Bob will discuss in greater detail, the number of prescriptions written for REVLIMID, patient growth and average duration of therapy continue to increase sequentially worldwide.</p>
          <p>Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $75 million. The launch of VIDAZA in Europe is progressing very well as the drug is now available in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Finland. Furthermore, we expect to complete the launch of VIDAZA in Italy, France, Spain and the U.K. by the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>THALOMID net sales were $114 million for the quarter, which is essentially flat as compared to the year-ago quarter. While the launch of THALOMID in Europe is on track, we remind you that the price of THALOMID is much lower in Europe versus the U.S.; therefore the impact of increasing volumes in Europe is unlikely to offset the decreasing volumes in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In addition, as of March 31, we no longer commercialize ALKERAN due to the conclusion of our agreement with GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
          <p>Our sales and returns allowances, as a percent of total sales, continue to decline versus 2008 levels. As of December 31, 2008, the total returns and allowances balance was 18 million, and as of March 31, 2009, it was 13 million. A majority of our returns allowances in the past quarter relate to U.S. THALOMID. A portion of the U.S. THALOMID is sold through retail pharmacies, which results in higher sales returns. REVLIMID is distributed through specialty pharmacies in the U.S., and therefore returns related to REVLIMID are low. In Europe, REVLIMID is sold directly to the hospitals and patients, and patients acquire REVLIMID at the hospital. This results in de minimis REVLIMID related returns in Europe.</p>
          <p>As Celgene continues to expand globally, ex U.S. sales of REVLIMID will continue to represent a larger percent of our total revenue, and U.S. THALOMID revenues will decline. Accordingly, our sales returns reserves are expected to further decline over the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>Our product revenues increased quarter-over-quarter, and our inventory decreased. These inventories consist approximately 45% of finished goods and the remainder is work in process and raw materials. As of December 31, 2008, inventory was 100 million, and it is 97 million as of March 31, 2009. We expect inventory to remain at these levels in 2009. Our non-GAAP gross product margin for the first quarter was 89%, and we are forecasting gross margins for the rest of 2009 to increase about 200 basis points. The projected increase in gross margin is due to an increased mix of higher gross margin REVLIMID sales and the discontinuation of ALKERAN, which has a lower gross margin.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses for the first quarter, non-GAAP R&amp;D expense was 168 million, as compared to 154 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. R&amp;D expenses increased as we continue to support our deep and diversified line in 2009, in such areas as NHL, CLL and inflammation.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at SG&amp;A, our non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were 156 million during the first quarter as compared to 182 million during the fourth quarter of 2008. SG&amp;A expenses declined as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 because of one-time Pharmion integration expenses and VIDAZA launch expenses, which were included in the fourth quarter. We expect 2009 SG&amp;A expense to be slightly higher than full-year 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning to taxes, our non-GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%. We continue to anticipate improvements with tax rates throughout 2009 and are now forecasting a 22% tax rate for the year.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2009, there were significant fluctuations in the dollar to euro exchange rate. We hedge our balance sheet foreign currency exposures, and our company foreign currency transactions and exposure related to certain euro-based revenue and expense. For 2009, we are hedging approximately 60 to 70% of our euro net foreign earnings exposure over a rolling 18-month period.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we realized approximately 33 million in hedging and reevaluation gains. Our hedging activity is incorporated into our overall planning process for the year. Our goal is to neutralize the impact to EPS and FX volatility, and we're now forecasting these types of FX related gains for the remainder of the year. And now a few words about our balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2009 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in high-grade, U.S. government and government agency securities and money market funds. We expect to generate approximately 1 billion from global operations in 2009. We view our strong cash position as an important strategic asset particularly in the current economic environment. Our strong balance sheet with no debt provides us the resources and flexibility to achieve our goal of becoming a leading global hematology oncology company.</p>
          <p>In summary, the overall fundamentals of our business and financial position are very good. We're reaffirming our 2009 guidance. We're expecting non-GAAP total revenue to be at the lower end of the range of 2.6 to $2.7 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be at the lower end of the range of $2.05 to $2.15. As you may have seen a press release earlier this week, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase is up to $500 million of the company's common stock through April 2011. The primary purpose of the stock repurchase program is to offset the dilution resulting from stock options.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Hugin, who will expand on our global commercial, clinical and regulatory plans for 2009 and beyond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. It's my objective this morning to review with you the important progress achieved during the quarter in our businesses and the key milestones for the remainder of 2009. Bottom line, our commercial products, our development programs and our functional organizations are all stronger and better positioned than they were at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Our products across all geographic territories are making appreciable market share gains with preliminary first quarter data demonstrating continued strong increases in both the U.S. and European multiple myeloma and MDS markets. The expansion of our products in global markets and our development programs in the hematology and oncology and inflammation advanced significantly in the quarter. And our plans for the year are on track.</p>
          <p>There were challenges in the first quarter, some specific to the quarter and others related to the extraordinary global economic pressures being felt in all markets and geographies. That being said, our company is stronger and better-positioned than ever. Though total revenue increased by more than 30% year-over-year, it was impacted by the extraordinary global economic conditions during the quarter and one-time factors. The most significant of the factors, being the aggressive management of inventories by pharmacies not surprising in an environment of heightened liquidity and balance sheet management.</p>
          <p>The economic impact is less of a first quarter specific event. Though in the United States, the start of a new year for Medicare Part D deductibles certainly led to more demand for co-payment assistance and delays in initiation of treatment. Though financial aid from independent third parties remained available for patients in need, the process of obtaining the support lengthens the time from prescription to dispense.</p>
          <p>The economic conditions also had a slight negative impact on the ratio of prescriptions dispensed to prescriptions written. In overseas markets, government and hospital budgets are under significant pressure resulting in delays in some cases in initiation of therapy. Though challenging, our team is managing through this environment with a solid growth trajectory emerging.</p>
          <p>My presentation will provide an update on the multiple myeloma and MDS markets and an outlook on the key drivers for the growth of REVLIMID and VIDAZA. I'll also review with you our clinical and regulatory progress in our major development programs and discuss the status of our key clinical programs in myeloma, MDS, CLL, lymphoma and our broader pipeline including Apremilast. Our products are well positioned in the global myeloma market. REVLIMID became the global revenue leader in myeloma late last year and the results of this quarter indicate that it further strengthened that position.</p>
          <p>Though revenue was impacted by some of the factors previously discussed, underlying fundamental REVLIMID patient demand was strong in both the U.S. and Europe. Total daily average prescriptions increased in the U.S. by about 4% with new myeloma patients increasing by more than 10% over the fourth quarter of last year. New patient starts are an important indicator of future growth.</p>
          <p>Unit growth was also very strong in Europe with prescriptions growing by more than 15% over the prior quarter. Throughout the globe, the REVLIMID expansion strategy is on plan.</p>
          <p>Market share is an important measure of performance and future prospects. Significant market share improvement was achieved in all markets in which REVLIMID is launched and reimbursed. 12-month rolling market shares indicate substantial market share gains in the U.S. in all lines of therapy with total REVLIMID share now above 30%.</p>
          <p>Preliminary and less reliable short-term market share indicators from the first quarter point to even more significant recent increases in share. Though the launch of REVLIMID in myeloma in Europe is less advanced than the U.S., the market share gains are no less impressive.</p>
          <p>Strong quarter-over-quarter performance is being achieved in both second and third line indications in developed markets. Territorial expansion, market share gains and extension of duration of therapy are all key REVLIMID revenue drivers. The positive trends observed throughout 2008 continued in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In the United States, nearly 25% of patients initiating REVLIMID treatment two years ago remain on therapy today. The benefits of long treatment duration are being recognized in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The commercial success of innovative therapies is increasingly dependent on their value proposition. In an era of increasing demands for evidence based medicine, the results of the first quarter bode well for the continued global expansion of REVLIMID.</p>
          <p>The recent announcement of the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence or NICE support for the reimbursement of REVLIMID and the advancement of reimbursement discussions in Canada and Australia &#x2013; excuse me; accurately reflect the value provided by REVLIMID to patients and to payers.</p>
          <p>Though there is now a comprehensive body of clinical evidence of REVLIMID's activity, especially in multiple myeloma, we're committed to fully exploring its potential in myeloma and a range of other hematological malignancies.</p>
          <p>In a few minutes, I'll update you on these key programs. Our investment continues to produce new and updated data supporting REVLIMID. Just recently, at the International Myeloma Workshop in Washington, DC, REVLIMID was featured in approximately 70 abstracts highlighting its position as a standard of care in all patient segments of myeloma. During the quarter, new dosing guidelines were added to the U.S. REVLIMID label to assist in the treatment of renally impaired patients.</p>
          <p>Additional discussions were held with the FDA regarding the submission of data from the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ECOG and SWOG trials to the package insert.</p>
          <p>Though we do expect to add clinical data from the trials to the label, it will not lead to a change in the label's indication. A label expansion will be dependent on data from MMO-15, our Phase III trial in newly-diagnosed myeloma. Interim data from this trial may be available later this year.</p>
          <p>On the clinical front, IFM-0502, a Phase III REVLIMID maintenance trial conducted by the French Cooperative Group completed patient accrual this quarter. This data, if positive, may serve as another long-term value driver for REVLIMID's usage.</p>
          <p>THALOMID remains an important therapy in the portfolio of products aimed at transitioning myeloma from a terminal disease to a chronic condition. The launch of Thalidomide has been slower than expected in major European markets with heightened sensitivity to the review of its risk management program. We do however; expect to have all major European markets on line by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we see REVLIMID and VELCADE gaining frontline share from THALOMID. But have just recently begun to see some increase in usage in the third line setting, an encouraging development. As we look forward to the remainder of 2009, we see a number of important growth drivers for REVLIMID.</p>
          <p>Important reimbursement decisions are pending in key markets where regulatory approval has already been achieved. Reimbursement in the Canadian, the Australian and the UK markets are expected in the third and fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>These approvals and successful launches are essential for us to achieve our REVLIMID guidance for the year. New and updated REVLIMID clinical data will be presented in multiple medical meetings in June and at the American Society of Hematology in December.</p>
          <p>Based on early second quarter trends, sequential quarterly REVLIMID revenue growth appears to be in the five to 7% range. The trends are positive and we'll need an acceleration of these trends and the positive impact of key growth drivers in the second half of the year to achieve our annual guidance.</p>
          <p>With the launch of VIDAZA in Europe, the global MDS markets are becoming an increasingly important component of our revenue growth. The longer term growth will be predominantly in the European markets. For the next two years, we expect strong growth in both the U.S. and Europe. In the United States, market share trends for VIDAZA in the newly diagnosed population have risen sharply over the past year and bode well for strong performance later this year.</p>
          <p>The recent peer reviewed publication of the unprecedented survival data from the AZA-001 study should support a much wider dissemination of this data to community physicians. The data demonstrated a nearly doubling of the two-year survival rate in favor of the VIDAZA arm versus that of the conventional care arm with a nine month survival advantage.</p>
          <p>VIDAZA is the only MDS therapy to have ever demonstrated an overall survival advantage. This data is the key element in our re-launch of the expanded U.S. VIDAZA label. Germany is the first European major market to conduct a launch with reimbursement. The reception in Germany has been very positive. And the lessons learned position us well to launch effectively in other European markets later this year.</p>
          <p>This slide illustrates the expected reimbursement time lines for the major European markets. As you can see, we expect a steady progress of reimbursement approvals throughout the year with key markets such as France and Spain expected to come online in the third and fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>Only following pricing and reimbursement approvals can marketing and promotional activities substantively begin. As we better understand VIDAZA's biological activity, we're increasingly able to identify specific indication and drug combinations that merit additional study. We're commencing numerous studies of VIDAZA including combination trials with REVLIMID and other new therapies.</p>
          <p>As we look forward, the key VIDAZA growth drivers have been highlighted. Broadened European reimbursement, increased awareness of the VIDAZA survival data in all markets and the heightened productivity of targeted sales and marketing teams in the U.S. and European markets have the potential to drive continued strong revenue growth.</p>
          <p>In the United States, we're also hopeful that in the next several months, the guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network will significantly differentiate VIDAZA from other therapies based on published clinical evidence. These guidelines can influence a wide range of pathways in physician practices. And can impact reimbursement priorities.</p>
          <p>Early second quarter trends indicate that our targets for the year of approximately $400 million in VIDAZA revenue seems appropriate with quarter-over-quarter growth of 25% achievable.</p>
          <p>Though we have a comprehensive yet focused commercial and clinical strategy in multiple myeloma and MDS, it is only a part of the Celgene growth story. We have made excellent progress during the quarter advancing our hematology, oncology pipeline which includes Amrubicin, Pomalidomide and ACE-011 in addition to REVLIMID and VIDAZA. Progress was achieved in accruing major Phase III REVLIMID myeloma and Amrubicin small cell lung cancer trials. Our pivotal programs in lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia gained traction with additional Phase II trials initiating.</p>
          <p>The next few slides are presented to provide you with a fairly comprehensive overview of the key trials and their objectives for our major compounds in a range of important indications. Let me start with myeloma. The trials on this slide are designed to enroll upwards of 4,000 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. These trials are being conducted to clearly establish REVLIMID based regimens as the standard of care for all patient segments in the newly diagnosed myeloma market. REVLIMID is a major scientific breakthrough that can produce durable remissions with manageable toxicities and is being studied in combination with novel and traditional therapies.</p>
          <p>As its product profile allows for long treatment duration, we are studying REVLIMID in continuous induction and maintenance treatment settings including the early smoldering myeloma disease setting to see if the early onset of the disease can be delayed. We believe that additional clinical research in myelodysplastic syndromes has the potential to further broaden the applicability of our products.</p>
          <p>We have important studies enrolling in a wide range of MDS patients from lower risk MDS to those patients with disease transforming to acute myelogeneous leukemia. We're exploring numerous combinations to produce the maximum potential patient benefit.</p>
          <p>We believe that our products have the potential to have an increasingly meaningful impact in myeloma and MDS and that their potential extends well beyond these indications. We're exploring a number of important indications that offer exceptional growth potential. Our CLL, Clinical Development Program, has the objective of establishing REVLIMID as a standard of care for the treatment of multiple patient segments within CLL. We're initiating multiple global Phase II and Phase III trials. Our studies are examining REVLIMID's potential role as a therapy for untreated as well as previously treated patients. We're comparing its effectiveness in elderly patients as a monotherapy versus Chlorambucil and as maintenance therapy following second line treatment. Various combination strategies are underway to examining, combining REVLIMID with Fludarabine Rituximab and Vinblastine.</p>
          <p>As with our CLL development strategy, our lymphoma development plan is exploring REVLIMID's potential in a number of patient subtypes, both as monotherapy and in combination with a range of other agents.</p>
          <p>Our program is targeted to establish REVLIMID as a standard of care for the treatment of relapsed refractory aggressive lymphomas and to establish REVLIMID as a standard of care for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who respond to first line R-CHOP treatment.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our special protocol assessment Phase III trial comparing our third-generation anthracycline, Amrubicin versus Topotecan in second line small cell lung cancer is accruing rapidly with a 620 patient accrual completion expected either late this year or early next.</p>
          <p>Our next IMiDs Pomalidomide is enrolling 212 relapsed/refractory myeloma patients in a multicenter controlled Phase II trial. Additional data on Pomalidomide is expected at this year's ASH meeting.</p>
          <p>ACE-011 our active inhibitor being developed in collaboration with our partner Acceleron is completing a Phase II trial in myeloma patients with bone lesions and the FDA has very recently accepted the filing of our IND for its study in cancer induced anemia breast cancer patients. We expect this trial to begin later this year.</p>
          <p>We're also very pleased to report that the dosing of our first cohort of Crohn's Disease patients with PDA-001, a proprietary placental derived stem cells has been completed. The overall trial is expected to finish before year-end and assuming an appropriate safety profile, we'll commence a broad clinical development program based on encouraging preclinical evidence in a number of major indications.</p>
          <p>Our inflammation clinical program has gained traction during the past several quarters with Apremilast being studied in number of severe indications. Having demonstrated activity in a Phase II placebo controlled trial in moderate to severe psoriasis patients, we're examining Apremilast's potential in recalcitrant psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and moderate to severe psoriasis.</p>
          <p>Key Apremilast trials in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are now fully accrued with top line clinical results expected as early as mid-year in the psoriatic arthritis study with additional data later in the year.</p>
          <p>Based on positive results, we're planning to begin pivotal studies in either moderate to severe psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis in 2010. At the same time, we're expanding our knowledge of the drug's full potential in dermatological, rheumatology and inflammatory conditions through wide ranging Phase II studies.</p>
          <p>Hopefully the presentation has given you a better insight on the results of the recent period and to the key objectives and programs that are essential to our continued rapid growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Question on REVLIMID. As you mentioned, your guidance for this year implies that REVLIMID growth will accelerate substantially in the second half of the year. It seems like based on your discussions there is clearly a lot of significant catalysts for longer-term REVLIMID growth. I'm just wondering based on the trends that you saw this quarter, what are the most important growth drivers that we should look towards for the second half of this year, and what gives you the confidence that some of the macroeconomic issues that we saw in the first quarter are not going to impact things by the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very important question, and I think there are a number of elements that are important to discuss as you look at REVLIMID's growth going forward. First, I think that there are a number of economic impacts of the first quarter that are not unique only to the first quarter but have a very heavy significance in the year when a new Medicare Part D program starts and the deductible period starts again.</p>
          <p>So clearly, January is a tough time for patients who have to deal with the doughnut hole in that. So I think we saw some delays. But we've seen, I think, that being effectively managed and more aggressive education and awareness of the programs that are available for patients so that we don't see a significant &#x2013; or we see actually a re-emergence of the ratio between prescriptions and dispenses, and the time between the prescription and dispense.</p>
          <p>So we haven't seen any worsening of those trends. We've seen some stability there. And we think so some of those economic factors are clearly a first quarter phenomenon. And just having to deal with it; everybody has had to deal with a pretty significant environment, and I think that's being adjusted to in all markets, in some cases.</p>
          <p>Going forward, clearly, we have a number of factors that are important. Getting the reimbursement approvals through the NICE was a very important event in the first quarter. But we've got to translate that into funding through the different primary care trusts in the U.K. and the National Health Service there so that we actually can begin the commercial launch in the U.K. We're in very late-stage discussions with the Australian government and the Canadian governments, the provincial governments, to ensure that those markets where we have very active programs in developing those markets through what we'd call Phase III programs so that very high numbers of patients who are already on the drug through those programs that will convert to commercial pay products once we have the reimbursement approved. So, those approvements are very important and we'd expect a pretty rapid uptake because of the programs that are already existing in those markets.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we're encouraged by the duration trends that we continue to see. So we need to have that continue in the second half of the year. Not just in the U.S. but also in Europe. And that's why the maintenance studies are important. And we're hopeful that the 0502 early preliminary data may be available as early as ASH this year, which will continue to demonstrate REVLIMID's usefulness in treating not just to best response but through to progression, and that's important to convince in the European markets and to give further comfort to payers where we've already established a great value proposition for REVLIMID. But it's something we need to continue to do to ensure that physicians around the world continue to treat for as long as possible and then add combinations as the disease does progress.</p>
          <p>So, I think &#x2013; we're in challenging markets. We're seeing, obviously a re-emergence of the growth trend which is important here in the second quarter. We've got important objectives in the third and fourth quarter. And we've got a lot of work to do to make sure that we can produce the kind of growth to achieve the guidance. It's not going to be easy, but we've seen the positive signs and we've got work to do to achieve it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Could you just quickly tell us how much of the effective currency on top line you're going to report, that you were able to hedge? And just secondly, could you talk a little bit, Sol, about IFM-0502 and 015? You highlighted the data that you could potentially get on both of those studies, perhaps at ASH. But is that data that would enable you to file in the first part of next year, or do you think you'd need more complete data that would come at a later point? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Geoff, it's Dave here. So the effect on top line and currency was very de minimis, it was less than $1 million in terms of any currency impact in terms of our hedging activities in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In terms of &#x2013; good question, Geoff. We're actually quite excited about both studies, as you know. In terms of the IFM study, that's a relatively unique study in terms of really accepting the longer-term benefit of REVLIMID. There's also a companion study to that &#x2013; not associated with it but very similar, which is a CALGB study of several hundred patients as well, that is looking at the same thing in terms of the use of REVLIMID as maintenance therapy. We do know that the &#x2013; again, neither one of those two studies are Celgene-sponsored studies. The first one's an IFM study. And that IFM study is being analyzed as we speak.</p>
          <p>And so hopefully, we will certainly have some data at ASH, and that data could be hopefully very positive. But I don't know the extent to which we're going to have data for that. When we do get data, and hopefully that'll be in late 2009, 2010, we'll try to assemble that data and if it's positive, as we all anticipate it will be, we will submit that data.</p>
          <p>And MM-015, the first interim analysis as many people know was delayed a couple of months because of the fact that we did not hit the number of events, which is actually obviously a very good thing. It's taking longer for people to progress. That's a positive sign, but until the data is unblinded at the appropriate point, you just don't know. The first interim analysis will be occurring later, and the interim data monitoring safety board will communicate one of the several options to us and then if it's a positive option, then we will obviously talk to the FDA and the EMEA about what the best filing strategy is going to be for that study. We have a second interim that's scheduled for later this year.</p>
          <p>So both of those are very exciting trials. They are extremely &#x2013; I think they could have significant impact in the marketplace. I think they could set a new standard for myeloma treatment, which would be very important. And we'll see, depending on the results of the study, what is presented at ASH, and we will obviously file as quickly as possible.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hi. Thanks very much for info and for the slides; it's actually really helpful. I have two questions for you guys. Bob, they're both for you. I don't mean to put you on the spot, but you really run commercial ops, so you're the best to answer these. The first question is, just help us understand a little bit, you're seeing demand in scripts actually going up. Duration was up in the U.S. Duration happened to be flat this quarter relative to last quarter internationally, but sales contracted. So is the market contracting here? Or is it just that you believe things got pushed out because of reimbursements? Do you have a sense? Because VELCADE actually was pretty strong in March after being flat for many months. So we're kind of wondering whether they captured some share there. And then secondly, can you share with us with a little bit, just sequentially, in terms of demand, how was January versus February versus March? And maybe if you can, what are you seeing in April? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A lot of questions. I think I want to first make sure that it's clear about how we see the positioning of REVLIMID. And I think it's dangerous to use shorter-term market share data, but I have to tell you when you compare the shorter-term data versus the longer-term 12-month rolling averages, the 12-month rolling averages are quite positive for how REVLIMID is competing in all lines in the United States and obviously in Europe, a separate analysis. But I'm glad to cover that.</p>
          <p>So REVLIMID and then the shorter term market share data, the most recent one, which is less reliable, more preliminary, shows an even accelerating improvement in the first quarter including March of REVLIMID's relative positioning in the U.S. So I think there's lots of factors in terms of the end of fiscal years and inventory, et cetera. And we certainly were impacted by some inventory dislocations. We had a systems changeover at the beginning of the year to move to an enterprise-wide software system early in January of this year. So there was potential issues of ensuring that distributors had adequate supplies around the world in late December. There was a price increase in December, not a small, an inflation-related price increase on REVLIMID in the U.S. So I think we did have some positive impact probably in the fourth quarter. And then we saw a fairly significant tightening of the distributors or regional &#x2013; especially pharmacies in terms of balance sheet management in the first quarter. So I think there &#x2013; I mean there were some of those factors that led to that.</p>
          <p>Prescription trends were positive. We did see some delays in January in the sense that as Medicare Part D new year came along, there were pressures on how quickly prescriptions were being filled. The trend has generally been positive as we move from January, February, March and April in both of our major products by days and REVLIMID; the trend in April was a very positive one. So if anything, the trend is our friend here as we're going forward. And there were a number of one-time impacts in the first quarter that account for it. So, on a relative basis to other products we feel REVLIMID is stronger today than it was two months ago or three months ago. And the issues in the first quarter, we think we're moving through.</p>
          <p>That doesn't change the fact that it's clearly a very challenging environment and we're going to need a number of important key growth drivers in the second half of the year including the reimbursement issues, but an extension of the duration. I also don't think it's fair to characterize the duration in Europe as flat in the quarter. I think that we do have markets in Europe where we are working hard to ensure that people are educated on the importance of treating through to progression, not just to best response.</p>
          <p>And some of the economic pressures clearly, on hospitals and other budgets, pressure people to look at that. And so that's why the maintenance study is important, and we're hopeful we'll see at least the early preliminary data of response rates and it's going to take to longer term to get the survival advantage that we think REVLIMID will show in those kinds of maintenance studies. But I think &#x2013; so I think we feel very good about the data that will be coming out but it's clearly going to be a challenge to ensure the growth is there to get to the full guidance for the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the question is for each one of you guys, so maybe for Dave; can you quantify the free drug impact in the first quarter and then what that looks like going into the second quarter? The question &#x2013; I have a question on VIDAZA. What do you think is the peak share that you can achieve in the U.S.? In other words, how much can you displace DACOGEN? And then a final question, maybe for Sol for Apremilast. What efficacy do you guys have to see to go aggressively in Phase III, should we thinking about kind of Enbrel as the marker there as to a clinically meaningful result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff, let me just answer a couple of the quick &#x2013; the first ones quickly. On the free drug, we began to see an increase in the fourth quarter and the first quarter free good in the U.S. was about two percentage points or a percentage point and a half higher than we had anticipated. And that was a little bit of an issue in terms of the decline in the first quarter in terms of the impact versus our plan in any case. So, it was about 1.5% higher than we had expected, and probably about 2% higher than we would have seen over the history of the drug since its launch. And it wasn't just REVLIMID. We've seen it in Thalidomide also.</p>
          <p>On the DACOGEN front and the VIDAZA front in the U.S., we have about two years left until regulatory exclusivity. We're focused on making VIDAZA the predominant, preeminent, virtually exclusive drug in the high-risk MDS setting and we're doing everything we can. I think the AZA-001 publication which really illustrates the differentiated survival benefit of VIDAZA is now getting in community physicians' hands and we are optimistic that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network is going to make a differentiation between the products based on the clinical evidence. And so there has been &#x2013; there have been healthcare systems that have treated the drugs equal on their pathways and on the protocols. And so we think that that would give us the momentum in the second half of the year, should that be a differentiating factor, to really ensure that insurance companies and practices recognize that the cheaper drug is clearly not the reason to use it, but it is an advantage there and is so differentiated on a clinical benefit.</p>
          <p>So, we think the market share in newly diagnosed MDS patients is extremely high and has increased dramatically over the past year and that's going to continue to accelerate as the year goes forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Apremilast, I'm actually quite excited about the compound. It is very different than a biologic in terms of mechanism of action, route of administration, and very importantly both for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis in terms of side effects and the positioning of it would be very different than the biologic. So I think that if we get &#x2013; continue to get the encouragement that we've seen in the dose escalation study of the 30 mgs BID and for longer periods of time, I think that would be very positive in psoriasis. And it probably will not be the same as the biologic in terms of the PASI-75.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, as I mentioned, it's going to be used in a different manner. It may be used before Enbrel. There may be a price differential between them that would &#x2013; third-party payers would favor this significantly, the adverse events so far. And again, you never know until you do the larger trials, but out of hundreds and hundreds of patients that have been dosed with this drug at multiple dosages, they're very mild compared to many other things.</p>
          <p>I'm very excited about psoriasis. And in terms of psoriatic arthritis, we'll have that data soon and we'll see how close to the biologics it comes in that. The end point is obviously ATR20. And again, it offers patients a new oral therapy that hopefully has a very high level of efficacy-to-safety ratio, which is going to be very important for physicians who treat in that indication. So I am really excited about it. With every new drug, you have to see the kind of activity it has. But we'll certainly learn in the relatively near future the psoriatic arthritis activity of this novel agent and towards the end of the year the larger study in terms of psoriasis itself.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. A few questions. Just number one, if we put it all together and you look at the inventory effects, the FX impact, hospital buying patterns you saw in Europe and this Part D doughnut hole that you had to deal with, what would you consider to be the true base sales we should consider in the first quarter when we're thinking about our estimates going forward? And then secondarily, on a clinical point, we've heard some positive comments on high-dose REVLIMID in AML. And just wondering if you could maybe discuss what data we'll get from ongoing AML trials and how you might think about an accelerated filing there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; we haven't specifically quantified the different impacts of whether it's short-term, whether it was in the first quarter, but I think the inventory impact between the fourth and the first quarter is likely to have been around the $10 million range. And then the decline at the end of the first quarter is probably more of a $5 million range. But other than that, we really haven't given any specific quantification to that impact.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>I'm sorry, could you ask that second question again, please? The second part of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just and maybe before that just quickly, Bob, on the co-pay issue, we've heard from other companies that have oral cancer drugs, that payers in some cases are going from a fixed co-pay to a percent of drug cost co-pay. Are you seeing that? And what are you doing to address that issue in terms of co-pay assistance? The question on AML was just what data should we expect this year? We've had some positive feedback on some ongoing trials of high-dose REVLIMID. Just wondering if you can tell us when we're going to get the AML data this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the AML data is, we really don't know. There's so many trials that are going on at various levels of rev in patients with AML. There is &#x2013; at multiple institutions both in 5q and in non-5q in terms of everything from high-risk MDS, which is pretty close to AML, to AML itself, to newly diagnosed AML, single-arm, combination, so I really don't know short-term what's going to be presented. At, for example, EHA, we're pretty confident that there will certainly be presentations and posters at the upcoming ASH in that area, with all of the trials that are going on. But I don't have the specifics for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of co-payment, it's clearly an issue for all drugs. But, Jim, the issue with cancer drugs tends to be that on the oral side that you get into the doughnut hole. So it is really that issue. It has less of an impact so much on the percentage because you're going to get into that total &#x2013; into the doughnut hole relatively quickly. So I think you are seeing programs go to more percentage versus flat co-pays. We haven't seen a change in the need related to what we do to help support independent third-party nonprofit co-payments.</p>
          <p>We have a commitment to ensure that there has &#x2013; there is a resource out there for people to go to. That's not affiliated with Celgene but we certainly support them. And even throughout this very challenging economic environment, rising unemployment, our commitment has been unwavering and to ensure that those foundations do have the support needed to support myeloma and MDS patients. So that has not proven &#x2013; it's proven to be an expense for us and we're hopeful that unemployment, it will not dramatically rise the rest of the year and will hopefully decline in 2010 and 2011. But we're there and we're committed to making that happen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking the question. You say that the U.K., Canada and Australia launch are essential for hitting your guidance. So I'm just wondering how much you're assuming that you could book from these markets this year? And if they don't come in, I guess how much below guidance do you think you could fall? And I guess, and finally, is there a scenario where you could come in at the high end, and if not, why not just lower the guidance at this point, such that the low end is not your midpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I think that we have a quarter of the year in the books. It was a challenging quarter in some ways, but in a lot of ways, it was a very positive quarter in the trends and market share and duration. Specifically, to the Canadian, Australian and U.K., we don't give specific numbers country by country, but we are well-positioned there. We are beginning to make sales even before the reimbursement. So I think it is an important factor for us, but they're not the only factors. And I think the continued penetration in other markets and duration, et cetera, going to be &#x2013; is going to go up and down and be variable. So I am personally of the view that that with any guidance, there's a range plus and minus to it. And I think at this point, we still have a lot of time to go before we're confident to say it's likely to be the low end of the range or below the range or at the middle end or the higher end. So I think we're sticking with what we are, and as we see these events happen or trends change, we'll have to reassess it and we'll likely do that at the end of the second quarter call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. There are two questions I have is, one is could you help us understand what is the percentage of prescriptions which are free drug and which may have changed over fourth quarter to first quarter and how do you see that evolving as you're going forward in the future quarters? And secondly, you give us a lot of detail on the myeloma market, clearly used in other indications much less so. Just what other use happens there, I mean I think one thing I'm struggling with it is just that the fundamental data continues to be strong, and still clearly, I mean even factoring in one-time sales impact, it does not seem, as Jason mentioned, that you're on track to meet really guidance unless there is aggressive ramp up. So, if you could help me understand that, that would be really great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The free goods in the REVLIMID context is &#x2013; we do believe the first quarter is the most significant quarter if you're going to see an increase in free goods and that is because you want to make sure the patients, as they're navigating different new insurances or et cetera, that need assistance with that, you want to make sure they're on therapy or remain on therapy. So you can see that sometimes flip up. But I think the overall economic environment has moved us from 4, 4.5% to probably closer to be more in the mid-6's percentage on REVLIMID to what we're looking at for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>The second question was &#x2013; I'm not sure, I apologize, Sapna, could you &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just the impact on using other indications just like MDS, et cetera, I mean, are you seeing economic conditions really impact use there, the data for REVLIMID is not as compelling as it has been in myeloma?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, general in the usage patterns in the United States, which are easier for us to track because of RevAssist and steps than it is in other markets, the myeloma percentage has been relatively constant. There has been a little erosion but not significant in MDS. And there's been a little bit of gain from other indications that might have been in the four to 5% range, that are now overall in the six to 7% range based on some data and compendia listing. We do have compendia listing in CLL. We do have compendia listing now in relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Obviously those are challenges for patients and payers in terms of the issues of co-payments et cetera, where myeloma and MDS is not so severe.</p>
          <p>I do think some of what you would have might have seen are some of the data on MDS and the 004 data is important for us to give the REVLIMID usage a boost, to have a confirmatory trial in 004. We're hopeful to see that data in the next couple months. That trial having been completed. And if the results are consistent with the MDS-003 trial, I think that gives us new ammunition to go out there. But generally having the VIDAZA product has allowed the discussions at MDS to be robust. So even though there hasn't been new data, hopefully now that will change with the 004.</p>
          <p>We've held on there. We haven't grown REVLIMID MDS like we had hoped and so we have opportunities there in terms of duration gains and with the new data and with the keeping the VIDAZA momentum going helps us overall also. So I would not say there is a differentiated economic impact by disease state that we've observed, at least not to this point.</p>
          <p>Operator, we have time to take two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we'll take our next question from Maged Shenouda of UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, hi. So I have a whole bunch of questions here, but maybe we can start with this. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in fill and refill rates for REV and THAL in first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year some numbers around those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I've got them here someplace. What we saw was about 0.5% kind of change over the last few quarters. In terms of the rates of prescription versus dispensed. So, maybe a 0.5% negative impact over a few quarters. And we've seen some erosion in the percentage by probably a 0.5% or sorry &#x2013; about a day in terms of the time it takes because of the increased number of people requiring assistance to get insurance coverage and the right co-payment assistance in terms between the &#x2013; an authorization and ultimate dispense.</p>
          <p>So, we've seen some delays. We've seen some decline in the &#x2013; we've seen some &#x2013; an increase but as I said about 0.5% between written and then dispenses which is troubling that there are people out there that get a prescription and then decide that for whatever reasons and hopefully it's for good reasons, not just cost reasons, that they don't fill the prescription.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any sense of when they will be coming back to refill those prescriptions? So is it just &#x2013; of the timing there? Is it transient or are they lost to the system completely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We generally don't seem to be losing patients that once they get on therapy, have reimbursement, whether it's through co-payments &#x2013; because you get into the doughnut hole relatively quickly so the major issue of insurance and funding and support of that is addressed very early on in therapy.</p>
          <p>So, it is not something like you're on three months of therapy and all of a sudden you're hit with this huge co-pay. You've been hit with it now when you do enter a new year that is a factor and we did see a little bit of pressure, which we had not seen before this January of patients on having a delay as they navigate the new co-payment and have to maybe seek assistance for the first time. But we haven't seen a deterioration in anything because that would ultimately lead to a decline in duration and in fact, the trends on duration in the first quarter continued pretty much in line with the trends we've seen in duration for the last 18 months.</p>
          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And it appears for our final question, we'll have Matt Osborne from Lazard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, great, thanks for taking my question here. Sol, just a question on Apremilast, depending on the data in the middle of this year, could you also position this drug as a bridge for patients before going to biologics or are you really trying to displace biologics in moderate to severe psoriasis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. You hit it on the head. We've had a lot of KOL sessions and focus groups and so on and we'll obviously have a lot more, especially in psoriatic arthritis and the draw was also positive and in the higher dose, longer dosing trial for Apremilast.</p>
          <p>But what we're seeing is a lot of the recommendations are exactly what you just indicated that this is &#x2013; in the earlier use for patients, before biologic, it would make sense for the patient individually, the physicians like it better because at least to this point, it is a milder drug that doesn't have the potential negative indications associated with the biologics. So, it may have a unique earlier role in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis as long as of course the data and the clinical data is there, which I'm very hopeful for.</p>
          <p>But that's exactly right. It could have a unique and new niche in the U.S. and around the world where some of the biologics are not used because of the cost and other issues associated with them, this being an oral drug.</p>
