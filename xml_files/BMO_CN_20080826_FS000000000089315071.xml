To give everyone an opportunity to participate we ask that you please ask one question then re-queue. At this time, I would like to caution our listeners by stating the following on behalf of those speaking today.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements may be made during this call, and there are risks that actual results could differ materially from forecasts, projections, or conclusions in the forward-looking statements. Certain material factors and assumptions were applied and drawing the conclusion, or making the forecast or projections in these forward-looking statements. You can find additional information about such material factors and assumptions, and the material factors that could cause actual results to so differ in our caution regarding forward-looking statements set forth in our news release, or on the Investor Relations website.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Viki, and good afternoon, everyone. As noted, my comments may include forward-looking statements. Turning first to our financial results net income for the third quarter was $521 million compared to 660 in 2007. On a year-to-date basis, we've earned $1.4 billion. Earnings per share, fully diluted were $0.98 compared to $1.28 a year ago. Cash EPS was $1 compared to $1.30, and you should note that year-over-year the increase in PCLs amounted to approximately $0.50 a share.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, our Tier 1 capital ratio strengthened from 9.4% to 9.9%, and return on equity was 13.5% on the higher capital base. While our core businesses have reported good, in some cases very good results, the deterioration in the U.S. housing markets has required higher provisions for credit losses, and our overall results have been negatively impacted. Looking at our results on a business-by-business basis there is clear evidence that we're making good progress in delivering against our stated strategies.</p>
          <p>Before I speak to the core businesses I want to make a few comments on Credit. Our U.S. portfolio, including our securitization conduit, is being carefully supervised given the economic environment in the U.S. and more specifically the U.S. housing industry. Two credits that were removed from the conduit early in the year are in the Bank's workout group, and we took an additional provision against them in Q3. We're managing this situation actively, and are confident that this provision is appropriate. As in previous credit cycles, we believe we'll maximize recoveries through an aggressive workout process, and Tom Flynn will talk in specific detail about our credit exposures and take you through the provisions, as well as giving you an update on the off balance-sheet entities.</p>
          <p>Moving now to core businesses, our Canadian retail strategy continues to deliver good results. P&amp;C Canada recorded one of its best quarters ever, with net income of 343 million. This was up over the second quarter of 2008, and was attributable to good revenue growth across the business. Strong Personal Loan growth at 19% year-over-year, market share increasing 87 basis points over Q3 2007, and I'd note it's improved in seven consecutive quarters. Commercial banking loans increased 9% year -- over a year ago, and market share also improved 69 basis points over Q3 2007, and it as well has improved in six of the seven last quarters.</p>
          <p>Customer loyalty continues to improve in both our personal and commercial businesses. Our customer base is growing, and we're strengthening customer relationships. Our results in P&amp;C Canada are a clear indication that our customer and growth strategy is working. We're going to keep doing what we're doing, and we expect this business will continue to provide improved returns.</p>
          <p>P&amp;C U.S. is holding its own in a challenging environment, with net income growing 12% year-over-year. In particular, net interest margins are showing early signs of stabilization, and this is an encouraging sign given margin pressures in recent quarters. Volumes, spreads, and fees all improved over the second quarter. Half of the revenue growth was due to the Wisconsin acquisitions and this was in line with our expectations. The results included 3 million in integration costs from Wisconsin, we expect these to increase to 16 to 18 million in the fourth quarter, when we'll have completed the bulk of the integration process.</p>
          <p>Harris has been able to capture a significant share of re-financing volume from high quality borrowers who are taking advantage of a decline in mortgage rates in the last two quarters and wanted to establish a new banking relationship. Clearly, provisions for credit losses are elevated, but Harris continues to compare very favorably with other U.S. regional banks. Our P&amp;C business is not immune to larger market forces, but anchored in the Midwest. It's solid, it's growing, and it's running well.</p>
          <p>Private Client Group delivered a second straight quarter of record net income at $110 million. This was an increase of 8 million, or 8.4% year over year despite challenging market conditions. Revenue growth covered a number of our fee-based businesses, including full service investing and higher trust and investment revenues in North American private banking. Obviously, we're pleased by the excellent results in Wealth Management and we expect it to continue to perform well.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to address our expenses in broad terms because I don't want there to be any uncertainty about our discipline. We're balancing our spending on long-term growth opportunities while recognizing the importance and visibility of shorter term profitability. We're going to maintain a prudent level of strategic spending to support continued market share growth, while mindful of the current environment, and we see a bigger picture. Our spending on the retail network has been an investment in stronger competitive positioning and includes growing and upgrading our branch network, increasing specialized sales forces, bolstering call centers, and becoming more visible in our communities through more visible advertising and promotion.</p>
          <p>And from the results I've just discussed, it's clearly working. We're profitably building market share and building our retail business and I think we're hitting our stride. So we'll continue to invest in building the business because it's generating good returns for BMO and its shareholders. The level of spending has been tempered by prevailing economic conditions, and it will be adjusted as conditions change, and Russ is going to provide more specific details about Q3 expenses.</p>
          <p>Coming back to the operating groups, in BMO Capital Markets results are up year-over-year, with net income of 259 million, an improvement over Q3 2007. We had good revenue growth, attributable in part to strong trading and driven by a positive yield curve. We expect the yield curve to remain positive while other areas of the business continue to be impacted by current market conditions, notably lower M&amp;A. With considerable uncertainty remaining in the marketplace, we continue to refocus capital markets, absorbing 28 million in severance-related expenses, to achieve further expense reductions.</p>
          <p>We've reviewed our U.S. credit commitments to focus on those clients where there is an opportunity to develop multi-product relationships, and as a result, have designated 20% as non-core. These will not be renewed on expiry, and as well de-risking the business continues as evidenced by the reduction in the core credit book, in the SIVs, in securitization, and continued risk reduction in commodity -- in the commodity business.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the economic outlook, we expect the U.S. economy will slow further in the second half. And although the U.S. is not technically in a recession, falling house prices, rising unemployment, tightening credit standards, and high gasoline and grocery bills are all expected to depress consumer spending. In particular, house prices will continue to decrease until the large inventory of unsold houses is absorbed. The Chicago housing market does continue to perform better than other regions in the country, the Case-Shiller data for June showed the year-over-year median house price decline was 9.5% in Chicago, and that compares to the nationwide 20 city index decline of 15.9%. That said, the benefit of tax rebate checks was largely spent in Q2, and is unlikely to provide lift beyond Q3. And as a result, there is considerable concern over consumers' financial health.</p>
          <p>In Canada, the economic outlook for the balance of 2008 is for an annual growth rate of 1%, and that would be the slowest growth rate since 1992. Regionally, the West is still doing well, but slowing as commodity prices have declined. And Ontario and Quebec have lost good jobs and are in recession. Canada's residential real estate market is cooling.</p>
          <p>The period of illiquidity that we've been experiencing does not have a historic parallel; however, the economic cycle does have defined characteristics, and we're seeing indicators that suggest that the cycle is progressing much like others have before. For example, with housing starts in the U.S. at a 17 year low, it's clear that at some point the supply/demand balance is going to come back into line. In short, these times are challenging, and we can reasonably expect them to remain challenging for the near future. I can tell you, however, that BMO Financial Group is managing effectively through this period and ready to capture significant gains when more normal times resume.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to Russ to walk through the financials.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon. As some of my comments are forward-looking, please note the caution regarding forward-looking statements on Slide 1. On Slide 3, and as Bill mentioned, you can see the reported second quarter earnings were 521 million, or $0.98 per share, compared to $1.28 last year. On a cash basis, earnings were $1.00 per share. I'd like to spend my time today, discussing some of the key drivers of earnings this quarter. Tom will comment specifically on provisions for credit losses.</p>
          <p>On Slide 4, you'll see that revenue was 2.7 billion, up about 5%, quarter-over-quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, there was volume growth across most products in P&amp;C Canada, as well as higher card revenue. Results also benefited by two additional calendar days this quarter. P&amp;C U.S. results were up as well, with volume growth, spread stabilization, increased fees, and the addition of the Wisconsin-based bank acquisitions. Private Client Group's revenue growth came mainly from the brokerage businesses and North American private banking.</p>
          <p>Revenue in BMO Capital Markets grew due to significantly higher trading revenues, and strong performance from our interest rate sensitive businesses. Year-over-year revenues increased 7.5% on a reported basis. Net interest income was 1.3 billion in Q3, up over both comparative quarters.</p>
          <p>Looking more specifically at the margins on Slide 5, total bank margin is up 11 basis points from Q2. The main driver of the increase was higher trading spreads in BMO Capital Markets. On a Group basis, margins were down year-over-year by 5 basis points in P&amp;C Canada, but were up quarter-over-quarter by two basis points. The decrease year-over-year was due to lower mortgage refinancing fees, higher funding costs, and competitive pricing pressures partially offset by improving product mix. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by a more favorable product mix and higher financing fees, partially offset by higher funding costs.</p>
          <p>Margins in P&amp;C U.S. were up 18 basis points quarter-over-quarter, with early signs of spread stabilization in loans and deposits, in part due to pricing initiatives. The main driver of the 26 basis point year-over-year decline was the 22 basis point impact of a portfolio transfer. The increase in BMO Capital Markets is attributable to better spreads in Trading and Corporate Lending. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on shifting our mix to higher spread products, but expect downward pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 7, non-interest revenue was impacted by Capital Market's environment charges, amounting to 134 million pre-tax, 96 million after-tax, or $0.19 per share, compared with the prior quarter benefit of 42 million pre-tax, or $0.06 per share.</p>
          <p>Two items accounted for the majority of the quarter-over-quarter change. First, a charge of 58 million pre-tax for mark-to-market valuations on counterparty credit exposures on derivative contracts, largely a result of widening corporate counterparty credit spreads relative to BMO. The prior quarter had a benefit of 128 million pre-tax, largely as a result of BMO credit spreads widening relative to our government counterparties. Second, the net charge of 15 million pre-tax related to our Apex restructuring and valuation changes during the quarter. The prior quarter had a recovery of 85 million.</p>
          <p>This quarter included a gain of 40 million due to the reversal of a portion of charges previously recorded on our 815 million of Apex exposure. Another party to the restructuring holds a $600 million exposure to Apex through total return swap with BMO. We have a loss of 55 million related to this total return swap transaction. This total return swap is in the trading portfolio, and subject to mark-to-market accounting. Also included in the capital markets charges were the following: a recovery of 25 million pre-tax or other trading and structured-credit related positions, last quarter we had a charge of 93 million.</p>
          <p>A $28 million pre-tax charge for asset-backed commercial paper held that it's subject to the Montreal Accord. This is due to an increase in the discount rate used for valuation. A $3 million charge for our capital notes investment in SIVs, and a charge of 55 million pre-tax for other than temporary impairments and valuation adjustments on preferred shares held in our trading portfolio. These charges above are reflected in the non-interest revenues, specifically 61 million in securities, gains and losses other than trading; 76 million in trading revenue; and a recovery of 3 million and other NIR.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 8, expenses were up 7.4% from a year ago, and increased in each of the operating groups. Excluding the severance charge in BMO Capital Markets, expenses were up 5.7% from the prior year. As Bill noted earlier, the largest increase year-over-year has been the continued investment in our businesses of approximately 70 million, over half of this increase relates to acquisitions and sales force expansion. The balance relates to initiatives, marketing, and promotion. Professional fees were also up year-over-year due in part due regulatory initiatives. Other increases included BMO Capital Markets' severance cost, and higher capital taxes, as the prior year was unusually low. These increases were offset by lower performance-based compensation, mostly in BMO Capital Markets, and the effects of the weaker U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>The quarter-over-quarter increase was 6%. Consistent with the year-over-year, the increase reflects continued investment in our businesses, higher capital taxes, and severance. There were also two additional days in the current quarter, and higher performance-based compensation in line with increased revenues. These increases were reduced by a Visa litigation reserve, and an increase in foreign pension expense booked in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a recovery of 12.2%. The decrease in the rate from last quarter is mainly due to 95 million of recoveries of prior years' income taxes, and the higher proportion of income from lower tax rate jurisdictions. We've revised our ongoing, sustainable effective tax rate estimate to range from 17 to 21%, down from 19 to 23%.</p>
          <p>On Slide 10 you'll see that our capital ratio was 9.9% for the quarter, up 48 basis points from Q2, with risk-weighted assets of 182.3 billion under Basel II. 27 of the basis points increase was driven by the higher Tier 1 balances, including a preferred share issuance. The remainder of the increase is a result of lower risk-weighted assets, including a $2 billion drop in market risk assets.</p>
          <p>To wrap up, I should say that as we've reported cash earnings of $1 per share, I would like to provide some thoughts on what our sustainable earnings may be based on present market and credit conditions. I think I would adjust that $1 for the general allowance which is $0.06 a share, the severance of $0.04 a share, and adjust downward for the income tax drawdown that we took of $0.19 a share. And then I think I would significantly reduce the level of provision for credit losses that we had in the current period to a more normal level in this present environment.</p>
          <p>And that would give me a sustainable earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.30 in my view. And with that, I will turn things over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Russ. Before I begin I will draw your attention to the caution regarding forward-looking statements. I want to start with three overarching points about the quarter from a risk perspective.</p>
          <p>First, Q3 credit losses are elevated by provisions on two large accounts. These two accounts have attributes that make them not representative of the portfolio as a whole. Second, the weak state of the U.S. housing market has continued to put pressure on portfolios that are related to that sector. Third, our Canadian portfolios and our non-housing-related U.S. portfolios continue to perform in a satisfactory manner. I will speak at some length to give you a better understanding about each of these three points.</p>
          <p>Starting on Slide 3 with impaired loans. You can see that impaired loan formations during the quarter totaled 434 million, down from the prior two quarters. The decrease in the quarter largely reflects the impact on formations in quarters one and two from two accounts. These two accounts increased our aggregate Q1 and Q2 formations by approximately $600 million.</p>
          <p>The majority of Q3 formations came from Manufacturing and U.S. Commercial Real Estate sectors and from one account in the Oil and Gas sector. Gross impaired loans decreased slightly from last quarter, but remain higher than the first quarter due to the weaker environment.</p>
          <p>Slide 4 shows segmented geographic and industry information for impaired loans. The majority of impaired loans are U.S.-based at the end of Q3. Accounts related to commercial real estate represent 58% of U.S. impaired loans. This includes a commercial real estate related loan classified in financial institutions. Within the commercial real estate category, exposure is largely concentrated in the residential sub-sector.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 5, our total provision for credit losses was $484 million in the quarter. This included a $50 million in the general allowance. The increase in the general allowance is based on our assessment of the weaker outlook for the economy, and in particular the U.S. housing market. The Q3 specific provision was 434 million. 247 million of this was from the two commercial accounts that I mentioned earlier. Both of these accounts were originated in our U.S. securitization conduit. If you exclude these two accounts, the specific provision for the quarter would have been 187 million, and this included an amount of 27 million for one account in the Oil and Gas sector.</p>
          <p>The table on Slide 5 provides additional segmented geographic and business line information on the provision. You will see that the Canadian portfolios have performed well, with both consumer and commercial provisions being relatively flat. U.S. consumer and commercial provisions are up, both due largely to the U.S. housing market. Corporate loan provisions are up from the prior quarters, the two accounts that I had referred to represent about 80% of the provision.</p>
          <p>Clearly the provision for the two accounts is large for the quarter. The two accounts had characteristics that made them more susceptible to loss, given the current state of the U.S. housing market. Due to the unusual size of these provisions, I will give you additional color on them. The first account was related to a company that until recently had a successful long-term record of buying and remediating distressed U.S. residential mortgages. The funding provided was largely used to finance a warehouse portfolio of such mortgages. When the account was transferred from our U.S. conduit, it had approximately 460 million in outstandings.</p>
          <p>Collateral for the account largely consisted of approximately 4,000 residential mortgages spread across much of the United States. The size of the provision reflects the continued weakness in the housing market, and also some specific factors. The first of these is that the values for the type of distressed mortgages, including foreclosed mortgages that are included in the portfolio, have been more negatively impacted than the overall housing market. In addition, some of the collateral was in states that have been harder hit by the downturn.</p>
          <p>To arrive at the provision on this account during a time when markets were deteriorating rapidly, we undertook a series of appraisals to update portfolio information. This review led to the additional provision of $151 million and the write-off of a 105 million this quarter. With this provision, the net unreserved balance is approximately $210 million.</p>
          <p>The second account funded and underlying portfolio of approximately 250 loan facilities. These facilities were used to fund housing development projects located largely in Minnesota, and to a lesser degree in South Carolina. These loans were originated and serviced by a third-party company. The loan had a gross value of approximately 150 million when it was transferred. We've taken a provision this quarter of 90 million, and a total of 125 million against this account. The net unreserved exposure is under 25 million.</p>
          <p>The size of the provision taken here reflects the weak state of the U.S. housing development market, but again also a number of specific factors. These include that the portfolio was concentrated outside major urban areas, which has negatively impacted values as these markets have been hit harder by the downturn. Secondly, issues associated with the way the facility was put together and its operations increased our exposure to loss. And lastly, the need to replace the original servicer and work through complex documentation that included multiple liens added complexity and risk.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude on these two accounts, both of the accounts have characteristics that made them particularly vulnerable to the housing downturn. We believe that the provision we have taken will cover off the exposure that we have to the two accounts.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Slide 6. You can see a further segmentation of the Q3 specific provision. As with formations, provisions are driven by the U.S. portfolio, with approximately 70% of U.S. specific provisions resulting from the two loans that I have already covered in detail. The consumer, and within that credit card business, continues to be the largest component of the Canadian provisions. The credit card business tends to be fairly predictable over time. With respect to cards, we have noticed a decline in delinquencies over the last quarter, demonstrating the successive efforts to rebalance our origination channels, and also improvements made in our collection areas.</p>
          <p>To sum up our view on the quarter from a credit perspective, first, the portfolios associated with the U.S. housing market are feeling the effects of the economic environment as reflected in higher provisions. Second, our Canadian portfolios continue to perform well as do U.S. portfolios that are not tied to the U.S. housing market. And finally, provisions in the current quarter were above where we expected them to be, primarily due to the larger-than-expected provisions taken against two accounts that had attributes that made them particularly exposed to the U.S. housing market.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 provides details on our U.S. loan book, which is well diversified across portfolios. The consumer portfolio represents less than 10% of BMO's loan book. The residential mortgage and indirect auto portfolios have seen a pickup on loss rates, but they remain relatively modest, both in absolute terms and relative to other U.S. banks. For example, mortgage and indirect auto portfolio average charge offs in quarters two and three were each under a third of Q2 pure averages. In common with other banks, we have seen more weakness in our U.S. home equity portfolio in the last two quarters.</p>
          <p>Losses have increased here, but again they remain below industry average. You can also see from the information provided on the bottom left of the slide that the higher risk parts of our mortgage and home equity portfolios are relatively small. The U.S. commercial and corporate portfolios are well diversified and generally performing well. The commercial real estate portion of the portfolio is approximately 4.7 billion, and within this, approximately 1.7 billion is developer related.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 provides an update on our U.S. securitization conduit, which was formed in 1997. The ratings continue to be strong at A1 and P1 by Moody's and S&amp;P, respectively. Assets in the conduit are well-diversified across 99 different securitization transactions, each of which has a diversified pool of underlying assets. The average transaction size here is $93 million. There are 10 transactions larger than 200 million, and none of these is real estate related. Only one of these is above 365 million.</p>
          <p>These 10 transactions are made up of eight different asset types, including equipment leases, consumer loans, and credit card receivables. The asset quality is fine, 97% of the assets are internally rated investment grade equivalent, even when no value is given to the monoline wraps that some transactions have 61% are externally rated, with these ratings being single A or better.</p>
          <p>Earlier in the year we transferred a third account from our U.S. securitization conduit. This conduit funded a number of real estate projects, which are diversified across much of the United States. The July 31 outstanding here was approximately 160 million, down from 225 million when the account was moved out of the conduit. The assets continue to perform, and we are expecting full repayment on this loan.</p>
          <p>For the conduit as a whole, commercial real estate related commitments currently represents approximately 13% of total commitments. Given the environment, there can be no certainties with respect to performance. That said, a review of the conduit's portfolio has not identified other immediate concerns. On Slide 8 I will direct you to the large trading and underwriting gains and losses on a few dates. These were driven by the type of valuation adjustments that Russ referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 provides an update on some topical capital market related issues. As you can see, progress continues to be made, and our exposures are manageable. We have only modest exposure to U.S. sub-prime mortgages, monolines and hedge funds. As Russ mentioned, Apex has been successfully restructured. We remain comfortable with the credit exposure here, given the credit quality of the underlying companies and the first loss protection that is in place.</p>
          <p>The SIVs are being managed in line with our plans. We are comfortable with our senior position, given the credit quality of the assets and the size of the subordinate capital notes. The amount that we have funded has increased in the quarter. As we told you last quarter, we intend to slow the pace of asset sales in the SIV to preserve the value of the subordinate capital that supports our senior funding.</p>
          <p>Last quarter the size of the Links facility was approximately $8.8 billion. That amount was down to 7.9 billion at July 31. The amount that we have actually funded at the end of Q3 was approximately $3 billion for Links and $4 billion in total. We expect an increase of approximately $1 billion in the funded amount during the fourth quarter. Our expectation for the total size of the facility that will be funded has not changed since the facility was first put in place, and continues to be below 6 billion for Links and 500 million euros for Parkland.</p>
          <p>And with that we'll open the call for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two quick ones on Apex, please. First of all this, total return swap, can you address the quality of the counterparty, and what kind of collateral agreement there may be? And the second one is, I understand you're marking this on the &#x2013; missed your notes I mean, you're marking on the discounted cash flow basis. What would lead you to mark this on a liquidation basis? I understand this is probably not going to get liquidated since there's no funding risk anymore, but under what scenario would you have to make that assumption?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;, I'll answer the first part. The counterparty is one of undoubted credit quality and does not have to host any cash collateral, so we're quite happy with the positions.</p>

          <p>Well, I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood your second comment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. How can credit quality be that strong that you have no doubt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we think it is very high credit quality, so we're comfortable with the positions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andr&#xE9;, this is Russ Robertson. Can you just repeat the second part of the question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Given that the margin facility related to Apex is being drawn, I suspect that if you had to assume that Apex were dissolved, the mark-to-market would be a lot more severe than what you're marking it at, which is based on a DCF methodology. My question is, what would lead to a change in the accounting treatment for your holdings in mid-term notes of Apex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The accounting is based on the expectation that the facility will be in place through the life of Apex, and the structure will remain in place and we're therefore accounting for it based on the underlying credit quality of the portfolio, which we believe to be high. And also to be supported by the first-loss protection that is in place. So with that expectation staying in place that will continue to be the accounting. And really, we wouldn't revert to any other type of accounting for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. One question for Russ, you were kind enough to give us a core earnings guidance of $1.20 to $1.30, and I just want to put that, just maybe dig into one of your assumptions regarding loan loss provisions, and I put it in the context of some of the commentary that Tom had regarding the U.S. and Bill's rather pessimistic view in terms of the Canadian economy and some of the issues that it's facing. So maybe you could just elaborate in terms of what you think the level of loan losses is expected to be in the upcoming couple of quarters given the environment that you've suggested this EPS range could be earned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, I might suggest that Tom speak specifically to that, since he's got the closest view of the credit portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll go ahead. This quarter, as you know, the specific provision was 434 million. If you exclude the two large credits that we think have characteristics that are fairly unique, the provision was 187, which is up from the last two quarters. Not up dramatically, but it is up. We think the environment is weakening both in Canada and in the U.S. And the U.S. housing market weakened noticeably through the last quarter and it isn't showing signs of bottoming. So we think there's upward pressure that we'll feel on the level of 187. And exactly how much pressure there is over the next quarter will depend on how the economy plays out, what the housing market does. And how the U.S. consumer holds up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I know you still continue to maintain &#x2013; expected losses in terms of the segments and then everything else is booked into the corporate. But with the elevation of loan losses and impairments, if we were to apply some of these increases toward the segments, would a majority of it still be coming from the wholesale operations out of BMO Capital Markets or would some of this start to filter through Harris Bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we thought this would be a bit of a challenging issue for people this quarter, so on Slide 5 of my presentation we provided some additional segmented disclosure. And what you can see there is the trend in provisions for really each of the lines of business. And you can see that there has been some pressure in the U.S. consumer portfolio and the U.S. commercial portfolio, which is part of P&amp;C U.S. The pressure that you're seeing there is very connected to what's going on in the U.S. housing sector. The commercial side is driven principally by home equity loans, the consumer side is driven largely by developers. And then down below you can see the BMO Capital Markets provision of 310 in the quarter. In that, we've got the 247 for the two large credits, 27 for one company in the oil and gas sector. And if you include those, I think you're down to something like 35 million. And that would include some pressure from developers and also just general portfolio activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks for the slide, I'll re-queue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Brad Smith from Blackmont Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I just had a quick question with respect to the gross loans and acceptances details on page 31. I'm just noting there that the bulk of the increase of roughly 3 billion sequentially during the quarter relates to financial institutions, which are now just over $20 billion of gross loan exposure. I was just wondering if I might get some sense for what would &#x2013; what would have caused that rather substantial increase during the particular third quarter, and maybe some just general comments about what sort of exposures are actually included in that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's Tom Flynn. Virtually all of the increase in the quarter relates to the funding that I referred to earlier for Links and Parkland. So the funding activity that we have for the two SIVs shows up in the financial institutions line. More generally, the balance is very highly diversified across really all segments of the U.S. and Canadian, and even European financial institution space. We don't have many large exposures and we've got exposure that's diversified across all of the sub-sectors within financial institutions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and then I guess just following on that, if I look at the provisioning in the quarter, on page 30 your year-to-date provisioning's 194 for that line item in your gross loan portfolio I take it &#x2013; and that's up about 155 million. So I take it that's what the provision for that space was during the third quarter. Is there something there that you're &#x2013; that's causing you to want to ramp up your allowance relative to that financial institutions line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a bit of a funny situation. The one loan that was funded out of our conduit that funds the distressed mortgages is classified in our accounts in the financial institution category. So when we showed the slide on impaired formations and the provision, you could see that a large part of the provision was coming from the financial institution category. There's a footnote that notes that the loan relates to the distressed mortgages. So really, almost all of the provision that you see in that category on Slide 30 of the supp pack relates to the one of the two larger loans that I've talked about in detail. It's not broadly related to issues in the financial institution portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just a final question. Switching gears to the domestic private client segment, where I'm seeing some pretty strong revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year. But I'm not seeing any assets under admin or asset under management growth to match that. What is it that's driving that rather strong revenue growth? It's north of six, almost 7% I think, sequentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well the business in the last six or seven years has changed quite a bit. And today we are considerably less dependent on the transaction side of the business. I mean, in the private client group as a whole, only about 25% of the revenues is related to the day-to-day activities in the market, and what's happened is that in this period of time the markets have held up, and we've been able to grow our revenues. I mean, the market has slowed down considerably, but as long as the levels hold up, our revenues are going to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean, I would presume that the bulk of the revenues in that segment are either transaction-related commissions or asset-based fees, and if the AUA isn't going up and the AUM isn't going up, I'm just trying to figure out how the revenue is going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the transaction revenues had slowed down, but the assets have held up, but it's, a lot of it has to do with the mix, the different businesses. Some of the assets, or the areas of the assets haven't grown, has been &#x2013; hasn't grown has been in the transaction side. And the other thing that's happened too on year-over-year is that the spread revenue has increased quite a bit. Our clients &#x2013; talking about clients, they have got the cash, and that's increased the spread revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I had a few questions. First of all, I don't mean to be cheeky, but how's an oil and gas company get into trouble in the current environment, and how is it that BMO found itself funding to them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tom Flynn. The provision that we took was for a company that was U.S. based that had some issues with its natural gas trading operation, and had a fairly high profile bankruptcy in the last quarter. So it is counterintuitive given the price of commodities, but this company had an issue with his trading activities and we took that provision against an exposure of about 65 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, in the stress testing that you do, could you give me some idea of the impact that you get by taking U.S. employment down by 1.5%, and house prices down a further 5% to 10% on average on the credit quality?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Russ, Michael. Yeah, there's no different &#x2013; no new instruments in our Level Three, and it does include the Apex notes, which have moved from trading to available for sale. The Montreal Accord asset-backed commercial paper and CDO portfolios, and there has been an increase in the amounts, but the increase is fully hedged.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the types of instruments, the three I mentioned, Apex, the Montreal Accord, and CDO portfolios. The nature of the type of assets that are in the Level Three that has not changed, but there has been an increase in the CDO portfolio, and just to let you know, that increase is totally hedged.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question, first, just more of a clarification on Andre's question about Apex and Sitka, the $600 million total return swap, this counterparty, why would this counterparty have their exposure through a total return swap, and not just put up the cash the way BMO has or put up a facility the way BMO has?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going into &#x2013; it's Tom Milroy. Mario, going into the restructuring they held it already in the total return swap, so coming out of it, they held it in the same form.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so BMO has put up the money, and this company has their exposure in the form of a total return swaps. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, why is it that BMO would have a mark-to-market loss of 55 million? Presumably, on the other side, that other counterparty would have a gain of 55 million. I guess, I'm getting at this, if BMO's put up $600 million, then renting a total return swap, the loss on the total return swap should have been offset by the gain on the asset that BMO put up.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, what I'm saying is that BMO is not putting up the $600 million really to risk, then why does BMO have a loss at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Russ. The terms of the underlying and the terms of the total return swap aren't exactly the same, and that gives rise to the &#x2013; this one-time, the one-time loss, but I will add just for some additional information that there will be a $10 million swing in the value for each 50 basis points shift in spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you clarify that? 50 basis points shift in what spreads or returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in the valuation of the underlying and the swap. If there's a 50 basis point movement then there'll be a $10 million gain or loss to give you some idea of the sensitivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll get off this quickly. It just seems to me that BMO now seems like they're on the hook for the 600 million. Is that a fair statement? Like BMO has got 850...</p>

          <p>million and another 600 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The counterparty is on the hook for the 600 million and any diminution in value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The actual question I wanted to ask really related to the SIVs. Last quarter you said the liquidity provided was about $427 million, it's now up to about $4 billion. That's the liquidity you've provided. And I think that's correct, isn't it? You added about $4 billion of liquidity in one quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little less, but that's not far-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It was 427, so something under 4 billion, but a lot essentially in this quarter. You're adding another billion next quarter is what you're suggesting, getting you to 5 billion. The assets in the facility, the liquidity &#x2013; sorry, the assets right now in the SIVs are about, what it is, it's about, $9.8 billion roughly, down only about 1.4 billion from last quarter. I think what I'm getting at is the assets are &#x2013; in the SIVs are declining, slowly; only 1.4 billion this quarter, but the liquidity is ramping up really quickly. Ultimately, what I'm getting at is, at some point BMO is going to be providing over 50% of the funding for that SIV, and it could happen as early as next quarter. Does that have any accounting implications for BMO? BMO is in fact providing more than 50% of the funding for the SIV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tom Flynn. No, it doesn't have accounting implications, and that's because there is significant capital that is subordinate to us, and bears the risk of the expected loss in the structure. The funding is up in the quarter, and it's up by more than the change in the total level of assets might suggest, because the quarter was relatively heavy from an asset maturity perspective, and we did sell some assets in the SIVs during the quarter but they didn't meet the maturing notes, and so pursuant to the terms of our facility, we provided the funding.</p>
          <p>The total amount that we expect to fund hasn't increased from the total amount that we talked about at the time the facility was first put in place, and the amount of funding is expected to ramp up, and it will peak roughly a year from now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If &#x2013; sure and I'll stop very soon just because this is, this surprised me at how much funding was provided in one quarter. The capital notes, what's left in the capital notes, market value not the book value? I think you told us it was something like 147 million? It was a small number, is what I recall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a small number. Let me just look for it here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what I'm getting at is, if the capital notes are &#x2013; if that's a really small number, because it sounds like it because essentially the stuff is going away, how is it that there is a sort of an equity owner right? Why hasn't BMO essentially become the owner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't become the owner because people, in the case of Links, own subordinate capital notes that have a book value that's approximately 1.3 billion, and the market value of those securities moves around with the market value of the underlying assets, but it doesn't change the reality that they owned the assets, and those assets are at risk first before our senior funding facility, given the structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't envision any way that this could possibly come on BMO's books? Obviously, you know where I'm going with this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We don't expect so. The way we look at this really is we've got a portfolio that is 75% plus rated AA. We think the quality will prove up overtime, and against a portfolio of that quality, we've got a book value of subordinate capital of 1.3 billion. And so, losses on the underlying assets would have to be in a multiples of loses experienced on assets of that quality in order for the subordinate capital to be consumed. So with that, we think we should be okay from a risk perspective. And we're not expecting a change in the accounting.</p>

          <p>Tom, the gross loans on the balance sheet. That's page 31 on your supp pack, you provided a breakdown by category. And this financial institutions line has always intrigued me, because it's your single biggest exposure. And it's grown more markedly than anything else. So, I just want to find out a bit more about it. So, of that 4.5 billion, we know that 3 billion is Links. We know that 0.5 billion was a financial institution that really was residential, but was U.S. real estate in some manner. So, I'm down to 17 billion or something like that. What can you tell me about that $17 billion portfolio? What can you tell us about it to make us feel that it's not more sort of structures or more real estate related stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess the first thing I'd say is that, if you look at the losses that have been produced in that portfolio overtime, they have been modest. I talked about the diversified nature of the portfolio earlier. I don't have a detailed segmentation by asset type, but the portfolio is very highly diversified across the different sub sectors that make up the financial services industry. And the ratings of the companies that are in that category are strong.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any more, sort of, structured-like loans? So, loans to structures like SIVs or conduits that show up in this financial institutions line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Loans to SIVs or conduits, the answer I am almost certain would be, no. We aren't out there lending to other people's SIVs or conduits.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the doubling in this loan book over two years? What &#x2013; like, are you lending to small regional banks in the United States over $100,000 each?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have checked on that number, and the lending to small U.S. regional banks is de minimis. It would be under a couple $100 million, so we're not in that business.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Similar answer. So it's &#x2013; maybe we can take it off-line and try to give you more detail, but it really is highly diversified, coverage to different sectors that are part of financial services and overtime has produced modest levels of both impaired loans and loss.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Tom, you touched on this a little on your prepared remarks, but can you provide any more detail on the differences between the performing asset that was taken from Fairway and the two on which the provisions have been taken? And if you expect to be repaid, why was it taken out of Fairway in the first place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I have a whole lot to add. You've seen that the loan has been reduced from approximately 225 million down to about 160. So, the loan is a mode of paying out. The loan funds development projects, they're spread across much of the U.S. portion of the portfolio is retail related, and we have been managing this account in what we call our special asset group, which is our workout group, and clearly there was a level of risk attached to the loan, given that we took it out of the conduit. But given what's developed over the last quarter, although, as always there is risk, we're expecting that it will pay out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might add one point to that, and this does differentiate this loan from the one of the two loans that we took a provision on that was developer related. The developers that are being funded through that third loan largely make up the 100 largest developers in the U.S., and so, we're dealing with companies that are generally good at what they do, well established, and have more resources to complete projects in a tougher environment than some of the people that we were dealing with in that other loan had.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. In the capital market segment it looks like your average loans and acceptances are down about 3% quarter-over-quarter. Can you talk about the 20% reduction in non-core relationships in that segment? How much of that this is related to? And is that 20% number a static one? Or do you see this increasing going forward? Basically, I'm trying to get a view on what's the appetite of the bank in the mid-market commercial corporate space in the U.S. right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sumit, let me &#x2013; it's Tom Milroy and I'll just respond to both of those. The first one, the reduction in the average loans and acceptances really had more to do with a reduction in our repo book because the steps that we've taken to reduce the U.S. loan portfolio haven't actually come through at this stage. We've identified the loans. We've put them into a non-relationship portfolio and we're working them down. We have &#x2013; the change in our appetite really relates to what type of business we want to do, and we looked at this, at our entire portfolio, and this subset really comprises those loans where we felt we didn't have the opportunity to make decent return by selling additional products, and it was more on that basis. So, I would say that we continue to have an appetite to be a provider of lending capital into the U.S. middle market space, but where we can sell more products and ensure that we get a reasonable return from the relationship.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. If we move onto something else here, 4 billion in liquidity provided to the SIVs, your commentary suggests, were up to five by the end of Q4. If I just look at this funding I see that it's expected to exceed 70%. That would put your total just over 6 billion. Given how difficult it seems for this entity to fund itself right now, and it's certainly not the only one, the six billion number doesn't sound that far away. What was the, can you just remind me, what was the original rationale behind the commentary of the not to exceed 70%? And is that still valid in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Tom Flynn. First of all, the number is still valid. The funding picked up fairly dramatically in the current quarter. The increase over the next year will be more gradual, and will peak in around a year, and the 70% number reflects the net impact of the need to fund the maturing debt in the SIV, offset by asset maturities that occur with the SIVs asset portfolio and ongoing assets sales. So, we see that situation really as playing out as we expected. We were not expecting the market to come back for SIV pay per directly, and we're funding it in line with our initial expectations, and continuing with asset sales, although at a slower pace given the liquidity in the market and the resulting lower prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I'll wrap up here, Tom. My comments here will be, in Q2 it seemed like when the world felt a lot better about the problems we have in April and May you were able to sell a decent amount. We didn't have to see that much on the liquidity side. This quarter credit markets get a little bit tighter and the funding picks up. My concern would be if this kind of environment continues, you may have to exceed that 70%, and again the 5 billion at the end of Q4 doesn't seem that far away. I don't know if you want to comment on that, but I'll certainly leave it there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. This is Bill Downe. We're at the last question that was in the queue. I might have one last reflection on the topic, and that is as Tom said, the variables are maturing assets, and the sale of assets. When we looked at the paper maturity when we put the line in place, we didn't anticipate any difference. There's no expectation of rollovers as paper matures the line is necessary to balance that, and when we put the line in place, it was in the area as I recall of around $11 billion. So the progress that we've made continues to be, I would say, a steady pace, and we did reflect, as I recall, that we would slow down the pace in periods when spreads were a little bit wider and the asset realizations were below what we thought was a fair market value. Those will rise and fall as we go through the quarters based on what's going on in the external market. It doesn't change our view as to what the draws will be over the next 12 months. The draws will be determined by, as I said, the variables of maturities asset sales and the run-off of the book.</p>
          <p>I want to finish up with a quick comment with respect to the economy, because I know in the questions I have a sense that there was concern about pessimism, and would just like to be real clear about this. We're very vigilant with respect to the economy. I wouldn't put it in the category of pessimism. I think I referenced the kinds of pressures that we're experiencing. One of the observations about the U.S. housing market is that it is good news. The housing starts are at the low level where they are. And at some point people are going to come out of rental housing and move back into purchased housing. And clearly, the one big blockage in the market is the GSCs that are pending restructuring. And when they're restructured, I think the U.S. housing market will become a much more orderly place. So I'll just finish up with that, because I don't want to leave the impression that we think that we're on the edge of a precipice. But we are vigilant, and we do recognize that further deterioration, obviously, will translate into loan books. And with that, I just want to thank you. I know that this afternoon has been very busy, because you've had two calls. And I'll turn it back to Viki.</p>
