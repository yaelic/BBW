          <p>Good day and welcome to the Q1, 2012, Results Presentation Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host today, Mr. Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And welcome to this Novo-Nordisk's conference call regarding our performance of the first three months of 2012, and an updated outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>I am Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo-Nordisk. With me, I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release and the slides for this call are available on our web page novonordisk.com. The conference call is scheduled to last approximately 1 hour. Usually, we will start with an outline of the presentations on slide number 2. Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 3. As always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Please note that the conference is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on Nova-Nordisk website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 4. We're satisfied with the performance in the first three months of 2012. Sales increased 10% in local currencies. The key drivers have been modern insulins and Victoza. The solid sales performance was realized in a challenging economic environment, with healthcare reform impacting sales growth negatively with 1.5 percentage points in these first three months.</p>
          <p>Today, we are happy to announce the intended global brand names for our new long-acting insulin, Degludec and DegludecPlus, which are currently under regulatory review, by the regulatory authorities in major markets such as U.S., Europe and Japan. Degludec is intended to be marketed as Tresiba and DegludecPlus is intended to be marketed as Ryzodeg. The regulatory reviews of Tresiba and Ryzodeg continue to progress in the major markets. Novo-Nordisk has completed an initial Phase 1 trial for a range of novel insulin aspart formulations with faster onset of action. The data on the trials are encouraging, and additional confirmatory Phase 1 trials will proceed during 2012. Mads will elaborate on this during his R&amp;D update. Further, Novo-Nordisk is now initiating a Phase 3a program for N8-GP, a long-acting recombinant factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia A.</p>
          <p>Turning to financials, reported operating profit grew 18% and diluted earnings per share also 18%. For 2012, we now expect sales growth of 8% to 11% in local currencies, and operating profit of at least 10% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 5. The modern insulins continue to exhibit double-digit growth rate, and Victoza continues a steady growth performance. In the first three months of 2012, the diabetes care franchise grew 15%, while the biopharmaceutical franchise declined 4%, both measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Diabetes care now represents 78% of overall sales. Modern insulins were the prime growth drivers accounting for 61% of growth followed by Victoza, accounting for 53% of growth.</p>
          <p>Sales of NovoSeven declined 8% in local currencies. The two primary regions for NovoSeven, Europe and North America, the sales development primarily reflects a low level of surgeries involving NovoSeven treatment, strict repository controls at hospitals and a low level of acquired hemophilia cases, and also an increasing number of inhibitor patients participating in clinical trials. Sales of Norditropin increased 4% measured in local currencies. The sales growth was driven by international operations in North America, and partly offset by decline in Japan and Korea.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. For 2011, the insulin sales growth rates were impacted by healthcare reforms across most major markets, including U.S., Europe, and China, as well as competitive pressures in North America, Europe, and Japan. Due to annualisation of our U.S. healthcare reform, and the strengthened competitive situation in the U.S. in the first three months of 2012, we are encouraged to see that our insulin sales growth rate had rebounded, as illustrated on this slide.</p>
          <p>With the stable underlying volume growth in the diabetes market driven by increasing diabetes population, continued to conversion to modern insulins and devices, and introduction of new insulins, we believe that our insulin sales growth rate in the long-term will be able to be maintained at double-digit levels.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. The positive market dynamics in the U.S. are illustrated on this slide, where we are seeing an encouraging development in the prescriptions across the entire portfolio of Novo-Nordisk modern insulins. We illustrate here the development we saw in 2011 and during the first quarter of 2012 for our three modern insulins: NovoLog, NovoLog Mix and Levemir. The developments are primarily driven by strong promotional activities and recent contract dynamics.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. In the first three months of 2012, North America accounted for 64% of growth followed by international operations accounting for 34% of growth, both measured in local currencies. Sales growth in North America was 17% in local currencies reflecting continued solid market penetration of the modern insulins and a continued steady performance of Victoza.</p>
          <p>Sales growth for the first three months in Europe was flat, measured in local currencies and in reported currencies. Sales development reflects solid performance of Victoza, progress for the portfolio of modern insulins and the sales growth was also negatively impacted by declining sales of human Insulin and NovoSeven and generic competition for NovoLog and healthcare reforms.</p>
          <p>Sales with international operations grew 24% in local currencies, driven by continued penetration of modern insulins, solid human insulin sales and continued solid Victoza performance. Sales in China increased 9% in local currencies. The main contributor to growth was sales of modern insulins especially NovoMix. The growth is driven by modern insulins portfolio, partly offset by a loss of market share in modern insulins losses of EDL billings in three provinces and slowing of the retail growth rates in China.</p>
          <p>Sales in Japan, Korea declined 7% in local currencies in the first three months of 2012. The sales development reflects wholesaler de-stocking prior to the mandatory price reductions taking effect April 1, 2012. Further, the first three months of last year 2011 were positively impacted by supply chain stocking following the earthquake in March 2011.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 9 for an update on the market situation. The global diabetes care line continues to grow by more than 8% in value with injectables growing close to 14% annually. As you can see on the right hand side of the slide, Novo-Nordisk continues to expand our leadership position within diabetes care and now holds 25% value share of the global diabetes care market.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on Victoza. Sales of Victoza reached DKK2 billion in the first three months of 2012. The performance reflects steady penetration across key markets, including United States, UK, Germany, France, Japan and certain countries in international operations. The development in Victoza's quarterly sales when comparing Q1 2012 with previous quarter Q4 2011 primarily stems from two elements: rebate reversals in the U.S. and Europe in the fourth quarter which amounted to approximately DKK200 million; and normal seasonality where we typically see Q1 diabetes sales being slightly lower than previous quarters. When adjusting for these effects, Victoza continues to exhibit a steady growth rate reflecting the steady performance across key markets and the continued expansion of the GLP-1 class.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for more specifics. In the U.S., Victoza sales continues to be encouraging. We hold a market share of close to 56% on the total GLP-1 prescriptions in the U.S. and we are currently capturing 53% of new GLP-1 patients. Since the launch of Victoza in February 2010 the GLP-1 class measured by prescriptions has grown by around 70% and now constitutes 5.6% of the U.S. diabetes care market measured in value.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. In Europe we continue to see strong uptake for Victoza. Several key markets of the GLP-1 class has more doubled since the launch of Victoza. Victoza is the leading GLP-1 product in many key markets including Germany, U.K., France and Italy.</p>
          <p>With this, I'd like to handover to Mads.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to the next slide. Let me start with an update on Tresiba and Ryzodeg that have been submitted for regulatory review within the last six months in a large number of territories as listed on this slide. In parallel with the ongoing dialogue with the many regulatory agencies which is continuing in line with expectations, we continue to submit new drug applications for both products in a number of markets through 2012.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to provide quarterly updates on the regulatory process towards <mark type="ph" /> prior (10:31) market approval of Tresiba and Ryzodeg, a process which currently does not include a U.S. <mark type="ph" /> ad (10:37) company, but does involve a multitude of agency inspections all over the world. While we are on Tresiba, it is now the second time that the Lancet publishes trials from our clinical programs; more about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Next, we are now with encouraging results, time wise the first phase 1 investigations on NN1218, a novel fast-acting insulin formulation of insulin aspart. Further confirmatory phase 1 testing will be conducted during this year with a potential for selection of a candidate for phase 3 development in 2013.</p>
          <p>A phase 1 trial investigating Victoza as adjunct therapy to insulin in type 1 diabetes has now also been initiated based on animal and human data suggesting that GLP-1 suppresses glucagon secretion while enhancing residual &#x3B2;-cell secretion in type 1 diabetes. Apart from an insulin sparing effect, the potential for more time spent in the so-called target zone is one of the endpoints we are going to study in type 1 diabetes.</p>
          <p>The Victoza labels in the U.S. and EU have been updated to include data from the sitagliptin comparison trial published last year in the Lancet and showing superior blood glucose control for Victoza. The U.S. label update also includes approval of combination therapy with basal insulin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Thus in the U.S., basal insulin can now be added to Victoza therapy or vice versa.</p>
          <p>Finally, the CV outcome trial comparing Victoza to standard of care in 9,000 patients with type 2 diabetes has completed recruitment slightly ahead of schedule, and we are looking forward to the outcome of this event-driven trial that is expected to report in 2016, as part of the post marketing requirements agreed upon with FDA and EMA.</p>
          <p>Moving on to biopharmaceuticals, the hemophilia B compound N9-GP has competed pivotal trial recruitment and further to this we have initiated the Phase 3a program for our long-acting glyco-PEGylated recombinant factor VIII compound, N8-GP. The first Phase 3a study will involve 132 hemophilia A patients in a two arm non randomized interventional study, investigating N8-GP both in prophylaxis and in on-demand treatment. Later this year, we will initiate the second Phase 3a trial, which will be a smaller study investigating N8-GP during surgical procedures.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in the inflamation area Novo-Nordisk has completed a Phase 2a trial of anti-NKG2D in rheumatoid arthritis. The trial showed that the compound was safe, but it did not demonstrate any effect on the primary endpoint DAS28-CRP, which is a measure of disease activity. As a consequence of this Novo-Nordisk will not pursue further development of the compound within rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. As mentioned I am happy and proud to share with you today that two of the Phase 3a studies on Tresiba have just been published in The Lancet, where the papers were featured back-to-back together with an editorial in last Saturday's printed edition. This marks the first full-length publication of primary data from the Phase 3a program. The two trials process included a total of 1635 participants, and investigated basal-bolus treatment for one year with insulin degludec compared to insulin glargine as the basal component in either type 1 or type 2 diabetes using insulin aspart as prandial insulin in all groups. These were treat to target studies implying that insulin doses were titrated systematically to allow patients to achieve the same level of glucose control in both arms.</p>
          <p>This approach is requested by the FDA, and allows for detailed assessment of risk and benefits including hypoglycemia on the same HbA1c background. Despite the important contributions of mealtime insulin toward overall hypoglycemia, both this and nocturnal hypoglycemia was significantly reduced in the Tresiba group in type 2 diabetes, and in type 1 diabetes, nocturnal hypoglycemia was reduced significantly.</p>
          <p>The editorial accompanying the papers highlighted that the biggest barrier for diabetics to achieve the desired glucose target was hypoglycemia and the fear thereof. The editorial further describes how the ultra-long flat action profile of Tresiba regularizes the absorption of insulin monomers on all days leading to a higher likelihood of a consistently good match between glucose and insulin levels and potentially higher treatment adherence.</p>
          <p>Finally, Tresiba is described as evolution in the management of diabetes; similar, I would argue to the therapeutic evolution represented by the current basal insulin analogs, when they improved upon existing in-patient insulin therapy a decade ago. Later this year, remaining Phase 3a Tresiba trials will be presented at major diabetes conferences globally all confirming the improved hypoglycemia profile, dosing flexibility and other benefits of Tresiba.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. The ADA and EASD joint Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines have been updated and published online last week. The general HbA1c target remains 7%, but the guidelines call for individualized  targets with younger motivated patients in the lowest end and elderly patients with complications and short life expectancy in the higher end of the HbA1c target range.</p>
          <p>A decisive factor in this regard relates to the risks associated with therapy-related hypoglycemia for which recent drugs with no or low hypoglycemia risks should be strongly considered for use. With metformin maintained as the first line agent there are number of proposed second line drugs to be added to metformin upon HbA1c target failure including GLP-1 and basal insulin. Specifically in patients with very high glucose levels, dual therapy with metformin and basal insulin should be strongly considered and likewise for GLP-1 and second line therapy in patients where weight loss is a big need.</p>
          <p>Over time as the disease progresses basal insulin therapy will typically be needed according to the guidelines with intensification either through supplementation with prandial insulin or via a shift to <mark type="ph" /> tri-steady (16:58) biphasic insulin therapy.</p>
          <p>Since type 2 diabetes treatment is multi-faceted and should target the relevant elements of the metabolic syndrome in a patient, polypharmacy will often be needed and in order to reduce treatment complexity, it is the Novo-Nordisk strategy to reduce the need for multiple daily drug administrations by working A) with therapeutic doctors offering high efficacy standalone agents and B) the use of these in fixed combinations such as Ryzodeg and <mark type="ph" /> mitagliron (17:27)</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. Public Citizen, a U.S. NGO petitioned the FDA to withdraw Victoza from the US market on April 19 due to their concerns related to the safety profile of Victoza, which were primarily based on the pre-approval data including in the NDA value as well as observations from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System known as the AERS database. All the preapproval findings that were highlighted in the petition were obviously known to the FDA when approving Victoza in 2010. Importantly and since then two pretty preclinical studies have been completed as part of the FDA post-marketing requirements.</p>
          <p>First a rigorously conducted diabetic rat study revealed no micro or macroscopic signs of pancreatitis and further to this a mouse knockout study revealed no C-cell cancer observations adding further support to our original hypothesis that development of C-cell cancer in rodents involves a mechanism to which they, but not humans and monkeys, are sensitive.</p>
          <p>Moving now from animals to the large pool of completed human studies, there's been no indication of a causative role between Victoza therapy and pancreatitis or C-cell proliferation. Specifically the ongoing <mark type="ph" /> LEAD carduvesa (18:44) outcome trial described above also assesses these and other parameters as trial endpoints and as of today, we've heard nothing untoward from the Data Monitoring Committee in regards to significant adverse findings in the LEAD trial.</p>
          <p>Today almost 1 million years of human type 2 diabetes exposure to Victoza is included in our pharmaco-vigilance system, where adverse events are reported by treatment physicians and monitored as part of our rigorous safety surveillance program. All relevant data are routinely shared with the FDA, EMA and other regulators and today there have been no deviations from the expected background incidence rates as regards EG, pancreatitis and cancer. Indeed as described in the preceeding sections, the FDA and EMA have just updated the label for Victoza and as part of that process the benefit risk need for warnings et cetera have been assessed by the agencies for the indication areas included in the recently updated product label.</p>
          <p>Finally, the AERS database operated by the FDA, is a signal detection system that as described by the agency is not to just report event calculations. However, even with an EG at tenfold under reporting of pancreatitis, Victoza is still within the one to four cases of pancreatitis per 1,000 patient years that would be expected in a type 2 diabetes population based on published instance rates.</p>
          <p>So, in conclusion, no post approval safety data have emerged that would suggest any change in the favorable benefit risk profile for the indicated use of Victoza in type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>With that over to Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to the next slide. In the first three months of 2012, sales increased by 13% measured in Danish kroner to DDK17.6 billion and by 10% in local currencies compared to first three months of 2011. The underlying production economy improved by 70 basis points in the first three months of 2012. The improvement is mainly due to a positive price impact from North America, Victoza and the conversion to modern insulins from human insulins.</p>
          <p>Due a neutral currency impact the reported gross margin also improved by 70 basis points to 80.8% in the first three months of 2012. Total non-production related costs increased by 9% in local currency and by 11% in Danish kroner to DDK3.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Sales and distribution costs increased by 14% primarily reflecting increased sales promotion activities in the U.S. and the sales force expansion in China mid-2011.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D cost increased by 9% to DKK2.5 billion mainly driven by Phase 3 trials for IDegLira, the fixed combination of Tresiba and Victoza, ongoing Phase 3b trials for Tresiba and Ryzodeg well as the two ongoing Phase 3 trials for Liraglutide in obesity. On the biopharm side, R&amp;D costs are impacted by the Phase 3 trials for Vatreptacog alfa and N9-GP.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by 18% in the first three months to DKK6.4 billion; in local currency the growth was 13%. Net financial showed a net expense of DKK328 million in the first three months of 2012, compared to a net expense of DKK128 million in 2011. For the first three months of 2012, the foreign exchange result was an expense of DKK309 million compared to an expense of DKK104 million in the first three months of 2011. This reflect losses on foreign exchange hedging contracts, primarily related to the U.S. dollar due to the appreciation versus Danish kroner in 2012 compared to the exchange rate &#x2013; the exchange rate level prevailing towards the end of 2010 and in the early part of 2011. The effective tax rate for the first three months was 23%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. The two graphs illustrate the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. The tables on the right show the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in each of our key invoicing currencies and the current extent of hedging for the same currencies.</p>
          <p>During first three months of 2012, the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar versus the Danish kroner was approximately 4% above that experienced in the first three months of 2011. At present, the value of the U.S. dollar is approximately 5% above the average level for 2011.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. Novo-Nordisk now expects sales growth in 2012 of 8% to 11% measured in local currencies. This is based on the expectations of continued market penetration of for Novo-Nordisk key products, as well as the expectations of continued intense competition, generic competition to all anti-diabetic products and a continued impact from healthcare reforms, primarily in U.S., Europe and China. Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is expected to be around 4 percentage points higher than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2012, growth in operating profit is now expected to be at least 10% measured in local currencies. The outlook for growth in operating profit reflects significant costs related to the expected launch of the ultra long-acting Tresiba, including an expansion of the sales force in the U.S. in the middle of 2012. Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported operating profit is expected to be 6.5 percentage points higher than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2012 Novo-Nordisk now expects a net financial expense of around DKK800 million, reflecting a net loss on the foreign exchange hedging contracts following the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, versus kroner compared to the exchange rate prevailing in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be around 23%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is expected to be around DKK3.5 billion in 2012, primarily related to investments in filling capacity and a pre-fill device production facility in Denmark. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are around DKK2.9 billion and free cash flow is expected to be around DKK18 billion.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly change business conditions for Novo-Nordisk during the remaining part of 2012, and that currency exchange rates especially for the U.S. dollar will remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner during the remaining part of 2012.</p>
          <p>This concludes the financial update, now back to you, Lars.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper and Mads. We are moving to the Q&amp;A part. Operator, we are ready to take the first question, please.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And, we'll take our first question from Michael Novod from Nordea. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Michael Novod from Nordea Markets. I have two questions. First of all, if you could elaborate a bit on Victoza and your confidence in quarterly growth. You said before that you expect DKK200, DKK250 million per quarter. That would be a reasonable level; is that something you still have confidence in, i.e. that you are hitting around DKK9.25 billion to DKK9.5 billion for 2012? And also perhaps including in that the status on Victoza in China. And then secondly, a FDA panel meeting, you will often get notifications 55 days before what to include in briefing materials. Do you still expect that there will be no panel meeting on Degludec or with the new names in mind or what should we put into our forecasts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Michael this is Lars Rebien here. I will start out with the Victoza comments. And then we will ask Mads Krogsgaard to elaborate on the typical guidelines for AdComs and the implications of that.</p>
          <p>If you look at, when you annualize the historical development of Victoza sales, we've had a quarterly growth of around DKK200 million, and we mentioned that we believe we are on a steady track going forward. So, it's anybody's case of course with all the uncertainties going forward, but I would sense &#x2013; I think it's a reasonable projection to calculate somewhere between &#x2013; somewheres around DKK200 million per quarter growth going forward; so that's a reasonable assumption.</p>
          <p>In terms of China, we've had strong growth, but of course coming from a very, very low base. The product is not reimbursed. So it is typically for private paying patients or patients with private insurance and so far the numbers are in the just double-digit million kroner. So, it's going to take it some time before we can make it noticeably in our numbers, but it's also a very good sign, and it has some indications for other emerging markets that there is a large group of potentially wealthy individuals that they would be able to acquire to this product.</p>
          <p>Mads, AdCom, it is correct though isn't it. 55 days &#x2013; working days prior to the PDUFA date is the typical timeline you have to prepare for an AdCom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, yes, so what you can see Michael is that the PDUFA action date as issued to us has been July 29. And then according to the FDA, you can see working procedure; that means that you typically start discussing the label, i.e. the packaging six weeks in advance of that and if you then work your way backwards, it is true that if they would need 55 working days prior to that to issue a request for pre-meeting packages, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>It's getting very close indeed. So, of course that is decreasing likelihood that we will see an outcome, when that is said obviously you will notice this always planning for whatever can happen in any scenario and that means that we are fully on top of having prepared ourselves for an AdCom, as it relates to the multitude of risks and benefits that can be discussed at such a panel.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Brian Bourdot calling from Barclays in London. Thank you very much for your presentations. One question on the GLP-1 market in the U.S. please. And one question on insulin competition more broadly, especially on GLP-1s, it looks like Amylin's share in the U.S. has stopped declining since the Bydureon launch, despite inferior efficacy, a thicker needle and a cumbersome injection process. Could you tell us whether your plans to expand your US workforce by 15% are motivated by any sort of disappointment at the progress for Victoza in the U.S. or is it more to do with your keenness to ensure a successful degludec launch or is it both?</p>
          <p>And the second question, I guess on insulin competition, your competitor Eli Lilly made some aggressive comments regarding its ambitions in the insulin space the other day. In particular they claimed to have made significant progress in emerging markets, and also claimed biosimilar glargine could take one third of the long acting segment. Could you please offer your perspective on the competitive situation, and how you expect the basal segment to develop as new products including your own are introduced. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. This is Lars Rebien here. I'll attempt to give a shot at both questions. With regards to the GLP-1 market in the U.S., we have seen that Bydureon has gotten off to a reasonable start, which was what we anticipated. As I mentioned we have the better part of &#x2013; the lion's share of the market; well, 55% market share in the GLP-1 segment in the United States.</p>
          <p>And the new scripts that we are picking up every week is very consistent with historical patterns, so our expansion and intention to expand this field sales force is actually more predicated on our ambition and willingness to support our modern insulin franchise and potential launch of Degludec and DegludecPlus, or should we rather say Tresiba and Ryzodeg going forward. I know it's difficult even for us to remember, but so that's the key rationale for that. What we seeing in the U.S., is we're seeing that Bydureon primarily is expanding the market. So this is viewed as a positive for us, and giving momentum behind the whole GLP-1 segment versus the DPP-IV segment.</p>
          <p>With regards to insulin, yes Lilly has made a number of <mark type="ph" /> those (32:29) statements and what we do see is Lilly is losing ground in the United States due to contracting dynamics, if we can call it that. It is also true that if we take China as an emerging market, Lilly has gained market share in China because of extension of their reimbursement and adoption on the regional <mark type="ph" /> say so drop (32:46) list over their modern insulins. So, yes we are anticipating a continued strong battle with Lilly on the emerging market, in fact, as well as everywhere else.</p>
          <p>Whether or not they will be successful is of course questionable. In general we would say that generics is not the place to be in. We see now that for instance, that if you take the global insulin market 85% percent of the total value of the global insulin market is constituted by patent-protected model insulins. So there will be a transitional phase where one can buy volume, get some business in generic medicines, but we cannot arrive at profitability and growth rate that is necessary to fund innovation going forward, if you are betting on generic medicines. So that would be my comments. They are to be reckoned with and they are a long and respected competitor.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Carsten from Carnegie here. First a question to Mads on your new fast-acting insulin here; how far are you in the work? It seems &#x2013; I  actually thought that you were sort of approaching the end of Phase 1 and were more or less ready to move into Phase 2 trials with an identified new fast-acting insulin. And how long a time do you think it will take until you'll actually be ready to move into Phase 2, and how confident are you that you'll actually be able to innovate this segment? And then a just a follow-up to last &#x2013; did I understand you correct that Lilly also in China had bought volume or was it primarily because of more EDL listings, or how should I understand the comments made about China? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Mads, first comment to you around near the faster-acting formulation of aspart, where we are and what the timelines should be expected on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, Carsten you can &#x2013; in some regards, you can compare to what we've done in the oral insulin and GLP-1 space, where you essentially test out a number of treatment in an almost competitorial fashion, a number of different formulation candidates in humans being the best species to actually verify that you get the faster onset of action. What you essentially want is an action profile that if you pass the onset of action with a similar duration so action to that observed with today's fast action modern insulins.</p>
          <p>So that has been done in this, you can say competitorial way, and what I am saying is that, at the end of the year it is our hope that we can then select a candidate, not for phase 2 development, but for phase 3 development, because the way that these formulations are engineered, it is actually possible to move into phase 3 without a phase 2 dose range findings phase, for the sheer reason that that insulin is titrated regardless of phase 2, whereas other products, you have to do dose range finding in the more classic setting of a phase 2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much Mads. And then a clarification on China. The loss to Lilly in China is primarily relating to the fact that Lilly has had expanded provincial reimbursement drop-listing whereas as previously they had had 14; they have gone to 31 provinces where they are on the provincial reimbursement drop list and that leads to volume loss on our part. And with regards to human insulins, we have in some of the biddings which takes place since human insulin is on the essential drop list, we have lost to and it's primarily to local manufacturers volume, on human insulin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you and good afternoon. Mads, I believe the EMA is about to revise their guidelines for proving bioequivalence for insulin and for them to include analog insulins as a part of the revised guidelines. Can you share with us your perspective on what might be required and what feasibility do you see for analog insulins to have biosimilars in Europe over the course of the next two to three years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much. Mads that was very direct to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, obviously we have been involved as one of the so-to-speak seriously heard parties since the EMA sent out for a hearing round, their draft guidelines in the different therapy groups related to biosimilars, and it is true that there are many aspects to consider for the EMA before they issue their final guidelines and one of them is clearly bioequivalence, is that enough?</p>
          <p>Our view is that since insulins are known in a you can say somewhat differential manner to influence also immunogenicity and sometimes thereby the pharmacokinetics of these compounds, it is our view that there is a need to actually do not only bioequivalent studies and PKPT as such, but full immunogenicity studies and you can always discuss if they should be of 6, 12, and 24 months duration and these are the kinds of considerations that we have shared with the agency. But until we see the final product-specific guidelines in the insulin category, it is difficult to say much more.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, just two quick questions, please. Could you just give some clarity about the potential timing of a European submission for the N8-GP just given the extra requirements of pediatric exposure there?</p>
          <p>And then on Victoza and obesity, given the comments at the FDA Advisory Committee meeting about cardiovascular outcome trials or at least cardiovascular event analysis, could you just share with us your perspective of what do you think may be required for Victoza, assuming it meets efficacy guidelines and you submit it. And whether you think you would have enough events in your obesity population to perform a metro analysis and if not whether do you would need to use the diabetes population to support to that and if you think that would be acceptable, Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. So Mads, two questions for you. The first one, could you give us a little bit more clarity on the timelines you are anticipating on N8-GP given the requirements for pediatrics studies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Well, we are obviously having <mark type="ph" /> liase (39:59) a lot with the pediatric committee, the PIP committee in Europe. We are pretty much aware of the pediatric guidelines and what we're doing right now is the main study that is gating for the overall submission timing and where you may be aware that we have to show 50 exposure days in all patients. So it's a question of when does the last patient have the 50 exposure experience with the product. And our anticipation is that that should happen kind of towards the turn of the next year. So that we are recruiting this year and then treating the better part of next year. The pediatric requirement, I will not comment more specifically other than saying that we are discussing with EMA and the pediatric committee. vis-&#xE0;-vis how much to submit and when to submit it, whether you get a waiver, whether you do part of it or whether you do the full thing and we haven't disclosed exactly what is the case, but do trust us that we are in a very constructive dialogue project by project on the pediatrics in hemophilia. This is European issue as you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Mads then on the obesity and this is Liraglutide in obesity is the reason our company is starting in the future CV requirements for the new drugs in the obesity space. What are you anticipation of influence on &#x2013; if any on our proclaim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, as you are all aware those who have been following this intensely as we have. Obviously, this is supposed to give guidelines for new products that are entering phase 3, so that they can prepare themselves for what is needed, preapproval as compared to post-approval. With that being said, Liraglutide 3 milligrams is and has been for quite some time undergoing Phase 3 development. And you can say after the discussion that took place on March 29, I think a fair statement would be &#x2013; and this is actually supported by the senior staff at the agency namely Bob Semple and Mary Parks and others.</p>
          <p>I think a fair statement would be that the agency clearly sees increasing overlap, both between the obesity and type 2 diabetes populations, but also between drug development in these areas as is simplified by Liraglutide, and our view is that even though this was not unanimous, there's a general consensus also in the panel that to use some degree of enrichment in your patient population to get up there, where you can accumulate a number of MACEs whether it's custom MACE, narrow MACE or broad MACE, that is of course a discussion we'll have to do with the agency.</p>
          <p>Then we will be able to use the scale program, where the total amount of MACEs will be modest, if I can put it that way, and analyze that together with the elements of the diabetes program where adjudication has taken place in a good way. And in fact the FDA was kind enough to actually adjudicate the lead trial events that have taken place for us with FDA Adjudication Committee, because we were operating in then pre-CV guideline era, when we had the lead trial program ongoing.</p>
          <p>So we are actually pretty confident even though this of course remains to be discussed with the agency that the aggregate of all the MACEs that we have from the 20 or more trials we've done in diabetes plus the phase 2 and 3 programs that we have done in obesity should lend themselves well to a meaningful CV analysis, that can rule out the pre-approval upper 95% confidence bound of either 1.8 or 2.0. As you will recall, we did that already in the lead program with the data we had there in about 15 out of 16 analysis, we were below 1.8, but this is something we'll discuss with the agency and we'll do it sooner rather than later.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of quick questions please. First on NovoSeven, you've called out a slightly lower expectations versus previously, I wonder if you have any color on how much of the shortfall is budgetary constraints versus lower bleeds due to clinical trials ongoing? And whether those pressures are increasing or decreasing from here?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the once weekly GLP-1 Semaglutide versus Victoza weekly, just any color on finding a decision. And then the final question on CV safety, just a quick follow-on, could you just run us through the basis of discussions with FDA as to using the 1.8 diabetes dose to support safety out of the 3 mg obesity dose? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Sachin. Jesper, with all the uncertainties surrounding NovoSeven, and the experience we have, if you care to the comment on, if you can sort of dissect the impact to the different, either clinical trial participation, budgetary control or surgeries or what have you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we don't have complete clarity as to where the clinical trials are taking for competitors trying to develop a NovoSeven, but I would say the prime focus here, as we see is a reduction in the number of patients being undergoing surgical intervention; typically, orthopedics surgery for either knee or hip surgery and that has been restrained both in a U.S., and in &#x2013; particularly in a European setting. And we are seeing in certain of the solid European markets, a significant drop in usage compared to prior years. But it's not in the ordinary hemophilia treatment, as daily treatment is primarily related to the surgical intervention. Then there may also be an element of increased individual contracts &#x2013; increased use of immune tolerance treatment to try to overcome the inhibitor reaction and treat patients with Factor VIII; that could be some the cases. But the prime problem we would ascribe to a reduced surgical use of Factor VII.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Jesper. Mads Krogsgaard a couple of comments for you. First one, a comment on the once-weekly &#x2013; the timing of observation and the implications and when we would expect to have a once-weekly preparation for GLP-1 in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, Sachin, so it &#x2013; there is no change there. What we have said is that around mid year, we should be to able to update the market on which one or ones have been selected. As you know we have announced that we will come out with the Phase 2 data from Semaglutide at a media conference this year, which is indeed the case. I can confirm that. Whereas in the case of the once-weekly Lira Depot formulation, it is so that we are still awaiting analysis of the clinical data such that we can make the judgment call between the two. So no real change there, but we will get back later or around mid-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then there were the CV safety issues, whether they are &#x2013; do you have any concerns around having accumulated the largest portion of patient experience on 1.8 as opposed to 3 milligram, which is being used for dosing in obesity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes well first of all, just a piece of anecdotal, you can say data. It is well known that in the lead trial meta-analysis, that we have done many of by the way, the BMIs that we are operating with are around 29 point something on average once with <mark type="ph" /> lead players all (47:08) being slightly heavier and the others being slightly lighter in weight terms.</p>
          <p>And, in the scale program when the dose is higher ,3 mgs compare to 1.8, we are also operating with average BMIs that are, I would argue, quite a bit above 35. So the percent difference that you'll get in exposure just driven by sheer body mass in scale versus lead is actually, you can say, erasing part of the difference between the two doses.</p>
          <p>On top of that there is a significant overlap in the overall exposure, i.e., the area under the curve in patients, whether they are getting one dose or the other. But these ones were more kind of, you can say, empirical considerations. When it comes to our liaison with the agency on this one, we've discussed that a lot with FDA. Obviously the FDA did not have a cardiovascular guideline, and they are still don't by the way, for obesity products. That is something that has emerged more recently in the aftermath of all the programs that we heard about last year, and several of which were issued complete response letters.</p>
          <p>Now, based on the discussions that we have had with the agency, it is so that they consider data on cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients who are at higher risk; they may also be older et cetera. It is of relevance to what we are going to witness in the obese population. Obviously it cannot standalone, i.e. we have an Adjudication Committee that is adjudicating what is going on in the programs for obesity, and then of course it becomes an approach where we will discuss with the agency what is enough, because quite frankly we also have the Lira trial that is encompassing 9,000 patients treated for up to five years. So, we will have discussion, I believe in the second half of this year, I hope with the FDA to further corroborate the notion that we are on the right track with what we have discussed with them previously and what we are doing currently.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have are two questions, please. First on Levemir, looking back over the last few quarters, and particularly this quarter there has been an acceleration in the growth rate. So I'm wondering if you could give a bit of color behind that? Is it certain geographies &#x2013; is it volume gains or is it just pricing?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, looking at the diabetes care franchise, the operating margin for that business has been steadily expanding over the last several quarters; just wanted to see what you think in terms whether that can continue? How far can that really go? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Levemir, yes we've had a relatively strong showing of Levemir. It is largely reflecting the performance of the product in the United States, where we are conducting a lot of direct to physicians and direct to patient activities, especially highlighting our device capability with all our insulins, but also with Levemir. So, it is largely reflecting strong performance in United States. Jesper, do you want to comment on the diabetes care business, the margin development going forward, what our expectations are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it has been a gradual progression, as you rightly allude to Gavin. And of course you have to be careful with individual quarters, where first quarter last year was marked by some provision for legal cases, but I think the general trend that you pick up is a gradual improvement. And that's really coming from a margin expansion, selling more advanced products, where you see the results of selling a higher proportion of Victoza and the modern insulins, whereas the overall mix was not improving due to the lower sales of NovoSeven. Of course, the relative improvement can be directly related to the diabetes care franchise.</p>
          <p>And then of course, when you look into 2012 and moving onwards, as Lars alluded to, we're going to expand our U.S. our sales force primarily to be ready to market Tresiba. And of course that expansion in the sales force and hopefully a significant investment in launch costs in some of the trial markets, with the prime focus first on U.S. Ideally that would certainly temper the development near term with the prospects of delivering a further expansion longer-term and could take out some of the difference longer-term that we have had historically between the biopharm franchise and the diabetes care franchise.</p>

What could be the implication of the citizen petition, given the higher dose used in your morbidity and the potentially increasing safety risks. And the second question is related to your strategy in immunology; what is your strategy there following the decision to terminate NK-G2D, and what could be then the impact on the long-term R&amp;D expenditure.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, indeed, as I also talked a little bit about during my presentation the citizen petition, it's basically based on the two things. A), historical data mostly derived from the preapproval era of Liraglutide R&amp;D, and in that regard not much has changed. The only things that have changed since is that two of the three preclinical postmortem required studies have been completed. And as I mentioned one of the criticisms at the AdCom was that we've not studied the occurrence of pancreatitis in diabetic creatures, only in non-diabetic animals.</p>
          <p>What we've done now is taken sugar diabetic fatty rats, and done very rigorous slicing of the pancreas, looking at endo &#x2013; sorry both endo and exocrine parts of the pancreas, using many markers of potential pancreatitis and seen absolutely nothing. The other one was the mouse knockout study, where we confirmed our model in which it's rats and mice that are sensitive to functional GLP-1 receptors being present on the C-cells and driving a proliferation response that is not seen in monkeys and humans for the sheer reason that they've not expressed functional GLP-1 receptors in the thyroid.</p>
          <p>And do bear in mind that type 2 diabetes was approved by the agency based on 3 milligram data from obesity &#x2013; phase 2. What they looked at &#x2013; Mary Parks and her colleagues later on in the process &#x2013; was the two-year extension data from our Phase 2 program on 3 mgs in obesity and that was what actually gave us, you can argue, the type 2 diabetes approval for 1.8 milligram. So we've already used quite a bit of 3 milligram data in the approval process.</p>
          <p>And when you ask about the increased safety risk, I mean if anybody's guess what we will see in the scale program, but what I know today is that we've completed one study called the 1923 body weight maintenance study. And even though that's a smaller study it was done for one year with 3 mgs. And based on that, the benefit risk profile in terms of what we use safety wise is looking very, reminiscent of what you see at the other diabetes doses. So if we can repeat that performance then I'm clearly cautiously optimistic that we have something very exciting here, but more about that next year when we, in the first half can reveal the data from the scale program.</p>

          <p>Yes Mads and then or perhaps I should talk a little bit about immunology, the question was is that going to have any implications on our overall guidance in terms of cost and R&amp;D into our original IT budget and it is not. We of course when we budget our activities at this early stage of the pipeline and as our immunology projects are, we budget with just some attrition.</p>
          <p>So now this project is going into a phase where we will evaluate its further destiny, whether we will continue with some other indications, Crohn's disease or IPD or whatever and so it would not have any significant impact on the overall R&amp;D budget.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we basically continue to assume that until we have clinical proof of concept for any of our information compounds then you should anticipate that we spend approximately 10% of our R&amp;D resources on building up the information franchise.</p>

          <p>Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm sorry I'm losing my voice a little bit here. Just a couple of questions very quickly. On Victoza, can you just reiterate again why the numbers came in a little softer than perhaps expectations were at. I remember you called talking a little bit about some patterns of buying, but if you just go through to the items there that you would like us to take away from this meeting and hopefully highlighting specifically whether you saw competition from Bydureon although Amylin says that most of the patients are coming from new-to-script, new-to-class.</p>
          <p>The other question I have is on NovoSeven. What you're saying in terms of procedures in hospitals doesn't correlate with some of the data that we are seeing. We've in fact seen the opposite, where hospital procedures, specifically in orthopedics knee and hips, both in the U.S. and Europe have been up, and revenue for its hospitals has been higher than that. So, is it procedures that are pressurizing you or is the new patterns of the buying that hospitals are going through that are pressuring you on the NovoSeven? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mads, I'll ask you comment on the NovoSeven situation, as we see it. You may have different data than we have. In regard to Victoza, just to reiterate, the fourth quarter was impacted by approximately DKK200 million in rebates that were reversed due the fact that we on an ongoing basis are assessing what the average annual rebates are on our all our products, in particularly in the United States.</p>
          <p>And this particularly in the U.S. There is also some influence in France for instance when we reach certain volume thresholds, then we have to give some rebates and that's calculated late in the year, but it is primarily a U.S. issue. So, you have to take DKK200 million out of the top of Q4 and add it to the quarters one, two, three to normalize the sales. And then if you want to go even further back, then you should take off the peak, which comes on the pipeline filling when the launch took place in United States. So, when you smooth out these curves, then you get to a growth rate of approximately DKK200 million for quarter. And so &#x2013; and then we mentioned further to that that it is customary, at least that's we've seen it historically that Q1 numbers are relatively soft for diabetes product. If you go ahead and look at Amylin and Lilly numbers on Byetta and Bydureon, they see the same thing, Q4 bigger than Q1. So with that said, the numbers are following exactly the trend that we have anticipated, and also the trend that we had used in our guidance. And so the numbers are such are not a surprise to us.</p>
          <p>With regard to hospital procedures on Op Mads, do you have any comments on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Well, the reason why we are following it, normally we say, which is also true that it's a very erratic and unpredictable amount of surgeries that's taking place in the different areas of world, because it fluctuates because the numbers are, whether you look at them one way or the other, they are always rather small. But, what is clearly present right now is the situation, where we are looking into it, because we need to know, which surgeries we can plan for our hemophilia programs. And quite frankly Sam, it is a fact as we see it, there are less surgeries, elective surgeries ongoing, than we are used to seeing at least here in the first part of the year. That can change over time, that we cannot predict, particularly not in this area, but this is the numbers that we've seen.</p>
