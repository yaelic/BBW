          <p>Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today at DBS' Fourth Quarter Results. Today we are also reporting our Full-Year 2008 results. We -- today we have with us at our panel in Singapore, our Chairman, Koh Boon Hwee and our CFO Chng Sok Hui. We are also joined by our colleagues in Hong Kong, Amy Yip, our CEO in Hong Kong and also Christo Chao (0:023) who is our CFO for Hong Kong -- DBS Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, I will pass the floor over to our Chairman, Koh who will say a few words.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, thank you all for coming to our fourth quarter and full-year 2008 results briefing. Before I start, I would like to acknowledge the many well-wishers and expressions of concern that we've received since Rich was diagnosed with leukemia. He sent all of you his regards.</p>
          <p>I saw him on Tuesday and he is responding very well to the treatment. He is in very good spirits, in fact, he had free weights in his room, so he was taking a lot time doing exercises. And he has kept his sense of humor.</p>
          <p>So while I'm here today, all of us in DBS look forward to the day when Rich returns to work. DBS announced today full-year earnings of SGD2.06 billion in 2008. Given the economic downturn and the unprecedented market dislocations, we feel that this is a credible set of numbers.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we are well positioned to weather the storms ahead, having had the foresight in -- to act early in 2008, ahead of what we think will be a challenging 2009. We've taken early action to fortify our balance sheet. With SGD4 billion in our coffers, we are in the enviable position of being one of the best capitalized banks in Asia.</p>
          <p>We will use this capital judiciously to grow in Singapore, Hong Kong and our key growth markets of India, Indonesia, China and Taiwan. Let me make it clear. Organic growth remains our priority.</p>
          <p>With many of our competitors forced to retreat back to their home markets, we see opportunities to deepen existing customer relationships and to develop new ones. Our enlarged capital base gives us the added flexibility needed to help our customers through these tough times.</p>
          <p>We've reorganized our senior ranks and we've streamlined the organization for greater efficiency. We've combined six divisions into two, credit, market and ops risk into a single risk department.</p>
          <p>Enterprise Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking and Global Transaction Services into the Institutional Banking Group. This, we believe, will help to improve work processes and to break down silos.</p>
          <p>In addition, our Asian roots put us in good stead in this economic upheaval. Our knowledge of industries and companies in Asia will enable us to differentiate between those companies whose business models and competitive advantage will still prevail despite the current slowdown. It will allow us to evaluate each company on its own merit and not brush or color entire industries.</p>
          <p>While others banks may be distracted by head office issues or are curtailed in their ability to lend due to capital constraints, we are not similarly hampered. In fact, you've heard me say before that we pledge to stand by our loyal customers in good times and bad.</p>
          <p>Because we have been supportive of customers' financing needs during the year, DBS customer loans rose 17% to SGD126.5 billion in 2008. More than half the growth was from Singapore dollar loans. As a result, DBS market share of Sing dollar loans rose from 18% at the end of 2007 to 20% at the end of 2008. Our market share of Hong Kong loans remained stable.</p>
          <p>Let me share with you some ways in which we supported customers in 2008. On the Consumer Banking front, because we know that cash flow will be tight for some families during this time, we've taken the step of allowing Singapore homeowners to pay only interest on their home loans for as long as 18 months to help them cope with the economic crisis.</p>
          <p>We've revamped our investor sales process and have rolled it out in Singapore, Hong Kong and Mainland China. We now ask more questions to find out more about the customers' investment experience and objectives, their risk profile. We preface every investment with a summary sheet where customers must affirm that they have read and understood the product before investing.</p>
          <p>Where appropriate we ensure there is a cooling off period for customers so that they can withdraw their purchase if they subsequently change their minds within a stipulated time period.</p>
          <p>We perform callbacks whereby the relationship manager/supervisor will call the customer after the sale is made to reconfirm customer's understanding of the product purchase and their inherent risks. These processes are being fine-tuned in response to customer feedback. But we believe these are in the best interests of the customer.</p>
          <p>On the Corporate Banking front, DBS is doing all it can to stand by our customers. In Singapore, we were the first bank to offer the enhanced government schemes to SMEs since 1st December '08 and have doubled the size of the team seconded from other departments to handle the loan applications so that we can process them as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong, Enterprise Banking is also an active participant of the Hong Kong Special Loan Guarantee Scheme, which was launched in late December '08 to help Hong Kong enterprises through these difficult times.</p>
          <p>In the syndicated loan space, despite the meltdown in financial markets last year, Singapore had a record year. DBS was involved in four out of five high profile transactions, financing Singapore's two integrated resorts and a number of power, real estate, technology and shipping builds.</p>
          <p>Our SGD1.5 billion Hybrid Tier 1 issue launched in May 2008 broaden and deepen the Sing dollar debt capital market. By setting new benchmarks for the Sing dollar debt market, DBS redefined perceptions about the local debt market's ability to accommodate jumbo debt transactions and paved the way for local and foreign borrowers to tap the market for an alternative source of funding.</p>
          <p>DBS lending relationships helped us secure over SGD3.5 billion in bond transactions in 2008. Excluding self let deals DBS continues to lead in the league tables for the amount raised in the Singapore dollar bond market. Our willingness to continue lending has resulted in us getting mandates for capital markets and other products.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver convenience to corporate clients. Last year we launched the Quick Collect service and today have two dedicated security vans visiting to us OB and Orchard daily to pick up checks and other documents from corporate clients. Our Corporate Internet Banking service, IDEAL, is also seeing wider usage with transaction volumes up 30% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>While 2009 will be a difficult year; we remain optimistic about the future. In spite of the problems plaguing the financial sector worldwide, banks in Asia are not affected to the same extent. Our balance sheet is strong and given the skills of our people and the resilience of our organization, I believe we will be able to emerge from this economic crisis fitter and stronger.</p>
          <p>I would now like to pass it on to our CFO, Sok Hui to give you the details of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. DBS fourth quarter's results were in line with the trading update we issued in September 2008. We reported net profit of 383 million in the fourth quarter, marginally below the previous quarter by 5%.</p>
          <p>Revenues rose 5% from the previous quarter from higher net interest income, which benefited from previous quarter's loan growth as well as better asset and liability management. We also took the opportunity to lock in profits in some fixed income and equity investments. As with recent quarters, financial market dislocations continue to affect fee and trading incomes. The decline in fee income this quarter also included non-market-related activities, such as trade finance as the general economy slowed.</p>
          <p>Expenses in fourth quarter 2008 were higher than expenses in third quarter, as third quarter expenses reflected the write-back of bonus accruals made in first and second quarters. Total allowances declined from the previous quarter due to the absence of further CDO charges, which are already sufficient.</p>
          <p>There were three one-time items this quarter. A 45 million charge for an organizational restructuring, a 47 million impairment charge for our stake in Thai Military Bank, which mugged down the value of our investment to $76 million and a 4 million gain from sale of the property in Hong Kong. Including these items net profit for the fourth quarter would have been 295 million.</p>
          <p>We achieved a net profit of 2.06 billion in 2008 amid challenging conditions. Our markets-related income fell and credit cost rose, we had sustained customer loan growth and deposit inflows. This reflected customers' confidence in DBS and contributed to net interest income reaching a record of 4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Our focus on cost management assets enable us to keep expenses unchanged, at the previous year's level of 2.6 billion. Profit before allowances fell slightly by 3% from 2007 to 3.4 billion. Allowances for credit and other losses increased by 82% as credit cost increased.</p>
          <p>Net interest income rose 4% from the previous quarter to 1.115 billion despite the less favorable interest rate environment. Net interest margin rose 5 basis points from the previous quarter to 2.04%, reversing the downward trend from the previous quarters. The higher margin is due to better management of asset yields and deposit costs.</p>
          <p>Customer loans rose 17% year-on-year to $126.5 billion in 2008, more than half the growth was on Singapore dollar loans. This is in line with our strategy of raising our loan to deposit ratio in Singapore dollars and putting our excess liquidity in Singapore dollars to better use. As a result DBS market share of Sing dollar loans rose from 18% at end 2007 to 20% at end 2008.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, loans declined 1% as foreign currency loans fell 3% in line with softer economic conditions in the region. On the other hand Singapore dollar loans continued to grow at 4% better than the industry.</p>
          <p>Net fee income declined 17% from the previous quarter to 263 million on lower levels of market activity. Wealth management fees continued to decline, while stock broking and investment banking revenues remained weak. Fees from loan syndication and trade and remittances also fell.</p>
          <p>Other non-interest income rose from 11 million in the previous quarter to 93 million as a result of higher gain from the sale of securities in our investment portfolio. Trading income continued to be affected by conditions in credit markets and recorded a loss of 25 million.</p>
          <p>Expenses rose 19% from the previous quarter to 689 million due to write-backs of bonus accruals in the third quarter. There was also a 29 million write-off on the technology project. The quarter's expenses did not reflect the impact of the reduced head count from the organization restructuring. Annual savings will be felt from first quarter 2009, which will be reinvested into growth markets and technology improvements.</p>
          <p>For full-year 2008, the cost-to-income ratio edged up to 43% from 42% in 2007. The slowing economy will continue to exert pressure on our revenues as business volumes contract. We will maintain tight controls around our controllable expenses, as there remains scope for us to improve productivity, especially in our core markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to Hong Kong, this slide incorporates a depreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Hong Kong dollar of 2% from a year ago, and 6% from the previous quarter. The operating environment remains challenging in the fourth quarter with the narrowing of prime-HIBOR spreads and a general repatriation in the operating environment.</p>
          <p>Net interest income was up from the previous quarter as the impact of favorable currency movement and higher loan spreads offset a decline in loan volumes and rates earned on interbank assets and securities. Despite lower prime-HIBOR spreads, we kept interest margin stable from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income also rose from the previous quarter, as the currency impact and gains from the sale of investment securities offset weaker fee income and treasury product sales. Expenses rose from the previous quarter due to bonus write-backs in the third quarter and certain non-recurring expenses in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The increase in allowances was due to higher specific allowances for SME and private banking clients. The NPL rates in Hong Kong rose from 1.4% in the previous quarter to 1.7%. The allowance coverage was above 100% at 112% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>For the full year, there was an appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Hong Kong currency of 6%. Net profit declined 43% to 390 million on lower net interest income, higher expenses and increased loan-loss allowances. Net interest income fell 18% due to a 35 basis point decline in net interest margin to 1.86%. Loan growth for the year was 10% in local currency terms driven largely by corporates and SMEs.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income fell 3% after adjusting for currency effects. While there was a sharp slowdown in markets-related activities, such as stock broking and wealth management product sales, revenues from the sale of treasury products to corporates and SMEs continued to be resilient.</p>
          <p>There were also higher gains from the sale of certain equity investments. The increase in allowances was due to specific allowances for loans to private banking and SME customers.</p>
          <p>Operations outside Singapore and Hong Kong achieved strong growth during the year. This chart shows combined contributions outside of Singapore and Hong Kong. The improved performance was driven by a 57% increase in revenues from a year ago, as net interest income rose 72% and non-interest income grew 40%. The cost-to-income ratio improved from 51% to 44%. Net profit rose 94% to 322 million, which accounted for 16% of the Group's net profit compared to 7% a year ago.</p>
          <p>The encouraging results reflect the success of our ongoing efforts to grow our branch network and customer volumes in China, Indonesia and India in a disciplined manner. In Indonesia, we doubled our network to 37 branches and sub-branches compared to 18 year ago. In India we now have eight branches with two more to be opened this quarter, compared to two branches at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>In China, we have six branches and five sub-branches compared to five branches and one sub-branch a year ago. We also boosted our presence in Taiwan to 40 branches with the acquisition of Bowa in May.</p>
          <p>Non-performing assets rose 16% from the previous quarter to 2.4 billion with the non-performing loan rate rising slightly from 1.3% at end September 2008 to 1.5% at end December 2008, similar to the beginning of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our recognition of non-performing loans is conservative, with 36 of them being -- still current in interest and principal. Our allowance coverage remained comfortably above 100%, at 114%. Taking into account the collateral that we have, allowance coverage would be 176%.</p>
          <p>Our CDO investment portfolio was reduced to 1.06 billion during the quarter with a repayment of non-ABS CDO of 72 million. 97% of the portfolio is still rated A or better, unchanged from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>The non-ABS CDO was reduced by a further 72 million earlier this month as another CDO was unwound. This brought the allowance coverage for the non-ABS CDO from 27% in December to 30% currently. The allowance coverage for the ABS portfolio is at 93% after adjusting for currency effects from the previous quarter. No further allowances were set aside for CDOs in the fourth quarter as the existing coverage is assessed to be adequate.</p>
          <p>Our capital adequacy ratio rose during the quarter to 14.0% with the Tier-1 at 10.1%. The increase in capital adequacy ratio was due to a decline in market risk-weighted assets, as we made efforts to de-risk a part of our trading business.</p>
          <p>We reduced positions in more complex credit derivative positions, which required high capital usage during the quarter. These ratios did not factor in the 4 billion rights issue which closed in January. If we included the rights issue, pro forma capital adequacy ratios would be a very comfortable 16.2% at the total level and 12.2% at the Teir-1 level.</p>
          <p>We indicated during the rights issue that we'll pay the same amount of monetary dividends in the fourth quarter as we would have done had there not been a rights issue, which is about 300 million a quarter.</p>
          <p>With an enlarged share issue -- with an enlarged share base, we are proposing for approval at the forthcoming AGM a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter, this compares with adjusted 17% in the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize with some key points. First, the quality of our loan book continues to be strong. We've been prudent in past underwriting standards and we entered a year with NPLs remaining low at 1.5%. We conducted thorough credit reviews on our loan portfolio regularly and are conservative in accounting for impairment.</p>
          <p>Our practice has been to quickly recognize potential loss exposures as non-performing. As I said earlier, 36% of our non-performing assets are still current and allowance coverage ratio stands at 114%. The quality of our non-ABS CDO investments is sound. We are comfortable with our existing allowances for the CDO portfolio.</p>
          <p>We've also been extensively reviewing our off-balance sheet exposures to manage market and counterparty risk. And we remain comfortable with them. Our balance sheet is strong. Our liquidity position is excellent. And our leading deposit franchise continues to capture deposits.</p>
          <p>Our capital was boosted by the 4 billion rights issue completed last month. Operating conditions are expected to remain difficult in 2009. At the same time, interest rates have fallen to multi year lows exerting pressure on our interest margins.</p>
          <p>Despite the exceptionally challenging environment, we have remained and expect to remain profitable. Our cost efficiency has been enhanced by an organizational streamlining.</p>
          <p>Our strengthened balance sheet and broad based customer franchise will allow us to weather this downturn and selectively capture opportunities as they arise. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Sok Hui. We will now commence our Q&amp;A session. Kindly state your name and which publication you represent and we will -- we have our panel members both in Singapore and Hong Kong available to answer any of your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Xavier from Reuters. In terms of asset quality, we've seen some specific allowances out of Hong Kong, do you see the Hong Kong -- asset quality at Hong Kong <mark type="inaudible" /> faster than Singapore? And my second question is you've talked about organic growth and I think that's been the focus of the bank. But with opportunities right now in the market, for example, there are press reports that RBS may be selling its Indian operation, I was wondering if DBS would look into such opportunities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps, Sok Hui would you like to take the first part of the question on asset quality in Hong Kong. And perhaps Chairman on the second one on the RBS opportunity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our portfolio in Hong Kong is largely from the SME sector and we have been seeing faster decline in downtime for the NPL. But I think you look at the data a 1.4% at end September is gone up to about 1.7% end December. The -- our credit people in Hong Kong remain on top of things and they are monitoring the situation closely. But it is at a faster rate compared to the SME portfolio in Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our focus is on organic growth and I think that is our clear number one priority. When opportunities do present itself, we would take a look at it. But I think it is important to recognize that as far as we are concerned our basic strategy is to focus on what we already have, especially during a time like this where we ought to be able to take market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And our second question please. Conrad?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Conrad from the Business Times. Can you tell us what your outlook is for loans growth and NPLs for the rest of this year? Are you expecting, for example, an outright contraction perhaps in Sing dollars and bank lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sok Hui?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that in this environment we would be able to grow faster than the market, although I think it is hard to predict how the market -- the growth rate for the whole market. Because we are actually seeing opportunities to take exposures to customers who have come to us due to foreign banks perhaps withdrawing lines at this stage. So we expect to grow our market share in Sing dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also at previous public engagements, I think our Chairman has also stated that DBS will stand by our loyal customers. But we've asked our customers come and talk to us early before the conditions become too difficult, such that we are able to work with them through their situation. Next question please? Patricia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patricia, Dow Jones . When you guys -- talking about reclassification of some assets you've done in the third quarter and there are some losses that were not recognized because of the reclassification this quarter. Can you give any -- can you give more details on which -- what kind of assets are those that you guys decided to prefer reclassification? And given that the losses so far are not substantial, what's the thinking behind actually adopting these accounting rules? Is this more like making sure that the future if there are further losses on the two point something billion bundle of assets, just to make sure that you guys are protected or -- what's your thinking? Because the other banks haven't done that and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me clarify. I think our auditors actually advised when the Accounting Standard recall came into effect we were able to take it in time for our third quarter. But the other banks were already -- had already either disclosed their third quarter or was very much to finalizing of their accounts.</p>
          <p>What the auditors deemed to have happened in third quarter was a rare and exceptional event, which meant that if there were securities in our portfolio, which were illiquid, meaning that we actually had difficulty getting the mark-to-market prices, and we actually intend to actually hold it for a longer-term horizon, we should actually avail ourselves of the accounting standard to reclassify.</p>
          <p>So in the third quarter, we reclassified certain securities from the trading book to the investment book. That impact was 72 million in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, I think we reported the further impact in the AFS portfolio, because it is now in the AFS book.</p>
          <p>So the thinking is very much along the lines of securities that we hold, but really they are no longer liquid, and we intend to hold for a longer period.</p>
          <p>In terms of the color of this portfolio, some of these are well-rated Tier-I instruments which has seen market dislocations as well as certain Singapore corporate bonds which are also fairly illiquid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see other assets, I mean, can you discard the possibility of other assets maybe be included in this reclassification in the future or you think this is -- this was it. I mean this group of assets that's the only thing you guys are going to reclassify at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We -- our auditors &#x2013; we've discussed with our auditors, the event in the third quarter was considered kind of a rare market event. So we reclassified the trading portfolio to AFS portfolio. Now in the fourth quarter -- and again, remember it was done under very short time pressure, very compressed timeframe. In the fourth quarter we reclassified certain assets from the AFS portfolio to long-term receivables. We don't envisage that there will be lot more reclassifications going forward unless the market conditions change significantly.</p>

          <p>Hi. Peter Hoflich from The Asian Banker. I have two questions. One is about compensation, given the circumstances, given the times, are you changing any aspects of your composition policies across the bank. And I guess compensations and incentive programs, the way you offer bonuses for increases in the portfolios.</p>
          <p>The second question I have is one for Chairman, Koh, I guess you haven't been actually named Acting CEO, but I think your new role is temporarily at least the CEO. Could you please describe what your new duties are as a CEO and also I guess in a sense if you have a succession plan in place in the eventuality that Richard Stanley can't come back to be the CEO of DBS?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the element of our bonus program is that it should be flexible and reflect the performance of the bank. 2008, while we produced a credible set of numbers was not as good a year as 2007. So we would expect bonuses to decline somewhat inline, but we do intend to pay a bonus to our people.</p>

          <p>No, we believe that our programs currently are quite responsive to the performance of the bank. The second is even when Rich was here, our offices are next to each other. I talk to him practically everyday. We are on the same page about where the bank is headed. There will be no significant change during his period of absence. Third, he is sick, but he is coming back.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Kloe you had a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that was actually Peter picked up on what I had in mind. A lot of analysts I've spoken to this morning suggested that there was a lot of -- the DBS talk in recent past few weeks happen. So now because of investor uncertainty about the long-term strategy, about DBS, at a time of volatile stock markets and financial conditions. So that was actually my question. But I think you've spelled that out.</p>
          <p>But what about this loan growth, while your loan growth is growing faster as opposed to your smaller rivals UOB and OCBC, you have issues of rising loan -- rising bad debt and that's certainly something that a lot of analysts seem to be pointing out at, how you plan to deal with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think our NPLs for the fourth quarter, we have just discussed, you can see the level for yourself because at 1.5%, it seems to me that at this stage of the credit cycle, it is very decent. I think in the nature of this business as the recession worsens or it gets prolonged, we must expect NPLs to rise. But we believe that we have done a decent job of monitoring the credits and of monitoring our customers. And while it may rise, it is not out of the norm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could we have the last two questions, please? Gabriel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Gabriel from Straits Times . Let me check, your Sing dollar loans growth, I mean, grew third quarter, fourth quarter. Can we get a sense anecdotally, how much of this is really due to new customers and -- or how much is it due to existing customers taking on more loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This reflects primarily the loans that we have booked in previous quarters and they were drawn down in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the last question. <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Just wanted to check with you, is there any particular reason for the big drop in interbank lending -- fourth quarter. The other thing is any reasons for the sharp rise in positive income ratio from 41% to 47%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Can I get your question, interbank lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a drop about 5 billion in fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think interbank assets, the -- we have been prudent in managing our counterparty risk and that reflects that -- and that reflects the decline in interbank exposures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the other banks are not safe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think this is something that is felt in the global community. I think banks have been much tighter on counterparty exposures. And it is reflected on our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Your second question is cost income ratio, I think I have mentioned to you that our fourth quarter expenses, when you compare it to third quarter, there was an adjustment for bonus accrual for -- I am saying third quarter was also lower because of the bonus accruals that were written back in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter there was also a write-off of some technology expenses. And if you adjust for that in the fourth quarter it would have been 45%. I would say that the thing to look at is actually for the full year. For the full year of 2008 cost to income ratio is actually at 43%, just slightly higher than the 42% that we recorded in 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Sok Hui. Sorry, Alisha I think had a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Alisha from Business Times. I wonder whether you have started to see maybe some negative equity in home loans. And what is the bank's policy towards home loan borrowers who are current but their loans have fallen into negative equity. Do you -- would you require them to top up or --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No there is requirement to top up. We continue to monitor the trends on negative equity. But we basically focus on assessing the borrower's ability to repay, because we've gone through many previous down cycles. Our negative equity has increased there is not been a driver of default rates. Negative equity is a function of the property prices. Yeah. And if you see property market -- property prices declining there should be some deterioration in the components of negative equity.</p>

          <p>Chairman, do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I just wanted to add that in absolute terms as of this point in time, the situation -- the number of cases is really small, and is pretty much close to zero. And this is true of both Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last question Conrad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to find out from you, are you expecting your NPL ratio to eventually rise above 10% as in -- during the Asian financial crisis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think point of correction. I think even in the Asian crisis, we had the effects of Thai Danu Bank, which we'd -- we no longer have that today. I think adjusting for Thai Danu, the NPL rates during the Asian crisis was a lot lower than the 10% that you mentioned. We are starting in this cycle at 1.5% which is actually on the very low side. We do expect it to increase, but nothing like the figure that you've just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well thank you very much everyone. Apologies to have to rush this, but we have our Hong Kong media and panel to attend to right now. So thank you very much.</p>
