          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.</p>
          <p>At this time I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief Financial Officer, Doug Braunstein. Mr. Braunstein, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator. I'm going to be taking you through the earnings presentation which, as you know, is available on our website. And I'd also ask everyone to refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the presentation and with that, if you all turn to page one for the quarter we generated net income of $5.4 billion, $1.31 per share that's on revenues of $27.4 billion up 6% year-on-year, 24% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Return on tangible common equity of 16% for the quarter and I would characterize solid performance across most of our businesses particularly strong results in the Investment Bank and significant improvement year-over-year in Mortgage Banking.</p>
          <p>There are a number of significant items that we're highlighting here on this page. We do that every quarter. It includes DVA, reserve releases, litigation build and WaMu settlement. Every quarter we also have some modest pluses and minuses. We don't put these up front, but if you did total these significant items they had an aggregate negative impact of $0.09 a share on our reported numbers this quarter. I'm going to discuss them in much more detail as we go through the financials.</p>
          <p>Strong capital generation in the quarter. We ended with Tier 1 common of $128 billion, that's up $5-plus billion. Strong Basel I and Basel III ratios of 10.4% and 8.4%, respectively and I wanted to just highlight a couple of trends for the quarter and then we will go into the businesses.</p>
          <p>First is, if you look across our businesses, we have continuing signs of underlying fundamental growth. So 23% loan growth across wholesale year-on-year, record middle market loans this quarter up 19% year-on-year, $4 billion of credit provided to small businesses that's up 35% year-on-year, record Retail channel mortgage originations up 11% this year, deposits in CBB up 8% year-over-year, sales volume in Card up 12% year-over-year. And so the underlying fundamentals year-on-year look strong.</p>
          <p>On the credit side, we continue to have stable and good credit results in our Wholesale business and on the Consumer side, real continuing improvement in Consumer. And I would say in aggregate we're putting on better quality loans today from that loan growth, but just two quick statistics: in Mortgage, net charge-offs are down 25% year-on-year; in Card, net charge-offs are down 37% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>So with that is sort of an underlying theme, let's turn to the Investment Bank on page three. And for the quarter you see circled net income of $1.7 billion, that's on revenues of $7.3 billion, reported ROE of 17%. On page 1 we did highlight $900 million in DVA losses pre-tax for the IB this quarter. And as we've mentioned consistently in the past, we don't consider the DVA as a part of our core business results and in fact after the changes from this quarter, if you remember the spread widening we saw in the third quarter of 2011 where we booked a $1.9 billion gain on DVA, in the last two quarters we've now reversed $1.5 billion of that and obviously if spreads returned to the level they were last summer we would have gone round trip.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to focus on the IB numbers excluding all DVA. So in the first quarter, revenues were $8.2 billion, $2.2 billion in net income, and we had a 23% return on equity. And that &#x2013; those numbers are all very comparable to what was a very strong first quarter of 2011, but I do want to remind everyone that we tend to have a seasonally strong first quarter to start the year.</p>
          <p>IB fees in the quarter of $1.4 billion. That's down 23% year-on-year, up 23% quarter-on-quarter. And if you look on Appendix page 9 you'll see we continue to maintain our number one market leading share in fees.</p>
          <p>Markets revenues were relatively flat year-on-year. On a linked-quarter basis revenues were up significantly. Fixed income revenue was $5 billion. And that reflected continued solid client revenues across the products, particular strength this quarter in our Global Rates business. Equities revenue of $1.4 billion, really improved results across cash and derivatives. And we continue to have improving performance from our Prime Services. We are seeing increased balances there, a little improved leverage in the markets and a modest uptick in spreads.</p>
          <p>Credit portfolio revenue was a little over $400 million, up from the fourth quarter. And then expenses in the quarter at $4.7 billion were down 6% year-on-year. The comp-to-revenue ratio ex-DVA, which is the way we manage it, was 35% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>If you go directly to page 5, Consumer and Business Banking, you'll see circled net income of $775 million. That's down 13% year-on-year and an ROE for this business of 35% for the quarter. Revenue of $4.3 billion, that's relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but down 4% year-on-year; and that reduction year-over-year is generally consistent with our guidance on the impact of the Durbin Amendment, which we had this quarter and didn't come through in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>We continue to see solid year-over-year underlying performance trends in the business. So the deposits up $29 billion, which I talked about up 8%. We believe that is a growth rate faster than the industry growth rate. Business banking originations up 8% year-on-year. We had very strong investment sales this quarter as the markets improved and we continue to build out CPC, our Chase Private Client business, up to 41% quarter-on-quarter and in fact client investment assets of $147 billion is a record for Chase Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>On page six, you see Mortgage Production and Servicing, circled net income of $460 million for the quarter. That compared with a net loss of $1.1 billion in the prior year so $1.5 billion swing year-on-year. We had very strong production-related revenues of $1.6 billion and that's driven somewhat by higher volumes, so originations were up 6% year-on-year, applications as I mentioned up 33%, a very favorable refinancing environment, including the impact of HARP 2.0, but we also had higher margins this quarter as a function of those volumes and some mix issues. And we should be cautious about that because we're likely to see those margins return to more normalized levels on a go forward basis.</p>
          <p>Repurchase losses in the quarter were $300 million, that's lower than our expectations on a quarterly basis, which remained $350 million plus or minus. In large part that was a function of timing. And if you now move to the servicing side in the middle of the page, you'll see expenses there of $1.2 billion. That includes approximately $200 million of cost for the foreclosure-related matters associated with the settlement. So if you exclude that $200 million, servicing costs continue to remain very elevated at $950 million for the quarter and of that number, $700 million is related to default expense, which was essentially flat quarter-on-quarter, but very, very high.</p>
          <p>As we discussed at Investor Day, you should expect to see our servicing cost come down over time, volume of delinquencies as the units decline, costs will come down. We're also working very hard to make our processes more efficient. And over time, you would expect consistent with what we shared over at Investor Day, that our normalized expenses for servicing should be in the $300 million to $350 million range, but that will take a number of years to get to.</p>
          <p>On page 7, you see our Real Estate Portfolios. Circled net income of $500 million in the quarter and that compares to a loss of $160 million in the prior year. Revenues down 7% year-on-year. It's the result of the run-off we've been talking about for a while. Loan balances are down $24 billion, 11% year-on-year, consistent with our guidance. And we've said that you can expect a reduction in NII in this portfolio of about $500 million plus or minus for the year as we continue to run-off the WaMu portfolio and our other non-core mortgage assets.</p>
          <p>Credit costs you see is a benefit of almost $200 million and that is a function of delinquency trends improving across all the mortgage asset classes, including Home Equity. You see a circled number of $808 million for the quarter in net charge-offs and as I mentioned, that's down 25% year-on-year. Based on the reduction in the delinquencies, which by the way is in the appendix on page 16, the resolution of the foreclosure settlement and what we're seeing as stability in our severity numbers, we reduced our allowance this quarter by $1 billion. That's again part of the significant items on page 1.</p>
          <p>But I will say even after that reduction, allowance coverage remains at 6% for the portfolio, $7.7 billion, which is a very conservative approach to our risks and quite frankly the $1 billion release is reflective of what we had to do as an accounting matter.</p>
          <p>I would note one other reporting change here, which is due to the industry wide regulatory guidance. We moved $1.6 billion of our high-risk seconds into the nonperforming loan category. And that's despite the fact that $1.4 billion of those $1.6 billion are current today. As you know, we've identified those high-risk seconds early. We put reserves up against them early and so our reserves remain unaffected, but if you excluded these changes, NPLs would have trended down year-on-year, down quarter-on-quarter and the same would be true at the company-wide level as you look at the company statistics.</p>
          <p>On page 8, Card Services &amp; Auto, circled net income of $1.2 billion. That's on revenues of $4.7 billion. Revenues and outstandings are lower year-on-year, that's the impact of runoff and modestly lower quarter-on-quarter and that's primarily due to the seasonal growth that we saw and we tend to see in the fourth quarter around the holidays. We did see strong sales volume in Card, as I mentioned, up 12%, but if you exclude the sale of Kohl's, sales were actually up 15% for the system and the new product sales growth for our Freedom, Sapphire and Ink products were actually in excess of that growth rate. Auto originations also up 21% year-on-year and that quite frankly reflects higher industry sales.</p>
          <p>Credit costs of $740 million really reflect two factors. Total net charge-offs are $1.5 billion, that's down a little under $900 million year-on-year. We've got lower delinquency and net charge-off rates circled for Card at the bottom of the page. We do expect, by the way, the net charge-off rate to be 4.25% plus or minus in the next quarter. I'd also note, loss rates in Auto remained very low. We recognize 28 basis points of charge-offs this quarter.</p>
          <p>And as a result of all of that information, we released $750 million this quarter in Card and again reserves here remain very robust, even after that release. One other comment on Card, expenses were up 6% year-on-year and that really was related to exiting a non-core product in the business.</p>
          <p>Page 9, Commercial Banking, circled net income of almost $600 million on revenues of $1.7 billion, 25% return on equity and that's based on a higher capital allocation for this business this year. 9% year-over-year revenue growth, it's been driven by the themes we've been talking about, growth in loans and liability balances and that's offset by the spread compression we've experienced year-on-year. It is our seventh consecutive quarter of loan balance growth. You see the circled loan balances of almost $116 billion, up 16%. We had record revenue and record loan balances in our Middle Market business for the quarter that was up 19%. C&amp;I loans up 24% year-on-year and I think the best of what we've got in industry data, industry volumes are up 12% year-on-year. So if you think of all that, it really does reflect two underlying trends. Growth, we believe in terms of demand, as well as a combination of improvements in market share across those product sets.</p>
          <p>I will continue to note utilization does remain relatively stable where it's been at a low rate for the last several quarters. Credit costs were $80 million in the quarter here, but net charge-offs were exceedingly low at 4 basis points.</p>
          <p>Page 10, Treasury &amp; Security Services, solid results here, net income of $350 million, up 11% year-on-year, 40% quarter-on-quarter. Revenues of $2 billion, up 9% year-on-year and that's again resulting from some underlying fundamental trends that are offsetting that spread compression that we've talked about. Liability balances are up 34%, international revenue is up 12%, assets under custody is a record $17.9 trillion, up 8% and trade finance loan balances are up 40% year-on-year. You will notice there, by the way, we had a modest decline in trade finance quarter-on-quarter, really a function of a little bit of seasonality and I would say an increased return of competition, particularly from some of our European competitors in the fourth &#x2013; in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 11, Asset Management, we had improved quarter-on-quarter results in AM, largely driven by market conditions, but we are down from what was a strong first quarter 2011. Circled net income of $386 million, that's on revenues of $2.4 billion. The results were really driven by some underlying growth, as well as the market improvement we saw this last quarter. It's the twelfth consecutive quarter of long-term flows, $17 billion, $43 billion over the latest 12 months. And we did set records for assets under supervision and records for assets under management. Expenses were up year-on-year and that's largely been from the investment spending we've been talking about for a number of quarters.</p>
          <p>Page 12, Corporate and Private Equity. Private equity net income of $130 million, that's on $250 million of revenue predominantly marked-to-markets for public positions and some modest realizations this quarter. So Corporate, we recorded a net loss of $700 million and the loss included two significant items. The first is a $2.5 billion addition to our litigation reserves, predominantly mortgage related and we identified that up on page 1. So I'm going to make a couple comments on the litigation reserve.</p>
          <p>As you know, including the actions this quarter, we have been building very significant reserves. We believe that currently these reserves are both comprehensive in nature and appropriately conservative given what we know about these exposures, including the information in the first quarter of this year. And I would say absent a material adverse development that could certainly change our views, we don't anticipate making material addition to these reserves over the course of the year, but I do want to caution, facts and circumstances can change; reserves can go up, they can go down, but we feel based on what we know today that we are unlikely to add materially to this position.</p>
          <p>We did book an addition of $1.1 billion pre-tax gain that was also identified on page 1 that is from the WaMu bankruptcy settlement. And if you excluded those two items, Corporate net income excluding PE we note on the right, bottom right, was $175 million for the quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 13, the Fortress Balance Sheet, I've covered a lot of the topics already, but let me add two comments to the page. First, as you know, we authorized the new $15 billion share repurchase. We've spent approximately $450 million year-to-date on that new authorization and for those likely to ask, it is at a price of about $44.75.</p>
          <p>Second, on trust preferred or TruPS we have $20 billion outstanding, as you all know. We do expect to redeem $10 billion of that $20 billion in total this year. And that is pursuant to the capital plan that we submitted in the CCAR process and for much of that those securities we're going to wait until there is a regulatory call event to call those. We were in the market for a $400 million call on a single security that did not require that trigger. And for the remaining $10 billion currently, our view is that is very attractive long-term financing.</p>
          <p>On page 14, we do have the outlook, I think I covered all of that and so before I turn it over to Jamie I did want to talk about the topics in the news around CIO and just sort of take a step back and remind our investors about that activity and performance. We have more liabilities, $1.1 trillion of deposits than we have loans, approximately $720 billion. And we take that differential and we invest it and that portfolio today is approximately $360 billion.</p>
          <p>We invest those securities in very high-grade, low-risk &#x2013; we invest those dollars in high-grade, low-risk securities. We've got about $175 billion worth of mortgage securities, we've got government agency securities, high-grade credit and covered bonds, securitized products, municipals, marketable CDs. The vast majority of those are government or government backed and very high-grade in nature. And we invests those in order to hedge the interest rate risk of the Firm as a function of that liability and asset mismatch.</p>
          <p>We hedge basis risk, we hedge convexity risk, foreign exchange risk is managed through CIO and MSR risk. And we also do it to generate NII, which we do with that portfolio. The result of all of that is we also need to manage the stress loss associated with that portfolio.</p>
          <p>And so we have put on positions to manage for a significant stress event in credit. We have had that position on for many years and the activities that have been reported in the paper are basically part of managing that stress loss position, which we moderate and change over time depending upon our views as to what the risks are for stress loss from credit. All of those decisions are made on a very long term basis. They are done to keep the company effectively balanced from a risk standpoint.</p>
          <p>We are very comfortable with our positions as they are held today, and I would add that all of those positions are fully transparent to the regulators. They review them, have access to them at any point in time, get the information on those positions on a regular and recurring basis as part of our normalized reporting and all of those positions are put on pursuant to the risk management at the firm-wide level.</p>
          <p>The last comment that I would make is that based on, we believe, the spirit of the legislation as well as our reading of the legislation, and consistent with this long term investment philosophy we have in CIO, we believe all of this is consistent with what we believe the ultimate outcome will be related to Volcker.</p>
          <p>So with that, maybe, Jamie, I'll turn it over to you before we open it up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Doug, thank you. So let me just comment about one thing and then we'll open to your questions. One is the stock buyback. Obviously we got permission to buy back $15 billion worth of the stock. We would have preferred to have been able to buy back substantial amounts below tangible book value, but we were unable to. We will always, as a disciplined buy back of the approximately $3 billion we issue every year, and that's the $3 billion we issued mostly for comp and that's not on a GAAP basis because we issue before vesting, etcetera.</p>
          <p>At $45 we reserve &#x2013; right now we're buying back at that rate, but we may do more. So we reserve the right at any point in time to do whatever we want. And it's based upon basically four things: what are the organic opportunities: they might be there, portfolios or more organic growth. What are the investment opportunities? A lot of things you can buy &#x2013; both investments or acquisitions, we don't really expect big ones now. Our own desire to get quickly &#x2013; how fast do we want to get to our new cap requirements, under Basel III and the stock price. So it does not mean at $45 &#x2013; obviously if the stock goes up, I think we'll be consistent, we'll buy less; when it goes down we'll buy more. We're a buyer in size around tangible book value. And then obviously we reserve the right to change that at will.</p>
          <p>So let's open up to questions or comments about any subject at all.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Hi, Glenn.</p>

          <p>Hey, Glenn.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jamie, just because you brought it up I think it's interesting &#x2013; if you took the midpoint of the range that you outlined in the shareholder letter and you took the $23 billion, $24 billion of over-the-cycle earnings, that's a sub-seven times multiple. It seems very attractive at the midpoint of the range. Just &#x2013; I'm just curious on how you think through the valuation when you're thinking about the use of proceeds on the buyback.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean look, you said it yourself, anyone could do the numbers. At tangible book value it's extremely attractive; at $40 it'd probably be very attractive; and at $45, I'm not saying it's not attractive, but our best thing is to grow our business and not to worry about buying back the stock. We're going to buy back the stock when it's a bargain, not just because we feel like it. And so you guys can all do the numbers, we're just not going to tell you all what we're going to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Fair enough. If you look on the quarter for a year-on-year basis, expenses were up like 15% and now there's litigation costs in there and things like that. I think on the Investor Day you had suggested flat expenses year-on-year. That obviously depends on Investment Bank revenues, but can you just talk about the revenue expense dynamic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said flat expenses. We still expect that. The first quarter is a little bit higher because of FICA and payroll, a whole bunch of things like that, and some one-off expenses that run through there. And that's flat; if you back out IB comp and extraordinary stuff, that number should be about $12 billion a quarter. Obviously it was a little bit higher this quarter if you do that, but it'll come down over time we think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's still flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember it's flat, but we're still doing a lot of investing, so we are getting other efficiencies to help pay for the investing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. And then maybe last one for me, I think the fear around issues in Europe started to subside post LTRO and I think we discussed that last call. We got a little bit of a scare in the last week or two with Spain. Just curious on your thoughts right now where are we in that process and do you still feel comfortable on the counterparty exposures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I constantly read about counterparties. Our numbers, we disclosed around $15 billion, a little bit higher than that now. They obviously move around. I would still say exactly the same thing. The LTRO was a massive thing that took a real catastrophe in the short run-off the table, but obviously the world is going to evaluate over time whether the fiscal union is tightened and giving teeth and carrots and sticks and all that, and it's going to look at Spain and Italy's both austerity and growth plans and it's going to be like an accordion over the next 18 months. So I'm personally not going to overreact to that, but I think they have to do some things to give it the real stability. The LTRO wasn't sufficient. It was a short-term fix, not a permanent fix.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>On the CIO question, which obviously you've addressed and has gotten so much attention in the press this week, can I just ask one further question, which is, are all of the results of the CIO group reflected only within Corporate and other?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's just a question that I ask in order to sort of assess the tempest in the teapot nature of the stories relative to the revenues that we see that just don't seem to be that big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a complete tempest in a teapot. Every bank has a major portfolio. In those portfolios, you make investments that you think are wise, that offset your exposures. Obviously it's a big portfolio, we're a large company, and we try to run it &#x2013; it's sophisticated, obviously with complex things, but at the end of the day, that's our job is to invest that portfolio wisely and intelligently over a long period of time to earn income and to offset other exposures we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning to the capital questions, obviously you've had a rapid growth towards your eventual Basel III targets, although of course we still don't know exactly what they are. And you've alluded to the conditions under, which you would return capital through buybacks, but what about the potential for, say, special dividends along the way if you felt that you had excess capital and the share buybacks were not that attractive? How would you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, I think the right way to look at that is ask that question in two years. I mean, we're not at the Basel III targets yet. You should expect dividends on a regular basis &#x2013; we may change our mind, but on a regular annual basis from us that we'll look at what to do. Obviously that's a Board level decision, but there's going to certainly be no special dividends before we know what the real capital rules are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's completely fair. Mortgage origination, you alluded to better spreads, obviously, and maybe you could just give us a little bit more color of how that came through because it certainly does look like they improved meaningfully given how the revenue evolved versus last quarter versus the origination volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were several hundred million higher than what we would call normal for a whole bunch of different reasons, including HARP, supply, demand, the price at which, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are securitizing things so I would expect that to normalize over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then the last one for me is a related one, which is that looking at the mortgage apps that you received during the quarter, which would presumably tell us something about originations out a quarter or so, that's up very, very strongly. Factoring in the HARP and everything else, is that a pretty good indicator that we should expect origination revenues to improve at least in the quarter or so ahead? Or should we discount that in some way?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a measure of what you're going to get next quarter on revenues but, not on the volumes but, not necessarily on the spreads.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. Questions on trading. Equity trading revenue seems better than expected and better than the industry cash volume, any color on what helped you guys there? Was equity derivatives particularly strong or any other color?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then can you give us some sense of how trading revenues trended month-to-month during the first quarter and maybe, it's early, but how things are so far in April?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to go through month-by-month numbers. I would say so far it was 10 days it's going to be 60 plus days this quarter and the 10 days is a little bit lower than we saw in the first quarter. That, in my opinion, does not reflect the next 50 days. Though Doug mentioned, there has usually been regular seasonality in the business not just for us, but for everybody so whether that continues or not, who knows?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It was the completion of a thorough review of all the reps and warranty, all the litigation, all the tranches, all the Bear Stearns, etcetera, etcetera, but the real view about all of that, that's all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then is the net interest income and margin trend from this quarter, that's consistent, Doug, with your expectations for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say we are going to continue to see pressure. I would not say, John, for the year, but certainly for the next quarter and then we will see where the world goes. Part of it is a little bit we have the opportunity to buy back some TruPS that may help improve some of the trends and we're not quite sure when that's going to hit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And part of it is discretionary, like how we invest in long-term funds over time. We've been fairly conservative in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you are sitting on kind of excess cash that you're kind of waiting for a very better environment to invest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And part of the reason NIM was down quarter-on-quarter is we were a little more conservative in the opportunities with that excess cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if you did the $10 billion of TruPS that you're planning, there might be some NIM or net interest income benefits, Doug that you've not put into your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we didn't &#x2013; all I'm saying is we're going to have pressure. The only thing I would say is we'll see some continued pressure on NIM for the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about that in terms of spread compression and runoff and you just haven't incorporated any impact from what you might do on TruPS yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is incorporated in everything we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but look the important thing is when we talk about the portfolio one of the bigger decisions you make if you look at our portfolio and we disclose we would benefit from rising rates. A lot of that comes out of CIO and it costs money to be there, but we think it's a conservative and proper way to run the company because we worry about, you know, the fat tails, much higher rates not much lower rates, so we can change that and increase NIM tomorrow if wanted to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we started to see the 10 year go up consistently without Fed Funds moving up would that be something you could take advantage of or when you say rates going up, Jamie, it is really the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but we would have to feel at that point in time that we want to do it and there are other ways to do it. You can buy spread products not just fixed rate products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then more fundamentally, there's a benefit from just kind of the shorter Fed Funds going up eventually?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>I'd say, John, from a position standpoint very consistent with where we were at Investment Day (sic) [Investor Day] (36:15), a 100 basis point rise in the curve, we generate a couple billion dollars of incremental NII.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of follow-ups, one is on the special dividend question that was asked earlier. I guess the reason why &#x2013; what I'm wondering is, if you were &#x2013; if you decided not to do your approved buyback this year based on what the stock's doing, then why wouldn't you do a special dividend this year to absorb what you were approved for in buy back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Betsy, we don't know all the final capital rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we weren't going to buy back the stock, my preference would be, get to &#x2013; whatever the rules are, sooner rather than later. That's all. It's not that you've lost the money- you can- I always call that kind of earnings in store, you can redeploy your capital later. If after we know all the rules and we have excess capital and that's the best thing to do for shareholders, obviously the Board will consider that. We're not going to consider it before we get to whatever the known capital rules are. And we're going to know a lot more, remember, by hopefully by the end of this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, we're not going to do it before we get to our capital rules. We don't know what they are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. So I guess &#x2013; but the basic question I have is, you have an expectation for what your capital's going to end up being at year-end...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but we don't know. We &#x2013; our expectation, 9.5% Basel III, but we don't know all the RWA rules, we don't know how it's going to come out and we're not even sure about the 9.5%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I suppose the question then is, why are you more comfortable doing buybacks than special dividends?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Okay, and then on just a couple questions on housing. So obviously from your letter, housing is much better, green lights flashing. I just wanted to understand how that comports with what was presented at Analyst Day, Investor Day, when you talked about how estimated OREO and foreclosure projections were actually moving up in the near-term, as you're getting the pig through the python, but given your letter, I kind of wondered, well, is your investor...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I didn't &#x2013; we didn't say they were moving up. What we said is that they might move up temporarily as some of them get freed up, but if you look at total seriously delinquent loans and total foreclosures from a year ago to today, to the end of this year, they're going to come down. Obviously they're kind of very lumpy as every bank goes around its own different thing, but homes for sale are down, inventory is down, delinquent loans are coming down, charge-offs are coming down, real money's coming in. So we're just saying we pretty much are at the bottom. I don't know the lumpiness by month or by quarter, but we're pretty much at the bottom here. As long as you have a recovery, if the United States goes back into recession, you know, all bets are off.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think we fully disclosed about two years ago, that we had identified a long time ago that when &#x2013; we were surprised to find out, by the way, that a lot of seconds were still paying when the first no longer was, but when we analyzed it, it was pretty obvious it was just a timing difference. That in almost all cases the first went delinquent, the second eventually went delinquent. And in all cases, where the first went into foreclosure, the second was a loss, basically a total loss. So we just recognized that in our reserving years ago. That's all. We specifically reserved for specifically that thing. So moving it from performing to non-performing didn't affect our reserves. That's...</p>

          <p>Okay. And then on refi, anecdotally it seemed like there was a lot of expectation about HARP 2.0 moving a good deal of refi activity, but we haven't really seen that in the Fannie and Freddie MBS at this stage and we also didn't see a big increase in JPMs volumes either. Is the expectation that, that is going to kick in, in a big way in the back end of the year? When you're taking a look at the pipeline, how many months does it take for that to move through the &#x2013; through your production?</p>

It's going &#x2013; you're seeing refis any way and this just opens up a bigger universe to be refi'd. Other than that we just couldn't give you the numbers off hand.

          <p>My questions really relate to the impact of lower interest rates. I guess the first would branches, the number of branches are up 5% since a year ago, but revenues in RFS are down 4%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I know we talked about this at Investor Day but still the same plans to increase the branches? What metrics should we look at from the outside to monitor that progress?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I pointed out at Investor Day, the branches make like $1 million a branch; and we just adjusted the build to make up for changes from Durbin and other things like that. But we are losing in total we disclosed like $500 million a year in NIM.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are running the Company such that we expect to get that back. So we're not going to make short-term decisions about branch builds because of short-term spread compression. We think the value is there and we're doing it, we just are adjusting the branch builds. And so what you're seeing is almost exactly what we told you. Durbin is $150 million a quarter, NIM is down by...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be $400 million year-over-year and you see the margins in that business declined by 20 bps as a result of that this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then more generally, you mentioned that NII could see some additional pressure, what would be the biggest source of ongoing margin pressure as it relates to the low rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've identified NII from the portfolio run-off, Mike. So that's another &#x2013; that's a $500 million number. And as we go through quarter-on-quarter now you've got spread compression impact in TSS and in CB somewhat leveling off over time, but you'll continue to see a little bit of that, but it'll level off as we normalize in a rate environment we've had low for long.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, why don't we have bigger loan growth? It looks you're &#x2013; you mentioned you had record Middle Market loan balances, but still wholesale loan growth versus the fourth quarter increased at the slowest pace since six quarters ago. So if we have for good borrowers the most benign rate environment in our lifetime, why wouldn't we see more loan growth in aggregate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got to be &#x2013; the issue is that in our wholesale you've got really two big books, okay. You've got the Commercial Bank, which was up substantially. If I were you that's the one I'd look at. You have the Investment Bank, but that one moves around dramatically as big companies borrow, pay it off, you've got a bridge loan that goes in and out, a conduit loan that goes in and out. So I wouldn't look at that one the same way. I said that just can go &#x2013; that can move dramatically quarter-by-quarter, but we saw &#x2013; if you look at the Investment Bank, a lot of debt issuance. That we &#x2013; usually when you have huge debt issuance, sometimes your bank loans go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just one overview insight. It seems like traditional banking isn't doing so great: NII down, margin down, loans were flat for the quarter, utilization hasn't changed. On the other hand, the capital markets are doing great; you have phenomenal issuance, great trading. Is there some insight you can give us into the industry? We have lower rates. It's not necessarily fueling traditional banking. On the other hand, capital markets are doing well. Is this just exaggerated disintermediation? Or how would you describe the current environment?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, we've had eight straight quarters of Middle Market and C&amp;I loan growth in the Commercial Bank. We've had probably four, five or six straight quarters of small business loans going up. So if you're looking at the commercial world, that's what I would look at. In the commercial &#x2013; in the consumer bank, we've had consistent growth in deposits and we have a NIM going down a little bit because of the interest rate environment, but the underlying deposits, clients, flows is actually pretty good and credit card spend is good and debit card spend is good, but you have NIM compression. We could go over it a thousand times; we're going to have NIM compression. Think of that as like the cost of mozzarella for pizza. When it goes up, your margins go down a little bit. It doesn't mean you're selling less pizza.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two things jumped out to me from a big picture point of view. The comp ratio at the Investment Bank was, as you mentioned, lower than a year ago at 35 versus 40. The pace of reserve release in the credit book also accelerated quite a bit. And I guess just from a high-level point of view you tend to be very conservative when you can be, especially in the beginning of the year. So as we think about each of those two buckets, which I realize are completely separate, but as we think about the comp ratios in the Investment Bank &#x2013; what is it within the business that you're trying to change or think that will be different than they've been in the past where you've kind of erred on the side of being a little more conservative early on in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing. Remember, there's a lot of things that go in the comp ratio at the bank, but I think the best way to think about it is 35% give or take, we've always said 35% to 40%, but a lot of things affect that and that's how we book it because nothing's changed. And the reserve takedowns were in mortgages and credit card and they're required. The accountants look at a whole bunch of numbers, they make you take it down, so we had to take it down. We don't expect &#x2013; I think it's important, we don't expect big reduction reserves in credit card anymore. Mortgage over time will have to come down as the book gets smaller and charge-offs come down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the mortgage reserve release, I think this was the first quarter that you had significant reserve release in the RFS. As you think about the pace going forward based on what you see right now, would you expect something similar?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Okay. And then just going back to the Investment Bank comp, as we think about the businesses there, there's been a lot of talk about trying to manage down the comp ratio within FICC. Is that something that's driving the ratio? Or is it just the...</p>

          <p>Most of my questions have been answered, but just one quickly on FICC trading and the strength there. You talked about the Rates business. Is there any way to put color around how much of the strength in Fixed Income trading was sort of volume related and how much was basically more market-oriented based on just gains mark-to-market gains on sales and the inventory through the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, but we had very good volumes and you are absolutely correct, volumes drive it, spreads drive it and your positioning drives a little bit, so but volumes will be probably the primary driver. Obviously we want to do a good job-positioning inventory too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think the fear is &#x2013; I mean, obviously the first quarter is usually seasonally strong, the fear is not just that you maybe get a little bit of drop off in volume after the first quarter but that some of the strength came and obviously we can't measure it from the outside looking in, but some of the strength came from just the fact that debt spreads in almost every asset class were tightened so much throughout the quarter. Is there any way to think about that as we try to think about where trading could go for the next several quarters?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, all things being equal, when that happens, it will be a benefit to trading results. If it goes the other way it's usually a negative. It's not necessarily that way because you can position for it. So if I were you, you could look at volume, spreads, and you can make your own estimate, but every company takes different positions and tries to protect itself but, all things being equal that a back wind for trading. Yes.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I wanted to come back for a moment to the delinquent mortgage servicing cost issue. And just looking at industry statistics, the number of homes in the delinquency have almost dropped by half since early 2010, but the number of homes in foreclosure has stayed flat at about 2.1 million and ever since then hasn't budged and it seems to be the number of homes in foreclosure that drives the expense levels. And I'm wondering, does the AG settlement kind of give you an ability to break the logjam a bit and to accelerate the process and/or when should we start seeing the decreased delinquencies translate into decreased foreclosure and foreclosure related expense?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we told you, you should start seeing it every quarter for the next eight quarters. It will be a little lumpy, but my guess eight quarters from now it will be a lot less than it is today.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys. I just wanted to circle back on the margin commentary and NII. I think you mentioned that perhaps in 2Q there could still be some pressure, but we shouldn't really read into that in terms of pressure throughout the year. I just wanted to tie that back to the full year commentary about the real estate run-off drag of, I think, $500 million year-over-year as well as the Consumer Business Banking drag of I think you still think about $400 million. How do we think about it in terms of potentially when there would be an inflection point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I'd say think about it 5 to 10 basis points for the next quarter. It will moderate a little bit going forward and then it's going to be a function of as Jamie said of our positioning and a function a little bit of what the financing market looks like in general. But near term, that's a good indication and that incorporates all of the runoff, all the margin pressure and a variety of pluses and minuses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's hard to speak about this on a consolidated thing. Probably for the most part in TS we see it in Commercial Bank it's going to be more the pricing pressure than it is to margin pressure and loans and if you see it as Doug said probably most in the consumer bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Consumer bank. Correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, that's helpful. And then any sense of when the real estate drag kind of starts to slow down? When can we see an inflection in terms of C&amp;I in Business Banking maybe growth offsetting that drag? Is it by the end of the year or do we have to wait until next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The drag isn't going to slow down; it's going to go on for years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Andrew, remember I put that chart up at Investor Day, we're releasing capital with that as well, so the fact of the matter is, as that slows down it does hurt NII. It goes on, hurts NII, but it's releasing capital along the way.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about $175 million. We manage that number, as you know.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good morning. A couple of follow-ups, one on FICC; did you see any evidence of market share gains as some of the Europeans have decided to pull back there? Or was it a more kind of a broad-based business improvement in the FICC line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we saw any real material market share gains here undergone in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you really haven't seen that yet. On the HELOCs, the $1.6 billion that you added to NPA's, is that representative of all of the HELOCs that are behind delinquent firsts? Is that like 100% of those or is it just part of the ones that might be behind delinquent firsts?</p>

          <p>We identified 4 &#x2013; we have $4 billion that are part of that portfolio of which $1.6 billion had to move. We've reserved, as Jamie talked about, across the whole $4 billion of the portfolio. Each of &#x2013; there are different characteristics within that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>So why did this $1.6 billion move and not the other $2.4 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it fit the specific guidelines of LTV that the regulators ask for.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I got you. Thank you. And one last question on the margin, the one thing that was a little strange was that the long-term debt cost jumped pretty material, about 56 basis points sequentially. Was that related to &#x2013; was there something about last quarter where you had some debt gains that kind of skewed that or why would the long-term debt numbers be going up so materially?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Hey, Jamie, just change the conver &#x2013; the discussion a little bit, we're hearing out there for loan growth people that are getting loan growth that there's a lot of price competition and underwriting competition, especially in the commercial markets. And a lot of people bring up your name as being one of the most competitive out there for pricing. I was just wondering if you could add some color to that. And are you taking outsized interest rate risk growing your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well, two separate things. First of all, there is competition pricing. I'm surprised to hear it's us. When I've heard that before I went and checked, we see no evidence of that. Obviously we don't want to drive them &#x2013; drive the market like that. It's got nothing to do with interest rate exposure. We don't look at &#x2013; we fund &#x2013; we try to match fund loans is the way we look at loans. We don't say, okay, we'll take interest rate exposure and pass it on to the client.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you hedge &#x2013; so you're just saying you're hedging most of those &#x2013; you're doing fixed rate at five or seven years, you're hedging all that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you say you're surprised to hear that your name is mentioned a lot, but especially out West, your name comes up a lot, and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Paul, it's because we're a new competitor out West. Obviously we're competing out West to gain share. Everything we do out West, remember we didn't have a big Middle Market operation out West so everything we're doing is taking share from someone as opposed to like if you go to the Midwest where it's a lot more renewals than it is new business. I understand why you're hearing that out West.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about underwriting standards? We're hearing that that's been &#x2013; that that's been &#x2013; also been cheapened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely not. It may be cheapened for the industry, but it's not, has nothing to do with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one quick follow-up on the expenses related to servicing, with the servicing &#x2013; and you've taken some write-downs on servicing already related to higher costs, but is the AG settlement, does that materially increase servicing costs? Or has that already been factored into your valuations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We reserved a bunch of that stuff in prior quarters. It cost us $200 million in this quarter and most of the rest is incorporated in loan loss reserves and it's already in our higher servicing costs. We've already been running to the Consent Orders and things like that, so it's not going to add additional servicing costs. We also, as you point out, recognized some of that in the MSR already, and we wrote down the value of the MSR relating to some of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Two questions on capital, if I may. The first one really is on the Basel III RWA. I know you don't disclose them, but perhaps you could give some indication as to the extent to which, you mitigated those either passively or actively during the first quarter? That's the second one or the first one rather.</p>
          <p>And the second one really is obviously your enthusiasm for getting to your Basel III ratio. I think you said getting the yoke off your shoulders at the Investor Day sooner than later has pretty well been taken up by nearly all your competitors apart from one very large one in Frankfurt, which seems intent on moving fully to 2019 and is obviously sitting on a considerably higher leverage ratio than your good selves. Do you think that you and your peers who are taking this regulatory high road are putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage to this fairly powerful player? Or do you think that the regulatory pressures will start to actually bring you together much more quickly than perhaps they might envisage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it does that at all. I think we're all competing in the marketplace and I don't think that your capital ratios change your competition that's in the marketplace and we're all waiting for more guidance from the regulators. It's not like there's a total competition for capital.</p>
          <p>And then the RWA mitigation, its two pieces. One piece is simply the runoff of stuff, which is going to go away. That's happening every quarter. We've already talked about the consumer portfolio running off. There's a couple in the IB running off, there are a couple things &#x2013; and the second is just the normal adoption of modeling capabilities that could be used in B-III, that's all, that were not being used before because you didn't need to. It's those two things and they're rolling in over time.</p>
