        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. Apologies for the start being a little bit late. Questions of media went a little bit longer than we anticipated. Appreciate the fact that this is a very busy day for your community with Woolworths and Foster's and Rio and, I think, Suncorp all announcing, so we'll try and be as efficient as possible with the answers and with the presentation, because I know that there are more than Woolworths' fish to fry today.</p>
          <p>Okay, last year has been yet another successful year for our business performing well across all of our divisions. We believe that it's because we have delivered consistently against the strategies that we defined each of our businesses and we put many years of hard work into building the foundation for that and that hard work has been not only our own staff and stores and the distribution centers and our support officers, but also the partnership that we have with our suppliers and our farmers. And lastly, of course, the growing confidence that consumers have in what was delivering great value in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Last year we invested pretty heavily in our businesses. We are going to continue to do that in 2009, but more particularly we believe that we are well positioned for future growth as a team.</p>
          <p>The headline numbers, everybody has seen. I think a 24% EPS growth and a 25.7 growth in net profit after tax is a good result for the team for 2008.</p>
          <p>Some of the highlights for the year. The investments that we made in our supermarkets with the refurbishments are being well received by our customers, not only are the comp numbers of customer counts increasing, but more particularly, we're getting stronger fresh food results. We're getting good margin mix changes in our non-fresh, and more importantly, the verbal reports that we're getting back through our focused groups has really indicated that we've hit the mark in terms of delivering either fresh and a really great venue offering to our customers. Last year we did 180 stores in the new format, up until about now &#x2013; sorry, and a further 150 odd including 134 refurbishments are expected in the coming year.</p>
          <p>We also launched the new logo for the Supermarkets at our Annual Conference last week. The stylized W is a harken back to one of our earlier chevrons that we had in the 70s and 80s with a fresh new look and obviously the lift at the top is the good link into the fresh food people. It has been remarkably received by our team, just as in the 80s and 90s and on for 21 years, the "Fresh Food People" banner was very much a rallying flag. This is really in a very short period of time, so planted that in the minds and hearts of our people, and I have the pleasure of going out to our <mark type="inaudible" /> store to have a look at this new brand in action at the store and it looked absolutely sensational about during the day, but at night with their new LED signage it really was a beacon, it looked absolutely fabulous.</p>
          <p>Our Cards Program with Everyday Rewards has been very successful. Now just on 4 million cards out there, 2.5 million odd cards are registered, the vast majority of those registered online. And we now commenced new compensations with our customers in a way that wasn't possible before and new offers over and above the petrol offer that are being engineered through this card. It has been a terrific response from our customers, the feedback we've got in replacing the paper petrol dockets that we're forever getting lost or damaged or whatever being replaced by card has been very, very well received by our customers.</p>
          <p>Later today, we are going to launch a credit card, Everyday Money, and the issuer is HSBC. We are very proud to have them there. They've obviously got other retail partners around the world and their scheme partner of course is MasterCard, a very widely accepted scheme right around the world.</p>
          <p>You'll note that, it has very latest of safety including encryption involved in the physical benefits of the card. And it's going to be a card that has a very rich reward basically one point for every dollar that you spend outside of Woolies, two points for every dollar you spend inside the Woolworths Group and if you buy slick products three basis points or three points per dollar.</p>
          <p>What we have seen then is that, we've attracted a number of families without trying to influence their behavior and looked at their spend on their credit card, both inside and outside of Woolworths, and on a quarterly basis without changing behavior and influencing behavior, we think that the average family will get &#x2013; or a average credit card user will get about $70. But for those that regularly use their credit cards and do shop at Woolies not exclusively that actually goes up well over $100, so we can easily see people will be getting $500 worth of Everyday Money shopping cards per annum as a reward for shopping within the Woolworths Group. So very, very rich rewards.</p>
          <p>And even one family that we checked at basically didn't use their credit card much, didn't shop at Woolies at all, still earned $30 enough to buy two kids outfits at BIG W. So this is very rich. The interest rate is at the low end at 18.99% presently, transferring balances 5.99%, special offer &#x2013; carry-forward between now and February the 1st on all purchases, 0%; so Christmas shopping, back-to-school shopping, a great offer.</p>
          <p>And the zero fee for applying in the first year and $49 thereafter, and a whole host of other things that we'll talk about a little bit later, that are part of a very rich but very affordable financial offering and we are the first of a number of offerings in this space. The team have done an absolutely outstanding job with their partners in delivering this product.</p>
          <p>BIG W; the repositioning has continued extremely well. Seven quarters of positive sales growth. We've invested once again in price and maintained a very strong leadership in the price position in the marketplace. 16 stores refurbished, three the previous the year and a further 15 stores planned for refurbishment in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Supply chain; we're continuing to get the benefits. The DCs that have been in place are well and truly delivering over and above their business case. Brisbane is in its commissioning year, is doing particularly well, of light, and we are about to &#x2013; in fact we have started both DCs, so we're now in the receiving and spec stage in Sydney and Melbourne actually had its first receipt of stock yesterday.</p>
          <p>In the near future, we'll talk about investments in distribution centers in Dick Smith and in BIG W and also a further Liquor DC in Queensland and further investment in DCs in New Zealand and we'll be announcing some investment in the Tasmanian marketplace to come. More importantly, the intellectual property that we've been able to get as a result of our experience in supermarkets has been well and truly leveraged across our other businesses.</p>
          <p>Okay. The financial results; always good to look back over an extended period of time so here is the last year since the turn of the century and you can see that for each of our long-term strategic targets that we have managed to get ourselves a tick for the eighth year in a row or actually it's the ninth year in a row, isn't it?</p>
          <p>Profit after taxes, we mentioned before, up 25.7 to 1.6 billion, a couple of one-offs there, obviously the 53rd week helped a little bit. We had some profit on sale of some real estate but even without that it was a good result by the team. CODB, for the first time we're under 20 basis points. It's always a strategic milestone for a business that is in the high-volume, low-margin business group they say it would be under 20%, we managed to do that and it's down 43 basis points. Obviously in that we've got the profit on the sale of certain properties and also the costs of both the Brisbane supply chain transition and also the establishment of the one &#x2013; the credit card and also the petrol card. When we take both the positive and negatives out of that, it's still 38 basis points. And if we take out petrol and hotels &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; it still is over 20 basis points. So a great result by the team.</p>
          <p>Gross margin; we've got two numbers as we've decided to do going forward including and excluding hotels, and you can see that as a business we actually increased a little bit excluding our hotels &#x2013; putting hotels back in, it's decreased a little bit by 2 basis points.</p>
          <p>More importantly, what we would like to do is look back to 2004 and indicate despite the fact that we've actually improved our starting margin with private label, global sourcing, direct-to-store delivery, improvement in shrinkage, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, we've taken over that period of time basically 100 basis points ahead of our gross margin delivering great value to our customers.</p>
          <p>Dividends per share; we've announced 48-cent final dividend, so full year is 92, up 24.3%. The payout ratio is in line with previous year at 69%.</p>
          <p>Supermarket division had a very strong result, <mark type="inaudible" /> team delivered great sales of 10.9. Gross margin was up just slightly four basis points, we put several $100 million into price reinvestment with getting to state based price groups and also some positions that we took on private label.</p>
          <p>CODB down 32 basis points, which was a terrific result given the enormous number of refurbs that we did during the year. So the underlying cost of doing business reduction <mark type="inaudible" /> strip out the additional cost of the refurb program was just a fantastic effort.</p>
          <p>So EBIT, the combination of two of those, 36 basis points improvement, and in dollar terms up 18.8. We're going to continue to reinvest in that business going forward. Inflation last year was 2.9, the previous year in '07 was 3.5; and we opened 30 new supermarkets.</p>
          <p>Petrol; a really challenging year, three of the four quarters, prices significantly higher. The average <mark type="inaudible" /> motors actually went down probably in the region of 4 to 5%, on most weeks. Our comp sales increased by 11%, obviously reflecting the higher pump prices over the year. Our comp volumes in a market that was probably shrinking to have positive at 0.6, I think, was just a great reflection of the strength of our offer.</p>
          <p>Our EBIT decreased by 1.2% to 81.9 million. EBIT margins were lower at 1.5% versus 1.7 <mark type="inaudible" />. We actually made some strategic decisions at key times when petrol was going through $1.30, $1.40, $1.50 to hang on to the 0.98 of the earlier decile for as long as we could, so that we actually reestablished in the minds of the consumers that we really were understanding that this was a hard time for them, and wherever we could we hung on to that number for an extended period of time. The EBIT equates to 1.8 cents per liter sold, in 2007 it was 1.9 cents per liter.</p>
          <p>More importantly, a little later this year, we've retrofitted all of our pumps with epump and for those cardholders who have new cards, they'll be able to drive into our service stations. They'll be able to wave the card, and it will recognize the fact that they are a cardholder. It will search the database to see what discounts that they've got available, you'll be able to fill up, and then you will just tap and then you'll go. The discount will be automatically applied to your petrol. We think that, particularly in our really, really busy service stations, having the ability to actually get people in and out quickly will be very, very well received and certainly help congestion at some of our key sites going forward.</p>
          <p>We are very, very excited about this. We have been working on this for, probably best part of 18 months, may be even two years. So now that we have our card out there, we think this is going to be a real turbo charge to our petrol offer.</p>
          <p>In Liquor, we had another great year in our three brands, Dan Murphy's, BWS and the Supermarket attached liquor, 4.7 billion, previous year 4.1. We now have over a thousand liquor outlets and, more importantly, within our business number of great strategies, one of them, of course, is with exclusive and control brands and private label, and I think one of the great examples of this is the recent launch of Platinum Blonde in July. We've had one of the major brewers come to us and ask how we manage to keep the taste in the low-carb beer because no one else has been able to do it and the sales of it has been &#x2013; well, we actually ran out because we actually sold a lot more than we thought that we could to begin with.</p>
          <p>Dan Murphy's has expanded its operations with another 22 stores, up to 89, and we have got the licenses and the sites to go to 155 within the next three years.</p>
          <p>New Zealand Supermarkets. Tough time, particularly in the second half, sales up 7.3, gross margin, particularly with the introduction of private label has -- and global sourcing and a few other things that we have done, have improved by 10 basis points. CODB was tough. We had KiwiSaver and youth wages change in the marketplace. And we also, particularly in the second half and the last quarter in particular, ramped up tremendously our refurb program, so we had a lot of our big guns out of &#x2013; well, under severe refurb there.</p>
          <p>EBIT dropped by 4 basis points to 4.19 and the dollars were up by 6.5. More importantly, we are well on track to have finished all of our systems by about October this year, so that's our store system rollout, our AutostockR rollout, our merchandizing systems, where we replaced three legacy systems that we've been patching up and holding by their chinstraps for last couple of years. We can now decommission those. The Transport Management System, the Warehouse Management Systems, are on their way as well.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we have decided on the way that we'll pay forward with our refurbs, so we've got a version of the 2010 that we are putting into New Zealand, and it's getting great customer reaction so far. Now we have to do &#x2013; what we have to do is to ramp up dramatically. The Homebrand rollout is pretty much finished, we've got a few to go. We are now starting with Naytura, Select Organics, and Freefrom and our general merchandise, some range essentials that are being introduced, and once again they are being met with great customer acceptance.</p>
          <p>BIG W had a terrific year, up 13%, gross margin up 19%. Clearly our mix changes and our global sourcing has helped in that area. Ramping up of the refurbs has certainly meant that a cost of doing business reduction was going to be challenging this year, but we believe it's a great investment for the future. EBIT, nonetheless, improved by 12 basis points and the dollar is up 16.3 &#x2013; 16 as I mentioned before, and we opened nine new stores; very, very happy with the progress the team is making there.</p>
          <p>Hotels; a challenging year with couple of things happening, the smoking bans in three states; and of course, in Victoria we had at Christmas time, a couple of hundred gaming machines had to go back. We finished with gaming comparable sales up 1.6% for the year, and our rating of what is available in the marketplace is that we're probably the only ones that actually had positive gaming comps, which is a terrific endorsement of the team. We finished the year with 271 hotels, nine additions during the year, including the Saturno Group in South Australia and probably most important is the gaming comparable sales in July, where we were very positive, so it was a good start to the year for hotels.</p>
          <p>Consumer Electronics, up 11% for Australia and New Zealand. Gross margin, we invested in a very competitive marketplace. We also took the opportunity to mark down a lot of the ranges that are not going to be part of our strategy going forward, particularly in the bibs and bobs and small appliances and others that are not going to be part of our offer going forward and I'll say it'd be as we opened another 40-odd stores was a little challenging, and the EBIT to sales was down by 76 basis points. The combination of the two and EBIT was down by about $3 million to 68.1.</p>
          <p>I think more importantly, we are on a new beginning with &#x2013; along the same trial that we started the BIG W three years ago and the Supermarkets with the 2010c two years ago. This is the front of our new Hornsby Store, a couple of shots to really show the before and after. And you can see that from a customer experience point of view, it is like chalk and cheese, we've actually changed the range, highlighted a number of categories that are working really well. We've had tremendous sales growth in this particular store, whilst that centered Hornsby hasn't been traveling all that well. This store has been doing really well. A number of weeks we were 40% up on the previous year and other weeks where we've have been doing particularly well.</p>
          <p>So in the next couple of weeks we're back to the board. We want to push the button on <mark type="inaudible" /> and we'll be asking for some capital to do that. And Debra and the team have certainly hit upon both from a financial point of view but more importantly from a customer reception point of view, a formula that will take us through in the medium-sized Dick Smith format.</p>
          <p>Our business in India continues to grow. We have now got 22 opened. There is quite a few opening this year. The wholesale sales went from 25 to $104 million and as we planned, we've expensed all of our expansion of the DCs that we've opened during the year. And that has made a loss of $5 million. We will continue to expense rather than capitalize on any of the expenditure in India going forward.</p>
          <p>I'll now ask Tom to come up and quickly take us through some of the more <mark type="inaudible" /> of the numbers and I'll join you for some follow-up comments.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. I'll just take you through some of the aspects of our balance sheet and cash flow for the year and comment on capital management. Our balance sheet overall remains very strong and in this current financial environment, I think it's a great asset for Woolworths to have going forward.</p>
          <p>Some of the key features; our net investment in inventory was down about $330 million. Our fixed assets and investments were up about $1 billion, which is really the accelerated CapEx offset by depreciation. And we manage to repay just under $300 million in debt during the period and that's reflected in a lower interest cost that we could over the 12-month period. So a very strong position.</p>
          <p>Our cash flow, our EBITDA is up about just under 18%. Our cash after interest and tax is up just on 24% which is very strong. After working capital, we're up about 16% and clearly the kick we got in working capital last year is not as great as the kick we got &#x2013; or the kick we got this year is not as great as kick we got last year but still the 16% is very good increase. $2.6 billion in cash. We spent about $1.7 billion in CapEx as planned, so a very strong result and as I said $300 million repayment in debt.</p>
          <p>Our inventory days down 0.8, very close to our target of one day, which is our ongoing target. With the fluctuating retail market, one of the core skills Woolworths has got with its systems and its disciplines is being able to manage inventory through those retail cycles and I think that 0.8 day reduction is excellent outcome in the current trading environment. So that's a very strong outcome.</p>
          <p>Shareholder payouts; we've paid &#x2013; over the last eight years we've paid back about 5.7 billion to shareholders. And in terms of capital management, as many of you would know, we made our capital structure to ensure that we've got flexibility going forward not only to pursue acquisitions but also to pursue other growth opportunities that we have got just for our own development. With our credit ratings at A- with Standard &amp; Poor's and A3 have been maintained, and that puts us in a really good position that if we need to raise debt going forward for growth opportunities then we can access those markets with reasonably good pricing when we <mark type="inaudible" />. We previously advise the market in 2000 that we do some form of capital management in 2008. However, with basically the equity and the debt markets in quite a lot amount of turmoil right at this point in time, we have decided to defer that. And I think it's prudent to do that. There is no point re-gearing the balance sheet without having certainty as to the cost of debt that you're going to put on your balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We will as always continually assess the share buyback or capital management activity but that will be again in the context of anything we do in terms of acquisitions or in the current capital market environment.</p>
          <p>On the debt side, the U.S. markets are in turmoil, the banks have written off their $500 billion, the second re-impacts could get 1.3 trillion. So it's not the right time to get into the debt market to re-gear our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Return on funds employed up 31.4%. The return on equity is 28.9%, slight increase, and I'll hand back to Mike Luscombe for strategy and growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to give some context to next piece. Project Refresh always had three stages; we talked about each of them in turn. Now, the first one was about reorganizing particularly the Supermarket business into one national business and selling off some of the businesses that <mark type="inaudible" /> was going forward and then tackling the profit and loss line by line and becoming a much more efficient business.</p>
          <p>The second stage was Project Mercury which was developing of the system and logistical expertise within the Supermarket group, along with private label, and a few other initiatives that we had in global sourcing et cetera. And the third one was in fact leveraging that across our existing businesses other than Supermarkets, and of course seeing how that might be applied to other businesses that weren't part out of the Woolworths Group, at the moment.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of what underpins our strategy for growth, we believe that we have got capability in supply chain that sits there with those in the world. We believe that we have very much a low cost culture and we believe also that we've got a tremendous depth of talent right through our business.</p>
          <p>Interesting to note for the second year in a row our management turnover was around about 7 to 8%, and when you take out retirements due to age or ill health then we lost very few people in the last couple of years. We think that those strengths are able to be leveraged, both into our existing businesses to grow organically and also we are continually evaluating how we might grow the group through acquisition. However, we don't want to take away from the fact that our vision is obviously to concentrate in making sure our core business continues to be successful by focusing on all those elements of convenience and price and quality that are important, and why the Woolworths businesses continue to attract more and more customers through their doors.</p>
          <p>Each of the businesses have clear strategies that they're following and they are very much about delivering growth. We have defined plans for space growth in all of our businesses, with confirmed new store and they actually don't in most cases &#x2013; in fact the vast majority of cases &#x2013; contain any cannibalization of material effect.</p>
          <p>We believe, given our market share in all of our businesses, food in Australia about 31%, the rest less than 30, and in New Zealand, that we have an ability to continue to grow market share in all of our businesses. And I think it'll be fair to say that we've got a good record of growth both through the development of new categories, and if you have a look at BIG W for instance, we have introduced the optometry range of offers that are doing particularly well and we are going to roll that out; and of course, new businesses, and Thomas Dux is another good example, that we opened our second store in Paddington, the other week at Five Ways and it is being really, really well received by the local consumer.</p>
          <p>And there is no doubt that given our scale and our reach that we believe that we can leverage that into our goods and services and I think the credit card and other services that will follow past the credit card, clearly leverages that distribution capability that we have. And we also believe that in each of our businesses we have many opportunities to invest in future growth.</p>
          <p>We are in the early stages of evaluating opportunities internationally and today I won't be entertaining any questions as to geography or what particular businesses there may be. But clearly what we are going to do is we are going to be very careful, very prudent, when we do, we'll do it in a confident fashion, but these businesses have to be high volume low margin businesses, so very much nimble. They've got to be well managed and they have to meet the hurdles that we have for all investments. If they don't get the ticks then we won't be doing it. But we think it's a good time to be doing it and we've been doing it in a fashion for a number of years, and of course India and New Zealand are good examples of that, but we obviously believe that it's a good time now to be having a good look.</p>
          <p>We will continue however to invest in price and range and quality within our existing businesses. And in the past year, we invested heavily in all of our businesses in improving our price position. In all of our businesses we will continue with private and control brand and we've just got a couple here for the Supermarkets, within all of our brands BIG W probably other than Petrol we will continue to develop and expand our private labels.</p>
          <p>With our card that we have 'Everyday Rewards' cards and now with our 'Everyday Money' card we will have enormous enhancement availability to actually check behavior that can be compared to what we hear from customers as to their intentions through market research. And it is always interesting to listen to intent and then check through behavior, because it's actually behavior that you want to try and really hone in on in terms of your offering as a retailer.</p>
          <p>We are going to continue to invest in our financial services capability. I'm very happy to say that we now have all the major banks through our switch. And for the first year of operation it operated at amazing speed, number of transactions per second, but more importantly, we had 100% uptime. So, the first time in the history of Woolies that I can remember. Christmas time, Easter time, all those big trading periods we didn't have the credit cards and the <mark type="inaudible" /> system go down because we weren't relying on the third party to do it. So we are very, very happy with our investment in both our people, but more importantly in the infrastructure we put behind our financial services.</p>
          <p>We are going to continue the acceleration of the refurbishment activity in Supermarkets and BIG W and as I mentioned earlier, we are also &#x2013; we'll add to that the Dick Smith stores in the 2009 year, subject to obviously the board approving that. And our CapEx for the coming year will be at around $1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Our global sourcing activity, we've tripled our volume year-on-year. We've now opened a Shanghai office and they cover the Greater Asian area; and in particular, we've moved into not for resale products so we're now getting equipments such as shopping trolleys and others direct from the source and we get both improvements and quality and of course the cost is somewhat better too.</p>
          <p>We also believe as I mentioned earlier that we continue to have a wonderful opportunity to leverage the supply chain expertise that we have in the logistics group as part of our Supermarket offer into other parts of our business and we're doing exactly that.</p>
          <p>The growth plans very similar; they haven't changed in terms of our space rollout for the next couple of years and our long-term targets remain unchanged. So, for those in the room, you are very, very familiar with our commitment for sales and EBIT and EPS and CODB and the maintenance of target of the credit ratings within two credit rating agencies. Of course the EPS one is subject to both acquisition and of course any capital management initiatives that may happen.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of the sales and earnings guidance subject to the fact that discretionary spend obviously continues to be influenced by such things as inflation, fluctuating petrol prices, interest rates and lower confidence levels amongst consumers, our guidance is such that we expect sales for this year to be in the upper single digits. We expect that EBIT will continue to grow faster than sales and the net profit after tax is expected to grow in the range of 11 to 14% on a 52 on 52, or if you take the 52 on 53 then it will be 9 to 12.</p>
          <p>To give you a feeling for how we're going after seven weeks, Australian food, liquor and petrol top line sales after seven weeks were up over 12% and the comps were up over 10. If I split that between food and liquor and petrol, food and liquor was up 8.5 and comp 6.4. So we're running ahead of the fourth quarter numbers. Petrol up 34 and 30% comp. New Zealand a little bit tougher, up 1% and 1.7 comp. BIG W, a great start, 17% and 10% comp. Consumer Electronics up 19.5 and just under 9% comp and Hotels up 2% and just below flat in terms of comp.</p>
          <p>So important however that we don't take that seven weeks and extrapolate that across the year but what I am happy to say is that we've had a good start to the year. The team have worked particularly well. I believe in our businesses particularly in Food that we've grown our market share again and widened the gap on our competitor. In fact the numbers that I see absolutely tell me that.</p>
          <p>So, with that I'm very happy to show a beautiful truck which is a Euro 5 design <mark type="inaudible" /> newest in the country but a great exhibition of our new Food logo.</p>
          <p>So Tom and I would be happy to entertain questions. Thank you. Greg you got your hand up first.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I got one for Tom but obviously I'll address it to you. I'm sort of curious about the decision you're making on capital management? I think I just saw the fixed capital ratio of 2.9 up from 2.7. You appear to be over capitalized. You refer to the stress in the markets which we all acknowledge, yet you don't seem to have any debt rollover that would require immediate attention. So my question is saying like this, your "planetary initiatives" quoting myself by acquisitions surely buying the stock back at $26 would give you a better return than a project like that? And I'm making reference to the fact that you said on the one hand you don't want to go to the debt markets for a buyback but on the other hand you'd be happy to for an acquisition?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> gearing in this period, Greg, I don't think is a smart thing. Other retailers have gone in the market and have come back with ridiculous debt costs. The market &#x2013; there's two issues in raising debt, one is the price and two is the execution risk. So &#x2013; and if you talk to anyone out of the U.S. debt markets and I've done a significant amount of work talking to all the investment banks that are sitting in the U.S. market, they're all saying if you don't have to go to the debt markets right now then don't go. So I think commercially it's a rational decision to sit and wait. But that doesn't mean as things stabilize we're not going to do capital management. I think capital management is something we've done before. And we'll very clearly do again to keep the balance sheet efficient. I'm just saying right now, is probably not the most prudent time to do it. But we've got the capacity; we've got the franking credits. It's not off the table at all. If the debt markets settle themselves out in six months time and we don't do anything else, it will be absolutely back on the agenda.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'd be fair to say we've had lots of really good advice from the assembled scholars in the room and that's probably been 70%, don't do it and 30%, do it. So at this point in time our Board has determined that we'll just hold their products a little longer but that, as Tom said, that doesn't mean that we've ruled it out completely?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that's one implication, you've wouldn't consider undertaking acquisition in the near term also?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Mike. Just in regards to food and liquor margins, you spoke about the level of price investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>You got four?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess if we're looking forward we've got cost of doing business falling by 20 bps at least in regards to some supply chain projects. But when do we start to see a lack of gross margin expansion in terms of rollback benefits no longer coming through, private label penetration starting to moderate and your price investment act actually resulting in EBIT margin starting to be flat lying or possibly, even going down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see it in the immediate future that there's no doubt the rollbacks continue to work for us. We still got quite a way to go. We've got plans in private</p>
          <p>label across all of our business, but in Supermarkets we still believe that there's plenty of room for more private label, not necessarily at the expense of branded product. But we just think that we can do a better job. We've actually made some more space available in our stores by being very, very smart, the way that we've arranged our general merchandise. So, we have actually generated some more space, lineal space in our stores over the last little while and we think that we've actually expanded a little bit but we've reserved room to come back in, with some more private label.</p>
          <p>We've still got &#x2013; with the direct store delivery we've got the BE conversion happening at the moment with the introduction of the new stores. We continue to actually do a lot better with our shrinkage control, and there's still opportunities to continue to do it. We still know that we can &#x2013; we've still got a lot of product that comes from overseas that comes through third parties that we have the potential to do better on.</p>
          <p>So, I would say for the next couple of years, on the growth side there's an opportunity to improve our gross margin. We've been very much dependent on what our view is how reinvestment and price will actually drive volume and there is no great signs to that, you just need to be in retail for a while to really understand that. What we did last year on an annualized basis was for Supermarkets line was a more than a couple of $100 million but on the parts of the year where those decisions came in it was less than 200 but well above 150. And then, of course, we invested in Dick Smith because we had to become a lot more competitive. We invested in BIG W to maintain the gap on others in the marketplace. We invested in petrol because we thought it was a good thing and we certainly invested in price in New Zealand. So, we will continue to do that, but we will continue always to look at ways we can improve our margin and there are 93 ways that you can do that and I've just mentioned probably about five or six, but there are a lot more that can...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will continue to improve &#x2013; as each DC gets more mature, they just become &#x2013; they get into a rhythm and they just become more and more efficient. So, the ones that we've finished for two or more years are now actually ahead of what we have projected to do and all credit to Julie and the team for doing that. Brisbane was a big &#x2013; it was the biggest one we had to do and it's now heading towards its business case on schedule to hit its business case.</p>
          <p>We got our two liquor DCs that we're opening and another one that will open in Queensland, and we also will announce an investment in Tasmania in due course that will bring us into the 21st century there, because we're &#x2013; got 1960s at the moment, maybe not even that in Tasmania, but I mean we've got fantastic team there, but we really haven't given them the facilities that they need to be really efficient.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and in regards to New Zealand Supermarkets, I mean, have you lost market share in New Zealand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the last quarter, up until the third quarter, we were holding and getting a little bit better, but as we started refurbishing some really &#x2013; some of our big gun stores, we actually lost a little bit of market share in that last quarter <mark type="inaudible" /> it actually &#x2013; particularly in the last two months, as they've really gotten to the depths of being disemboweled, but we'll get that back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just looking forward, you've got a 2010 style format opening there, where do you sit in regards to your brands, in terms of what they do -- and ultimately are you going to get a scenario like you do in Australia where you've got Woolworths that can operate in less affluent &#x2013; more affluent areas, so you actually don't have a value offer and premium offer, you have one offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. We'll ultimately head down that track. We haven't made a great deal of secret about that. We are actually converting right now a couple of Foodtown stores in affluent areas to count them and the initial response has been terrific. So when we look across our business we've done really well in the South Island, We've done really well in the <mark type="inaudible" />, it's been that Auckland market where we've got the Foodtown brand that's been our biggest challenge and it's probably the area where we've got most of the refurbs happening at the moment, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just in regards to Consumer Electronics, you spoke at this forum last -- probably six months ago, that you wanted to be number one in that position. One, do you need an acquisition to do it, and secondly, is the new Dick Smith format, the small format, the way forward, and what are your intentions with PowerHouse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's take the first question. We still have an ambition to be a lot bigger than we are at the moment. The format that I've shared for Homsby is for the medium-sized format, so that's the 400 to 500 square meter format that we have, a vast majority of the Dick Smith stores. The PowerHouse, we've got a version that I haven't made public that we are working on. We're getting good results out of that, and we are very hashed about the whole darn thing. We've got a couple of stores that we're opening in Victoria in the next half that will look a little different to the normal PowerHouses, and when we are comfortable, we'll invite you and take you through it.</p>
          <p>We will make this business, a really good business. I have been delighted with the leadership that <mark type="inaudible" /> a fresh new team in the business. We have invested in clearing out some of the debris, in terms of stock, of yesteryear and we are going to invest in the supply chain and we're going to invest in the new store format. And the results that we're getting out of the first one and where we're retrofitting some of changes in Rash and others in the existing stores without refurbishing are also getting some good results, and I think July's a good example of that. So, thank you Shawn.</p>

          <p>Hi Mike. Craig Woolford from Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question about acquisition criteria; have you, or will you, look through the site in terms of your return on capital type hurdle rates or will you encapsulate the higher cost of debt funding in terms of any acquisitions that you make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, you know any acquisition has to take into account the cost of &#x2013; if we have to borrow; we'll need to do that. And we've already recalibrated our internal investment hurdles to take into account, any new debt that we need to take on board. Interesting to look at New Zealand for instance, and we just completed now two years, and by the time you take the reported number that you see for New Zealand we take into account the &#x2013; if they aren't stores we've bought, we take into account this &#x2013; the buying benefits that we've got in Australia and New Zealand, and we take into account a few other synergies that we haven't talked about publicly.</p>
          <p>The return on the investment, both the initial acquisition price plus the capital we've put into New Zealand, and the capital we've put into the apparel stores here, exceeds <mark type="inaudible" /> rate. There is no doubt we can improve it, but we're very comfortable that we're actually getting good return on our investment in New Zealand, but once again I'll say we've got a lot of work to do still. We have got to invest in some DCs there, but the team there have done a fabulous job. They have been operating the business walking around and having open-heart surgery, and have maintained good momentum in the business expect for the last quarter when we've said, right, this is the format we are going to refurbish in. Let's push the button, and unfortunately for Pete that meant that some of his real big guns that have been delivering went under the knife in a big way. But they are coming back and those that have been repicked &#x2013; the ones that you've relaunched, what percentage you've been getting up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>14, 13%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>13% up, so we're pretty happy with the numbers -- big store for us to begin with. The other thing that Pete is doing is that, in the stores that we're not going to get to refurb, some of the ones that are really crummy old &#x2013; wasn't able to be replaced under the previous ownership, we're actually going back in and refixturing those stores to get much better range into the stores and some of those are showing double-digit growth as well. But it's a journey we're on but we know what we have to do and we just need to be patient. We bought this business to stay there, not to turn it into something to sell.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just so we don't misinterpret the lack of capital management, is there any guidance you can give in terms of size of acquisitions that you've &#x2013; maximum size of acquisitions that you would consider making; obviously you are keeping your powder dry, potentially for acquisitions?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I clearly cannot &#x2013; I use my words very carefully. We're going to be prudent, and we're going to do all of our homework and we certainly might put at risk the value that's been created at Woolworth's over successive decades, particularly in the last decade. We understand that the people here in this room represent people that have had faith in Woolworth's and invested their money and we're certainly not going to do anything silly or rash with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of capital &#x2013; CapEx, capital expenditure in <mark type="inaudible" /> business, that was increased quite substantially in the '09 guidance. I just wanted to understand, is this the new run rate, is there something else that you can explain as to why that was up about 26%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There's a couple things in there. There is the &#x2013; included in there is the Quicksilver initiatives that we're doing in BIG W, which is revamping all of the supply chain, plus, there is some environmental initiatives that we're doing across the network that are in there. The other major <mark type="inaudible" /> about bits and pieces so we -- put them into your run rate or take them out, it's really up to you but, yeah, Quicksilver was more once-off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for instance the signage, we've always had really good advice that we should change Sofa to Wollies, and my research just says do it, but until now investing in the capital to change all the signage just didn't make sense. But now that we've taken the view that we can actually reduce our energy consumption by going to LED and we've got a new logo, it was a great decision but signs, even though we'll get those manufactured elsewhere directly and bring them in, they still cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the run rate Craig, we've accelerated refurbishments this year and &#x2013; last year and this year, greatly ahead of what we normally do. So, logic would say if everything had remained the same, CapEx would drop down to a much lower rate going forward. So that's &#x2013; that way we look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I was certainly trying to get a sense, it was running at about $1 billion priceless step back in refurbs but some of those stay in business numbers have increased in the last 12 months -- just want to know, are they ongoing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We think that the customers are a lot more demanding of up-to-date clean, and neat, and well-maintained stores. And we think the fact that we've actually put a lot of effort into doing that, not just the refurbishment but in-between refurbs.  New trolleys and a whole list of other things, really pays dividends. <mark type="inaudible" /> that refurbish the store and do nothing for next few years. So a lot of our focus groups works said, make sure you keep your stores up to, up to, up to the mark and that's mean, obviously we're going to spend a little bit more on day-to-day stuff.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>All our internal tracking, including, you know we did the special one around on that timeframe on the 500 best selling items. All the information I've got, by our own professional check is that we're actually cheaper across the basket. The government made a commitment to put it in &#x2013; we should let them do it. They need some assistance to get it right. We know that with their own checks, we have to send around about 15% back for recheck, because parts get moving the level down. Mistakes get made.</p>
          <p>It's interesting that we booked one state price, but we ended up with different outcomes and <mark type="inaudible" /> national price, and they just don't vary, and yet when you look at the grocery baskets, supposedly on the same products, it goes up and down like that. So, there's work to do done, and for some consumers it's going to be a benefit. So, the government made a commitment, we should get on with it. But I think we need to work in the background to help them to make it a more meaningful tool for consumers. Grant?</p>

          <p>Look, you just need to keep in mind, 53 versus 52. We had a profit on sale. As we paid down debt, you would have noticed, our interest build came down during the year. It ticked up a little bit as we started the refurbishment. This coming year, our interest bill will tick-up again as we get into refurb, in a big way with that Capex.</p>
          <p>So, when you take those three out, you know, the maths that I have done says that it's in line with the sales in previous years, et cetera. So, 1% I think is about $15 million or something like that. You know we made &#x2013; it was &#x2013; what was the profit on...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess as well. But I guess just to understand, say, you wouldn't be expecting any dilution in the roughly out of Supermarkets, for example, with the capital that's going into it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of the capital expenditures has started in the second half of '08, will be ramped up in '09, and the benefits of that will really flow through in the next couple of years after that because you don't get it straight away as you know, takes a while for the sales to ramp back up. So I think we are pretty comfortable, but we don't want to have earnings guidance on our earning guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is no great mystery on that, it's just that it's very difficult because if you have a hotel, you have the hotel, you also have a <mark type="inaudible" /> on it. You've got three attached hotels and quite often you got a big block of land at the back, which is suitable for redevelopment.

          <p>Just had a question, we think about this year is the first year without the impact of acquisitions for a little while and really you've essentially going to 11 to 14% momentum, is that the way &#x2013; is that &#x2013; should we be viewing that as a realistic longer term top growth in absence of any other major acquisitions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is it. If you hacking back to the targets in the absence of acquisitions that that is their long term running rate, so sales <mark type="inaudible" /> etcetera, etcetera, so yes we haven't changed that.

        <plist>
          <p>And just looking more specifically at the Supermarket business, I've seen some data which indicate people are shopping less often, but doing bigger shops when they do, bit more of a shift away from the top up shopping, are you seeing anything like that?</p>

          <p>Yeah, and with the credit card obviously outside of our division. We've spent a lot of time while we didn't rush into this and making sure that we design something that gives us the greatest benefit in understanding our customers' behavior and then tailing the offer to them. The temptation was many years ago just to rush in and do cheap and nasty, but Richard and his team have done a marvelous job in putting a strategy together and now they are putting &#x2013; implementing that strategy. And we'll have more to talk about in subsequent releases about what we're filing and what we're seeing. We also believe that some marvelous opportunity for us to work a lot closer with our key suppliers to share some of our learnings and help them with &#x2013; combining with us to deliver better offers to our customer. Some of the earlier things that Richard and the team have done with some tag at the marketing have given us amazing results in &#x2013; people went shopping in certain categories and given them incentive to actually shop in those categories, and the behavior change has been amazing. I would not believe that was possible but anyway, the numbers don't lie.</p>

          <p>Phillip Kimber from Goldman JBWere. Just a question on the offshore expansion. I know you can only talk in general terms, but obviously depending on whether these risks can go up quite significantly and in the past, you've had a pretty good track record with partnerships, joint venture arrangements. Should we be thinking along those lines or are all options on the table for offshore expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think without going into any detail, one should assume that when we do it we'll make a prudent decision on the best relationship, so it could be any of those that you mentioned, it will be the right decision for the particular occasion. But one that very much takes into account country risk etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one other one was really, back in Australia there is a category that's quite big that you're not playing in, but you're close to the edges of in terms of white goods, is that a market that is attractive to you and if it is, can you access it in your current footprint, I mean why couldn't BIG W, for example, expand more meaningful...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think it's probably a category that in a background we're doing a lot of work in the online space and Rich and his team &#x2013; and we think that white goods is a good candidate for virtual shopping as oppose to filling up their stores with lots and lots of washing machines and fridges etcetera. And it's being &#x2013; it's not a great &#x2013; not a great regulation because Tesco and Wal-Mart and others are doing it very successfully in other marketplaces.</p>

          <p>Our first question comes from David Errington from Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. it's Silvia Spadea. Sorry David had to hit off to the <mark type="inaudible" />, but just a couple of questions, if I may, Mike. Firstly, you've talked about your cost of doing business being impacted by your store refurbishments and <mark type="inaudible" /> these refurbs that would impact your capital cost, but how exactly does it impact your cost of doing business and by how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I won't count it how much, but clearly what happens there are two main effects. There are certain things that are not capitalized, that are part of the refurbishment. And the second point is that during the refurb, your sales go down but what we don't do is <mark type="inaudible" />. So, it's important that we keep their team engaged and they don't suffer a loss of income during the refurbs. So when our sales go down, we look after our people and make sure that they are part of the deal. So we do a lot of work to make sure that we just don't refurbish, but still we do up to start for <mark type="inaudible" /> small stuff at the same time. So I know there are quite a number of other areas that fold into the area of cost about you're not getting equipment there and rest of other things that we don't capitalize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just secondly, on the Capex, I mean you said that you're going to be spending 1.9 billion. I think it was in '09 assuming you guys have a cost of funds <mark type="inaudible" /> tax. Should we be looking for an increase in EBIT of at least 150 to 2 million on the back of these Capex spend. I mean is that the right way to look at this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should use your model to come to the conclusion. We wouldn't give the price down to that data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just in terms of your credit cards, do you see that being a profit rather this new card or is it more tool to drive customer loyalty in key stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We fully intend this to be a profit center. And in fact, we have every intention of not &#x2013; in the first four year, we expected to be positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the first four year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just roughly, with your transition costs of 31 million this year, when will those supply chain cost saves going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we'll always &#x2013; we'll always have them. So, we're finishing with Brisbane and now we've got the two liquor day sales, we got another one coming. We have transition cost with Big W and Dick Smith. We'll have New Zealand, we'll obviously have transition cost when we start replacing those DC, so it's an ongoing thing.</p>
          <p>I think the important thing is that what we're saying is we got these additional costs, we haven't capitalized them. They are part of what you see; we haven't put them to some &#x2013; against some provision. We've actually expensed a lot, we're just being transparent and saying, you know what we've done this new thing. There is an additional cost for this one this year, but it's part of the overall result that you're seeing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, morning Michael and Tom. Just got a question regarding the rebranding of Safeway to Woolworths. Just in the past, I understood that one of the reasons for not doing that has been potential impact of sales. So I guess first question is that true? And secondly, if it is true what you think the likely impact will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will be positive. Bill Pratt, I was talking to Bill the other day. And he was saying that &#x2013; he actually told the U.S. Board that they should change, when we brought Safeway he told when we should change, when he left the Board in '95. Our market research which we've done every couple of years, as always said, the vast majority don't care. There is a group &#x2013; small group that says, yeah, you should do it and the other small group that says don't do it. And people recognize that we are part of the Woolworths group, Safeway, that we are full of Woolworths' products, the ends are the same, except the word changes. And quite frankly, the only reason that we &#x2013; three years ago that we got <mark type="inaudible" /> then we looked at the cost of doing the signage, we said, what we'll like. And then now with the new logo and moving to lower cost signage with LED, it's a smart thing to do rather than change and then change the name later, we should do it now. Our staff &#x2013; you know we did a lot of work making sure that particularly the long term Safeway staff including me won't going to be upset by the change. I passed muster quite a bit, but anyway. You know quite frankly, people don't actually look at the name over the door, they talk about their Supermarket and they talk about their people that they shop with and their store and their car park, they don't actually say, it's Woolworths or Safeway, so we actually believe that we are going to get a positive benefit out of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess at the EBIT line as well, would you see cost doing business benefits with the &#x2013; if the brand gives you private label as well as through marketing and those sorts of cost lines as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We already took the decision not to have any private label brand at Safeway. But certainly in the marketing area and in the long term refurbishment program with not having to do separate signage et cetera, there is no doubt we will make some cost savings. But you know quite frankly, there is not a huge amount of money in it. It always was &#x2013; look it's a right thing to do but let &#x2013; can we afford to do the signage at the moment, now that we are going to do the signage right across the business, just makes sense to do at the same time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions in regards to the Hotels business, the second half result was very strong and driven by savings and cost of doing business, can you just run through, I guess, some of the programs that you're introducing there in the second half?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>It looked they are no great secret, they are the same programs that we run in all of their businesses and once again its about leveraging our IP across the group, so smarter roistering of playful tackling all the line items, making available the synergies of the purchasing pair of the Woolworths Group, the various cost items within the business, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, purchasing pair of energy. So there is a whole raft of airs, there is no one big ticket item that you'd say well here it was, but what I would say, it's a credit to one, particularly Bruce Mathieson, Jr., who now heads up the operational side of the business under his father Bruce, Sr. and he has done a marvelous job with his team in the past year in tackling what was going to be a very difficult year for hotels, he really is an outstanding young executive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess, flying on from that, is there any reason why we wouldn't say that benefits flows through to the '09 year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look we'll continue in all of our businesses. We always look to improve their costs. The quantum in the hotels, it's a huge number this year to say that we might do another 170 basis points in the coming years &#x2013; that'll be a huge challenge. I wouldn't expect that they would replicate that this year.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning Michael. Could you just comment on LD and do you see them as a direct competitor and the how do you count to the potential threat of LD getting to 500 stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, LD is a direct competitor. You know all their public statements have been that people shop in a range of alternatives &#x2013; not just supermarkets &#x2013; not just <mark type="inaudible" /> but convenient stores and specialist stores. So they are part of the competitors. They have been very successful in opening new stores; at the same time, clearly <mark type="inaudible" /> enjoyed really great growth for all the years that they have been there. We think that we have a different offer to royalty, I note that you know LD <mark type="inaudible" /> have in the U.K. market for 10 years or more Richard <mark type="inaudible" />. Yes, 20 years. And they are still combined less than 10% of the marketplace. So there is a place there for them. They're really great retailers, they are certainly, on a global scale a bigger retailer than Woolworths, but competition is good for us. They keeps us on our toes, that keeps us fresh and focused on the customers. And the last think that I'd really like to work in as an industry where you don't have vibrant competitors because it becomes pretty dull and boring.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just second question, there's simple one. In terms of your financial services business would that be reported as a separate segment in terms of the earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in the early stages, when we <mark type="inaudible" /> where we believe it, it's many fold of marketplace will do so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, cool, thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>I would like to advice that there no more phone questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Any final. Once again, thank you very much for you attendance today. I know it's a really busy day for you. I hope the other Aussie firms have got really good results because I'm very proud of the strong results that the teams delivered here this year. Thanks again for your time.</p>
