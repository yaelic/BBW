          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is really a pleasure to be here with you today and to comment our results of 2010 that I believe it is to us, it was good. It was really good. We had a lot of tonnage during 2010 to recover production, to keep our costs under control, to face a new price systems in the market, and I think we've overcome all the situation. I'd like to say to my colleagues in San Paolo and Tito in Canada that I think we can be proud of the results that we finally we are presented to the market today.</p>
          <p>I would like to ask Guilherme to make comments about the results, and later on, I will make my statement. First, 2010 is the best. I think we &#x2013; it was good. That is the best. I think we have to be focusing 2011. That seems to be a very good year, will be a very good year for us. At least in the &#x2013; in January, Februarys, everything is going very well and the trend is positive. Depends on the situation, the conflict that we are seeing in Libya, in the Middle East, and how these kind of event can really jeopardize the year for everybody. But I'm still very optimistic, and I &#x2013; we are working to make a better year in 2011.</p>
          <p>Guilherme, if you can, please, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Roger. In fact, 2010, we had an extraordinary performance. On the operational side, we had an all-time high production. Iron ore of 308 million tons, 29% above last year. 49 million tons of pellets, more than double of last year. 6.9 million tons of coal, 27% higher. 14 million tons of bauxite, 15% higher.</p>
          <p>Caraj&#xE1;s surpassed the 100 million tons threshold for the first time, producing 101.1 millions tons in 2010. Also, we had a strong recovery in nickel output since the end of the period of strike, being 58% higher in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the financial side, we also have all-time high figures. We had record revenues of $45 billion, 21% higher than the last highest figure of 2008. We had also a record earnings before interest and taxes of $21.7 billion, 38% higher than 2008, and a 47.9% EBIT margin which is &#x2013; which was the highest in 2010 among our peers. Our EBITDA was $26 billion, also a record, and our net earnings was $17.3 billion, the highest ever in the mining industry.</p>
          <p>Before going ahead, I would like to say that Vale has developed several initiatives during the last years to reduce fixed costs. Therefore, we managed to keep our costs under control, even with the current environment of pressures around &#x2013; arising from a strong demand of labor, equipment, spare parts, and services. The fourth quarter cost increase was due to effects of movement to gain exposure to the cycles and one-off effects, such as resumption of Canadian assets, increase in purchase of iron ore and nickel products from third parties, sales increases, consolidation of an acquired fertilizer assets, start-up of projects coming on stream, and personnel presented a one-off effect coming from the bonus payment in November due to a two-year agreement with workers made in 2009.</p>
          <p>Therefore, it's important to manage &#x2013; to mention that we managed to implement a reduction in personnel and material costs in 2010 against 2009, when we excluded the volume and exchange rate effects. Therefore, we diluted our fixed costs.</p>
          <p>On page 7, we see our financial performance in the second half of 2010, where Vale is the number one among our peers. We had the highest earnings before interest and taxes of $15 billion. We have the highest earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization of $17.7 billion. We have the highest EBIT margin of 51.7%, and the highest net earnings of $12 billion. Our peers include BHP, Rio TInto, Xstrara and Anglo American.</p>
          <p>On page 8, we see that after interest and taxes, we generated $20 billion of operational cash flow. We increased our net debt in $3.6 billion. We made divestures of $700 million, and that was &#x2013; the source of cash was used on $12.7 billion in cap expenditures, $6.7 billion in acquisition, and $5 billion was returned to shareholders, being $3 billion in dividends and $2 billions in repurchase of shares.</p>
          <p>Therefore we continue to build our growth platform guided by a long-term view of minerals and metals fundamentals. Our investments in 2010 was, as mentioned, $19.4 billion, being $12.7 billion in CapEx, $6.7 billion in acquisitions, a figure significantly higher than the previous years.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we delivered six new projects, Caraj&#xE1;s additional 20, Oman pelletizing plants, On&#xE7;a Puma nickel plants, Tres Valles copper mine, Bay&#xF3;var mine in Peru of phosphate rock, and our steel plant, CSA in Rio Janeiro. Projects recently approved by the board of directors includes Caraj&#xE1;s S11D of 90 million tons; Caraj&#xE1;s additional 40 million tons; Simandou phase 1 of 15 million tons; and our distribution center in Malaysia, Teluk Rubiah, of 30 million tons.</p>
          <p>On page 12, we see that from 2011 to 2015, we'll deliver 33 major projects that will contribute to a significant value creation for our shareholders and that will double the size of the company.</p>
          <p>Looking backwards, Vale was number one shareholder value creation among large mining companies. If we're looking at the last 10 years, we deliver total shareholder return of 38.2% a year, and looking at the last five years, 29.5% a year, higher than our peers.</p>
          <p>Our strong cash flow generation so allowed us to invest the $19 billion that I mentioned, and also deliver a $5 billion return to the shareholders, and also to deleverage our balance sheet. Our average debt period grew from 9.1 to 9.6 months, and our average cost of debt decreased from 5.5% to 4.9%. As I mentioned, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio came from 2.5 at the end of 2009, to 1 time at the end of 2010. And also, it's worth mention that we had, at the end of the year, almost $10 billion in cash. It's also worth mentioning that of more or less 60% of this cash position are allocated in reais, that besides being a hedge for our costs in reais, it also earns a current Brazilian CDI rates at 11% a year.</p>
          <p>On page 15, we start our outlook. That looks very promising for the next year. Industrial products &#x2013; global industrial productions, we ramp it at the end of year. And on page 17, you see leading indicators for industrial production also increasing. The purchase manufacturing index reaching 57, and the new orders over inventories ratios reaching 1.18.</p>
          <p>We think that the global growth continue to be supported by strong fundamentals. Monetary policy will continue to be accommodative. Fast-growing consumption expenders of emerging economies and the U.S. We will have recovery of corporate investments, now that companies are deleveraged, had strong balance sheets again, and are capable to pursue the strong CapEx. We have also developing economies' recovery and emerging markets' growth sustainability.</p>
          <p>Inflation, that's been worried. We would like to say that we think that the effect inflation will be temporarily because it's mainly because of energy and food. So we don't think that the currently inflation means a trend looking ahead.</p>
          <p>On the short term, we expect that the global economy will continue to grow above its long-term trend. And on page 21, we'll see that the global carbon steel output has regained momentum following the growth path of global industry production. So in global steel output already surpassed the previous peak. This is also led mainly by China, which you can see, that also surpassed the previous peak in January 2011.</p>
          <p>This increasingly steel output was reflected in iron ore price. So strong steel production growth and a tight supply of iron ore underpin the price increase, as we can see on page 22.</p>
          <p>In face of a tight supply of iron ore, China has been accessing an increasing number of small-scale supplier, showing that the tightness of the market will probably continue in the next three to four years. So because no major projects are coming onstream, capacity must increase to meet the repletion. Chinese production failed to accelerate, and Indian exports losing steam. So as you can see on the chart on page 24, India exports with &#x2013; is losing &#x2013; are losing ground, coming from 25% in 2005, to more or less 15% in 2010. The increase in relative scarcity of iron units is driving the upward long-term trends for the iron ore prices, as you can see on page 25.</p>
          <p>Turning to the nickel, global stainless steel production reached 7.8 million tons in fourth quarter 2010, implying a 23.4% growth in 2010, it's highest ever record annual expansion. This reflected on page 27 on the behavior of the nickel price, due the strong demand stemming from the stainless steel application and also non-stainless steel applications. Different from steel and copper, nickel intensity of emerging markets is still converging to the level of advanced economy, indicated a high-growth potential for the future, as you can see on page 28.</p>
          <p>On page 29, we see copper prices reaching all-time highs against a backdrop of strong demand and structural supply constraints for these raw material.</p>
          <p>Moving to fertilizers on page 30, the surge in grain prices has raised farming profitability, stimulating the recovery in fertilizer demand. So corn as &#x2013; on a very high level, is also soybeans, as all other agribusiness prices.</p>
          <p>So in page 31, we see the recovery in potash prices varying from the lows in the middle 2010.</p>
          <p>So before the question-and answer sessions, I would like to hand over to our CEO, Mr. Roger Agnelli. Please.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Guilherme. Well, as you saw, the year of 2010 wasn't a bad year. As you see, that was a good year, a very good year for the company. Today, operationally speaking, we are doing very well. I think the company is in the best moment of its history. Everything is going well. We are improving all kinds of operations and standards and incorporations. The company's gained in terms of speed.</p>
          <p>We are right now implementing big projects among the world that we are proud, that we have people in who have expertises to implement these projects in a very good way. But one thing that I'm really very proud is that, besides or behind the numbers that you are seeing, we are doing a terrific, a fantastic job with our communities. In Brazil, in Africa, Indonesia. Of course we have a lot of &#x2013; to improve. Still, we have a lot of &#x2013; to improve, but we are doing very well. I think there is no other company in the mining industry doing what we are doing in terms of community. Nobody in the industry is reducing CO2 emission, revegetating, reforestating and even reducing the usage of water, as Vale is doing. So I'm very proud that we are, every year, every single month, we are improving a lot in terms of sustainability.</p>
          <p>The company is well &#x2013; very well seen by the communities, by the society. We are supporting the development of local people. We are giving them alternative to make a income. It's improving the standard of living of these communities. So I think Vale is in a very good track. I think we are really, operationally speaking, in a very good moment.</p>
          <p>For 2011 also, we are going to see increasing iron ore output, in copper, in met coal, in potash, in phosphate, in nickel. So in all our operations, in all our segments, we are going to see increasing production. If the price remains as the same level that is it today, I think 2011 will be a very, very good year for Vale and for our shareholders. I'm very confident that. Of course, we are going to see a lot of challenges, a lot of problems, and I'm very confident that we are going to overcome all these challenges.</p>
          <p>Again, I'm very happy that the company is committed to do everything that we have been doing, plus we are concerned about the sustainability of the company. And again, I don't see anybody in the same level as we are today in terms of sustainability. I'm very proud. I think we'll &#x2013; Vale is be recognized today as a trendy company in all countries that we are operating. And we are promising a lot of things, but we are delivering everything. Every single promise that we are making, we are delivering results.</p>
          <p>And the results are really amazing, are very good. If you go to Mozambique today, the country's a completely different country. Even if you go to the north of Brazil, you're going to see the communities working with us, supporting us. If you go to Indonesia, I think we have a lot of to improve there in Indonesia, but we are going to improve a lot there in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>In Canada, I met the governor of central bank of Canada yesterday, and he said that Vale is very well known, very well received by the society, by the community. Even though we had a long, long strike there in the Sudbury operations and Tito is doing a very good job there to overcome and to keep our people motivated in Canada.</p>
          <p>So, what I can say is that, these are these, numbers are numbers. We delivered reasonable results. 2011, we are keep &#x2013; working hard to improve wherever we have space or room to improve. And I think we have a company that is committed to make every day a better day, and bring the company in the position that the company deserves to be. I think in terms of operations, we are one of the best, if not the best. And in the end of 2011, we like you to celebrate that. We are going to be best mining company in the world, and to be the largest one. I think we are in the right track. This is it. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations on the results. 2011 is looking that is going to be much stronger, so we are looking forward to seeing your results for this year. I have two questions. The first one is related to the growth in iron ore volumes for the year. As you did in your standard, you expect to see an increase in iron ore production or volumes of 5% to 6%. Where do you think that you're going to sell these iron ore if all of this is going to China? And if that's the case, do you think that there could be any kind of downward pressure in the spot market because of these higher volumes that you're selling to China? And that's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is related to cost pressures. We are seeing across the board that commodity prices are leading to a higher inflation, and we already saw that in your results, your numbers showed some cost inflation in your operations. So just wanted to know what are you looking in terms of cost inflation for this year? Can you talk how that you have one of most aggressive growth pipelines in the industry? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Felipe. Martins is speaking. We believe that additional production could be sold worldwide. If you look what's going on in iron ore market of today, all the main markets are improving. Euro zone is improving, not talking only about German, but other countries are improving. We having many customers that have their blast furnace idle, deciding to come up in production again.</p>
          <p>Japanese market is also doing well. Korean market is doing well. Even Brazil is improving. So &#x2013; and China is China, okay. We see every year China steel production growing. For this year, what they talk about is a 5% growth, and a 5% growth, only China will demand more than 50 million tons of iron ore. So I don't believe there will be any problems in marketing these additional ore that we are going to have this year available.</p>
          <p>And also, we do not believe the big pressure on prices. I think the &#x2013; iron ore price in China, we have some overshooting now and then. But on general, the fundamentals are very strong. So I do not &#x2013; I don't see too many changes in iron ore price. Maybe some accommodation because of the overshooting we had in the last two or three weeks. But fundamentally speaking, you have a &#x2013; India is not delivering enough ore. They are consuming more internally. Even local ore is becoming &#x2013; the quality and the iron content is becoming lower. Even if they mining more ore, the ore have less iron content.</p>
          <p>So when I look everything together, I do not see big change in these fundamentals. For sure, more iron ore you come in production, not only from Vale, but from other producers, but not an extent that could change fundamentally the market situation.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Felipe. Here is Guilherme, about your cost question. You're right that there's been in the market cost pressures, but first of all, I would like to say that on our procurement side, we purchase a lot of materials in the past in advance. And if you look closely to our results and exclude the effects of exchange rate, volume, and things related to acquisition of minerals from third parts for example, you see that we diluted costs and reduced costs for our personnel and materials, for example.</p>
          <p>Maybe some confusion will be done, because this quarter, we introduced all the fertilizer costs on our base. So this is misleading the analysis. So I would like to ask you to contact our Investor Relations so they can split up the effect that the first &#x2013; the introduction of the fertilizer business in 2010, that didn't exist in 2009, are distorting the numbers. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Guilherme. Thank you, Martins, for answers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Rodrigo Barros from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, congratulations for the managements for the results, and most of all, I think to all employees of Vale, as this was really outstanding. I have two questions. The first one is on the depreciation of iron ore product. I wonder if you could tell us how many years of lump does Vale still have, excluding Corumb&#xE1;? As I do understand that probably you are talk about just a few years left.</p>
          <p>And in terms of new iron ore supply, we can see that approximately 70% of Vale's new supply is going to be sinter feed. And worldwide speaking, it's kind of the opposite, where actually more than 60% of supply will come from pellet feed. My second question is if Vale believes that that premium that sinter feed used to have over pellet feed may once again exist, which would &#x2013; eventually sinter feed would becoming the new lump. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the lump question, Vale was never a big producer of lump. Historically speaking, Vale was the king of sinter feed. And lately, we started developing more and more pellet to feed as we start to processing iron ore to produce sinter feed and then we start generating a lot of pellet feed. Our ratio of lump was always below 10%, and for sure, we don't have it too many years ahead to produce lump ore besides the Corumb&#xE1;. Corumb&#xE1;, we had a huge resource there, but the main issue is logistically. So as far as we are developing better logistic, we could increase a little bit lump production based on Corumb&#xE1; mine. But even with this additional lump, Vale will never have a big percentage of lump in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>As far as pellet feed, it's increasing, not only in Vale, but world &#x2013; mainly in Brazil. That is very interesting to point out, that pellet feed is main Brazilian product, is mainly produced in Brazil. And all of those mines that are now developing in Brazil by third parties will be mainly producers of pellet feed.</p>
          <p>Pellet feed could be priced at same level as sinter feed as &#x2013; although they have &#x2013; the sizing is not the best for steel makers. But the quality for pellet feed is really good. So the chemical quality will, in such extent, compensate by the lower size and quality. So but as time goes by, steel makers will needed to use more and more pellet feed, because of the strength. And in this case, they have a chance to use pellet feed as part of their sinter feed.</p>
          <p>Up to 10%, 15% of the sinter machine, they can use pellet feed, and the remaining will have to be palletized. So we believe that as time goes by, more pelletizing plant will be built in order to cope with this additional pellet feed that will be delivered. I believe that long term, pellet feed will be one of the most important material for steel making, being used that pellet feed in itself or being used that &#x2013; a feed for pellets. But this is a very important point that I think steel makers will have to adopt  themselves to use a different burden going forward.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Marcos Assump&#xE7;&#xE3;o from Ita&#xFA;</p>
          <p>Bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations on the strong results. First question is regarding the sales, iron ore sales volumes that you did under the CFR model. What is the maximum level of sales that you can do on this &#x2013; under this type of contract? And if this was the main reason behind the positive price performance that you had, as iron ore fine prices dropped only 5% quarter-on-quarter, well below the class average which declined more than 10%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are selling on a CNF basis, but we are selling freights to our customers, okay? Sometimes we sell CNF, sometimes we sell FOB, but we sell the freight together. So it is a different composition, and we try to manage this on a daily basis in order to get the best net price &#x2013; the best net FOB price for us. I prefer not to tell how much we are selling on this condition, but the point you raise is okay. We have a better pricing than expected for two reasons. One was CFR sales, and the other one is the improvement in quality of our iron ore in this quarter, okay? So the combination of both improved our price, and our price decreased less than the Platts index, as you say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just second question regarding India, if you have any insight on the issue regarding the export bans in the country? And as you already touched on the point, if you believe that India's &#x2013; could continue to be a sustainable long-term supplier of iron ore to China, let's say?</p>

          <p>Steel production in India is growing very fast now, okay? So as time goes by, a big part of their iron ore will be used locally. And what we see is in the next &#x2013; in the last two years, they kept their sales in the same level. And there is a clear indication that this year they are going to reduce a little bit their shipment worldwide, including China.</p>
          <p>So I don't believe &#x2013; unless there was a big change in Indian reservation as far as iron ore exports concern, and also in the mining rights and logistics, I don't believe that India could have a big role in the iron ore market from now on. I think they got their most high level in 2009, and from that point on, they start reducing their presence in the seaborne market. So I think it is, this answer is very difficult to assure, but in our view, the way we are looking the market, we see they are a presence in the international market lower and lower in the years to come.</p>

          <p>Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you very much. Good results in fourth quarter. Just a couple of questions. One is, given the very strong result that you've had in the fourth quarter and your very promising outlook for 2011, did you see, Roger, any room for additional return of capital to shareholders? It was proposed, about a month ago, a $4 billion dividend, minimum dividend, but some of your peers have had a more aggressive capital return to shareholders, and your results are much better. So if you can comment on that, I would appreciate it.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, a lot has been said about how much the government in Brazil is trying to get involved in the mining industry and the mining companies. So if you can give us what you are perceiving, that would be also appreciated. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I may answer this question. In terms of a return to our shareholders, of course is a very big concern. But we are right now facing a $24 billion investments, and of course we are &#x2013; we have to be very, very disciplined in capital allocation. We would like to finish the expansions of our operations. We would like to start up new mines around the world. So we have to be very careful with that.</p>
          <p>I don't know exactly, how is going to be the markets, or the financial market at the end of the year, if we are going to see or not a shortage of capital. I don't know. So we have to wait a little bit more to see it, to decide if we are going to increase the dividends to our shareholder. If we have room to do that, we are going to do, no doubt about that.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash, in terms of abilities to face this $24 billion, we are okay. We don't need to raise any money. But let's wait a little bit to see the performance of the first semester, and let's see the financial market in the end of the year.</p>
          <p>I think we have to be very careful with this currency fluctuation. We have to be very careful with inflation in the world. Maybe some big economies will need to raise interest rate, that will be &#x2013; we'll &#x2013; as a consequence, we will see more &#x2013; a little bit more scarce capital or funding for new investments. So we'll to be very careful with that.</p>
          <p>Again, if we have room to increase the return to our shareholders, we are going to do. But I don't want to promise, or I don't want to anticipate any movement about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for the call. My first question is regarding the Simandou project, and if you can update us on the political environment and the understanding that you have been reaching with the local government?</p>
          <p>And also, what are the next achievements that we should be looking for regarding this project? We saw headlines that logistics started to be built, right? The railway was underway. So if you can give us an update on Simandou, that would be great.</p>
          <p>My second question is for Tito Martins on the nickel side. Reading the press release, it was clear that Vale is bit more cautious now on HPAL projects, especially given its project at &#x2013; in Goro, right, in New Caledonia. So just to get a sense of how feasible these HPAL projects are in treating the laterite ore in the industry, and if you guys see a big chances of disappointments with these projects going forward? Those are my questions, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question, I just arrived from Guinea, and we celebrated a break-ground ceremony there in Guinea. But this railway will not be used by Vale. This is railway is a revamp of the existing Trans-Guinea, that goes from Conakry to Kankan. This road will be used by Guinea for transportation of people, by bananas, et cetera, et cetera. General cargo.</p>
          <p>What we are doing, we are developing a new railway &#x2013; new railroad from Simandou to Liberia port. The political situation there in Guinea and around Guinea, I should say, that is not really a easy place to be, but our position is to contribute with democracy there. We would like to have our social projects implemented there in Guinea. We believe that we have a lot of good things to bring, or &#x2013; to bring to Guinea, and I had a meeting with Mr. President, Mr. Alpha Cond&#xE9;, and the meeting was very good. Of course, he's a little bit conservative in terms of approach, in terms of action, and I think that we needed to wait a little bit to see how fast we can move in terms of the implementation of the project.</p>
          <p>We are ready. We wanted to contribute with Guinea people. We would like to contribute with democracy there, implement this project that is very important for Guinea. But they are facing a lot of problems there. They have a problem with what are external debts, they have a problem with a power supply, they have a problem with food. It's a poor country, and an investment like we wanted to do there in Guinea, it will be very, very, very important for the community, for the society, for the development of the country.</p>
          <p>I have no doubt that the future of Guinea is very good. It is a rich country in terms of natural resources, oil, gas, iron ore, bauxite, and they have a very good hydropower generation in hydro also, but they are consuming right now only diesel power plants. So we are working hard. We are working hard to be a very good citizen and to be a company that the Guineas people will be proud to have in their country. Tito, go ahead with the second question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the laterite, the &#x2013; let's explain what's going in New Caledonia right now. We have already commissioned all the plants. So the HPALs, they are working very well. The refinery is working very well. We still have one problem, which was the &#x2013; which is columns that stay less, we have rebuilded them right now.</p>
          <p>In terms of the results that we are have, the outcomes we are having in some of the plants, we are very optimistic about them. Why is that? Because the technology that we are implementing has proven to work well.  And I said some time ago that the future for the laterite is primarily related to the success of the HPALs. And we are still believe in that. If you ask me, are we actually expecting to see any fallback in the near future? Of course. We are dealing with a new technology, but so far, everything has proven to be very efficient.</p>
          <p>We are moving on with the rebuilds of the columns. We are already shipping what we call intermediate products, NHC, or the nickel hydride cake. We're selling this, some tonnage, through Australia, and we are confident that along the year, we will be able actually to deliver the metal. And as I also said before, all the industry is looking at us and say &#x2013; and expecting to see our success, because this is the future for the nickel industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may say that, if we &#x2013; I had to bet in the success of New Caledonia project or the technology, I should bet in the positive way. I should bet that is going to be a success.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Rodolfo Angele [Rodolfo De Angele] from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. The first, on iron ore. It's &#x2013; if you could just give us an update on your views on what is the marginal producer looking like in China in terms of cost, in terms of iron ore grade? Just an update. As you've seen the cost curve in China moving, where do you see it at right now?</p>
          <p>And I also would like to hear from management an update on the coal projects in Moatize. That's it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as the cost of the marginal broad producers, worldwide, mainly China. It's clear that all the additional production that is coming on stream has a higher cost of production. So in China specifically, these are &#x2013; today it's around, on average, considering the most expensive producers, around $80 per ton. But this quarter is increasing because first, quality of ore is deteriorating so less iron ore content, more cost to produce per unit of iron ore. And also, China, it's facing internally, wages are increasing, currency is revaluating a little bit. So I believe that the situations of these marginal producers in China, their cost is going up and will continue to go up.</p>
          <p>And even outside China, all the new producers will have a much bigger cost. On this aspect, I think Vale is very well positioned, because the new mine we are bringing on production is even with the lower cost than the former one. So the new projects that we are developing in Caraj&#xE1;s, we are introducing a lot of new technologies, are not &#x2013; a lot of new approaches that will drive our cost down. So as time goes by, I believe that the competitiveness of our ore will increase relating to China and to the other marginal producers, even in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. This is Eduardo Bartolomeo for the second question about the coal project. The main project that we have in Moatize project's coming onstream on July. One side of the matter is due to the project date. Is on time, on budget, it's very well taken care of. The threat that we have is around logistics. We are taking care of that also, within the &#x2013; with the development of Mozambique and the concessionary. The solution for the railway is really &#x2013; we believe that we'll able to service around July. We have &#x2013; we're taking care of the rolling stocks and the wagon and all the issues there, and about the Beira port, the provisional solution for the exporting of the coal from Beira is already fixed with the government so we think that we'll be able to ramp up the production. After then, we even talk in the beginning for the first semester &#x2013; the second semester of the year and for the year 2011, we'll be very optimistic, too. That's the main projects I think we have in coal, this. And the operations in Colombia and in Australia are doing well. Besides Australia that were very impacted due to rains that everybody else in that region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may, is the last to ask M&#xE1;rio Barbosa to make some comments about fertilizer. Fertilizer is one of the &#x2013; or is very important for us as it's going to be year by year more important for us, and if you &#x2013; if I may, I'd like ask M&#xE1;rio Barbosa to go ahead with some comments about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First of all, we incorporated Vale Fertilizantes and Vale Fosfatados last &#x2013; in first of February, so now we are one company, and consolidated. And we have many projects to build, like the importers and in Sergipe. We are analyzing all these projects, total investment which will to -- in fertilizer, will be something around $12 billion in the next four years. And in the moment, I think fertilizer is in a good position because the price of the commodity are increasing, like corn, like soybean, like coffee, sugarcane. In other words, the world need food, and how the world is using more and more food, we are using more and more fertilizer because the only way to increase the production is to increase the productivity, and fertilizer is very important to do this. Studies of FAU indicates that 50% of the production of food came from the use of fertilizer. So we are investing a lot. We are building a new company, and we are very optimist about this new company, and during the year, we will have some news about fertilizer environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may, I would like to ask Eduardo Ledsham to talk a little bit about energy, and you own me, yes, this year, Eduardo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roger. Well, regarding energy special, and I guess that you just finish an agreement Peru, right? And you are very confident to have good results in terms to have a gas supply. And there could be one of the best alternative for us to go downstream in a Bay&#xF3;var project, and I believe that it could add value in the fertilizer business.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, what &#x2013; you are confident we'll have good results during 2011, especially in the area in Esp&#xED;rito Sants, and could be one of the alternative to supply gas for the iron ore operations in Esp&#xED;rito Sant.</p>
          <p>You are looking for opportunity in Argentina, yeah? Two months ago, we had a fantastic results with one of the areas that you have a JV and a per diem agreement. There is gas to supply our Rio Colorado project for the next 50 years. So there is a huge deposit, it's &#x2013; the JV with <mark type="inaudible" />. Yves St Pierre</p>
          <p>And we are looking forward for opportunity in Africa as well, especially in the Mozambique, because in Mozambique, you have a project in the late stage going to finish the feasibility studies. It's a large project, and it's possible to go downstream as well with &#x2013; if we have gas available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you developing in north of Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The north of Brazil, we are starting the implementation of pilot plants in the Par&#xE1; state, and we are starting small production in the end of November. And we just finished an exhibition of more 21% of the Biopalma. Now this Vale has 70% of the Biopalma, and you are starting the second phase, until we start the production at the middle of this year, and to achieve the full scale in 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To finish this very nice conversation, I'd like to say that we are committed to be disciplined in terms of capital allocation. We are looking for new reserves in copper. I think copper is an area that we have to increase our presence and we are speeding up all the implementation of new mines here in Brazil, as Salobo, as Cristalino, as other project in Caraj&#xE1;s, in Zambia also, we are pushing the investment there. We are looking for new opportunities in Congo, also in Zambia. And I believe that the target to produce 1 million tons of copper by 2015 is it still alive, and I think we will be able to deliver this promise to the market.</p>
          <p>Met coal, as Eduardo said, the project there in Mozambique is going very, very, very well. In nickel, the On&#xE7;a Puma is ready to start the production. New Caledonia also. The improvements in Voisey's Bay in Sudbury is going very, very well. Fertilizers, I think M&#xE1;rio gave you a good update to of our projects there. Logistics is another area that we can grow a lot in the next coming years.</p>
          <p>So I'm very, very optimistic that Vale is well positioned in terms of returning to results and very well positioned in &#x2013; for future results. Nobody else in the industry has the same or the size of our investment pipeline. We are very positioned &#x2013; very well positioned in logistics for iron ore, in Malaysia distribution center, in Oman also we are very well positioned. The big vessels will start to arrive next month. That will give us more flexibility to deal with our prices, to deal with our clients, to be a reliable supplier, independent from this very volatile freight market.</p>
          <p>In financially speaking, the company's able to face the projects of this size or the amount of projects that we have right now to implement for 2011 and for 2012. We don't &#x2013; we do not depend in &#x2013; of anything, but of course, permits, you got to make a permits. The ability of suppliers to supply with equipments, with labor force, et cetera. So everybody in the industry are facing the same problem. There is no doubt that we have to be creative to overcome this lack of resource to implement big projects as we are implementing right now.</p>
          <p>So I'm very happy that we have a lot of problems, a lot of issues to be solved. I'm very happy that the company's well prepared to face all these challenges. And I'm very happy that we are delivering very good and sound and sustainable results for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>This is it. Vale is a company that, I can tell you, ahead of our competitors, ahead of the main big companies in the world in terms of sustainability. I'd like to stress this thing, because this is a strategy for us. It's not sustainable to be in any country in mining business if you are not going well with the stakeholders, with the communities, in the areas that we are operating.</p>
          <p>So I think we are in a very good positions. We've &#x2013; I don't face any &#x2013; I don't see any major problem for 2011. Of course, we have to be aware that a lot of changes are happening in the world today. We needed to update ourselves there every single day, in every single regions that we are present. But this is a challenge for everybody. So it is &#x2013; for everybody, is not a problem, is the day-by-day business. So we don't have any affection in terms of issues or problems. I think we are in the same environment that everybody is today. So, we are confident that we are &#x2013; we have our duties, but we are able to overcome those &#x2013; these issues. Thank you very much.</p>
