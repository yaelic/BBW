        <plist>
          <p>Well welcome everybody, thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation. I'm joined by David Mathers, our CFO, who's going to deliver the results portion of today's discussion. And our divisional CEOs are here as well, and they'll participate in the Q&amp;A. So Hans-Ulrich Meister of the Private Bank; Eric Varvel of Investment Banking; and Rob Shafir of Asset Management will be available for questions as well.</p>
          <p>2011 was a year of transition for Credit Suisse. We took decisive steps in the second half of the year to further evolve our integrated bank model. And we made significant progress in adapting the business to the new market and regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>There's been a fundamental change in the industry landscape, and in response, we have aggressively reduced risks and costs during the year. While these actions had an impact on our financial results, we're convinced that our status as a first mover in adapting the business model will position us for improved profitability and more sustainable returns.</p>
          <p>We did this against the backdrop of very challenging market conditions throughout the year, characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, low levels of client activity across our businesses and periods of extreme market volatility driven by concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis and its effects on the global economy.</p>
          <p>We did make significant progress in three areas: first, sizeable and accelerated reduction of risk-weighted assets in the investment bank which will allow us to achieve our original year-end 2012 target level, a full nine months ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>Second, demonstrable progress against our CHF2 billion cost reduction program, primarily aimed at improving the financial performance and cost flexibility of the investment bank. We're confident of achieving CHF1.2 billion of run rate savings from the start of 2012, excluding the impact of the one-time charges from PAF2 awards granted in expense in the first quarter. PAF2, our Partner Asset Facility 2, is a deferred compensation plan which effectively transfers risk from the group to employees and will result in a one-time costs of CHF500 million in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>And third, early and encouraging progress towards achieving enhanced profitability in the private bank.</p>
          <p>I'm going to cover these actions in greater detail, but first I do want to discuss our financial performance and the impact our actions had on fourth quarter and full-year results. Our performance in the fourth quarter with a net loss of CHF637 million was clearly disappointing. The loss reflects not just challenging market and trading conditions, continued lower client activity in the quarter, but also the impacts of rapidly adapting the business model.</p>
          <p>This includes the impact of a pre-tax loss of approximately CHF1 billion in the fourth quarter related to these measures, including: first, the implementation of our risk reduction plan; second, losses from business we're exiting, particularly specific areas of fixed income in which we no longer see the prospect for attractive returns under the changed regulatory environment; and third, business realignment costs resulting from the rapid execution of our cost reduction program.</p>
          <p>In spite of the difficult fourth quarter, for the full-year 2011 we reported net income of CHF2 billion or CHF2.4 billion on an underlying basis and this equates to a reported return on equity of 6% for the full year or 7.4% on an underlying basis. We continued to gain market share across our businesses. We saw solid private banking net new assets of CHF7.5 billion in the fourth quarter and CHF44.5 billion for the full year, including strong contributions from ultra-high net worth individuals and the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 5, overall, as I said, a disappointing fourth quarter. But given our robust capital position, we are able to take these measures while maintaining the strength of our franchise. In fact, despite the fourth quarter, we continued to further strengthen key financial and capital ratios. We maintained a strong capital position and increased our Basel 2.5 Tier 1 ratio to 15.2%, up 0.9 percentage points, and improved our core Tier 1 ratio to 10.7%, up 0.7 percentage points from the end of the third quarter. As you know, Credit Suisse has been operating under Basel 2.5 standards since the beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>On a Basel III basis, we expect our year-end 2012 CET1 ratio to be at 13%, well in excess of the FINMA requirement of 6%, and on a look-through basis, we expect our CET1 ratio to be 7% at the end of 2012 and to increase to 10% by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet remains highly liquid and Credit Suisse continues to have an industry-leading Basel III net stable funding ratio that is well ahead of requirements. We further improved our ratio to 98% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We will continue to pay a material dividend. The board of directors will propose a dividend distribution of CHF0.75 per share at the annual general meeting on April 27. The distribution will be free of Swiss withholding tax and will be payable in cash or in new shares of Credit Suisse Group at the option of the shareholder.</p>
          <p>For the script alternative, the new shares will be issued at a discount with a price equivalent to approximately 92% of the average opening and closing price on the SIX Swiss Exchange during a period of five trading days following the Annual General Meeting.</p>
          <p>While we're mindful that the market and the economic environment remain uncertain, we are encouraged that our business is off to a good start in 2012 with year-to-date underlying return on equity consistent with our target level of 15%, including the benefit from our risk and cost reduction plans.</p>
          <p>And with this, I'll now turn to how we're implementing the measures to evolve our strategy. Moving to slide 6 then, we're confident that our measures to aggressively reduce risk and cost in 2011 have been effective in adapting our business to the new environment and have strengthened our position heading into 2012. I want to give you some of the details on the three areas that I mentioned earlier, including our significant progress in, first: risk-weighted asset reductions in the investment bank; second, expense reduction initiatives across the group; and third, early progress on initiatives aimed at bolstering the profitability of the private bank.</p>
          <p>First as you can see from the chart on the left-hand side of the slide, we accelerated the reduction of our Basel 3 risk-weighted assets in the investment bank, reducing them from $331 billion at the end of the second quarter to $248 billion at the end of the year. This amounts to an aggregate reduction of $83 billion in the second half of 2011, $47 billion of that in the fourth quarter. We expect to achieve an additional $33 billion reduction by the end of the first quarter, bringing us to $215 billion. This aggressive reduction in risk-weighted assets will allow us to exceed our year-end 2012 goal nine months early, by the end of the first quarter. We now expect to achieve a risk-weighted asset level of $190 billion by year-end 2012 which is $40 billion lower than our original target.</p>
          <p>Second, as you can see from the chart in the middle of the slide, we significantly reduced our expense base and improved our cost flexibility, primarily aimed at improving the performance of the Investment Bank in 2012. We completed aggressive measures to achieve expense run-rate reductions of CHF1.2 billion from the start of 2012, again, excluding the expenses related to PAF2 awards which were granted in the first quarter. We've targeted additional reductions of CHF800 million by the end of 2013, for a total cost reduction of CHF2 billion. We go into 2012 having increased our compensation flexibility by reducing senior level head count with the resulting substantial decrease in costs from deferred compensation from previous years.</p>
          <p>And third, in the Private Bank, we've taken steps and see early progress towards achieving enhanced profitability. The integration of Clariden Leu is well advanced. We acquired an onshore platform in Japan and we see continued momentum in our ultra-high net worth market share. We've set a goal for an CHF800 million improvement to pre-tax income in the Private Bank in 2014, and we will achieve this enhanced profitability while maintaining our industry-leading franchise momentum.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to David.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady. Good morning. I'd like to start my presentation on slide 8 with an overview of the financial results. If you look at the full-year numbers, you can see that underlying net income was CHF2.4 billion and diluted earnings per share, CHF1.71. The underlying return on equity was 7%, compared to 14% in 2010.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we reported an underlying pre-tax loss of CHF0.8 billion and a net loss of CHF0.5 billion. The reported pre-tax loss was CHF1 billion, and reported net loss CHF0.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide 9, we highlight the significant items that affect the reported result. The reported fourth quarter pre-tax loss of CHF1 billion includes CHF0.2 billion of fair value and debt gains and CHF0.4 billion of severance costs that we booked in the corporate center. These severance costs are a part of the CHF1.2 billion total implementation costs that we expect to occur over the whole of 2011 and 2012 in order to deliver the CHF2 billion cost reduction initiative. As a result of accelerating this program, we recognized some CHF0.8 billion of these charges in 2011. And we expect to incur the remaining CHF0.4 billion of realignment costs during the course of 2012.</p>
          <p>It's also worth noting that our fourth quarter result includes pre-tax losses of CHF0.6 billion in our fixed income businesses within the investment bank. These losses relate to businesses we're exiting and to the accelerated risk reduction program. And the full year losses across both categories totaled CHF1 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 10. We're on track to deliver total savings of CHF2 billion from the cost reduction program by the end of 2013. The left-hand chart shows that we expect to achieve annualized expense reduction of CHF1.2 billion of this in the first quarter of 2012. The bulk of this CHF1.2 billion will be realized in the investment bank where we have reduced headcounts particularly at senior levels and as we rationalize and reallocate resources, downscale and exiting some of the less capital efficient business lines. These numbers exclude the impact from the PAF2 awards which will be granted and fully expensed in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>The right-hand chart shows the divisional split of the further CHF0.8 billion of expense reductions planned to be achieved by the end of 2013, savings from this include the benefits from the integration of Clariden Leu, the streamlining and integration of operations and support infrastructure, as well as a focused vendor management initiative.</p>
          <p>Slide 11. We have achieved a material reduction in compensation levels going to 2012. The left-hand chart shows that we have reduced the economic value of variable compensation awards by 41% in 2011 compared to 2010. The right-hand chart shows that compensation awarded in prior years but not yet expensed, has fallen from CHF5.9 billion at the end of 2010 to CHF3.7 billion by the end of last year. Of the CHF3.7 billion, we expect CHF2.4 billion to be charged in 2012, subject to fluctuations from market movements, relating to the award value.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, for 2011, we awarded deferred compensation to senior employees in two forms: Credit Suisse deferred shares and PAF2 units. The effect of the PAF2 units is to transfer an element of credit risk to our employees. This achieves three things: first, it reduces the risk of the bank; second, it accelerates the implementation of our restructuring strategy; and third, it aligns the risks and rewards to our employees with those of the bank and of our shareholders. As a result of this program, CHF500 million, in respect of this risk transfer will be expensed in the first quarter 2012 as this award is vested and granted.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, let's turn to the Private Bank. The Private Bank's fourth quarter pre-tax income CHF467 million was characterized by significantly lower levels of client activity as well as higher expenses for legal matters and an increase in provisions. Despite the continued weak environment, we achieved strong net new asset inflows of CHF44.5 billion in 2011 with strong contributions across all regions.</p>
          <p>The overall pre-tax income margin was 26% in 2011. The full-year result was adversely impacted by the strength in the Swiss franc during 2011 with net revenues and pre-tax income, CHF844 and CHF550 million lower as a consequence. At constant exchange rates, constant FX rates, and excluding the litigation charge that we took in the third quarter, the full-year pre-tax income in Private Bank would have been down 3% from 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's look at Wealth Management revenues in more detail on slide 14. So if we start with net interest income, the lower segment in these columns, you can see that after several quarters of falling net interest income, the result of continued low interest rates, we saw an increase in the fourth quarter to CHF863 million due to increased loan and deposit volumes as well as a somewhat weaker Swiss franc in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Recurring commissions and fees were slightly higher in the fourth quarter at CHF821 million, in-line with the improvement in average assets under management. After the increase we saw in transaction-based revenues in the third quarter, there was then a sharp decline in the fourth quarter due to significantly lower levels of client activity. And this was the main driver in the 5-basis-point decline in the overall gross margin to 109 basis points. And these revenues will remain subject to the continuing market environment and the significant fluctuation in client activity levels that we've experienced over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Slide 15. In an increasingly difficult market for net new asset accumulation, wealth management achieved net new asset inflows of CHF4 billion in the fourth quarter, with continued strong contributions from emerging market and ultra-high net worth clients. In Switzerland, net outflows of CHF2.3 billion were influenced by the usual fourth quarter seasonal effects. For the full year, the net new asset growth rate was 4.7%, with well-diversified inflows across all regions, and that included a 13% growth rate in Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to corporate and institutional clients on slide 16. Pre-tax income was CHF183 million in the fourth quarter, with a continued strong pre-tax margin of 40%. Net new asset inflows were particularly strong. Credit provisions did increase in the fourth quarter, but due to a small number of specific cases. For 2011 as a whole, they remained low.</p>
          <p>Slide 17. In light of the ongoing challenging environment and regulatory changes, in our third quarter results, we announced a comprehensive set of measures to rebalance the private bank towards growth areas in order to enhance its profitability. Already, we've hired 100 senior relationship managers, a third of whom are focused on the ultra-high net worth client segment, whilst reducing the overall head count in private banking by 400.</p>
          <p>We've acquired a private banking onshore franchise in Japan. We've announced the integration of Clariden Leu. And we're well on track to achieve the financial and operational benefits this will bring. Furthermore, we've also begun work on the shift in our resources towards ultra-high net worth clients, particularly in emerging markets, and you'll see this in the hiring of relationship managers towards a much more cost-efficient infrastructure in Western Europe, including the consolidation of the different processing centers and also the restructuring of our cross-border business to better segment how we look after affluent clients.</p>
          <p>We're confident these combined measures will result in a targeted incremental pre-tax income improvement of CHF800 million by 2014. And that's on the assumption that the external environment remains similar to that in 2011. Furthermore, we expect to achieve CHF300 million of that in 2012.</p>
          <p>So let me now turn to investment banking on slide 18. The investment bank posted a CHF1.3 billion pre-tax loss in the fourth quarter. Our 2011 performance was disappointing, adversely affected by difficult trading conditions, losses from businesses and positions that we're exiting, and from the cost of accelerated risk reduction. For the full year, net revenues totaled CHF11.5 billion, compared to CHF16.2 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 19. As we mentioned earlier, we incurred losses at CHF320 million from businesses that we're exiting and a further CHF149 million in respect to the accelerated risk reduction, as B3 RWA was reduced by $47 billion, or 16%, in the fourth quarter. If you were to adjust for these losses, fourth quarter revenues would have been CHF1.7 billion, but still down 31% from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 20. What we give here is an update on our progress in reducing the investment bank's Basel III risk-weighted assets. I'd just note that it's the first time we have provided you with quarterly B3 RWA numbers, and I would caution that these calculations are still in flux, but they do represent our current best estimates, based on our understanding of the draft B3 rules as they stand today.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we significantly accelerated RWA reduction, resulting in an $83 billion decrease, to $248 billion, in the second half of 2011. We expect to achieve a reduction of another $33 billion in the first quarter 2012, and to exceed our original goal for 2012 of $229 billion nine months early. Further, we plan another $25 billion of RWA reduction during the remainder of 2012, resulting in risk-weighted assets of around $190 billion in the investment bank by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 21. Fixed income revenues were significantly lower in the quarter, a reflection of volatile trading conditions, low client trading volumes and reduced liquidity. Our securitized products and credit franchise underperformed in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to losses on client and venture positioning, increased basis risk, extremely thin and liquid markets, as well as some losses on the hedges against these positions. Emerging markets and commodities were also somewhat weaker than in previous quarters, again due to subdued client activity, but our rates and FX businesses continued to perform well.</p>
          <p>Slide 22. If you recall at our third quarter presentation, we showed a breakdown of the CHF100 billion of planned risk-weighted asset mitigation in the fixed income business. What slide 22 shows is the progress in these mitigation efforts during the fourth quarter, as well as updated Basel III risk-weighted asset target levels for each business line at the end of 2012. We've presented the RWAs in dollars here to show a better like-for-like comparison free of the FX movements.</p>
          <p>You can see in the fourth quarter we mitigated CHF50 billion of the planned CHF105 billion target. In macro, credit and emerging markets, you can see we've made significant reductions in the fourth quarter and we have relatively limited further reductions planned in these business lines. We're already close to our end state for these areas.</p>
          <p>In securitized products, we do still have CHF11 billion to mitigate, having mitigated CHF25 billion in the fourth quarter. But this does give us confidence that a further CHF11 billion reduction is very much achievable and can be done at minimal incremental cost.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the wind-down category. As you can see this includes a total of CHF57 billion of risk weighted assets at the end of the third quarter, reducing to CHF48 billion at the end of 2011. So just to be clear, CHF10 billion of this is what you saw in November in our third quarter results, and that's the final tail of the 2008 exit portfolio, most of which has been sold down over the last three years. The other CHF38 billion is in respect to the businesses and assets which under the Basel III review, which we talked about in November, we have also decided to exit from.</p>
          <p>So having reduced this portfolio by CHF9 billion in the fourth quarter, you can see that in 2012, the target is to reduce this by a further CHF34 billion. We already have firm plans in place to eliminate more than half of this in the first quarter, and that includes PAF2. The incremental costs of the reduction are expected to be minimal but I would note that these assets are subject to market fluctuations which do affect the fair value over time.</p>
          <p>So let's now turn to equities on slide 23, please. You can see we had lower albeit resilient equity revenues quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a strong performance in prime services with increased client balances, resilient cash equity revenues notwithstanding lower client volumes and equity derivatives performance that was impacted by reduced customer activity, and that was particularly in Europe and in Asia, as well as hedging losses due to the cost of a conservative approach to risk position in this business.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, underwriting and advisory results were low in the quarter, reflecting lower industry-wide issuance, and a decline in completed M&amp;A activity. Debt underwriting revenues declined driven by reduced high-yield issuance, and also equity underwriting levels were lower, particularly in IPOs.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Asset Management on slide 25. Pre-tax income was CHF87 million in the fourth quarter. Full-year pre-tax income was CHF553 million, a 10% increase on 2010. If you move to slide 25, you can see the drivers in this improved performance.</p>
          <p>Slide 26, you can see that the pre-tax income was driven by higher fee-based revenues and significantly reduced operating expenses as we continued to realize platform efficiencies and exit subscale businesses. The higher fee-based revenues were somewhat offset by lower investment-related gains as a result of adverse market conditions in the second half of the year. And the strong franc also had a negative impact on like-for-like performance. The overall pre-tax margin for 2011, nonetheless, increased to 26%.</p>
          <p>Slide 27, in 2011, Asset Management experienced strong underlying inflows, primarily in higher margin alternative investments. However, we had outflows of CHF5.9 billion, resulting from our decision to close certain product lines as well as from certain private equity realizations that we saw during the year. In addition, we experienced CHF7.1 billion of outflows in the low margin pension fund advisory business.</p>
          <p>So let's now turn to capital and liquidity on slide 28, please. We continue to maintain a strong capital position with our Basel 2.5 core Tier 1 ratio increasing by 1.0% to 10.7% during 2011. Our Basel 2.5 Tier 1 ratio increased by 0.9% to 15.2% at the end of the year and clearly in addition to the B2.5 capital, we also benefit from the issued and foreign exchanged buffer capital notes or cocos that we raised in February a year ago.</p>
          <p>Let me comment briefly on the EBA stress test. Although the Swiss banks are not subject to this test, on the most conservative definition of the EBA rules our ratio would be around 9.5% at the end of 2011 which is comfortably above the requirements as laid out in the draft rules that have been published so far by the EBA. And I'd note that this excludes any credit for the buffer capital notes, including these notes, the ratio would be 10.2% at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 29, we showed you the substantial reduction in our overall B3 RWA in light of our 2012 goal resulting from the steady alignment &#x2013; realignment in the investment bank. We've accelerated the reduction in B3 RWAs and we'll achieve our end 2012 target during the first quarter, nine months earlier that we'd previously planned. At the end of 2012, we now expect to achieve our end state risk weighted assets of CHF283 billion, CHF37 billion below the original target. If we look forward to 2013, we anticipate the business growth going forward to be in the private bank and asset management.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 shows an update on how the B3 CET1 ratio could develop based on our capital progression expectations through to the end of 2013. On the left chart, the first column shows our current shareholders' equity. We have adjusted for regulatory deductions and analyst expectations for the next 12 months' retained earnings. And I would remind you this does not represent forward-looking statements being made by Credit Suisse management. We assume a benefit of CHF2.6 billion from issuing shares out of conditional capital for share-based compensation awards as well as other movements in capital and deductions.</p>
          <p>So by the end of the year, our CET1 capital goes to CHF36 billion to give a B3 CET1 ratio of 12.9% based on the transitional definition in the proposed FINMA capital ordinances that were published in December.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have issued and forward exchanged loss-absorbing contingent capital which is worth another 2.7% on this ratio and we've included just for reference the proposed FINMA glide-path requirements that came out with the December draft ordinance and that's on slide 42 in the appendix. We've also included in the appendix the CET1 look-through calculation. So on this basis which is on slide 41, shows ratios of 7.1% and 9.9% at the end of 2012 and 2013, respectively.</p>
          <p>So let's now turn to slide 31. Our funding and liquidity positions remain strong. The Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio, NSFR, increased around 98% at the end of 2011. As Swiss regulatory leverage ratios stood at 4.6% under B2.5, which is towards the top of the required range, and funding spreads remain amongst the tightest compared our peers. Furthermore, we have a highly unencumbered balance sheet with limited use of covered bonds, only about 12% of our Swiss mortgage book is so utilized.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have not and have no intention of participating in the LTRO facility given our existing strong funding liquidity position and also our limited inventory of euro collateral.</p>
          <p>So on that note, that concludes my presentation, and I'll hand it back to Brady. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Huw van Steenis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for that useful presentation. Two questions. I want to first focus on the Basel III look-through ratios. So at the end of 2013, despite your very successful de-risking, your ratio is only about 40 bps higher than last time, so at 9.9 versus 9.5, last disclosed, and I think, if I think about that, almost all of that is explained by you cutting the dividend. Have you also got thoughts about not only accelerating the reduction of RWAs, but actually looking to a much smaller risk-weighted asset base in two to three years' time as you re-think the opportunity set in investment banking?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is really around the cost base, clearly you have done a great job in trying to re-base the cost base for a more challenging environment. What sort of assumptions did you use as you thought about what was the appropriate level of cost and what would it take for you to need to have another look at that as the year goes on? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the second question first, Huw &#x2013; by the way, Huw, thanks for the questions. I think with regard to the cost base, I mean obviously that's one of the more important question is how &#x2013; what kind of an environment are we going to be encountering and therefore what kind of a cost base should we be maintaining?</p>
          <p>I think as you know, we've actually planned to reduce the cost base and we've actually executed on that in such a way that we think if we had sort of 2010, 2011 average environment we thought we'd have sort of a 16% return on our investment bank. If we have a 2011 average environment, we would be more like a 12% return on equity in that environment.</p>
          <p>So that's what we've kind of cut to is something where we think hopefully we can have I think our view is that if we had conditions that are along those lines, we'll still have something that is in the low teens in terms of returns on the business.</p>
          <p>So I think for right now, that's sort of how we've positioned the business, obviously that's an important &#x2013; one of the more important decisions is how to scale the business for what we see going forward. I think our &#x2013; obviously it's anybody's guess as to how 2012 is going to proceed. We've said we're encouraged by how it started off but I think our view is that hopefully we will be &#x2013; we'll experience an environment such that the scale of our cost base will allow us to make those kinds of returns. But we'll obviously reassess it as time goes on, but we think that's probably about the right place to be.</p>
          <p>I think with regards to the RWA, I don't know if, David, you want to comment on the specific question of the changes to that, I mean, I think our &#x2013; I guess what I would say is the acceleration of our program hasn't really impacted our end-state approach to the business. So but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you said, Huw, I think in the third quarter on the look-through basis which I think your question was about, I think we talked about a look-through ratio of 9.4% excluding the buffer capital notes and I think if you look at slide 41, the ratio increase is now up to 9.9% excluding the buffer capital notes or 12.5% including the buffer capital note.</p>
          <p>So I guess your question is, I think, Huw, but correct me if I'm wrong, is should we be looking beyond that in terms of those numbers? I would say clearly the Swiss rules essentially do lay out pretty clear in terms of what they are. We've given the glide-path in the back against the transitional CET1, clearly the end state under 2019 is a requirement for 10% common equity Tier 1, 3% further equity or high-strike cocos and then a further 6% low-strike. So I think that's probably pretty much in keeping with the Swiss rules but somewhat earlier obviously than the timeline required.</p>
          <p>But, I mean, I thought your question, where it was going, is should we go beyond that. I guess probably we feel that's about the right level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; I thought the question was, maybe, Huw, you can clarify, but I thought the question was since we've accelerated the movement, I guess your question was, does that mean we're going to have an end state that's actually lower than what we had originally projected and I would say the acceleration is not changing our ultimate configuration of the business. I mean, the &#x2013; we've taken some very clear steps, we outlined them. We've spent some more time talking about some of the RWA increases as you see here. And that's really just based on the new capital regulations and how they impact returns on the business.</p>
          <p>So we're really working to have an investment bank that can make around the 15% return on equity in decent market conditions and I think that configuration hasn't really changed. I think our decisions around the acceleration of that are really more around our view that if we can get our business into a sustainable state earlier, we'll be able to take advantage of opportunities with clients and in the markets and we still believe that.</p>
          <p>Our belief, our thesis is still that the industry will have to move pretty rapidly towards this. Some of that has happened in the industry, but not very much and so frankly, you're going to see a lot more movement to reduce RWA, which is going to obviously increase the price of the reductions. So if we can do that up front, we will hopefully be in a better position. That's at least the thesis. We will see how it works out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Huw. Next question on the phone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a few questions if I can. First on the investment banking compensation, I think you mentioned with Q3 result that you were accruing for a bonus pool down 25% to 30% in line with what your compensation consultants were telling you. Your pool actually fell 41% so I guess I was surprised that the costs in the investment bank were only down about CHF90 million, so my question is did you pay a higher percent in non-deferred, if you will, than you envisioned at Q3 or how else do you reconcile that difference?</p>
          <p>Then on the $47 billion risk-weighted asset reduction in the investment bank, I was wondering if you could give us the actual asset reduction just so we can kind of do some calculations on what the haircut was on the assets that you've sold? And then on the exit cost you gave us for legacy business in Q4, were all of those assets sold or given a January recovery, could we see some write-backs of that?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I guess more theoretical, in the Q4 results Deutsche Bank said that their regulator forced them to take some operational risk-weighted assets to cover potential legal issues or litigation losses and I'm wondering if you had a similar conversation with FINMA given the potential for fines and servicing non-disclosed U.S. tax payers as well as and I guess you do have some put back risk as well? Those are the three questions maybe or four, a few anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I count at least four. Maybe I can start with a broad answer to the first question but then David can address that and we can go on from there or I'll try to answer a couple of them and probably David or Eric could jump in and give better or more complete answers.</p>
          <p>I think, first of all on the investment banking side, I guess I'm probably going to increase the scale of your question by saying that, while the variable comp was down 41% for the whole bank, it's actually down more than that in the investment bank, as you can imagine. The investment bank obviously had worse performance, it was actually down more than that. So when David gets around to answer that, then I guess he'll have a bigger difference to explain than what you just mentioned.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; on the exit costs, I would say some of those are obviously realized in terms of those exit businesses. We have reduced our risk-weighted assets in those businesses, but some of them clearly are mark-to-market but not realized losses. So, could those come back? I guess they could, certainly. So I think it's a combination of those two.</p>
          <p>And I think on the last question the answer is, yeah, I mean, obviously as you say with the kind of the industry's increasing litigation docket, etcetera, a number of the issues out there, I think in general the regulators are looking at the operational risks as increasing and are actually requiring more capital against that, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think just an addendum to that point, I mean, I think generally I think there does seem to be a cross-European impact in terms of looking at op risk models again in light of 2011 just generally. So, yes, we have seen some increase in op risk RWA in the numbers that we actually report today as a consequence of that. I don't think I'd really comment specifically on one regulator against another but it's definitely been a common trend across the industry, particularly in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>I think on the IB comp point, I think there's probably two ways of looking at that. Firstly, if you look at slide 45 which is actually in the appendix, what we've given there is the investment banking results in U.S. dollars. And you'll see there that the comp and benefits line did actually drop from $1.729 billion to $1.491 billion which clearly does reflect part of the true up in terms of the CV or the cash value in the investment bank.</p>
          <p>I think then if we step back and look at the group, I think if you look at that earlier slide, you saw that &#x2013; if we could jump to the slide in the first section which shows the falling economic value of compensation awarded across the bank which refers to 41% &#x2013; don't worry &#x2013; and we've then included...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's slide 8 or something.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's about slide 8.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slide 11; sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slide 11, thank you. So you'll see the group number there actually did fall by 41% between 2010 and 2011. What we &#x2013; if we look over to group number, that 41% drop in the group number, we then actually reconcile on slide 44, sorry about this, guys. And what you see there is the 9% drop in the CV that actually went to the accounts because I think we really wanted to try and reconcile this.</p>
          <p>So what you see there in the group numbers is that the salary component drops from CHF8.6 billion to CHF8.1 billion. There were then severance costs which we took in the corporate center, CHF0.4 billion there, and then the variable compensation awards for current year is dropping from CHF2.3 billion to CHF1.7 billion and then you have the prior year deferred compensation coming through. So what we're trying to point out is clearly, because we have prior year deferred compensation, the actual decline in the comp charge you actually see in the accounts falls lower as a consequence of that prior-year amortization coming through.</p>
          <p>So I think that probably gives an idea how it was at the group level. If you want to look for the investment bank in particular, then clearly that drop in the fourth quarter comp and benefits line reflects the specific true up, to your question. But I think we'd have to get back to you if you want to try and reconcile the investment bank numbers with the same detail we've actually done for the group numbers overall in the slide deck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So then the second question was around the &#x2013; whether we could link up the RWA reductions to actual asset reductions and, A, I'm not sure we're getting to that level of disclosure but also it's a little bit of an odd situation because a lot of the Basel III RWA that you're giving rise to are not necessarily on balance sheet items so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we looked at the &#x2013; what we said in the Investment Bank that was about 0.6 billion of costs related to accelerated risk reduction measures and also the wind-down business. Of that 0.6 billion, 149 was in respect of the sale of predominantly securitized product positions. Clearly we sold those and therefore if there was a rebound, then we wouldn't see it, nonetheless, you can see from the analysis we showed of target RWA between the end of 2011 and the first quarter and the balance of this year, there is still further work we need to do in the securitized portfolio so we clearly would benefit from such a thing.</p>
          <p>Within the FIB wind-down business that really reflects two things, the ongoing loss of actually running that portfolio, as well as some costs associated with the 9 billion reduction. So I think you would see some in which we actually sold off and you wouldn't see a recovery. Clearly, the ongoing costs of the wind-down business will depend on the market conditions we have over that. So an improvement in that environment would obviously help our efforts to actually run that out. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think his other specific question was would we be able to link the risk-weighted asset reduction to actual, I guess nominal balance sheet reductions and obviously A, we have not given that level of detail, and B, it's not really necessarily corresponding because some of the Basel III risk-weighted assets and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's true that the overall balance sheet dropped by about 33 billion in the quarter but in reality given that the Basel 2.5, the Basel III assets obviously have a very high capital multiple and we have a lot of other things on the balance sheet at much lower risk levels, it doesn't directly link to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well thanks, that was a lot of questions and you guys gave thorough answers, I appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thanks. Let's go to the next question then. Thanks, Derek.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kian Abouhossein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. A few questions, the first one is on your ROE, 15% that you have achieved so far this year. You have excluded PAF2 which I see you've taken in the first quarter. So if I adjust for it, is it fair to say we are looking more at 11% ROE, that kind of run rate?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the deferred comp. I just wanted to clarify if the CHF 2.4 billion for 2012 expense &#x2013; deferred expenses includes a CHF500 million PAF2?</p>
          <p>And then I have one more question. And the third question is regarding the IB RE, to clarify, I think you said 12% potentially in 2012. If I make kind of back of the envelope calculations, I take your cost savings, I take your deferred out, and I look at how much earnings you generated this year including adjusting for structured liabilities, where you had a lot of gains, I get well below 10%. So should we assume that the revenue should look very different in the IB, or I'm doing something wrong here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the second point on the PAF2, so that was slide 11, that's &#x2013; that number actually includes, the CHF2.4 billion specifically includes the PAF2 expensing in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>I think on the first point about ROE calculations 15, 11, I don't think that we're going to comment any further. We've said that the performance, notwithstanding the uncertain market and economic environment, is consistent with the &#x2013; on an underlying basis with the 15% target we've announced before but I think I'm not sure we get into discussing how PAF2 affects. What we're making clear is that PAF2 will be expensed in the first quarter and is separate from that in terms of the calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But why do you exclude PAF2? I mean that's an expense that somebody gets and will expect to get another one next year, maybe in a different form. I just find it very awkward that you don't see that as an underlying cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I &#x2013; sorry, Brady.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I guess &#x2013; I'm sorry, but it's just I guess &#x2013; all we're trying to do is basically give an indication to how the year has started, to be honest. I mean, because we could get into a long discussion of &#x2013; and we've talked about an operating ROE so obviously, it doesn't probably include things like fair value and debt, etcetera, but we could have a long discussion around what was in, what wasn't in. We're just talking about really how the year started out and so I mean particularly, specifically for PAF, that actually can be awarded and expensed later in quarter, etcetera. But we just didn't want it. We don't &#x2013; obviously we don't want to get into a detailed discussion of what's in there or not. It's more just an indicator that the quarter has started off well, as we said. So I don't think we're going to get into a detailed sort of reconciliation of that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your third question was on the underlying ROE and how that relates to the numbers. I think it's difficult for us to really comment on forward-looking projections. I think what we said back in the third quarter, November, still very much stands and our assessment of the business model in the fourth quarter actually hasn't changed that. If anything, I think we've accelerated certain measures around cost and RWA reduction.</p>
          <p>I think what we said then is that the ROE on average, if we looked to 2010, 2011 would be around 10% to 12%. Clearly, 2011 was actually worse than that. Nonetheless, if you had 2011 again, given we've got a significant reduction in the cost base and a reduction in the RWA relating to the investment bank, I think that probably would improve things. But I think we probably &#x2013; we can't really go beyond that in terms of making forward commitments at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brady, can you maybe just comment about the revenue environment for 2012 relative to 2011 also considering that it's been very tough I guess for you in the second half and particularly in terms of fixed income revenues. Is the base quite low? Should we look at the 2011 revenue environment as a very low base going into 2012 for the IB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; I mean I think the average revenues from 2010 and 2011 in fixed income was about CHF5.5 billion. So that was kind of the average base of revenues in the fixed income business. As you say, I mean I think the second half of the year didn't seem to be a particularly attractive environment for that business, our hope would be that things will be better this year but obviously, who knows? So I think where we &#x2013; but we think probably as the &#x2013; that that as the level over the past couple of years is not a bad place to kind of center expectations around it but obviously, it's very much dependent on market conditions, so I mean it's hard to say.</p>
          <p>I mean so far, as we say, the year started off well, I think people are &#x2013; clearly clients are &#x2013; have increased in their confidence and their activity. Hopefully that will continue but as always, just like last year, there are obviously events could happen which could obviously stall the markets and the activity, which would impact the overall performance, needless to say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I had two questions, one on compensation and one on franchise.</p>
          <p>Just on the compensation issue, I'm just a little bit confused on PAF2 and whether this is substitutive in the 2011 bonus communications or whether its additive. Because if it was substitutive, then I would have thought that you would have paid people CHF500 million less in the 2011 pool and you'd have a bigger claw back than you did in Q4. And on a similar point, if it is part of the 2011 bonus pool, I appreciate the account aspect that you expense it when it vests in Q1, but you could think of it as being part of your 2011 expenses. And if you move into 2011, the investment bank would have been loss-making and generally for risk-taking individuals, if a division is loss-making, they would see adjustments to past remunerations. So I was wondering if that had been a consideration.</p>
          <p>And then the second question was just something on franchise where if I think of a couple of areas that are pretty capital intensive and derivatives with higher counterparty risk charges or leverage loans, derivatives seems to have underperformed for you a bit in Q4. If I look at leveraged loans, the amounts written year-to-date this year are comparable to last year. Last year, you ranked third after the first five weeks of the year in leveraged loans. This year, globally, you're outside the top 10 and I'm just interested, do you see a risk that you've gone first-mover, which I think is justifiable and smart, but if we see a delay to things like the Volcker Rule, the EBA being defanged a little bit with the European banks and a lot of liquidity in the LTRO, if you've gone first-mover and the rest don't follow, do you think there's a risk that your franchise is affected by that? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Matt. I think on the first issue on the PAF2 and etcetera, our &#x2013; basically our considerations were that we thought it was a smart way to obviously distribute compensation to employees but also to be able to materially accelerate the strategy and reduce risk at the same time. So in a sense, it's compensation that we would've paid but it also is being used to accelerate the risk reduction in our strategy overall. And so, that was our main approach to it. Given the structuring, given everything that we had to do on it, it was only really possible to expense that, to complete that and expense it in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So we didn't really have &#x2013; you make it sound like there was maybe an option to do it in 2011 or 2012. We didn't really have that option, so at the end of the day, this was really the only way that we could do it, make the risk transfer effective etcetera, and again, I think it's actually a pretty smart way to kill two birds with one stone in terms of compensation and reducing risk. And so we think it's actually very helpful, but we didn't really have that option on the accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. And I think to make two further points. It is clearly substitutional for other deferred compensation, so it was in substitute for other deferred compensation. If we had not awarded this, then we've &#x2013; I don't know, we would have probably awarded equity or whatever, but it's substitutional and it is included on slide 11 in that 41%. So this is not some further payout in addition to that, the 41% actually includes that in terms of those numbers.</p>
          <p>Because it's a substitute for deferred compensation, it would not affect the amount of CV or cash we actually accrued in 2011. So that's why you don't see a bigger write down than expected when we look to the purely investment bank numbers, so that's how it works. So, that's what I'd add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question on the franchise, I mean, obviously to the extent that &#x2013; I mean we're &#x2013; to the extent that there is not a level playing field around the world, it certainly does impact competitiveness and the franchise generally, I mean, but, by the way, we're already living with that. I mean, we've been on Basel 2.5 since the beginning of last year while many of our competitors are on Basel II or Basel I and that clearly creates an advantage if you're pricing and doing transactions on that basis. So we don't have a &#x2013; we didn't start with sort of a level playing field.</p>
          <p>And in addition, as you know, I mean to some extent I think our strategy is the right one because I do believe that there will be impacts in the markets that we'll see later as others do move to reduce risk etcetera that I think having been first out of the box will be very advantageous. But we also don't have &#x2013; we don't have that much latitude. I mean we're on Basel 2.5, we're going to Basel III. There may be debates about other parts of the world. I'm not sure there's that much of a debate in Switzerland. And so I think for us, we do obviously &#x2013; obviously if other regulators in other parts of the world defer or change their application of some of these rules, that could impact the competitive balance.</p>
          <p>We feel like so far we've managed to remain competitive in our businesses and have &#x2013; continue to have strong market shares and have pretty stable if not growing market shares in many areas. And we hope that will continue. I mean, I'm not sure &#x2013; you took the snapshot on leveraged loans for the first four weeks of the year. I'm not sure that &#x2013; I don't know the numbers here, but I'm not sure that that's relevant to look a one-month snapshot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Relevant and I'm not sure what's data you're exactly looking at. I know in the U.S. with respect to issuance which has been &#x2013; sorry with respect to issuance, it's been pretty robust, we've been sort of at the top with respect to that volume and have been very participatory in that market. So I'm a little surprised. It remains one of our stronger franchises with very high returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So in any case, so there certainly could be competitive impacts, but again, I guess our &#x2013; the negative scenario you can paint is that we're accelerating the changes and we'll be in a sustainable new model, which actually I think is better for investors anyway, because they can actually &#x2013; the questions they've had around business models and how they're going to work would be answered, while others don't have to move to that, that's the negative scenario.</p>
          <p>The positive scenario is we do all this now and others are forced to go into that model on a fairly concentrated basis later on this year or into next year and that causes a significant increase in the costs of actually reducing the RWA balances, etcetera. So that's kind of the bull case on it. So in any case, you can &#x2013; obviously you can &#x2013; we'll see what happens. But we think this is a &#x2013; we think this is the right strategy.</p>

It's been a pretty broad &#x2013; I think things have been &#x2013; we've had an encouraging start to the year, broadly across the business, obviously not every area and not every area equally, but it's been fairly broad. And as you say, it's actually &#x2013; I'd say it's client business. It's definitely client business as well as other parts of the business, and there are no particularly lumpy results in there.

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Philipp Zieschang from UBS, three questions please. The first one is with respect to your fully-phased Basel III target, or illustration of close to 10% in 2013, what is the &#x2013; basically the potential dilution impact, given that you're talking about a partial script dividend, you are adding CHF1.4 billion of deferred comp? How should we kind of think about the impact on issued shares?</p>
          <p>The second one is in terms of your cost reductions, you've mentioned a CHF1.2 billion net for 2012, however, this is excluding the CHF500 million amortization in Q1. Now in general, I thought that your total deferred comp amortization for 2012 is probably CHF800 million lower, which you run through the P&amp;L compared to 2011. So what is basically the total cost benefit from your cost reductions, the CHF1.2 billion from this CH800 million lower amortization of deferred comp? And could you also comment where you see actually underlying offsetting cost growth?</p>
          <p>And the third one is just coming back to the total asset question in &#x2013; for the investment bank, not only for Q4, but in a broader picture, you are reducing your risk-weighted assets under Basel III in fixed income from CHF230 billion to CHF125 billion. Would you expect that to have some meaningful impact on your total balance sheet size, because obviously you could &#x2013; if it is true assets, which it obviously partly is, you would get rid of some long-dated funding, etcetera, so what is, just a sense of the balance sheet potential in terms of the notional footing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Take it? So, taking the questions in order, I think we've said previously when we talked about this in the second or third quarter in terms of the deferred comp award to employees, that we expected approximately 50 billion between &#x2013; or 50 million of incremental shares between what's the midpoint of last year and the end of this year. We've got about another 30 million to actually go through this year. I think the number for next year is likely to be the same order, Philipp. But we'll get back to you in terms of that.</p>
          <p>The other potential dilution, just to be clear, as you know, is, we've said that we're actually offering our shareholders a script alternative, and I think we've assumed in this projection that approximately 50% of shareholders might choose to take up that election. Clearly, we'll find out in due course. If that was the case, then you'd expect that to actually result in another 20 million to 25 million shares, depending on the stock price at the time of that election in the AGM. So that would be the impact this year. Next year, we can revert to you, but it's probably, if we would do exactly the same thing as you'd expect, something the same sort of order of magnitude, if that answers the question.</p>
          <p>The second question then really relates to the cost savings. But I think, to be clear, so the PAF2 charge, I guess you're really comparing if the deferred &#x2013; if it had been regular deferred comp as opposed to a PAF2 accelerated charge, how much of that would have actually come through this year, then to what extent the cost sum is actually benefit? Well, I mean, obviously the PAF2 charge is about 500 million. We would probably expect about 50% to 60% of that to be actually vested in the first year, because it's not level vested through the period under U.S. GAAP. It actually vests more in the first year and then declines thereafterwards.</p>
          <p>So I guess the cost would be better in the whole of the year by the decision to actually accelerate that into the first quarter, although the impact in the first quarter is obviously only a fraction of that benefit. And the CHF1.2 billion number really, therefore, does actually apply whether you include that or not, certainly for the first quarter. If we look at our full-year targets over the next two years, we'll certainly meet the CHF2 billion target, regardless of how you actually meet PAF2. I guess you might say, Philipp, that implies a degree of outperformance against that, because you'd expect to benefit from the PAF2 deferral, you'd be correct in that statement. I think we're quite happy to make that statement and have it stand as it is.</p>
          <p>But clearly, for the first quarter, you have a CHF500 million one-off charge and we would not be able to offset all that CHF500 million one-off charge in the quarter of CHF1.2 billion, which is the saving we'll actually see in the first quarter of 2012. I mean, we did want to make that clear in that sense, because it's a difference from our normal practice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other part of the question was the 800 million reduction in deferral comp costs coming through in 2012, how much of that was &#x2013; how much of that is included in the CHF1.2 billion, or how does that impact the overall cost saving target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'd have to refer on that one. I mean, certainly in the CHF2.4 billion I mentioned before in terms of our likely deferred comp from the CHF3.7 billion, that CHF2.4 billion includes CHF500 million from that, but I'd have to get back to you, Philipp, on the CHF800 million point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the total assets &#x2013; sorry, balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The last question is, if you're &#x2013; the question is the impact on balance sheet, I mean David may have some more specific numbers, obviously, it's a mixture, kind of as we said before, some of the Basel III risk-weighted asset reduction doesn't necessarily apply to on-balance sheet assets. So it is a mixture, but there is clearly some balance sheet reduction as well. I mean I think the overall impact, and I don't know if David has more specific numbers, I don't have more specific numbers at hand. The overall impact is that obviously, from a funding and a balance sheet point of view generally, our requirements are reducing. So in fact, if you look at our funding requirements for this year, for instance, they're actually shrinking, which obviously puts us in an even better position from the point of view of our &#x2013; the funding side of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would &#x2013; looking at the funding requirement as a consequence of the IB's reduction program, we would expect the funding requirement to be about 13 billion to 15 billion lower than it otherwise would have been if we haven't done this. So I guess therefore, our issue requirements for wholesale funding would be less to that amount this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Christian Stark from Cheuvreux. Just a very quick follow up question on the risk-weighted assets, in terms of 2013 sort of look-through calculations, the targeted risk-weighted assets are similar to what you had before because, despite the very good acceleration of the risk-weighted asset reduction, you had negative FX impact. Can you just remind us what the hedging is on the capital ratios, in terms of the regulatory capital hedging in terms of dollars versus risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you look at the projection what we have, of course, is we have an increase in shareholders' equity and then an increase in RWA as a consequence of translating the IB's dollar RWA base into Swiss francs. And just to recall, the investment bank &#x2013; nearly all of it, or the vast majority of its risk weighted assets, is actually dollar-denominated. It's just &#x2013; that's the numbers you see for the investment bank in dollars will actually flow through that.</p>
          <p>It's something we watch very carefully. At the moment, I think that if we were fully neutralized on the dollar, then we'd be something like 66%, 67% of the equity would be. I think as of today, I think we're running, and at the end of last year, we were actually running about 64%, so more or less neutral against &#x2013; in terms of that, so that's why it matches. Sometimes we run that slightly shorter, something longer, but essentially we normally try to be around neutral on this, just to hedge this out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Six Swiss Exchange, <mark type="ph" /> Constantin Naborowski (1:05:54). I've got a question about your sovereign debt exposure. You've got a breakdown here on page 43, and we can see here your exposure to Italy in particular, it's substantially higher compared to other European periphery countries and well, first of all, any particular reason for this and are you looking to reduce this exposure even further, or are you now at a level you're comfortable at?</p>
          <p>And the follow-on question is, yeah, what is your take on the sovereign debt crisis in Europe? How do you see it developing? Do you think we are &#x2013; we've seen the worst behind us now, or how do you see it developing and are you prepared for the worst case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think as you say, we've &#x2013; I mean these are &#x2013; this is a disclosure that we've been making for many quarters now, I think for &#x2013; I don't know, at least a year, maybe longer. So what you see is actually the exposure is small, and it hasn't changed much really over the past quarters or so. So we have almost no exposure, we have almost no net exposure period and then obviously, as you say, gross exposure to Italy is as you can see there.</p>
          <p>Overall, I think we are comfortable with our exposures and the nature of those exposures. And we feel like we're &#x2013; we feel like the &#x2013; where you see the gross to net exposure, we feel comfortable with the effectiveness of those hedges. And so overall, I think we feel pretty comfortable with this exposure.</p>
          <p>Your question as to whether we're ready for the worst case. I think in general, I think we're comfortable with the direct exposures that we have to the sovereign risk in the region. We obviously have other exposure, I would also say quite manageable, to financial institutions and corporates in some of the Eurozone countries. But overall, we think our &#x2013; within the context of the bank overall, we have very manageable exposure here and we certainly think hard about what the various different scenarios might be, but we feel &#x2013; I think, we feel like we're pretty well positioned for that, not that we wouldn't have an impact, obviously, if there was a major event in that area, but we think that, in general, it is manageable. I mean, having &#x20AC;600 million of net exposure to the &#x2013; all of the sovereigns is a pretty manageable number in the context of these risks, we think.</p>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Should we go back here next?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, it's Dirk Becker from Kepler Capital Markets. I have a question on your risk weighted assets reduction. As far as I understand, you made a CHF149 million loss in the fourth quarter on the RWA reduction, and you want to reduce this further now in 2012 and particularly in Q1, and the question is, do you expect a similar loss from the RWA reduction and what should we then expect for Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very good question. Obviously, the cost of the reduction on RWA is dependent upon a number of different factors. And certainly market conditions and in the specific areas that we're looking to reduce is also &#x2013; is a factor. I think what we've said, I think David mentioned that, we actually have pretty good visibility on a pretty substantial reduction in the first quarter. We've mentioned that we're going to get to CHF215 billion by the end of the quarter. And frankly, most of that is &#x2013; are reductions that we already have good visibility on, and we feel like the costs will be relatively manageable, reasonable costs within that.</p>
          <p>So it's hard to say exactly what the cost will be because obviously, it is somewhat dependent on markets, but we don't think there'll be a major cost associated with the reductions that we're looking at in the first quarter. But also, as you could see, some of the businesses that we're exiting continue to have exposures, those will also be &#x2013; those could also be impacted by market movements in the first quarter. Those could either be, as was mentioned earlier, positive or negative, but we still do have exposure in those businesses as well.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, just to be clear, the CHF149 million was specifically related to securitized products, and it was related to the CHF25 billion reduction you actually saw in those numbers between CHF73 billion in the third quarter and CHF48 billion at the end of the quarter, and we've obviously separated it because it contributed to the overall securitized product net revenue that we saw in the MD&amp;A, basically. I think it was more triggered by the fact we were obviously selling down in an illiquid market that did that, not particularly a marking issue or anything like that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I've got three questions. Firstly, could you talk a bit more about the gross margin in wealth management, the 109, and what we could see for 2012, and how that ties in with your statement about the start to the year?</p>
          <p>The second issue is net new money. Obviously, you've got a target, and you're coming &#x2013; the net new money has been slowing over the quarters, could you talk about what's happening there, particularly the slowdown in the Asian numbers?</p>
          <p>And the third issue is, apologies if you already mentioned this, but how does PAF &#x2013; have you been specific on how PAF works from an RWA reduction? Was that &#x2013; just to clarify, was that seen in the Q4 number and how much is it? Do I just times the 500 by 12.5? I'm just trying to work out what that gave to RWA reduction. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe &#x2013; I'll ask Hans-Uli to address the first two questions, but maybe I can take the third question first, which is, as we said, the PAF2 &#x2013; first of all, the PAF2 structure is really focused on risk reduction, that's our focus.</p>
          <p>Now, there will be other ancillary impacts, but it's really focused on risk reduction. It's also only effective in the first quarter, so there is no reduction in risk, or RWA for that matter, in the fourth quarter that's attributable to the PAF structure, because it's only actually put in place in the first quarter. And then furthermore, we're not &#x2013; we've shown some, I think, pretty specific RWA targets. But we're not going to go into a lot of detail about how we're going to get into that by line items, so...</p>
          <p>So, Hans-Uli, why don't I ask you to address the gross margin...?</p>

          <p>On the margin side, our target 125 to 135 is an over-the-cycle margin, of course. Now, in this environment, with this low-interest environment with a risk adverse portfolio mix, with a lot of liquidity, then of course it's, on the short-term basis, it's not possible to have this 125 or 135. So we expect that it's closer, when we look one or two quarters ahead, what we have seen in 2011.</p>
          <p>Perhaps to the net new asset growth you have seen, it's still altogether private banking, CHF44 billion or CHF37 billion at wealth management, it's an impressive number also last year. So what we have seen in the market because of the macroeconomic environment is also a lot of de-leveraging. So because the low-interest environment was leading that some private clients really used to do deleveraging. And therefore, it depends on the macroeconomic environment, now going forward, but it's not a trend. It's really specific to this issue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just add, I completely agree with what Hans-Uli said. I would just say, on the net new money side actually, fourth quarter private banking number of CHF7.5 billion doesn't represent slowing. That's actually, on a seasonal basis, that's a pretty good number. And if you look back the last couple of fourth quarters, there is a seasonal slowdown there. So frankly, the full-year number and the fourth quarter number are pretty strong. So I don't think we view that as a slowing and we hope &#x2013; I mean, we hope that's confirmed in the first quarter, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I just clarify on that? Is that because you are including kind of more retail and corporate banking size, rather than just looking at wealth management, so is it just as a different mix or kind of type of clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean the wealth management as well is that there's a seasonal impact to it, so if you look at the wealth management specific numbers in the fourth quarter, you go back the last couple years, there are seasonal outflows for tax payments and the holiday season and other things. So there is a seasonal element to it, so whether you talk about private banking as a whole or you talk about wealth management, we think that holds.</p>
          <p>And then the only other thing I would mention, because you talked about the start to this year etcetera, with regard to the gross margin and I completely agree with Hans-Uli's comments and as you know, I mean it's the private banking business is a business that moves more slowly. And so we obviously saw a couple of encouraging ticks up in the net interest margin, etcetera, in the fourth quarter. We obviously hope that continues and we hope that, over time, the gross margin will recover, but it's obviously something that is more gradual and not really &#x2013; frankly, not really something that you see change dramatically in a four- or six-week period, frankly.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Kinner Lakhani from Citi. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Most of my questions have been answered, I guess, but just maybe &#x2013; just come back to slide 22 and on the $48 billion of risk weighted assets on wind-down, I'm still struggling, and maybe I missed a few points, but I'm still struggling to understand, broadly speaking, what the main categories of that $48 billion are, so any kind of color you can give us on that would be great.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the basis risk, that was clearly an issue that some of your &#x2013; or at least one or two of your U.S. peers had talked about through their results. But the effect, or the impact, on your FICC revenues was much more dramatic. I can maybe partly understand that by business mix, but was there anything specific there in terms of your positioning, which maybe hurt you more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you take the first part of the question and then I'll start the second and maybe, Eric, you could add to it if you need to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, slide 22, the $48 billion of wind-down, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slide 22?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The $48 billion. So that splits into two components. Firstly is $10 billion relating to the separate wind-down business we established at the beginning of 2009 and we've sold about 5/6 of those positions now, if you go back to what we said over the last three years. What is remaining in that portfolio, there is still some tail exposure to certain CMBS positions we had at that time. There's also power and gas contracts and one other &#x2013; some other small assets. But I mean essentially, most of that portfolio has actually been sold over the last three years.</p>
          <p>If you're then referring to the other $38 billion separate from that, that really is what we try to basically break up in the box on the right hand side. Now most of the CMBS we had from the re-entry last year has actually been expired. You've still got some correlation credit exposure which is sitting there. About 60% of that has actually been worked off in the fourth quarter. And there is still some EM hard currency in there, which has come down by about 40%. But in reality, I mean I think the largest component of this would be what we talked about back in November, which is the long dated swap exposure in the rates business, which is, as you know, quite highly calibrated under the Basel III rules due to the &#x2013; particularly when it's un-collateralized or when there's mismatch. So that would be the single largest component of the $38 million that you might say we added this quarter in terms of that &#x2013; in terms of those positions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's very helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question on the basis risk, just again to reiterate, I think the fixed income results were really a function of a few things, one is just the overall environment which obviously everyone in the industry experienced and then we think in areas like emerging markets and rates, etcetera, we had solid performances that clearly impacted.</p>
          <p>Secondly was these costs that we incurred of the risk-weighted asset write-down, some of the accelerated costs, and so basically that obviously did impact that. But we did, as you say, do feel that there was an issue around &#x2013; particularly in our structured products and credit businesses, some of the basis risk, so I don't know, Eric, if you want to &#x2013; but I just think it's hard to quantify that in the context of what you see in the numbers but maybe Eric can give us a little more insight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't trade particularly well in credit or structured products in the fourth quarter and that led to I think a disappointing performance most specifically in structured products. We did see times in the fourth quarter where the cash positions in structured products were deteriorating. We had mark-to-market losses and at the same time, hedges rallied and we had losses on hedges and that's probably the biggest single item in terms of real change in terms of Q-over-Q that we saw in terms of trading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just follow-up with one more, just the principal risk that we have in the asset management division? I think there might have been some small, kind of impact on that in Q4, but how do you feel about that portfolio? I think it's about $3 billion, $3.5 billion portfolio going forward?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Private equity position? Do you want to address that, Rob?</p>

          <p>Private equity. That's it. Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do use balance sheet primarily in some of the private equity portfolios. It's about $3.5 billion of balance sheet, so there's not &#x2013; there hasn't been a material movement in those positions in the last couple of years. In fact, our actual risk weighted assets in the business have actually gone down over the last couple of years as we try to get more efficient and raise more third party capital relative to our overall asset base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Well, I think with that, we probably ought to wind up to finish up at the appointed time. Thanks a lot for all your questions.</p>
          <p>I would just like to sum up a little bit. I mean, obviously, as I said, 2011 was a transitional year for us. We do believe we took decisive and aggressive steps to evolve the business model. We did make significant progress in adapting to the new market and the regulatory environment. Aggressively reduced risks and costs in the second half of the year and redeployed resources to a number of our client-focused growth businesses. As I said, we did take these steps because we're convinced they will benefit our clients, reward shareholders in the long-term and position us to achieve superior returns.</p>
          <p>There's no doubt that the fourth quarter was impacted by these actions. However, we were able to take these measures while maintaining an industry leading capital position and a strong client franchise. And, as we pointed out, our capital ratios actually strengthened during the quarter. As we said, we're obviously mindful that market and economic environment remains uncertain, but we are encouraged that the business is off to a good start in 2012. And as we said, year-to-date underlying return on equity is consistent with that 15% target level. And that obviously includes some of the benefit from our risk and cost reduction plans.</p>
          <p>So we do believe that the client-focused strategy coupled with a strong capital base, conservative funding and liquidity and a clean balance sheet, do put us in a position to pursue and gain market share across all of our businesses.</p>
          <p>And finally, we do remain focused on delivering consistent industry-leading returns to our shareholders and ensuring that Credit Suisse maintains its strong franchise, improves profitability and continues to grow. And we are confident that the measures described here today have positioned Credit Suisse for success in the new environment.</p>
          <p>So thanks very much everybody for your attention. Appreciate your time. Thank you.</p>
