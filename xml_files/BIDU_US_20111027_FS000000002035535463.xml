          <p>Hello and thank you for standing by for Baidu's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only-mode. After management's prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's conference, Victor Tseng, Baidu's Investor Relations Director.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to Baidu's Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We distributed Baidu's third quarter 2011 earnings release earlier today. You can find a copy of the press release on the company's IR website as well as on Newswire services.</p>
          <p>Today, you will hear from Robin Li, Baidu's Chief Executive Officer and Jennifer Li, Baidu's Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, Robin and Jennifer will answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we proceed, please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements made under the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in our public filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 20-F. Baidu does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement except as required under applicable law.</p>
          <p>Our earnings press release in this call include discussions of certain unaudited non-GAAP financial measures. Our press release contains a reconciliation of the unaudited non-GAAP measure to the unaudited most directly comparable GAAP measures, and is available on our IR website at ir.baidu.com.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a webcast of this conference call will be available on Baidu's corporate website.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's call. I'll start today by reviewing our results for the third quarter and taking a look at the key trends and growth drivers. Then, I'll talk about the exciting new initiatives we launched recently. And finally, I'll update you on our strategic investment projects.</p>
          <p>Looking first at our results. It has been another stellar quarter for Baidu with revenues accelerating 85% year-on-year. In particular, we see three main factors underpinning robust revenue growth in Q3. First, traffic growth maintained its strong momentum in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Second, we made solid progress on monetization. ARPU growth was at a record high of more than 65% year-on-year. This was largely driven by enhancements to our Phoenix Nest platform. For example, we introduced a new keyword matching option called advanced brief match. This is more focused than the traditional broad match, but offers more flexibility and higher coverage than the exact match. So, it better captures user intent and improves click-through rate and improved click-through quality. And we are seeing very encouraging adoption rates so far. And there are still many other levers in Phoenix Nest that we can pull out to drive further monetization efficiency.</p>
          <p>The third factor influencing our strong revenue growth was the increasing spending by our large accounts, which has been a priority for Baidu.</p>
          <p>One source of strong revenue growth was once again the e-commerce sector. In particular, the revenues contributed by the online retail sector retained impressive momentum, growing over 100% year-over-year. Separately, classified information websites, spending also maintained a strong upward trend, increasing by over 50% quarter-on-quarter. So you can see that because of our central position in China's Internet ecosystem we can always benefit enormously from emerging growth areas. While it is difficult to predict the future of any single industry category, the overall online marketing spending trajectory for our large account remained very positive.</p>
          <p>Another area of strong revenue growth was in customers from more traditional industries. We benefited as these customers transitioned from offline to online marketing. The auto industry is a good example of this emerging trend. These established offline businesses increasingly recognize the value of Baidu's online marketing platform and are allocating larger percentages of their advertising budget to us.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, our top verticals continued to grow healthily as well and remain an important part of Baidu's revenue makeup. In Q3, we continued to optimize our sales process. The goal is to ensure customer quality and improve sales efficiency for small and medium-sized customers. Complementing this push, we have deepend our commitment to creating a better, cleaner Internet ecosystem.</p>
          <p>Under the banner of Operation Sunshine, Baidu has forged alliances with major stakeholders, including government ministries and agencies, industry associations and the media. Operation Sunshine is part of a long-term effort of which the Chinese government has been very supportive.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to talk about some of our new initiatives; Baidu's new personalized homepage feature went live in the beginning of September. The personalized homepage represents the next step in the evolution of Baidu.</p>
          <p>From simple web search to open data, to open applications and now to personalized and direct feed that instantly meets users' needs. This new feature gives users who are signed in Baidu a more personalized experience based on their historical search behavior. For example, if a frequent moviegoer tends to search for local cinema times, we'll include that link on his personal homepage. Or if a user engaging often searches for weather, we will include that link on the Baidu homepage to updating weather forecast automatically. So the personalized homepage brings not just a general information but personal information as well.</p>
          <p>This is a great example of how Baidu is integrating search with users' social activity. We will tightly integrate Baidu's own search social products, like Baidu Post Bar and Space also as external social platforms to satisfy users' social need.</p>
          <p>Another useful thing about our personalized homepage is that users don't have to do anything. An intelligent recommendation engine customizes their homepage for them based on their behavior and social interactions. This means that the success of the homepage does not depend on users being proactive. These features will ensure that Baidu is the logical starting point for more and more Internet users and will keep users on our site longer.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our mobile strategy, where we've also made important progress. First, we are extending our partnerships with mobile phone makers. Baidu is now the default search engine on over 80% of branded handsets using the Android operating system built in China so far this year.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have made tremendous progress in ensuring that Baidu is the gateway to the Internet for Chinese users, whether they are going online on PCs or on mobile devices. At the same time, last quarter, we announced our announced our new E-mobile platform. E is designed to provide Baidu services to users on the go. We have an incredible suite of products and we want Baidu users to be able to use them anywhere, any time.</p>
          <p>Once devices featuring our platform are available in the mass market, Baidu E will give mobile users easy access to our search box, let them skim their music through Baidu ting!, find their destinations on Baidu Maps and use a growing number of web-based apps. This seamless access to Baidu's product across platforms, will increase users' business and ensure that we remain as the center of online experience for Chinese users.</p>
          <p>All of these features will be constantly integrated with Baidu's evolving cloud computing offering and we have plenty more exciting features in the pipeline. Also, through Baidu E, third-party developers will gain access to Baidu's suite of mobile products and services. Developers will have APIs to complete search, maps, payments and more into the apps for the E-platform.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'd like to update to our strategic investment. Our online leading platform GE continue to grow at a very encouraging rate. During Q3, we saw monthly unique visitors jumped to 191 million from 160 million in Q2. Both comScore and iResearch showed that GE is one of the leading video sites in user time spent on site. One of the key factors setting GE apart from the competition is differentiated high-quality content.</p>
          <p>To keep its edge, GE has signed licensing agreements with the Big Six, the top-tier movie content providers, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Sony, Disney and Universal. We are really encouraged by how quickly GE has captured a huge share of this very competitive market. Baidu is fully committed to supporting GE to grow further and will be backing this up with further investment.</p>
          <p>As you know, we recently invested in online travel vertical Qunar. With that deal now completed, high-quality travel-related information from Qunar has been further integrated into Baidu search in areas like hotels, airlines and train information. For example, when users search for a hotel chain like Holiday Inns, on the result page, they'll see a Baidu map that automatically picks up the user's location and provides a comprehensive list of Holiday Inn's hotel option in that geography, along with pricing information. Or a flight search will show you the recent price trend for your desired flight, so you can see if the cost has been falling or increasing. The net effect of this upgrade is rather to box computing coverage of travel-related keywords for our users and better fix through-rate.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, Baidu's strategic investments, combined with our robust organic growth and new innovated products, are solidifying our position at the heart of Chinese Internet ecosystem. We have every reason for confidence in our prospects for the future.</p>
          <p>With that, let me now turn the call over to Jennifer for financial highlights.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. As Robin mentioned, Q3 was another stellar quarter that exceeded expectations. This was driven by traffic growth, monetization improvements and strong spending by large accounts. In order to ensure that Baidu continues to stay ahead of the curve, we maintained investment in critical areas: R&amp;D, infrastructure, and strategic initiatives. Going forward, aggressive investment will remain central to our long-term growth strategy and driving top-line growth. I would like to highlight that starting in Q3, Qunar's financials have been consolidated into our financials. The overall impact on Baidu's financials has so far been insignificant.</p>
          <p>Also, as Robin mentioned, we'll continue to support Qiyi's rapid growth. Our cash investment of US$23 million in Qiyi this quarter was recorded as a loss under the equity accounting method. Our overall EPADS would have been US$0.91 without this charge. We anticipate a similar level of cash investment in Qiyi in this Q4. After that, we'll assess from time-to-time what are the optimal options available for Baidu in supporting Qiyi. Baidu and its partners will firmly support Qiyi.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at the financial highlights for the quarter. All amounts mentioned are in RMB, unless otherwise noted. Online marketing revenue for the third quarter of 2011 were RMB4.2 billion, an 85% increase year-on-year. Baidu had around 304,000 active online marketing customers in the third quarter of 2011, a 12% increase from the corresponding period last year and a 2% increase from the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer in the third quarter reached approximately RMB13,700, a 65% increase from the corresponding period in 2010 and a 19% increase from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition cost, as a component of cost of revenue, was RMB334 million or 8% of total revenue as compared to 8.9% in the corresponding period in 2010 and 7.9% in the second quarter of 2011. As we noted before, in the longer term we expect traffic acquisition cost, as a percent of revenues, to gradually increase based on the extent of contextual advertising growth. Contextual ads are an important initiative for Baidu and require a higher payout ratio to Baidu Union partners.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth costs, as a component of cost of revenue, were RMB166 million, representing 4% of total revenue, compared to 3.8% in the corresponding period in 2010. This increase reflects increase in server capacity to accommodate traffic growth, new product services and higher computing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:17:05).</p>
          <p>Depreciation cost, as a component of cost of revenue, were RMB177 million, representing 4.2% of total revenues compared to 3.7% in the corresponding period in 2010. The increase was mainly due to an increase in network infrastructure capacity. We will continue to aggressively invest in network infrastructure and building more office space.</p>
          <p>Operational cost were RMB125 million, representing 3% of total revenue compared to RMB85 million and 2.5% in Q2 of 2011. The main part of the sequential increase was due to pickup of intangible assets amortization related to Qunar transaction. The useful life of this intangible asset runs from three to 10 years, so we expect this will be an ongoing item in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense were RMB460 million, an increase of 22% quarter-over-quarter. This increase primarily reflects increased personnel cost, marketing expenses and, of course, Qunar financial consolidation.</p>
          <p>Research and development expenses was RMB383 million, a 28% increase quarter-over-quarter. This increase primarily reflects increased head count and, of course, including Qunar financial consolidation.</p>
          <p>Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating cost and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB39 million in the third quarter of 2011 from RMB24 million in the corresponding period in 2010. Operating profit was RMB2.2 billion, an 88% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Loss from equity method accounting was RMB156 million. This increase mainly reflects the cash investment we made in Qiyi this past quarter.</p>
          <p>Total head count as of September 30, 2011, was about 14,700, roughly 1,900 more than the previous quarter. This includes about 800 employees from Qunar now consolidated in our head count.</p>
          <p>Income tax expense was RMB318 million for the third quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.5%, as compared to 13.6% for the corresponding period in 2010. The year-on-year increase was due to expiration of some PRC subsidiaries' preferential tax rate.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to Baidu was about RMB1.9 billion, an 80% increase from corresponding period in 2010. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu Inc. per ADS for the third quarter of 2011 amounted to RMB5.39 and RMB5.38 respectively. Net income, attributable to Baidu Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, was about RMB1.9 billion, a 79% increase from the corresponding period in 2010. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu Inc. per ADS, excluding share-based compensation expense, both non-GAAP measures, were RMB5.50 and RMB5.49 respectively.</p>
          <p>As of December 30, 2011, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB11.4 billion. Net operating cash inflow and capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2011 were RMB1.8 billion and RMB490 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Now, let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the fourth quarter 2011. We currently expect total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 to be between RMB4.41 billion and RMB4.54 billion, which would represent a 79.9% to 85% year-over-year growth. This forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

In order to be fair to all callers who wish to ask questions, we will take one question at a time from each caller.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning and congrats on a very strong quarter. My first question is on the revenue contribution from SME. Robin mentioned that very strong growth in large customer and classified sites. I wonder what is the revenue contribution of SME customer. What is it the growth rate and what kind of ARPU for these <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:22:52) customers? If you can share some insight, that'd be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dick. I think this quarter, across the board, all the different customer bases grow very strongly. And they all contributed to the end of the day the revenue growth. The large accounts outperformed the SME, but SME is continuing to grow very strongly both on a year-on-year basis as well as on sequential basis. We have year-on-year 85% increase. Both SME and larger comps did well, but larger comp is growing faster than SME for this quarter. And it is actually has been the trend for the past few quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions, and congratulations on the very strong results. So, for Q3, your strong growth of roughly 85% year-over-year, I was wondering, could you please sort of roughly break it down for us in terms of, okay, how much was due to the traffic growth, how much was the monetization improvement, how much is sort of a price appreciation? And any color on those metrics for 2012 would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's combination of all factors. Traffic continued to grow strongly. The ACP increase was pretty much due to the value mix because the internal larger accounts are willing to pay higher prices. We're also seeing a good contribution from existing verticals, as well as newly emerging verticals. The B2C e-commerce has been very strong. Virtually almost all of the larger B2C sites are large customers of ours, and we see very strong momentum of the mega trend, the O2O mega trend, offline to online, and a lot of that virtual industries are moving their business from offline to online. So we are a big beneficiary of that.</p>
          <p>It's very hard to separate all the sectors and pick out which one contributed more, but what we can tell is that the advertisers are generally very happy about the performance, so that helps us. We still have lot of room to grow.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning and also congratulations on the strong results. I was wondering in terms of the Phoenix Nest enhancements that you discussed, are you seeing this as contributing already a material proportion of your paid clicks in the third quarter or going forward in the fourth quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as I have mentioned during the prepared remarks, advanced brief match did contribute quite significantly to the overall revenue growth, in particular the number of paid clicks. In the past, advertisers or customers only had two options, they either choose the exact match or the broad match. Some thought that the broad match was too broad. Some thought the exact match doesn't match all the user queries with their interest, with the customer's interest. But this new option more advertisers or customers can become more aggressive in showing their ads or paid links results. This started in Q3 and we will benefit from now on. So Q4, we'll also benefit from this. There are still quite a few things like this we are working on. We'll report that as we achieve those goals.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up on the previous question. How much impact in your guidance is really attribute to the new tweak in the Phoenix Nest, compared to any material contributions from the new homepage? Or are you expecting any greater-than-expected contributions from Qunar? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the first part of the question. The new homepage does not have a positive impact on revenue yet. It even has a slight negative impact because the users would search a little less with the new homepage &#x2013; but the new homepage, obviously, this year and we hope going forward people will stay longer on Baidu's site and use our site as the starting point more frequently. So the improvements we've made in the Phoenix Nest contributed the most from an product point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any improvement we have done on a monetization front, those will carry forward and we'll continue to refine and improve the monetization capability as Robin mentioned.</p>
          <p>To your question on Qunar contribution, as I mentioned, Qunar's overall impact to the Baidu overall picture is really small and it doesn't really make sense for us to isolate the Qunar our revenue per se just for the Q4. And as Qunar becomes a more meaningful part of Baidu, we'll certainly separately disclose that, but I think in the near term, it's very minimal.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Two questions. The first one is about your other revenues. Could you give us more colors on the increase of other revenues in the quarter? And then secondly, could you also give us the top five advertiser categories and where online companies are flash e-comers, the band within the ranking of your advertiser category? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You will notice there is a slight other revenue number in our reported financial. Our main revenue is online marketing services. And we have set up some business ventures that you are aware like Baidu HR to provide other services. So this more other revenue is basically a reflection of those non-online marketing services that we generate.</p>
          <p>As to your second question, related to the top five sectors, these remain largely the familiar ones: the medical and healthcare sector, occupation, machinery equipment, travel and business service. Those were the top five sectors for us in Q3. As we mentioned in our script, online e-commerce continues to be a main driver and continue to grow very strongly. As we've mentioned in the past, Eddie, we do not separately identify these because that will distort the way that we actually traditionally track our different sectors. But we are able to tell you the online e-commerce sector continued to outpace the general 85% increase and has been growing by over 100% for the Q3 bill.</p>

          <p>Hi, Paul. For Baidu's new personalized homepage, users do not need to separately sign up. As some actually have a Baidu account, whenever they log in, they will see the personalized home page as their default home page. The adoption rate has been healthy. I think users are acceptable to this new homepage setting. The benefit of this is obviously users, in a lot of cases, do not even need to search to reach the site that they are interested in, and also they can reach the feed they find on other social sites. So users will be able to view a lot more information than before on the Baidu homepage; that includes the social information both on where with Baidu social product like Post Bar or Baidu Space as well as social feeds from other sites. We believe that personalization is a very fundamental need from our users and is also underserved our effort devoted to this direction instead of developing a single social network site. That's been our strategy.</p>

          <p>Hi, Robin, Jennifer. Thanks for taking my call. I have a question regarding GE and two parts. Can you just give us a little more color on advertising spending trend on GE, especially given its robust unique visitor growth as well as traffic growth? And going forward, shall we be able to see more cross selling and for advertising service between Baidu and GE?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>GE is a joint venture. We have been pretty much focused on expanding the user base and the improved user experience. Because of the nature of online video, I think that this model is quite clear, which is advertising. And we are basically competing for media time on this front. So we are not so worried about the revenue opportunities of this venture. We have talked to the GE team on cross selling, but we have not really done much in the past. Going forward, that's certainly a real possibility.</p>

          <p>Good morning, and my congratulations. I was seeing impressive growth and an impressive guidance. Maybe you could talk a little bit about what are some examples of further improvements you have got for me you can still make and perhaps compare that to Google's platforms. And at what stage are you in terms of your platform relative to Google? Thank you.</p>

          <p>It's very hard for us to compare this with our competitors. We don't know exactly what they have done and what they are doing. We have stated that we have lots of room for improvement in the Phoenix Nest system. Basically, there are two main areas that we can improve upon. One is the mechanism side. As I mentioned, the advance brief matching, it's basically a changing mechanism. The other side is the account management so to speak. The CRI system how do we provide tools for our customers to better manage their marketing campaign. We just got started on that front. We believe a better management system or more tools will help a lot of the customers, especially the small and medium customers to spend more comfortably on our platform.</p>
          <p>So what I can tell you is that we have a lot of levers here and we are continuing to monitor the ROI for our customers. We believe as we move on we'll be able to release the buying power from both the large customers and the SMEs.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I have a question on the customer acquisition. It seems like you've added about 6,000 customers in the quarter. The year-over-year growth has some deceleration there, but you also, in the meantime, book a strong ARPU growth. So my question is, is it because you have a lot of large customers with stronger spending power that has flattened some of the SMEs customers, so the customer acquisition has slowed? So any color on that would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

          <p>I think it's a number of reasons. First, as you correctly realized, our focus was more on the larger accounts over the past couple of quarters. The desire to spend and the budget is when our platform is really high. Secondly, we also realized that there's some macroeconomic reason for the &#x2013; China is gradually moving away from the export-oriented economy, so there's rebalancing of the macro economy. Some of our export-oriented customers are not doing so well. And thirdly, the SMEs do not really have the necessary tools to really spend on our platform and we are working on that too.</p>

As we mentioned, we continue to improve our monetization capability and that in itself helps improve the click-through rate and generally, it's the number of clicks that will ultimately deliver the customers the ROI. We continue to have ways to refine our monetization platform and anticipated paid clicks as usual, the trend has been increasing and growing healthily for our customers and that, there's no reason for us to think why that shouldn't be the case going forward.</p>

The business initiative is tracking well. We're pleased to see the progress. And as I indicated in my script, over the longer term, as we gradually improve and taking traction on this business, you should expect the TAC rates to increase accordingly because for this business, it's an important initiative and we do pay out a higher payout ratio to our union partners. So over time gradually, as we gain traction from this business, you should expect TAC to increase.</p>

What we have control over is our own process. We have put a lot of effort as part of our normal business process to ensure that we service our end users with quality content information and we're vigilant in terms of developing our advertisers. There is &#x2013; it's very hard for us to say, one way or another, how this will affect us, but I don't &#x2013; we are doing things that we have control over.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. I think that it's definitely true that the large accounts are very much aware of the trend. From the companies or customers I have been talking to, they all have amended from the higher level that they should allocate more of their budget, more of their advertising budgets to online, to search. And among all of the advertising forms, search obviously provides the best performance. So it's much easier for them to show to their boss economic factors that advertise accounting is on Baidu, while on the other advertising platforms, online or offline, it's much harder to demonstrate that. So search has definitely become a key advertising platform for them.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations for a great quarter. I have two questions. From your current business development activities, especially with the SMEs, does management see stronger take-up of search marketing from third tier and interior of China? And then do you anticipate any &#x2013; or have you observed any weakness from the current credit crunch in some of the places for SME companies? And the second question is can management give any guidance expected run rate investment in Qiyi and Qunar for 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first one. Baidu's business is largely consumer or domestic consumption oriented. The large cities still contribute super majority of our revenue and the growth rate is also higher. You can probably imagine if these large accounts are growing faster, than the revenue contribution from the major cities are getting larger instead of smaller. So, from this point of view, the third tier cities are not &#x2013; they are growing fast but not as fast as the large cities. Because of our limited exposure to build very, very small cities and very, very small enterprises, we have not got any sense on the impact of the credit crunch you mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And with regards to support from Baidu towards Qiyi and Qunar. Qiyi, as I mentioned, we supported Qiyi with cash investment in Q3 and will do a similar cash investments injection into Qiyi in Q4. And after that, we'll address from time to time what is the optimal options that we have to support this venture. So if we &#x2013; as the time comes, then we'll let you know if there's any new development.</p>
          <p>With regards to Qunar, we acquired the majority of the company and Qunar has sufficient cash. On an ongoing basis, Qunar's own business is growing very healthily, has very little demand for additional cash from our perspective. So in the near-term, I do not expect that Qunar will call for cash contribution from Baidu.</p>

          <p>Hi good morning. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. I just want to ask a little about the mobile space. Can you give us some insight into the mobile search area? How much of your current search volumes come from mobile devices? And also, is there a difference or any difference between your online and mobile pay click behaviors and how you actually monetize those clicks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mobile search is a little bit different from the PC search. It's kind of hard to compare on an apple-to-apple basis, each mobile page is generally much shorter than a PC page. So number of page views on the mobile side is different from the number of page views on the PC side.</p>
          <p>The industry, I think it's very hard to say. We're still trying to optimize the mobile search experience. We have not been very aggressive in monetizing the mobile traffic yet. We do plan to optimize the advertising part of mobile too. For example, we would allow our customers to show the phone number and consumers can just click on those numbers and make phone calls. This is not possible on the PC side. So mobile is growing faster than PC, but it's still a relative small part from the page view point of view and it's an even smaller part from the revenue point of view.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have a question on competition especially on verticals, such as like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:50:50). So I think in rest of world, we haven't really seen a successful vertical search elsewhere, but neither have we seen a country which 80% of the gross merchandise value is being controlled by one company. So I just wanted to get your sense of how do you see the competition or competitive landscape going forward in this particular vertical search? What do you think is the advantage or disadvantage of Baidu versus your competitor? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, our fundamental belief is that users, most of the users, are lazy. They don't want to distinguish their information needs from shopping, to cars, to lifestyle. So any type of information needs, they naturally come to Baidu and search for it. And we have the largest user base and we have the most sophisticated search technology. So we are quite confident users will be increasingly relying upon by Baidu for all types of information needs.</p>
          <p>This is also true for e-commerce related information needs. Like I mentioned before, virtually all of the large B2C e-commerce sites advertise on us. That's because we can drive traffic, we can drive very good quality traffic to those sites and users. It's a trend as you probably also agree that more of the shopping activities will happen on those credible larger e-commerce sites and we are certainly a big beneficiary of that trend.</p>

          <p>In general, I think we saw a big increase in terms of group buying sites getting promotional activities on our platform and there has been in our sector some level of consolidation. On our platform, we continue to see the group buying sites are spending with us. The e-commerce site, as I mentioned, continues to grow very strongly. So these sectors, over the past few quarters, has been growing very nicely.</p>
          <p>As Robin mentioned, we are really at the center stage in terms of the overall Internet activity development and the growing of transition of users to take advantage of Internet space to do e-commerce activities. Ultimately, Baidu will be the beneficiary. At this, they do not make up to be the top sectors in terms of revenue contribution, so any slight variations in that sector does not really have a material impact to our bottom line. But of course, we're very excited to see the e-commerce sector growing nicely and Baidu is ready in the center of all the activity.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter. Large advertisers are clearly playing a big role here. So what percentage of the large advertisers' total marketing budgets and online advertising budgets is currently being spent on search? And, in your opinion, how high can that number go? And then I have a follow up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really varies from customer to customer and from industry to industry. Some of the more Internet savvy accounts spend virtually all of their budget on the Baidu search platform while for the other more offline oriented businesses they still only allocate a very small percentage of their total advertising budget to us. So it varies from like the 80%, 90% of the budget for those really online-centric side to like less than 10% online marketing budget for those more traditional businesses. But the trend is that they are allocating more budget to online and an even larger percentage is allocated on search.</p>
          <p>Of course, you can tell that a much larger portion of the economy comes from those offline businesses and, in general, they spend around like 10% of the advertising budget online. And then of online, they spend like 30%, 40% on search. So we definitely have a lot of room for growth there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And my follow up question is travel is one of the major advertiser verticals for you. So, as you integrate Qunar into Baidu, what is the reaction that you're getting from your travel sector advertisers? Does it change your role as a partner? And what is the benefit to monetization that you might be getting from the travel pay per clicks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Qunar is essentially a vertical search engine. It satisfies the needs of our users' travel activities. So it's very hard to separate the Baidu searches from the Qunar searches. We continue to serve our customers from all kinds of travel-related businesses. They have a choice to run their marketing campaign on the Baidu platform or the Qunar platform.</p>
          <p>Qunar is more detail-oriented, more specific on a lot of things. For Baidu, we are more generic. So, in this sense, maybe more of the Baidu users, they may not have that clear intention of where to go, or what to do, that sort of thing. They will come to Baidu and we try to convert that into the real travel customers. But for Qunar, the users in general have a better idea of what they would like to do and where they would like to go, so they go there and find the right information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The objective for us to acquire Qunar is really to ultimately provide our users a better search, a better overall search experience, as they're looking for travel-related information. So, as they get into Baidu, and they're looking for travel information, they really land on a premium, high quality, vertical, travel search information. And, in general, we're providing travel search information. And as you are looking for travel businesses, there are a whole slew of different players and the different stage of activities that the user will carry out, such as transaction, such as commenting.</p>
          <p>And just in terms of our relationship, we see other travel sector players, we don't see any slowdown in terms of their advertising activities on our platform. And, in fact, in Q3, sequentially, travel was a very strong sector that see a strong sequential growth. And the notable travel players that you will have the familiar names, they are all increasing their spending in Q3 with us.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have two housekeeping questions. The first is regarding your margin. Gross margin and operating margin both hold up quite well in Q3, despite of the increasing bandwidth costs and also <mark type="ph" /> any transition (1:00:34) costs for intangibles. So can you give some color for operating margin and gross margin for Q4, especially sales marketing cost, how will that change up in Q4?</p>
          <p>And my second housekeeping question is regarding Qunar. Just to double check, is this Qunar revenue included in the online marketing revenue in your revenue breakdown? If this is the case, has your number of advertiser figure and all of your ARPU figure include the Qunar contribution as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, in terms of margin, margin is really a reflection of the speed of revenue growth and also the speed of our investment. Our top priority is really focused to drive the top-line growth and, as mentioned in quite a few quarters and as you have seen, we have aggressively invested in R&amp;D in the infrastructure and in strategic initiatives. And these expenses will add up and flow through our expense line. So the operating margin is really a natural flow of what the revenue is and what the expenses are.</p>
          <p>You have seen in the past quarter the trend in terms of all the line items on expenses and that should give you a pretty good idea in terms of the speed our investment, that we're actually carrying out.</p>
          <p>In terms of marketing costs for Q4, we do anticipate continued increase in SG&amp;A expenses and particularly marketing per se. You do note a Q3 step-up and we would anticipate a Q4 continued step-up in terms of marketing spend. What actually happens in Q4 is this year marks the 10th anniversary of Baidu's commercial product. So we will do a number of celebrations and events to carry out, to continue to develop the market and to promote search engine marketing. So we may even carry out some TV commercials in certain cities. So continue to expect that we will do the marketing efforts to develop the market and promote the brand. So, sequentially to your question, you should expect marketing expenses to go up.</p>
          <p>And on your second question with regards to Qunar's revenue, Qunar's financials are completely consolidated into Baidu's financials. So both the revenue as well as each expense lines are added. And Qunar's revenue is included in the online marketing, in revenue dollar amount. And Qunar's customers and their customers' ARPU also contributed to Baidu's overall picture. But as I mentioned, Qunar's overall impact is very insignificant.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my follow up question. Just a follow-up on the operating margin comments. Last quarter, you correctly predicted that in the near term because of the massive investment you are making, the operating margins should trend down and it did. I was just wondering going forward, it doesn't have to be this call, just generally, like for the next few quarters, the direction of sort of the operating margin, how should we sort of handicap that? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I really wouldn't want to venture specifically into the margin predictions, as we don't typically do that. As we mentioned, we will continue to drive the top-line growth. And you have already, I think, grasped a good pattern of the way we invest and the expense line items, how that should form out. I think in the Q2 and Q3 expense development gives you an idea in terms of the magnitude and the pace how that's going.</p>
          <p>If we're looking longer-term, really search is a beautiful business model and has tremendous scalability. And our focus really is to drive the top-line growth at this stage because we're really at the very early stage of letting the market space, knowing the beauty of search engine marketing and really continuing to spend a lot more with us and we deliver the kind of RI to our customers. And we don't really focus on the margin, so I can't really give you quarter-on-quarter predictions, but this is a beautiful margin, beautiful business and we are managing this business with very disciplined approach and we invest prudently to develop future opportunities to drive long-term growth.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks for the follow-up. My first question is a longer-term question. If I looked at the Q3 sequential revenue growth, around like 22%, but if I look at account receivables, it's up by 60%. So I assume that should not be impacted. The large customers are spending much more in Q3 as well as, I guess, in the prepared remarks that this <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:24) site is also seeing 50% sequential growth. So it seems that SME growth is going much slower than the 22% revenue growth last year. So I wonder for the next three/ five years how would that kind of mix be changed, if you can shed some light that will be great. And I have follow-up as well. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Like I mentioned that the larger accounts grow much faster, actually faster than we had expected too. But the point is really that because of our central position in China's Internet ecosystem, we are able to reap the benefits of any emerging sector. So last quarter, classified ad website suddenly emerged as they pumped out their advertising on us and certain verticals would just go up and down but it's always a macro trend that once they are in position to expand their <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:07:37), they would advertise on our platform.</p>
          <p>I also mentioned because of the relatively difficult environment for the export-oriented businesses, some of the SMEs are not doing so well, but the overall customer portfolio is very healthy and we just need to come up with the right products or right tools for them to really benefit from our online marketing platform.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I think just following up on that is, what are you seeing in terms of the sentiment for some of the large advertisers on maybe SME as well, given the macro uncertainties? Any particular sectors that we're seeing stronger sentiment or weaker sentiment or any delays, so I mean spending as well? Any general macro comment will be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, we have nothing much sentiment on the macro economy, with the exception of export-oriented since it's in a tougher position. Our top verticals are all doing very well and, as you know, we are more domestic consumption focused and this sector is growing very, very nicely and we haven't seen anything slow down on this front.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. Financial-related questions, it seems the customer deposit in the third quarter can sequentially jump a lot, but the deferred revenue actually is actually coming down. Can you explain? And also one more is, it seems the minority interest loss is actually going much better; is this more related to Qunar? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Wallace. On the customer deposit, basically these are the deposits the customers make with us, primarily the SMEs. They will do a cash deposit and then they will incur their spending. So when you see a customer deposit increase and, of course, that's a good indicator of the strong customer desire in terms of spending with us.</p>
          <p>Deferred revenue, sometimes it's more or less related to the large accounts. Large accounts have payment terms and more complicated contract. So to meet revenue recognition test, a lot of the criterias need to be met and all the duties need to be fulfilled. So you will see some movement of deferred revenue but that is not a real indication of revenue going forward.</p>
          <p>And in terms of minority interest in the P&amp;L line, you're referring &#x2013; in the P&amp;L line, I think for the equity accounting that I have pointed out, those are related to the equity accounting related &#x2013; the entities that we invest and those accounting treatments are under equity accounting method. And if you are looking at less the income that &#x2013; our loss attributable to non-controlling interest and those are out of interest that really have very small impact to the overall picture. And I think if you are trying to get to what is this minority interest related to Qunar. Qunar's financial is doing pretty healthily; it can stand on its own.</p>
