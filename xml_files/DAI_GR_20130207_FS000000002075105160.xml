        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Mike M&#xFC;hlbayer speaking. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on the telephone and the Internet to our full year results conference call. We have with us today the Chairman of the Board of Management and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Dr. Dieter Zetsche; our CFO, Bodo Uebber; and the Head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler.</p>
          <p>This morning at the annual press conference Dr. Zetsche and Bodo Uebber presented our figures in detail. Their speeches as well as our charts are available on the Daimler website. Therefore, we will start the conference call with a short introduction focusing on Q4 and to have more time for Q&amp;A afterwards.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to hand over to Dr. Dieter Zetsche.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us.  I will begin with a summary of our 2012 full year results and our fourth quarter figures. And I'll briefly outline our next strategic steps focusing on how we will bring together growth and efficiency in our divisions to secure our overall profitability. And I'll end with our outlook for 2013.</p>
          <p>On the whole, it's fair to say that 2012 was a good year for Daimler. Despite some challenges in important markets, we were able to increase our Group sales by 4% over the previous year. Mercedes-Benz Cars set a new sales record with 1.45 million vehicles sold. Daimler Trucks increased its unit sales by 9%.</p>
          <p>Group revenue rose by 7% to &#x20AC;114 billion; however, 2012 was also a year characterized by very mixed economic and business conditions, including increasingly challenging environment in many important markets that resulted in competitive pressure, high investments in our product offensives and global presence and the fact that our car business in China fell short of our own volume and earnings targets.</p>
          <p>As our final figures show, our EBIT and profitability were negatively impacted by those factors. In line with our guidance during the third quarter disclosure, we achieved group EBIT from ongoing business of &#x20AC;8.1 billion and a net profit of &#x20AC;6.5 billion. As a result our earnings per share were &#x20AC;5.71.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow from the Industrial business amounted to &#x20AC;1.5 billion for full year 2012, despite ongoing high investments. Accordingly, our industrial net liquidity was at the level of &#x20AC;11.5 billion at the end of December. Our dividend proposal of &#x20AC;2.20 per share represents a payout ratio of approximately 40%. This is in line with last year's distribution and reflects the good results in 2012 from the ongoing business as well as the successful EADS transaction.</p>
          <p>We want our shareholders to participate appropriately in our financial success, and we anticipate a continuation of this dividend development in the coming years. Our dividend policy remains to pay out 40% of the net profit attributable to the Daimler shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Group revenue increased by 3% in Q4, driven by our passenger car division where revenue grew by 7%. However, our EBIT from the ongoing business was below the previous year's result at &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Profitability in the fourth quarter was adversely impacted by difficult market conditions, especially in Europe, lower unit sales of trucks, vans and buses and partially less favorable model and regional mix, and our decision to reduce production at our car and truck divisions which resulted in a lower fixed cost coverage.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow from the Industrial business reached &#x20AC;2.6 billion. It benefited from both the working capital reduction of &#x20AC;1.3 billion and proceeds from the EADS sale of &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, looking ahead, our agenda is clear. In 2013, we'll focus on doing our homework in terms of growth and efficiency at Daimler. As far as growth is concerned, we'll continue with our product offensive. At Mercedes-Benz cars, the CLA and the new E-Class will hit the market in the second quarter, followed by our flagship, the all-new S-Class, in the summer.</p>
          <p>Product rollouts in the commercial vehicle business are equally strong with Arocs, the new Atego and the new-generation Sprinter, all coming this year. Therefore, we expect higher unit sales in all divisions despite difficult market conditions in several key markets.</p>
          <p>At the same time, it is important to ensure that our growth also turns into higher future profitability. That's why the growth strategies of all our divisions include an efficiency program as a key component. In our Car business, for example, we've complemented our growth strategy Mercedes-Benz 2020 with an efficiency initiative, Fit for Leadership.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Trucks, we are continuing our global excellence strategy with Daimler Trucks Number One, a program we announced in 2012. With these two initiatives alone, we are targeting annual EBIT benefits totaling &#x20AC;3.6 billion by the end of 2014. In our other divisions, we have set savings targets as well.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at Fit for Leadership. We are working on two levels here. In the short term it's about safeguarding our earnings. We are planning &#x20AC;2 billion in cost improvements by the end of 2014. About &#x20AC;600 million of our overall reductions will be achieved already this year.</p>
          <p>In general, we will enforce and accelerate both established and new efficiency measures. As a prime example, you'll recall the net-zero approach we outlined at our last Capital Market Day in Hungary. The original target of this approach was to offset cumulative material cost headwinds with efficiencies by 2017. Now we have accelerated this initiative. As a result we will be able to achieve this goal two years sooner. That means our cumulated cost increase by 2015 will already be balanced by increased efficiencies at that time.</p>
          <p>In addition to these short-term measures, we're implementing medium-term structural measures to improve the MBC Business system as a whole. It's still a bit early to discuss most of these measures. We're hard at work on them right now. And we will inform you about our progress in due time.</p>
          <p>Let me give you one example of structural measures we have already implemented in our Passenger Car Business in China. We achieved an important milestone at the wholesale level there last year by setting up an integrated sales company to handle both our locally produced and imported vehicles. We created a single flow distribution system to enable more growth and more efficiency.</p>
          <p>We also increased our equity interest in the import company, Mercedes-Benz China, to 75%. On the retail side we accelerated the expansion of our dealership network to 260 outlets at the end of 2012 and we will grow our network further at the pace of 50 additional dealers each year. To underline the great importance the Chinese market has to us, we also established a new management board position for China, to which we appointed Hubertus Troska.</p>
          <p>Only last week we took another important step to move our Chinese Business to the next level of strategic investment of a 12% equity interest in BAIC Motor. This investment makes us the first non-Chinese passenger car manufacturer to take a stake in the Chinese OEM. In addition to these structural measures, we're working on renewing and expanding our product portfolio to better fit the Chinese market. We already upgraded our locally produced C- and E-class at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>In the first half of this year, we will launch the new A-Class and the new GL in China, followed by the new E-Class in the summer. The new S-Class will come next at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>All of these changes will not bear fruit overnight, but they will deliver improvements over the course of this year and well into the future. We are absolutely determined to leave no stone unturned to get our Business going. This goes for our Business in China and this goes for our Business in general as well. So much for the efficiency measures at Mercedes-Benz Cars. We are making comparable progress in the remaining divisions.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, that's how we intend to consistently move forward. We assume that the weakness of major markets will at first continue in the first half of 2013. We therefore anticipate a weaker development of our earnings in the first half of the year compared to first 2012.</p>
          <p>The first quarter of 2013 should be the low point this year. Due to our brand new models, the assumptions made for the development of markets important to us and the increasing effects of the efficiency measures we have initiated, we expect EBIT from the ongoing Business to improve in the second half of 2013, compared to the level of the first half.</p>
          <p>For full year 2013, we expect group EBIT from the ongoing Business to reach the magnitude of the prior year based on the expected markets recovery in the second half of this year. For Mercedes-Benz Cars, we anticipate full year EBIT from the ongoing Business of slightly below last year's level. The other Automotive divisions are expected to achieve higher earnings in 2013 than in 2012. For Financial Services, we expect stable earnings in the next 2 years.</p>
          <p>Looking beyond this year into 2014 the changes in our operations, sales and markets will become evident. At Mercedes-Benz Cars, we will have a significantly younger model line-up than today. And our portfolio will be broader, for example with completely new models like a new compact SUV.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, our Business model in China will be ready to fully exploit its potential. Daimler Trucks will benefit from the successful implementation of its product offensive and regional launches, including the completed Euro VI rollout in Europe. And all of our divisions will implement their initiatives to further enhance efficiency.</p>
          <p>These initiatives will enable us to turn the benefits of our ongoing product offensive as well as the growth potential of new markets into profit in the coming years. In 2014 and beyond, we expect to see an improvement in operating earnings for all automotive divisions and Business units as well as for the group.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. We'll be happy to answer your questions now.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Dieter Zetsche. Ladies and gentlemen, you may ask your questions now. I will identify the questioner by name, but please also introduce yourself with your name and your organization before asking your questions. Two practical points, firstly please avoid using mobile phones and secondly, please ask your question in English. Before we start, the operator will explain the procedure.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we will start with Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Horst from HSBC. I've got a couple of questions. First one is on Mercedes cars. So you say that your plan was a further unit sales increase and I would be interested if that also means that you can outperform the overall market, or if you will perform just in line with the total market.</p>
          <p>And then with regard to the earnings you say that you expect slightly lower earnings at Mercedes cars, and I don't get &#x2013; I don't get fully why that is the case. So you say you have got a small negative currency impact. You've got a slight positive net pricing. You've got rising volumes implying positive operate leverage and you have got cost cuts. So I want to get a feeling for the magnitude of the potential negative product mix that we see at Mercedes potentially this year. And also, want to know if that implies that we see a decline of the revenues per unit.</p>
          <p>And then the last question that I have is on free cash flow. Since you guide for roughly unchanged EBIT in 2013, stripping out the one-offs from the free cash in 2012, should we work with the assumption that the free cash flow is also unchanged or should we work with a rising free cash flow since we might have got more positive working capital effects? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first point, we do have a continuation of record high levels of investments and spendings into the product expansion, the product renewal, and Tier 2 reductions, which increases the content of our vehicles in a cumulative way. There &#x2013; we were talking about this net zero approach that we have, cost improvements, but they are going against these increases and as we said in 2015 we want to totally offset them, this is not the case in 2013.</p>
          <p>And we have certainly a mix shift, as we will see a significant increase of our compact cars during this year. And if you want at the other book end the S-Class is only having the impact toward the end of the year. We have in between the shift you were indicating, which certainly, I mean that's just mathematics between growth of sales and slight decline in profits, mathematically of course we will have decreasing earnings per unit, and accordingly slightly decreasing revenues as well, relative to the mix we discussed before.</p>
          <p>You were asking I missed to answer that, to which extent we plan to outsell the market development. We said that we expect something between 2% and 4% in an overall market development on a global basis; of course, we base that on a certain structural mix of growth; decline in Europe, slight decline in Europe, increase in the U.S. and so on.</p>
          <p>I would say &#x2013; no, I wouldn't say &#x2013; I say that our plan is to have higher sales increase than this market increase. It's slightly impacted by the way how this 2% to 4% materialize, depending in which regions the growth comes from in the first place. But I think our expectation there is relatively safe as far as slow sales in Europe and stronger in the U.S. and China. That was it from my side. So.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just one question, so the premium market isn't growing by whole much, which I think you talk about the total market, right, including mass, so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not differentiating this at that point of time.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question with regard to free cash flow, the free cash flow should be substantially positive, but we don't give a precise guidance. We might change it during the course of the year but for the time being we stay with that message.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also too early to say anything on working capital impact so?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question we take from Fraser Hill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Fraser Hill from Bank of America. I just have three questions here. Firstly on pricing in Cars, I am just wondering if you can give us a bit more detail on both the pricing side and also the launch cost side, particularly as it phases throughout the year. Interested how net pricing will be positive given, as you say, your flagship product is going to be running off throughout most of this year. Also with the C-Class changeover in 2014, perhaps there might be a few pressures towards the end of that model cycle, and maybe the E-Class at the beginning of this year. So just interested how on a net basis you see the dynamic coming out positively. And also beyond that and those model launches, how substantial the launch costs are going to be particularly for the first half, if you could give us some direct compilation that would be useful.</p>
          <p>Second question would be on your China business. You've obviously taken action there, when do you think you will start to see a pickup in your China sales? If you look at the January data, again, I think you guys were up 15% but in a market that was up 50%, and so there's still a lack of leverage and I guess it's going to take some time. But when do you think it will actually start to translate into pickup in your own sales in the region?</p>
          <p>And then finally, looking at your inventories across the businesses and particularly with regards to Trucks, where are you at in terms of perhaps, let's say, inventory days of sales for your Truck business? We've had a lot from your competitors in Europe about extra stock days being taken at Scania and Volvo and production shifts being scaled down into the third quarter. Is that something that you think you are going to have to continue to address or have you got a fairly tight level of inventory today? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your questions. First we told you that for 2012, we were intending to go for positive pricing. It was a tough year as you know. We started with some burden as far as our China action in February is concerned, you know about that.</p>
          <p>In spite of that at the end of the year we had a slightly positive net pricing, which I think in this competitive environment, especially in Europe, that was not too bad as a performance. Going forward, as you rightfully mentioned we have the same intention, flat to slightly positive. Of course you are right, with the S-Class being in the last phase of its cycle before the renewal, C-Class potentially having an impact before the renewal next year, so that's certainly correct.</p>
          <p>On the other side we have the E-Class, where we think we have basically a new car as far as the change is concerned. We have obviously the growing family of compact cars. So we think we have a number of positives as well and once again not just as an average &#x2013; of the average, but developed from bottom up per car line per market, we developed this plan of flat to slightly up. At the end of course, competition will have its impact and this is our plan. We hope we can realize it.</p>
          <p>China business, I think we did not give the impression that we expect making these decisions with Hubertus Troska and the new sales guy in China and bringing the two sales entity into one unit, one legal unit, and next month our sales will skyrocket. These are prerequisites and now people have to work hard to develop results out of that. Therefore, certainly it's good to be up in January; we will see how the next months will develop. We think that the coming products are important anchors to link our increased momentum to, perhaps an anchor and momentum goes &#x2013; doesn't go too well together.</p>
          <p>But a good base to start from and there of course we have a certain delay between the introduction of the new products in Europe and in China, so with E-Class we can count from mid-year; the S-Class to the later part of the year. These will be good opportunities, certainly on top; we have the CLA and the A-Class there as well. So all of that together we definitely expect the momentum to start to build throughout this year but don't expect major changes in February, March, April to happen. Inventory, I think Andreas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about the inventory. Let's try to answer it this way. We don't have a issue with inventory, we have a very low level. If it comes to capacity adjustments, there we have a different picture. At least, as you know, we expect a very weak, or weaker, or let's call it not so strong market in Europe and the United States in the first or second quarter. In Europe, we have a lot of flexibility in our plants; we already reacted last year by laying off our temporary workers. And all the methods we have established there in the U.S., you may have heard, we reacted already, because the order intake is on a okay level, but not as strong as it could be.</p>
          <p>So, we had to inform our employees there that we plan to lay off up to 1,300 people, and with the possibility that we can call them back, of course, the next six months. But this was already a capacity adjustment we did. In auto market in Brazil, to come to that, it's a different way. There we see a production increase, so we had to recall some of our employees in the production area there. So, it's a mixed picture, but basically in Europe and in the United States it's like I said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add one more sentence. The confidence in the new product is not just a nice feeling in our stomach, but it's based, among others, on the customer clinics we did with the new E-Class and new S-Class, which both of them cliniced extremely well generally, but particularly in China as well. So, this is a certainly a good indication that we have a strong weapon there in our hands.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next in line is Rabih Freiha.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions actually, maybe the first on CO2 regulation. We saw in your presentation that you made some significant improvement in reducing your CO2 emissions in 2012. Do you believe that you should be able to comply with the CO2 regulation in China by 2015 for your local and imported cars? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second one is on CapEx, do you think that there is any risk that you could overshoot the targets you set for CapEx and R&amp;D for 2013, 2014? Or should we consider these as cap to these amounts?</p>
          <p>And maybe one last one, is a housekeeping question, it's on eliminations. I was looking at your eliminations line in the ongoing EBIT. We saw quite a sharp swing of &#x20AC;700 million year-on-year. Could you explain what's behind this, and also, maybe how we should think about it going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you for your questions. As far as CO2 emissions in China is concerned, based on the current knowledge about these regulations, we expect fulfillment. There was for some time some speculation there that instead of limits, CO2 limits for specific car lines depending on weight, there could be an overall fleet cap on top of that. If that would materialize every car manufacturer would have significant challenges. At that point of time we're not counting on such regulations. So that is the remaining uncertainty; other than that we feel good about these numbers.</p>
          <p>CapEx, Bodo probably will say something. I would say we have a clear plan and we have limited resources and we want to pay a dividend, and therefore, we have to, if necessary we have to take actions if we were to go through this threshold. So that is a clear objective not to do so.</p>

          <p>Okay. I don't have to repeat it, because as Dieter has already said, these are fixed budgets. To your questions on reconciliation, elimination including in 2012, we had a one-timer, the sale of EADS, which was roughly &#x20AC;700 million. The equity result was roughly &#x20AC;300 million in the total year of EADS, makes it a total of &#x20AC;1 billion. So if you eliminate these two elements you come up with a negative of minus &#x20AC;100 million. This includes also the elimination piece, which we had also last year. So you can, going forward say it's &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;200 million negative, the elimination at the reconciliation line item, without EADS impact.</p>

          <p>Next in line is Stuart Pearson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, it's Stuart Pearson at Morgan Stanley. Two or three questions. Just starting on the Mercedes side in the walkdown that you helpfully provide there's the headwind of &#x20AC;775 million. I think that's the largest number you've probably reported in a quarter.</p>
          <p>I'm wondering if you could just explain a little bit more what's in that quarter -- in that number. I guess maybe the Chinese dealer support falls in there. But I also wonder, I know you said pricing was just about positive in 2012, but whether there is some more consent to help incentivize the vehicle sales that went into that number in Q4.</p>
          <p>And just following on from that how would you expect that to continue in Q1, whether we should still expect Mercedes margin in Q1 to be weaker than Q4 or whether it could start to improve as early as Q1. So it's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question just on R&amp;D, I know it's in the planning, that you now plan for that to start coming down going forward, at a time, I guess, when some peers are starting to increase that number. I wonder if you can just reassure us that that's coming down due to efficiency savings, perhaps you're finding, and we're not at risk of repeating some of the under investment of the past, presumably that's efficiency savings. But just explain a little bit more on that.</p>
          <p>And then the final, more general question, just on the guidance, given the experience of last year. I just wondered how you can reassure us all that this time the guidance is conservative enough. I mean, I notice you're looking for flat to positive pricing. I think you said earlier euro/dollar at $1.30 to $1.35 range; it's already above that. But just, generally how conservative is &#x2013; are your assumptions on volumes, price and so on, in that guidance, so we won't see a repeat of last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the headwinds are concerned, one of the Q4 &#x2013; one very important element was the reduction in stock and therefore the non-coverage of fixed cost, which obviously was cared for by building the inventory already before. So that is major part, which probably you didn't have on your screen by looking to this headwind part.</p>
          <p>Going forward, as far as the guidance is concerned, I would not call that a very conservative guidance. But it's our best take on the future under these assumptions we have given you as far as the markets are concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And on the R&amp;D, just the real reasons why that's starting to go down now? I just, it seems to be dropping below 5% of sales, and I think that was going towards more at like 6% to 7%. So just the reasons for that decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Car side, we plan on constant R&amp;D, which obviously with growing revenues leads to a lower percentage point. On the Commercial Vehicle side, we have declines because we have gone through the biggest new development phase of our history on the Truck side and this is now not coming to an end, but certainly being at the rear end of this big mountain, and therefore there the R&amp;D cost goes down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jose Asumendi, JPMorgan. Couple of items. First one on the pricing in China. The data we are tracking suggests that your incentives have started to rise again in January after the small downward trend in October and November, and this is mainly driven by the S-Class. So I am just wondering whether you recognize this trend and do you expect this to accelerate also over the next two quarters?</p>
          <p>And second, I am just trying to assess the guidance and I would like to specifically please hear whether you are actually building a currency tailwind in your guidance, if you are also assuming incremental one-offs for the dealer body investments or discounting of provisions, Bus restructuring costs, and if you could please quantify the S-Class launch costs in the second half. So basically the basket of one-offs which are basically the bonus to Chinese dealers, discounting of provisions, restructuring Bus costs and the S-Class launch cost. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing in China in January, our best information is that they have slightly improved in average and overall, so I don't know where we have potentially different data referring to. As far as the rest of your questions are concerned, I'll lean over to Bodo, who can decide what we can answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question of one-offs, first of all the discounting of provisions, of course we assume currently that the interest rate are stable and therefore we have not included in our guidance any further decrease of interest rates, which would lead to a further discounting of provisions. So it's not assumed that we have an interest decrease or increase, so a flat development means no impact on discounting of provisions.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we were referring to restructuring costs so we have given clear guidance to ongoing Business. So as long as we don't know precisely what restructuring costs, we can't tell you what they are. So we will define, for example, for the European Business and Latin America Business how big the piece is, and we'll inform you as soon as we can and when we have the numbers together.</p>
          <p>The third question you had, to currency, it is just right on the current level. It's a headwind, which we have from the currency size, it's roughly &#x20AC;200 million, as we plan our guidance on the current &#x2013; around the current level of the U.S. dollar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I do think that in addition to Bus, he asked specifically also in the Bus field, I put in on. In the Bus field we put everything what we need in the year 2012 so there is no specific big SRE foreseen for the bus restructuring.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. It's Michael Tyndall from Barclay. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if I may. The first, and maybe I'm being a bit silly here. If I look at your fact sheet for Mercedes-Benz I see that unit sales in Q3, sorry Q4, were roughly 400,000 units and retail sales are 380,000. So there's a delta there of 17,000; it was 10,000 in third quarter. Just thinking about what you've said on inventories, I mean, are we still looking at an inventory issue going forward that you need to work down? Presumably that's the difference between wholesale and retails that I'm looking at there.</p>
          <p>And then the second question just relates to Trucks in Latin America. It looks like your book-to-bill was less than one. Certainly all of your competitors are saying that things are doing quite well in Latin America for them. I'm just wondering whether or not there's something else in your numbers that has you slightly out of step with your peers at the moment. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as inventories on the car side are concerned, the yearend level, if anything, is rather too low than too high, so we certainly don't have company stock issue. And in January we have seen some significant reduction of dealer inventory as a gap between company sales and retail sales. So we think our inventory at the dealer level and at the wholesale level is just fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I just come back to you on that? So what is the difference then between those two numbers? How should I look at that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Off of my head, we had retail of 95,000, something like that, and I think it's about 12,000, the difference. In general about 12,000 more retail than group sales.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your question about the Brazilian situation when it comes to order intake, so far we have a system in Brazil that wholesale is counted at the same time as order intake. Why is this the case? It's a system that we are, whatever, having the last, whatever, 20 or 30 years. The reason is very simple. There, despite in the U.S. or in Europe where we have customer orders all the time, it goes through the dealers and customers are buying it in Brazil from the dealer stock.</p>
          <p>This is not so satisfying because the order intake is, at least sometimes, misleading, so we at the moment working in the last couple of months to changing the system. In the second half year, we will have also there a different order intake, it's not identical any longer with the wholesale. Again we are changing the system that it's then more comparable to what you see from the competition.</p>
          <p>To give you a feeling, as I said, we are increasing, or we increased capacity already in our production. The market is going up, no doubt, after depressed situation last year and we rehired already production people and we ramped up through the year. It's first quarter up, then second quarter and then of course the majority will come in the second half, like in the overall business in our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:47).</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions. First of all your guidance for 2013 on Mercedes, you suggest that the first quarter is going to be the weakest. Should we assume that the exit quarter, the fourth quarter 2012, the rate at around the 5.3% level, is the level you think you could actually maintain in the first quarter of 2013? And so, is it going to look <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:20) between 2012 and 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Steve. Unfortunately we have a miserable line here and only hear half of what you were saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe I can just repeat, your guidance is that the first quarter of 2013 will be the weakest quarter for Mercedes passenger cars, should we assume that the margin level will be round about the level we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the front wheel drive vehicles. You are launching CLA, could you explain the measures you will take to protect the C-Class against a more, against -- could well be a competing product? And could you give some feedback on how the A-Class is doing, in particular how it's addressing its target market in terms of age group and the like? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for these questions. To your first question, the first quarter should rather have a lower running rate than the fourth quarter of 2012. The CLA, what we primarily focused on is the position where new CLA and the new C-Class as much apart from each others as possible. That might not entirely apply to the current C-Class and the CLA so there might be a little more substitution from what we expect with the new C-Class, which is obviously being launched in 2014. And therefore this was our focus.</p>
          <p>As far as the market reception for the A-Class is concerned, we continue to be short in the A-Class sales, as in the B-Class, currently and in our plan for 2013. So we are looking for every unit we could get out of our plants, and still from today's perspective cannot fulfill the requirements of the market. So altogether, we are very happy so far with the reaction to our new Compact Car vehicles. And on CLA we cannot talk about orders or about sales, but the initial reaction, you might have seen that as well, sounds very promising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And is it getting the younger demographic that you're seeking, the A-Class?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Is it getting the younger demographic?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry. Didn't hear you. First of all, we have at this point of time about 40% conquest with the A-Class, which is a pretty strong number. And secondly, the share of younger customers is growing basically from month-to-month. It's somewhat normal that when we launch a new product that the classic Mercedes owner comes in first and orders before he or she has even seen the vehicle. So therefore, we have a normal situation that in the beginning we are relatively much with our traditional customer base. And this is seen here as well in the sense that we now have a strongly declining average age on the buyer base of the A-Class. So, again, going to direction we were hoping for.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So it's two questions. The one question is on the tax rate. Here in the fourth quarter there was a very low tax rate here. And so my question is, maybe you can quantify this Q4 effect and also talk a bit about the presumed tax rate for the years to come.</p>
          <p>And the other question is on Mercedes-Benz Cars again. So you are well behind the competition, to name it, BMW and Audi. And so my question here is when are you addressing to be at the same level as your competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While Bodo is looking for the tax rates, I can answer the last one. We said our target is later than 2020, and of course we do not plan to stay with the current gap 'til 2019 and then start catching up, is clear as well. But that is our official target, later than 2020.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question with regard to the tax rate, the income tax expense for 2012 of &#x20AC;1.2 billion; last year, 2011, was &#x20AC;2.4 billion. This decreased partially due to the lower pre-tax profit. The profit before income taxes in 2012 includes the, mainly tax we gain of the sale of EADS share.</p>
          <p>Both years were affected by the tax benefits on the reversal of impairments recognized on deferred tax assets, and 2012 was also affected by tax benefits from tax assessment for prior years. So you're right, the tax &#x2013; the effective tax rate in 2012 was 15.8%.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, normally we have a tax rate between 30% and 33%, if we don't look at the exceptionals. The sale of course of a portfolio and other topics are expectionals. So in the long run you should calculate between 30% and 33%.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question, we take from Jochen Gehrke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions, if I may. First of all on the Trucks, Mr. Andreas, you obviously maintained the 8% margin goal for the mid-term. When I look at the reporting line, ever since you have stripped out Trucks, you've made on average 5% return, and so far the 8% was hardly ever achieved in the peak.</p>
          <p>Now, your competitor's come up with numbers, and I think it's fair to say that currently we are seeing a slight drift in profitability in the truck industry as a whole. Assuming in a year from here, we're not seeing 8%, would you ever consider lowering the through-the-cycle margin target, especially the 200 to 300 basis points above the 8%, which we have so far yet to see?</p>
          <p>And secondly in that same regard, why should we be so confident that when you have a 5% margin, give or take, on revenues that are quite respectable in a historical context that you can double that, and where is really the big gap coming from?</p>
          <p>And then the second question to Dr. Zetsche, I think, it's not a real secret that we are shortly ahead of your term renewal; the press is talking a lot about it. I don't necessarily want you to comment on that. But assuming you stay on as the CEO for the next coming years, when you look back at the last couple of years, what do you think has gone wrong, what is explaining this main gap to BMW and Audi? And are we looking for any strategic internal structural changes in how you're approaching the organization, how quick the response of management is to changes in market environment. Or is this really that when you see all this criticism that comes from the outside, in your view it's only a lack of product and in two years' time we will basically just reverse our opinion and see the fruits of that work? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that question. We are definitely convinced that product is key in our business, and that is the main lever for growth and for profitability. And from all we see with the product we have launched most recently our confidence in our pipeline is justified.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; on top of that, and that's why we added MB 2020 with goal for 10, we certainly see some areas where we are lacking on the cost side as well, these we have addressed. The plan for 2013 and 2014 addresses of course the traditional ways of cost reduction, but as you perhaps have seen to some extent in the past that some of these costs bounce back. We are more focused than in the past on additional structural changes which then should make sure that these reductions are permanent and sustainable. So that is basically &#x2013; these are basically the two elements, as I explained this morning, which will lead us to, in competitive perspective, satisfying a positive development to the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Mr. Gehrke, to your questions, the first one I can answer very shortly. We are staying to our 8% with all we have said before and there is no reason to change this. The second thing now we can talk, maybe I can talk two hours about it. What we have done is basically summarized in our Global Excellence strategy, to only give you some ideas. The markets didn't support us the last two years very well.</p>
          <p>And as you rightly said you can also see some issues that competitors are struggling at the moment. But basically we are following our Global Excellence strategy. We are focusing to achieve our long-term goal in as an example the total new products we have launched here in Europe. We have worked the last, whatever, six years to come to this point. Now end of the year we have the full product launched, including the new construction site Arocs.</p>
          <p>Then we have striven for the modular concept and as you know we have now, first time, one engine available in the heavy-duty side. In addition to that our activities in so called BRIC or emerging markets, we have established the last couple of years, now we are starting to harvest also from them.</p>
          <p>So, again, I can talk, with this question we can talk a long time for it. That should give you some hints that we are still confident, when the markets are supporting us one time because we have never achieved a normal year market that we need of course to achieve a certain profitability.</p>

          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We take the next question from Michael Punzet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Punzet, DZ Bank. I have three questions. So first one is on your given guidance for the Trucks. When I compare your market expectation for Trucks and compare that with your own expectations for Truck sales maybe you can explain a bit in more detail why you are much more optimistic on your own Truck sales compared with the overall market development?</p>
          <p>Then the second one is on financial services. There in Q4 we saw a drop of EBIT margin of 2 percentage points. Maybe you can explain a bit what's happened there and give us some indication of what is a good run rate assumption for coming quarters or coming years?</p>
          <p>And the last one is on EADS, after the sale, stake sale, how you will account your remaining stake in your accounts in coming quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to answer your first question, as I said before, we have launched in all the regions, totally new products and we gained already market share in 2012. And we will &#x2013; our intention is to gain more market share though. The markets are not supporting us. But our products are helping us in all the regions, in the U.S., or in NAFTA, in, here in Europe specifically, but also in Asia and in Brazil with our new Euro 5 fleet. We see a good chance that we can gain market share. So that's the reason for our guidance when it comes to sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question with regard to the financial services, last year in 2011 we had releases of provisions, which we hadn't had this year. The overall cost of, credit loss level is on a good level and I don't expect it to deteriorate. In 2013 we will see slight increases, which are underneath the long-term average. In 2013 I do think you can account for a stable profit development compared to 2012.</p>
          <p>EADS is for the time being accounted for at equity because we don't have any decision within EADS on the agenda, and the governance to form a decision is yet missing. We will see an extraordinary annual meeting in the first half-year. If that of course comes up, annual meeting will make a decision on the change governance, we have to change our equity accounting and we will inform you about the impact on the financials.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next in line is Christian Ludwig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Christian Ludwig from Bankhaus Lampe. I have just got one question. In the presentation at the Hungary plant opening last year you showed us a slide where you said you are going to produce at least 10 additional models by 2015. Now in your presentation, you are talking about 30 new models until 2020.</p>
          <p>Just wanted to understand what that means? Does it mean that after 2015 we will basically see a significant decline in new model launches or are you spreading out the new model launches over a longer time period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. First of all since we announced the 10 new models until 2015 we already launched some of them. So the remaining number is lower. Including this remaining number and adding the ones we have already decided for by today for the years after 2015 we come up with this number of 13.</p>
          <p>That is the current count and it's not unlikely that in the coming years we will add more product to our portfolio which perhaps could be launched even before 2020 and further increasing this number, but this is the current count, the remaining part of the 10 and the additional part after 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just for my calculation, could you tell me how many of the 10 you announced last year you have already launched in the timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have launched two, that's the CLA and Shooting Brake.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions. The first one is on the pension healthcare liability. It's up &#x2013; the funding deficit is about up &#x20AC;3 billion in the year, mostly on discount rates. Just want to know if that changes your funding requirements, do you intend to basically step up your cash contribution to pension?</p>
          <p>And the second question is back in I think March 2010, you settled with SEC on some bribery or corruption charges. You went into some kind of supervision regime that, I believe, and after three years. So my question is, the first one is, are you going to be off that supervision in the second quarter? And two, more impotently, was that situation, which covered no issues in the U.S., Russia and China, was that in any way an impediment to you being able to do business in those regions and might explain some of your under performance, or was it just a non-issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we were &#x2013; we have signed a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, which has ended by the end of last year. So the answer to your first question is yes. But to the second one, there was no &#x2013; whatever, elimination of sales in any of the regions where we found wrongdoings in the past. Of course, we've established a lot of processes to make sure that any FCPA related or other non-integrity conduct would happen, could happen. These processes especially while being established, of course, were an additional challenge to our sales organization, to our financial community in the organization and more. But there is no cutoff of markets has happened or something like that, which now would be reversed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question with regard to pensions, we don't plan for a further specific pension contribution in 2013. The &#x20AC;350 million we did in EvoBus for 2012 was a piece of a longer term strategy, which was in combination to the 2011 special contribution. So there is no further contribution in 2013.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have last, but not least, Christian Breitsprecher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have two questions, and the first on Trucks. Two of your competitors were talking about their problems in Russia because of these recycling fees they have to pay. Do you have similar problems?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the pension accounting, because of the increase in the discount rate the nominal amount of underfunding has gone up significantly. What are your plans in terms of moving that on to the Biler balance sheet, what you're having at the moment, just kind of in a side calculation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can make it very shortly. No, we have, not an issue because we have our strategic partner KAMAZ, we ended with them in so-called Decree 166, so our products are local manufactured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, your question with regard to the change in accounting treatment of the underfunded pension position, that is the IAS 19R which will be accounted for in the first quarter of 2013 and that means that we then have to move the underfunded positions into the equity. Of course everybody has to do so. It's roughly the number of &#x20AC;6.4 billion which will move from the underfunded position and reduce our equity. Our equity ratio, industry, I have already said that it's roughly 46%, so on a very high level and also to say reduced onto 40% which is a very solid and healthy number.</p>
