          <p>I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everybody to the UPS Investor Relations second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Andy Dolny, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours sir. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.</p>
          <p>In a moment, Scott Davis, our CEO, and Kurt Kuehn, our CFO, will discuss second quarter results and our expectations going forward. Before they begin, however, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the company. These anticipated results are subject to risks and uncertainties which are described in detail in our 2009 Form 10-K and first quarter 2010 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website or from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's call is being webcast and will also be available on our Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>I want to remind you an adjustment we made in the second quarter of 2009 for certain foreign currency obligations which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The after-tax impact of this charge was $48 million or 5 cents per share. In the remarks today, Scott and Kurt will refer to UPS's second quarter 2009 results excluding the impact of this charge. Additionally, all 2010 full-year references and comparisons to 2009 will refer to adjusted results. We believe this is a more accurate picture of the company's performance. A reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is explained in the schedules that accompanied our earnings news release this morning. The schedules are also available on the UPS IR website in the financial section.</p>
          <p>Finally, during the call we refer to free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Reconciliation is also included in the news announcement this morning and is available on the UPS Investor Relations website.</p>
          <p>To begin our review of the quarter, I'll turn the program over to Scott.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>We continue to see strong momentum in 2010 as evidenced by our results announced this morning. UPS earnings jumped 71% on revenue growth of 13% with improvement across all business units. Now this was achieved despite the fact that mixed economic signals continue to dominate the headlines. The U.S. is witnessing strong corporate earnings and moderate GDP growth although employment and housing data remain weak.</p>
          <p>The debt crisis in Europe has kept everyone's interest, with stock markets around the globe reflecting this uncertainty. Yet we're pleased that our European business showed solid growth again this quarter. And Asia continued to experience significant economic expansion. Our export volumes in the region grew over 40%.</p>
          <p>UPS has succeeded in this environment while also investing to further strengthen our global network. In the quarter we enhanced and built new relationships with partners in Asia. UPS expands the reach of our services through strategic alliances in Vietnam and in Malaysia, providing greater access to customers in these important emerging markets.</p>
          <p>In May, UPS announced a significant new partnership in China with Alibaba, the world's largest small business ecommerce company. The agreement benefits UPS by giving us access to small and medium sized wholesalers through their new online marketplace. This platform provides easy use for our services for Chinese suppliers and eventually will be available to users around the globe. Our approach to international expansion, using alliances, service partners and acquisitions, has proved to be successful. The evidence can be seen in the strong international growth UPS has delivered over the years. We are confident in this strategy. In fact, during the quarter, UPS was recognized as the market leader in Poland by industry trade magazines and the local press. Accomplishing this in just five years following our acquisition of Stolycha. Poland has become a key manufacturing center and distribution point for Europe.</p>
          <p>I am equally confident in our U.S. domestic strategy. Our reorganization effort has started to pay dividends. UPSers have embraced the need for change and quickly adapted to the new organizational structure. Through the superb execution of our people, significant network efficiencies have been achieved, and our go-to-market strategy is beginning to bear fruit. In the midst of one of the most substantial changes in our history, the U.S. domestic segment reported 57% improvement in operating profit. We are not yet where we need to be, but we are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, I was honored when President Obama asked me to serve on his Export Council. I look forward to working with the Administration and other business leaders to help achieve the objective of doubling U.S. exports in the next five years. To support the Export Council initiative, UPS announced several key undertakings to help U.S. small businesses compete globally. Only 1% of U.S. small and medium sized businesses export products, and most to only one country. Since 96% of consumers live outside the U.S., it's important that we help our customers expand their businesses and compete in the global marketplace.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Kurt, I want to say that I am encouraged by our performance as we realize the benefits of our efforts. We made the right decisions, took the right actions, and are confident of UPS's ability to substantially improve results during this moderate economic recovery. Kurt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Scott, and good morning. It's good to talk to you today, especially after turning in great results like this.</p>
          <p>UPS global revenue was up 13%, with operating profit skyrocketing 57%. This is despite a mixed global economic environment. The operating leverage we demonstrated in the first quarter has continued, as witnessed by our margin expansion of 320 basis points. For the third quarter in a row, our compensation and benefit expense grew at a slower rate than volume.</p>
          <p>The numerous changes that UPS has made and the investments in our global network are paying off. Our progress on these has led us to increase our 2010 earnings guidance.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the segments starting with U.S. Domestic Package. Operating profit is up 57% on a 7% revenue gain. This increase was driven by yield improvements, increased volume, network efficiencies, and superb execution. As a result, operating margin was 10.3%, an increase of 330 basis points.</p>
          <p>Average daily volume increased more than 1% with Ground up too. We are also beginning to see UPS customers trade up to premium services, and that is encouraging. While volume in our Next Day Air was flat overall, we saw solid growth in Next Day Package, although this was offset by a decline in our letter products. This positive mix shift helped drive our 11% improvement in air yields. Total domestic revenue per piece increased 6% driven by stronger base rates and higher fuel surcharges. Our focus on yield management is clearly showing results. The U.S. operations team executed this quarter to near perfection with improved productivity, service and cost management.</p>
          <p>With an increased volume, UPS direct labor hours, miles driven and block hours were all down, a job well done when you also consider the challenges presented by our U.S. restructuring.</p>
          <p>We experienced substantial relocation and training expenses for the restructuring during the quarter. The impact was partially offset by reductions in payroll. As a result, the net effect overall was approximately $0.02.</p>
          <p>Now for the International segment, where operating profits soared 78% to $521 million on a 23% jump in revenue. Volume increased 20% with exports up 15 and non-U.S. domestic up 24%.</p>
          <p>We've seen International volume exceed 2 million pieces per day for 3 consecutive quarters, and for the first half of the year UPS International profits were the best in our history. During the quarter, UPS experienced strong export growth in all regions, with Asia up more than 40%. Both U.S. and Europe export volumes were up more than 10%. Operating margin climbed to 18.8%, an increase of 580 basis points. The improved margin was driven by higher yields and effective management of our network by the operations team. For example, during quarter our in-country cost per piece declined over 4%.</p>
          <p>Over the past few months there have been questions about how currency fluctuations will impact UPS results. Due to our hedging positions, currency did not have a material impact during the quarter. This will likely change as the year progresses and I will talk about that later.</p>
          <p>Export yields are up 9% due to stable pricing, fuel surcharges, and positive changes in product mix as customers traded up to higher service levels. For example, in our premium product, Worldwide Express, volume growth was more than 20%. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 24%, driven by core countries in Europe and Canada. These results are also impacted by our August 2009 acquisition in Turkey. Organic growth was equally impressive, up 13%. The value of the domestic and export portfolio continues to resonate with customers.</p>
          <p>Our results in Europe are impressive considering the disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud. And I want to recognize the great effort our team made during the quarter. Our customers told us that UPS saved the day by acting quickly to ensure dependable service. We leveraged our extensive pan-European ground network and kept their goods moving. UPS technology enabled us to provide accurate and timely visibility throughout this challenging event. Financially, the impact of the volcano was not material.</p>
          <p>UPS recently announced significant upgrades to several of our international shipping systems. These enhancements improve ease of use, visibility and provide importers with greater control of their shipments. We will continue to introduce innovative products and solutions that help our customers compete in the global marketplace.</p>
          <p>Now for the Supply Chain and Freight segment. Revenue increased 21% on the strength of the Forwarding and Logistics business with operating margins over 6%. Keep in mind that last year's operating margin benefited by about 100 basis points from the sale of the international MBE business. Forwarding experienced improved result this quarter with strong tonnage growth led by high-tech. Industry capacity continues to be constrained, putting some pressure on our margins. We remain focused on revenue management and expect to see margin expansion as the year progresses. As expected, UPS Freight has returned to profitability this quarter, a result of our targeted growth strategy. Freight revenue per hundred weight increased 9%. This will again be one of the industry's best results. Though we had modest declines in shipments and tonnage, weight per shipment improved.</p>
          <p>Our Logistics business unit continues to experience strong results from the healthcare and high-tech industries. Solutions created within this unit enable us to add value for our customers, benefiting through the alignment of multiple UPS capabilities. This is unmatched in the industry.</p>
          <p>Once again, the unique UPS operating model produced significant cash. Year-to-date we have generated more than $2.5 billion in free cash flow. In addition, we have invested 690 million in capital expenditures, paid dividends of 910 million, reflecting a 4.4% dividend increase, spent 425 million to repurchase approximately 7 million shares. And UPS ended the period with over 4 billion in cash and marketable securities. UPS's cash position remained strong. We will continue to follow our current stock repurchase strategy of offsetting the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation. We will consider changing this strategy once the S&amp;P outlook for UPS is modified. I am confident of meeting their targets by the end of this year. This quarter we did mark down certain auction rate securities to their market value. The write-down was $21 million and is reflected as an offset to our investment income.</p>
          <p>Now for some comments on our outlook. Looking forward, even when we consider expectations for a slow economic recovery in the U.S., and the uncertain outlook in Europe, we are more confident than we were earlier in the year in UPS's ability to grow and generate substantial profits. This leads us to raise our full-year 2010 guidance to an expected range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. This represents a 45 to 50% increase over last year's results.</p>
          <p>Look at the segments, in the Domestic segment, volume should grow in line with GDP for the remainder of the year. The third quarter will show better results due to easier comps and the way the 4th of July holiday fell last year. We expect to continue seeing significant year-over-year margin expansion.</p>
          <p>In our International segment, for the second half of the year we do expect to see export growth rates moderate but still outpace the market. The rate of volume growth will somewhat depend on whether the Asia export market continues to grow at its current lofty pace. Also, year-over-year comps will become more challenging particularly in the fourth quarter. We do expect a headwind from currency in the second half of the year of approximately $25 million per quarter. Based on these assumptions, we expect International profits for the remainder of the year to reflect typical seasonal trends, with the third quarter lower than the fourth. The Supply Chain and Freight segment should produce full-year margins of approximately 6% on revenue growth in the low teens.</p>
          <p>All in all, UPS had a tremendous quarter led by significant margin expansion on strong revenue growth in our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. We are very encouraged by the accelerated growth we're seeing in revenue and profit across all business units. Our ability to generate cash coupled with an outlook for moderate capital requirements will ensure that UPS continues to generate significant shareowner value going forward.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention. And now Scott and I would be happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen we'll now begin the question-and-answer session of our conference. And as a reminder please limit yourself to one question and we will allow one follow-up. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question in queue will come from the line of Mr. Jon Langenfeld of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about your weight per shipment both in the Ground side as well as on the Domestic Express side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, great. The weight per shipment was a positive trend across most of the businesses. It was &#x2013; it was definitely notable in our International Express services as heavier goods moved. In the domestic it's a little bit of a mixed picture. We saw it very notably in our Next Day Air package segment as A) growth began to kick in and also weights went up. The Ground business was up moderately but not materially. But clearly the rising weights is a positive leading indicator and we were pleased to see that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like there's still room to grow on the domestic side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, I think that we're still pretty optimistic on industrial production continuing to grow and outpace GDP this year. That's just the best barometer for us; if manufacturing kicks in, we should see heavier products both in the Ground and Air.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Gary Chase of Barclays Capital, Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Gary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was curious to get a little bit more color on, Kurt, you were talking in-country costs internationally going down 4%. Wondered if you could just give a little bit more color on what you're doing there to drive that and sort of how far along in that process we are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, this really was &#x2013; the catalyst for this was the downturn. We had as the economy began to hit the skids and we did shift gears pretty dramatically from what had been a decade of unimpeded growth to tightening up and challenging our network. So the recession was a challenge in our International business but it also gave us an opportunity really to go in and streamline and make more efficient some of our processes. So what you're seeing now is a more highly tuned network with volume back up dramatically, so we're getting economies of scale and we've got the core efficiencies that we can hang on to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a quick one: the 25 million in headwind that you referred to; is that net of hedges and can you tell us how much the hedges are offsetting, if it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's certainly net of hedges. We use a collar strategy where we protect most of the down side and give up in some cases some of the upside. So certainly the euro has been very volatile; that is by far our largest exposure. And the 25 million estimate basically assumes the euro stays in the upper 120s where it is today. We do have protection if it gets much worse, so we don't think the currency could get much worse than that. But certainly that is something that we're very active with and we constantly hedge to reduce some of the volatility, and it did that for the second quarter. Third and fourth we'll see some headwinds but still much less volatile than it would be otherwise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and congratulations on the really strong results and the good guidance as well. Let's see. On the yield, I was wondering if you could give a little sense of how much of the yield in Air and Ground is base price increase and how much is fuel surcharge and mix, and I guess then in terms of the price, whether that accelerates going forward. So I guess the question's on yield and price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a little different story for each of the products. In the Ground, it's certainly the majority of the yield increase is base pricing, as we have not seen as much of a tailwind from weight, so that's probably the best indication that &#x2013; as far as the status. There is some tailwind. On the Air side, somewhere around half would be fuel, and there is a little bit of a mix benefit. We talked about that Package is growing substantially more than Letters, which are declining. Clearly with the very low numbers of new home sales and year-over-year negatives on refinancing, the letter business is being challenged. But the weight did help on the Air also. We feel very good about our yield management campaign, Tom. We &#x2013; as we've said, we've made that a priority, and so it's a gradual process, but we're pleased to see the benefits of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in the follow-up, you were pretty helpful with the comments in currency impact in second half, 25 million a quarter. If the euro and exchange rates stay where they are today, what would the impact be in 2011? Presumably there's somewhat of a headwind; is that another 50 million headwind or more or less than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are pretty well hedged for next year, although clearly over multiple years we can't be indifferent to it. So there is some risk to that. We're not ready yet to give any specific numbers, Tom. But the goal that we have is to not be indifferent to it. We think it's too expensive to try to hedge away all volatility. But also to make sure that it never becomes the primary story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, our practice for the last decade has been to try to hedge a year in advance, and we've stuck with that practice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Edward Wolfe of Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, hate to pick apart a nice looking quarter, but if there's one thing that I look at here, the domestic volume, up 1.2%. How do you think about that and particularly the Air obviously, which domestically is weak, and what's in your guidance going forward in the second half for your volume expectations domestically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, we do &#x2013; we did guide this year that we thought that the Air business would underperform the Ground business. Clearly last year we had the benefit of the overlap with DHL's retreat from the domestic market. You know, our guidance is not assuming any dramatic economic uptick. That was one of the things we wanted to make clear. But we do think that we will see our volumes somewhere around GDP growth rates for the remainder of the year. We get a little bit of a tailwind frankly in Q3 with the way the calendar hit. 4th of July last year added an operating day to us without much extra volume, so there's a little bit of a tailwind there. So we do see third quarter volumes improving over the second quarter, and then the fourth quarter will depend a lot certainly on how the holidays turn out. But all in all, we're pretty confident that our volumes should be growing at GDP rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Air side, Ed, I think the numbers are a little misleading because frankly our Next Day Package business was pretty good in a quarter, where our Next Day Letters were down fairly significantly. So that the package business on the Air side was better than the overall results showed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give some numbers around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next day package was up about 2%. So it was &#x2013; actually did show some growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question in the queue will come from the line of Mr. Scott Malat of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Following up on Ed's question a little bit, I just wanted to better understand what you see as the elasticity of demand. Maybe, if you could help us think about &#x2013; I think the volumes are fine where they are, but as you take up price, how are those accounts volumes versus accounts that you haven't addressed yet?  Are there any buying pattern changes in those accounts that you have addressed price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>No, so far we have had pretty good success, we think. We are, as we said, our top priority for this year is stabilizing the pricing environment, so on the increment there maybe some accounts that plus or minus, but in general the &#x2013; we've been pleased with our ability to sustain rate increases without significant impact from our customers. So we do think the market will continue to grow gradually. We have been forecasting this being a gradual economic recovery, and I think clearly it's playing out that way. But we feel pretty good about our ability to sustain modest but substantial rate increases and at the same time continue to grow with the economy.</p>

          <p>I think generally the small package market that didn't drop as much as the overall economy did during the recession. Into the recovery, I think you'll start seeing the small package market catch up to GDP and IT levels as we move through this recovery. You'll see it get better.</p>

          <p>Thanks. And then following up just on the volumes, maybe on inventory restocking last quarter you said you were in the early stages. Is this &#x2013; should this be a tailwind as we continue to go forward or the most of the benefits behind us? Where are we in that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're just part way through this game. I think the inventory to sales ratio has gone up some, but it's still well below the pre-recession levels. So I would think you're going to still see more restocking. I think we saw not quite as much in the second quarter as we saw in the first, but I expect to see that in the second half of the year continue.</p>

          <p>Scott, just following up on that, where's the confidence of the shippers? Are they moving to really start increasing that?  I'm just wondering as we look forward to peak shipping season, what are your discussions like as shippers start to prepare for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's early to talk I think on peak season in the US. I think you're starting to see some talk on the ocean side, heavy freight, you're starting to see that pick up. I think there's pretty good confidence out there. Certainly the technology companies have had a banner 12 months, and I don't see that letting up in the near term. So I think it feels pretty good. B2C stayed strong. We saw more improvement B2B over the last quarter or two. So despite Chairman Bernanke saying all the unusual uncertainty out there, I think overall our shippers feel pretty good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you break down, I guess, when I look at the growth at the Ground, the 1% or 1.8% volume growth, is there a difference between what we're seeing on that parcel direct, that kind of direct to home versus what you're seeing on standard packages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Historically the B2C, the direct-to-home, has significantly outgrown the B2B. We have actually seen those two growth rates equalize more and more. This has been more of a B2B recovery. And that's evidence of what Scott talking about with industrial production and some of those things. So this is probably as close as the two have been in a number of years.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Just a follow-up on yields. On international domestic yield, if we've got our numbers correct, I think it fell by about 5% in the quarter year-on-year. If that is correct, can you just explain the reasons for that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Robin. We have got one big event in there that makes it a little hard to really peel back what's going on in that, and that was our acquisition in Turkey that has dramatically increased our growth rates.</p>
          <p>The average yield in that country is far below the more developed markets of Europe and Canada. If you took out Turkey, we would actually show a slight positive for yield on our domestics. So we're very comfortable with the pricing in our domestics. We have actually been thrilled to see the substantial demand, even with Europe being the lion's share of that, for our services.</p>
          <p>So that will wrap around next quarter. You'll have third quarter, you'll have half of Turkey comp in there and the other half. And then I think once we get past that, you'll see a more stable maybe slightly increasing yield in our domestics. So it's certainly not through price that we have been gaining this outsized share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So it hasn't really grown, because I thought it had been growing faster. In the past, we'd sort of said it got a percent or so a year in share, if you will.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's about right. I think it's been &#x2013; over the last probably 20 years, it's been going about a percent a year. So I don't think it's changed dramatically.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bill, as I said, this &#x2013; right now we're actually seeing B2C and B2B growth fairly similarly, given the current economy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe would be a lower percentage. I don't have exact numbers, but it's certainly much lower. Our focus there has been more business-to-business, more focused on export, which tends to be more business oriented. Although clearly there's a lot of companies in Europe and a lot of global companies that are looking more and more B2C, and that is a rapidly growing area.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on cash. I realize that you run a conservative balance sheet, but you're sitting on a lot of cash. And even some of the railroads are buying back more stock than you are. And I don't think we could say that they are more cash positive than UPS. So I just don't understand that sort of conservatism that you're having with &#x2013; relating to stock buybacks and return of capital.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bill, thanks for that question. And I tried to be explicit on it in my prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>But right now our intention is to get our S&amp;P outlook improved. They had concerns given last year's results of our funds flow from operation to debt margin. They gave us a benchmark. We're very confident we will meet that benchmark this year, way ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>And until that point, our strategy is to repurchase enough stock to avoid dilution through our stock compensation. After that, we will revisit that. And certainly, we have a commitment to return capital to shareowners. Of course, given where taxes are may make a difference also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. We've certainly &#x2013; our distribution policy has been strong. We've distributed most of our earnings the last several years.</p>
          <p>We'll watch very closely what happens in Congress through the end of 2010 and figure out what happens on tax policy, and that certainly could impact the dividends versus share repurchase.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions, one international, the other domestic.</p>
          <p>You guys had some cautious commentary in your press release regarding kind of your outlook in Europe. I was just wondering if you could provide some more color there? Is it just you positioning yourselves for the potential for a slowdown or are you currently seeing a slowdown within that part of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually think that Europe has been somewhat of a pleasant surprise based on all the media highlighted this year and certainly the sovereign debt crisis. I think that &#x2013; in fact, I just came back from a conference with about 100 CEOs, and we talked about Europe, and all of us are guarded about Europe just because of the unknown, but I think all of us are seeing pretty good business in Europe.</p>
          <p>In reality, I think the outlook for the euro-zone GDP has probably dropped from like a 1.5% growth rate to 1% growth rate through all of this hoopla on the sovereign debt issue. So I don't think it's changed that dramatically. Certainly, our business has been very strong. We talked about the double-digit growth in our European export products, and you saw the growth in the European domestic products.</p>
          <p>So it actually feels pretty good over there. We're going to be watchful and see what happens, but right now it feels pretty good in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the Domestic Package side, I think Kurt mentioned some cost benefits and some cost minuses during the second quarter. I think I heard a $0.02 number. Can you just talk a little bit about what the net impact was there from a cost perspective? And how do we think about operating margins at Domestic Package going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we did execute the lion's share of the restructuring, and we did see a significant amount of expenses in the second quarter. Things like relocations and training. Although we also were able to get some of the labor savings a little quicker than our plan. So the net impact for Q2 was about a $0.02 headwind overall of cost.</p>
          <p>That will improve in the third quarter where the amount of relos begin to taper down. So it will be a very modest positive in the third quarter, and then in the fourth quarter we'll see more of the benefit. But we do continue to estimate about a $0.10 a share benefit from the domestic restructuring. That will be manifest for 2011. Clearly it's one of the things we have going into next year that will be a positive.</p>
          <p>So the overall restructuring was the net positive $0.02 a share, a little better than frankly we thought. But on top of that is just the ongoing benefit from the wide array of cost initiatives and network enhancements we've made, and that's why we're seeing three quarters in a row now where, in aggregate, our comp and benefits are increasing at a slower rate than our package volume.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, and thanks for your time. A little bit about, you have been talking a lot about your international growth. As you talk to your customers, do you think we're seeing a modal shift from ocean to air in how they think about managing their supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's a little bit of that going on right now. I think right now there is somewhat of an ocean squeeze. Containers are hard to get. And that combined with the fact that there were a number of shippers last year that really got stressed late into the holiday season. That's why there was such an explosion in the forwarding activities.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing, I think, shippers plan ahead a little more, perhaps plan to use a little more air. Clearly the air forwarding and our Air Express businesses are growing very rapidly. So in general, my guess is there will be a little heavier concentration of air this year for the holidays, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up question. You talked about your customers trading up, and maybe it's along the same lines. Do you think this is a function of your customers really managing lean inventories and trying to manage their inventory situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we're getting back more to a normal environment.</p>
          <p>It's great to run very tight. It's great to use slower, lower cost modes. And during the midst of this recession, that was the priority. Customers had to reduce their balance sheet. They had to reduce their cost.</p>
          <p>Now that things are a little more stable, shippers are looking back at how do I optimize, how do I make sure I have got availability for goods without overinvesting in inventory. So that's where the more rapid services come in. So we're pleased to see that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly we talked earlier about inventory to sales ratios, and frankly they were pretty low going into the recession. They're a lot lower now than when we went into the recession, so I think that will drive some of the trade-up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, operator. Hi, gentlemen. I appreciate all the responses that you have given, and I kind of think most of my questions have been answered. Just one clarification.</p>
          <p>Do you think that you're seeing somewhat of an uneven recovery with industrial businesses growing and consumer-related businesses maybe growing not as fast? Or consumers slowing down but corporations growing faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the feeling is &#x2013; there's pretty good consensus that this will be a business-led recovery.</p>
          <p>I think that there were pleasant surprises probably in the first quarter on retail sales and the strength of the consumer, and the fact that the consumer is probably doing a little better than any of us thought a year ago at this time. But I think clearly this is a business-led recovery. You'll see industrial production continue to grow faster than GDP overall. And that's driven by the, obviously, the manufacturing side.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just real quick, most of my questions have been answered, but want to get your commentary on if you're seeing anything unusual in any of the markets from any competitors that you have. Anybody who's introduced new services that they're being aggressive about how they're trying to maybe take some market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Art, I think the market has been very rational.</p>
          <p>I think internationally we have seen stable pricing. I think all players had some challenges and they have been very rational. Domestically the market is sluggish, I guess. The demand is not robust. But the pricing is rational. Clearly the Post Office is wrestling with its financial issues.</p>
          <p>On the service side, FedEx has been expanding their global network. They are making a big deal of the 777s as game changer. That makes great press, but frankly we're very comfortable with our 747-400 assets. So we can pretty much go toe-to-toe. The 747 costs 40 to 50% less than a 777 from a capital perspective. And frankly anything less than 4,500 miles, it has a substantial payload advantage. And it pretty much matches the 777 for say Asia to Europe. But it's good. I mean, we want to compete on service and speed and quality. So that's what makes the market a healthy one.</p>
          <p>So we see competition continuing normally. We're continuing to reinvest with technology, capacity and merging all of our capabilities, and that's one of the big stories where I think we're really succeeding these days is all of the pieces of the UPS puzzle coming together.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we think the competitive environment is very positive. All providers are competing like crazy but also being rational. And we don't expect robust economic recovery, and that's what we tried to make clear both in our prepared comments and our press release. But we think even in this modest environment, we can prosper and continue to raise profits substantially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Art, probably the one area of the world that we're still paying attention to is China, and there's a lot of things going on in China.</p>
          <p>For example, the Chinese government is talking about consolidating the three airlines' cargo operations over there. And while that wouldn't have much impact on the small package side of things, it could impact our freight forwarding business, where we use those airlines. So those are things that are kind of in the process of change that we'll pay attention to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Appreciate you taking my call. I wanted to ask you about operating leverage. Obviously a very strong quarter for operating leverage here. You guys are showing more than you have in the past. I would imagine things like trading up in products and some of the repricing in DHL business is helping that out.</p>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit to where we are in terms of those events in particular? And then also kind of where you think we are in terms of you guys being able to display this kind of operating leverage on a consistent basis in terms of costs coming back in a cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, great. Thanks for the question.</p>
          <p>No, clearly the environment stabilizing is a great help. I think we did numerous initiatives, and we talked about us being able to keep the majority of those cost savings. We meant it, and I think you're seeing it.</p>
          <p>So we have been very pleased with the direct productivity, with the network changes. Having the highly automated hub with tremendous capacity at Worldport continues to allow us to take aircraft out of the sky and replace smaller aircraft with larger aircraft, so we're seeing the network economies there. I talked a little bit about our assets around the globe. The 747-400 is a very capital efficient asset that meets customer needs.</p>
          <p>I think one of the areas where we have not seen the operating leverage as much is in the wage arena. Clearly with us continuing to improve productivity, we have not had a need to add many employees, so we've still not yet seen the latent benefits of the labor contract, where as we begin to grow and add employees, we will see lower average wage rates ripple through the network.</p>
          <p>So that's something we're looking forward to hopefully as the U.S. recovery becomes more robust. That should give us another leg in this operating leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. That's very helpful. Then I guess not to harp on this, but following up on Bill Greene's question on the share repurchases.</p>
          <p>You guys have a lot of cash. Your balance sheet isn't over-levered. What's really the danger here for you guys to push ahead? Because it feels like &#x2013; and maybe it I'm getting ahead of myself, but waiting, you're obviously going to end up buying back the stock at a higher price, and I think shareholders would rather see you guys buying now rather than later.</p>
          <p>What's the down side consequence for just going ahead?  I mean, if S&amp;P were to downgrade you guys, what's the impact to the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's very little likelihood of S&amp;P downgrading us, given the incredible momentum we have got. But we did basically tell them our intentions to get those financial ratios robust. We think, given the expectation of our current momentum being far beyond even where we thought we were at the beginning of the year, that there's a good possibility that we will talk with them and have a little better view.</p>
          <p>So we're not totally beholding to them, but we also don't &#x2013; we don't like the negative outlook. We don't think it's appropriate, and we intended to demonstrate the financial capacity before we got more aggressive.</p>
          <p>But we committed five years ago to a policy of returning basically 100% of net income to shareowners, either in the form of share repurchase or dividends. I think Scott and I remain committed to that program. We do think that the stock is a bargain right now. And hopefully with these results, we'll get that one little minor cloud cleared up, and then we'll find what the best way to redistribute to shareowners is.</p>

          <p>We have a question from the line of Mr. David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. The first question on the purchase transportation, the costs were up significantly year-over-year in the quarter. I know a decent amount of that is fuel. Some is volume increases. Can you just kind of talk about that line item a little bit, how much might be volume versus fuel versus network adjustments, where you bought purchase transportation instead of adding UPS capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that line has a lot of moving parts now, especially as we have become a larger and larger forwarder.</p>
          <p>So the single biggest impact is the substantial growth we had in our Forwarding unit. Tonnage was up about 30% in the quarter. And on top of that, rates are dramatically higher than they were last year. So the lion's share of that increase would be directly related to the forwarding and the increased rates.</p>
          <p>Following that, there is &#x2013; certainly within our International business, we have a substantial amount of purchase transportation, either for agents or transportation. So with the dramatic 20% unit growth in International, that that's also up. And then the smaller part domestically would be fuel and there's also TOFSY in there.</p>
          <p>So it's really a reflection of the Forwarding and International growth, both which were in excess of 20%.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and then Scott, congratulations being named to the President's Export Council. It's good to hear that a business leader is actually on that council.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> It's very important, I think.</p>
          <p>We talked earlier about the need to get small businesses &#x2013; in the U.S., to get small business people to export. And I think the ability to help get out and train some of them on the ease of exporting &#x2013; we've identified 7 or 8,000 customers right now that export to just one country, and we're going try to get them to go to at least two countries. And we think that's very possible.</p>
          <p>So I think it's very important for the country to get employment going again, is to get small business exporting. We talked about 96% of the consumers outside the U.S. They need to understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand, but do you think it's possible to double exports over the next five years, given the current capacity constraints and trade policies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it all goes hand in hand. It's a stretch goal, but I think that we are going to have to get more accommodative trade policies. It starts with free trade agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama. And that's certainly part of what we're trying to work on on the council.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think a little closer to home, UPS is working like crazy to lowering the barriers to doing trade globally. That's why things like our paperless invoice, import control, all of that stuff. Just trying to automate things that used to be very confusing for small and midsized customers.</p>
          <p>So that's why we're so obsessed with technology and ease of use. If we make it easy and the government facilitates it, then we think there's a lot of latent capabilities in U.S. small business to grow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, guys. Just a question back on the domestic volume growth. If we are in for a more protracted level of modest growth, this kind of 1, 1.5, maybe 2% GDP for a protracted period of time, the reorganization that you just completed of the Domestic Package business, is that enough cost reduction to sustain the margins where they were this quarter through a protracted period of maybe slower growth in the domestic business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think John, it's, you know, it's our intention to increase margins, so no, absolutely. We have aligned ourselves in a number of ways to be able to continue to get margins growing and back, hopefully, over time to where they were at our peaks. So from a pure cost perspective, absolutely. I think there's also strategic positioning in our restructuring maybe that Scott could talk about a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A big part of the restructuring was all about getting our &#x2013; going to the customer, getting local control of our operations and our marketing. I think we're just getting the beginning of that process. We're taking marketing to all districts right now. It used to be done out of corporate. Every one our markets are somewhat different. I think the fact that we have this expertise now, looking at the different segments, look at micro-marketing, is going to help grow our business. It's not going to do it overnight. We're going to see more benefit the second half of the year than we saw the first half of the year; and we will see more benefit in 2011 than we saw in 2010; so I think it's a combination. Certainly we're going to save some costs, but I think the fact that we're giving more autonomy to our local operations, more decision making to our local operations, will help us run a better business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. The one thing I was a little bit surprised about in your answers in terms of the use of cash and the return of it, you know, wasn't &#x2013; there wasn't a lot of discussion there on maybe some of your growth initiatives or your acquisition outlook. Could you elaborate a little bit on that in terms of where that fits in, in the whole scheme of use of cash on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, John, we're going to be looking at opportunities to grow the business. I have said many times before our focal points are really going to be on the international package business, starting with Asia and probably Central and Eastern Europe. Clearly there are opportunities out there that fit our needs, that add our strengths, as far as capabilities or lanes that we need to strengthen, we'll take advantage of that. That never is far from one of our core areas of using cash. We're always looking for the right acquisitions. In the freight forwarding logistics world, again if we find areas that will fortify trade lanes or add capabilities and logistics, we'll take a look at those also. So it's a combination certainly of acquisitions, investing in the business, and distributing cash to shareowners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we &#x2013; our outlook though for cash flow is very positive for the next couple of years with the completion of our Worldport Air Hub, with the really replenishment and replacement of all the older aircraft in our fleet, our capital needs for the next few years are going to be significantly below the trend even with strong growth, so we're just in a good position of having a lot of choices right now with what we do with discretionary cash. And certainly growth would be the top priority.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of items. In your view is any of the strength you're seeing, particularly in the international volumes, reflective of maybe shippers looking to get ahead of the curve a little bit with regard to peak season because they're worried about capacity availability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, I do think that there may be some of that; that was part of my intention, my comments talking about the ocean squeeze and some of that. I think our &#x2013; a number of our customers, this is direct from our sales interview customers, did feel exposed last peak season and got in a jam. That's why there was such chaos trying to get goods out of Asia in late November and December. So there's a little bit of that not-this-time mentality. So we do think that there's &#x2013; people are pushing stuff through a little earlier. And as they see the constraints on the ocean side then it may make for an earlier air peak season also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think enough of that is happening that it will alter somewhat the normal seasonality as we go through the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I think right now it's way too early for it to be impacting air freight, but air freight continues to be strong. So it will be an interesting year. I think, as we come back, assuming the economy stays reasonably strong, then it could be a fairly interesting time, as there is some backlog I think on the ocean side already, the slow steaming in effect takes substantial capacity out, so a lot of companies that wouldn't normally think about using air freight earlier in the holiday season have been talking about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a follow-up, to the extent you're having high level discussions with customers about export and their strategic outlook, do you get any sense from customers that they are waiting for more clarity either on the policy front or the legislative front to make investments or to grow their businesses? Are people kind of sitting on their hands waiting for government to kind of settle out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think clearly policy uncertainty is one of the worst things for a recovery. And I think that the sooner we get some of these issues resolved, whether it be energy, we've got healthcare I guess somewhat resolved at this point in time, the sooner small business will spend money again and bring &#x2013; hire employees. So there's no doubt that policy uncertainty is an issue out there, and we need to resolve that to get this recovery going full steam.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello all. I had a follow-up to Robin's question on European both international domestic and export yields. You gave some color ex-Turkey. Could you also give us some sense of how much of an FX effect you had given the quite significant impact in Q1 and that we have seen euro dollar development if anything work against your favor a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, actually due to the impact of our hedging, the currency was actually not a huge impact. But we do show currency adjusted yields, export yields do show increases. Without currency it would be just a little bit lower. So no, we're seeing very good strength on our export side, good pricing power, and also the increased weight. The other big thing that's happened, and we saw a little bit of a shift, the transcontinental, the Asia to Europe, Asia to U.S. really was stronger than the intraregional shipments. And typically the yields on those long distance flights are much higher, so all in all very strong pricing, and we're very comfortable that those trends will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's clear. And just one quick follow-up. In terms of the trade-up effect that you referred to, are you seeing any signs of that within the European markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are actually. In Europe we offer this very integrated range of services from standard to express with no time commitment or afternoon commitments and early morning, and we are seeing a little bit of a shift across all of those up, just as the economy heats up, and frankly as we work with customers in Europe to help them realign their supply chains. You reduce your warehouses and you use a little more speed in your transportation network. So that trend has also helped the yield.</p>
