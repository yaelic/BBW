        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning to all of you and all of you who are here today and on the Internet, because we can be followed on Internet also, so I would like to welcome everybody who is listening to this presentation. And I'm particularly happy to be here today after weeks of speculations in the market, it's always good to come and tell you the truth. So I'm in a very happy position today to be able to do that.</p>
          <p>I would like to say that the presentation today will be a bit longer than usual, because we want to make sure that you leave this room with no doubt and as comfortable as you can be about those numbers and what they mean. So we felt that we could afford to make the presentation a bit longer than usual to give you all the details you need to perfectly understand the situation.</p>
          <p>First of all, I would like to say that if we look to 2007, it is a year for us where fundamentally if we look back that we have basically delivered on our strategic priorities to generate long-term value for shareholders. And I think that the full-year net profits were up 20% to 9.2 billion. And 9.2 billion, first of all, is the record profit of ING. It's also a very nice number, by the way. And by the way, it includes 2 billion of nice cash profits, which is even more economical because we just get paid in cash for that, right? Remember that. So it's kind of a nice number to look at. It's &#x2013; earnings per share is up 21%, and as you have seen, we are going to propose the General Assembly to increase the dividend by 12%, which is a kind of a nice increase.</p>
          <p>I have to say that I'm pleased to say that we have basically experienced a very limited direct impact from the credit crisis, due to two things: our business profile, because clearly we are essentially, as I will say later on, in a retail business of collecting savings and investing them in the market. And our business profile is also something that we manage carefully. In other words, there are obviously a number of business that we just don't want to get in. Okay? And that we have proactively decided not to get in. Right? And that should be no surprise to you, okay, because that's basically the way we manage our business.</p>
          <p>And second, within our business profile, we have basically developed risk management in the last few years into a very solid practice. And that's why we all end up the year with only 194 million pre-tax losses through P&amp;L in the fourth quarter, which is I think a reasonable number if you compare it with the 600 billion securities portfolio we have at ING.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to say that despite what I &#x2013; all the rumors in the market, there were no impairments on our Alt-A RMBS portfolio. And I want to say also that in those securities, there is a significant credit buffers in place. And I think &#x2013; Koos will go through that later on. But I think that's, of course, a very important issue that we want to discuss in this meeting.</p>
          <p>I'm also very pleased to say that if you look back to 2007, we had robust commercial growth in 2007. And I think value of new business in insurance is up 38% and went through the 1 billion mark for the first time with 1.1 billion. And volumes in banking continue to grow in all categories.</p>
          <p>I'm also happy to say that we are entering 2008 with a very strong capital position. And as of the 1st of January, we expect that under Basel II our Tier-1 ratio has increased from 7.2% to 9.9%, which shows that we have room to unlock capital in the bank.</p>
          <p>And also I'm pleased to report that our program of buying back shares has been on track, with 74% completed. We have a 5 billion share buyback. Just notice that when you make a 5 billion share buyback as it was announced a year ago, we bought back a few more shares than expected. Because all of a sudden that becomes the best investment we could make.</p>
          <p>And finally, I think that for those of you who observe ING carefully, I'm sure that you have noticed that we have shifted, clearly and progressively, our strategy to focus on very specific business, banking, investment, life insurance and retirement services, which by the way have one thing in common, is all those activities are basically in essence retail and in essence is collecting savings and redeploying them and investing that money in the market on the benefit of our clients. That's basically what we are doing, so I think that we can debate that and discuss that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Now let me first say about the strategies in 2007, what have we done. First of all, you have noticed that we have actively managed our business portfolio. We have made various acquisitions, focused on retail customers, banking distribution and high-growth markets. Example of that is OYAK Bank in Turkey. We have also divested in non-core business. And most recently you have seen that we have executed the sale of our non-life business in Mexico, which was in line with our strategy.</p>
          <p>Second, I think you can observe that we have continued our organic growth and we have developed our life insurance and Retail Banking greenfields in Central Europe and Eastern Europe. And by the way, we invested a lot of money in those new businesses, because we believe into them as well as in ING Direct, who has expanded its franchise.</p>
          <p>Third, we have progressed on the efficient capital allocation of our business. We have upstream capital to the group from business units. We have redeployed capital to growth markets. And basically we have made a very nice share buyback, and I think we pay a nice dividend, and you will see the numbers in a few seconds.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we are continuing to make our business more efficient. We are combining Postbank and IBN in the Netherlands and we are also transforming radically our Belgian network business. So we invest in the Benelux to be more efficient.</p>
          <p>Fifth, I think that you have seen that and I've always said that we were investing in risk management, and several of you said, "Well, yeah, okay, okay, okay, but this will be tested by the next crisis." Well, guys, this is it. So I think that what is the better test than the last few months. So I think that solid risk management has proven to be right, both the business profile and Koos' team has certainly helped shield ING from the direct impact from the crisis.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to invest in brand awareness. Why do we do this is because we believe and I strongly believe there's a fantastic opportunity in the world for ING to be one of the few worldwide retail financial services brands &#x2013; global brands. And I think that very few companies have a global retail brand. We think we are one of those few companies that can build that in the world. And this is what we want to do, and we'll continue to do so certainly this year.</p>
          <p>Now, we have also a track record of profitable growth in the last few years. I think that this is kind of a very nice growth over the last few years, which I want to say the 9.2 billion &#x2013; you know, we always the focus on and try to explain all the details on the numbers, but 9.2 billion in itself is a pretty nice number.</p>
          <p>And if you look also to our dividend increase since last few years, I think we have a progressive increase, which I think was in line with the quality and the development of our underlying business, as we said was our strategy.</p>
          <p>I think the fourth-quarter results &#x2013; we had underlying net profit up 23% to 2.6 billion, supported by equity capital gains. Now, if you look to this quarterly result, I think that &#x2013; and if you look to the results to the various business lines, and you see that some of our results are down and John will go over that. But if you analyze that carefully, you see that essentially that they are down because of the indirect impact of the financial situation.</p>
          <p>And I'll give you an example. For instance, if you look to Insurance Europe and if you look back into the numbers, what you see is basically, we had at the end of the last quarter in 2006 a huge revaluation of real estate portfolio, positive, and a huge revaluation of our private equity, which there, at the time, this is exceptional, it won't repeat again.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, I mean the market has shifted quite dramatically in a year, and what you see is the last quarter of last year, revaluations were close to zero. So, between big revaluation one year and closed to zero another year, there is big shift, and that explains &#x2013; and if you go business-by-business like this is, this is what you find. So, I think that I'm very comfortable and positive about our underlying business results because the commercial machine is driving extremely well.</p>
          <p>And I think that if you go to insurance highlights here, you can see that Insurance Europe &#x2013; I made the comment already, 200 million swing between one year into orders into revaluation, okay.</p>
          <p>Second, Insurance America, I think we have seen a very strong growth of sales and value of new business in America. But of course, the dollar has not helped us and because of the equity market in the last quarter, earnings declined because of the DAC and reserve unlocking, which is an accounting feature as you know.</p>
          <p>And third, if you look to Insurance Asia/Pacific, I mean results without Japan were up 17%. And if you look to Japan, I mean the essentially, we are down because CDO went wrong. So, the Japan investment, there's only one investment. I ask those guys do we have many investment like this. They say no. Okay we have only one. And so we took a loss on a CDO in our investment portfolio in Japan. And also we were impacted by the volatility of the hedge.</p>
          <p>And finally, on the corporate line, of course, we are the benefits of the ABN Amro and Numico shares sales. By the way, this is not a revaluation, it's cash.</p>
          <p>On the banking sides, we have had a very good performance in wholesale banking. If you look to 8% growth from 6 to 7, I think it's pretty good. Earnings are very resilient. Risk profile is good, risk costs are very low. So, I think those are very good results. Especially if you know that in the second part of the year trading in financial instruments and financial market was not very active because we were very prudent in the last the part of the year. And also that the leveraged finance business was basically at a standstill. So, I think given that background, I think Wholesale Banking did extremely well.</p>
          <p>Retail Banking, I think &#x2013; it's basically &#x2013; it looks like optically minus 0.5%, but the reality is plus 10%, because we have to basically take out an exceptional capital gains of 44 million in the last quarter of 2006, which we reported at the time on the sale of Banksys. So, if you take that out, fourth quarter was up 10%, which I think is pretty good, and we have seen good volume in Retail Banking, which were offsetting margins, which were basically under pressure because as you know, what we see in retail banking is today there are number of banks who are scrambling to get deposits, because they cannot find themselves in their number one markets. So they basically scramble to pay a lot of money to deposits to get them. Because they just desperately need those deposits to finance themselves. So there is there competition that we noticed very clearly.</p>
          <p>And at finally ING Direct. ING Direct has continued to support its growth. I think we had a number of small issues in the ING Direct in the last quarter. First of all the UK, but we are addressing this and I'm really ready to respond to questions later on. I think we experienced an impairment in Canada, but if you take that out, underlying profits were up 14% in the fourth quarter of 2007. And we are very confident in the franchise development of ING Direct.</p>
          <p>Now, I think that I would like to come back to this and basically insist to the fact that our business profile and risk management have shielded ING from the direct impact of the credit market turmoil. Keep in mind that ING is primarily a retail house. We collect customer balances and invest them, either through the bank or the insurance company. This is basically the same business. Now, the balance &#x2013; the customer balance can come in the form of current accounts, savings accounts, mutual funds, pensions contributions, life insurance, but essentially is the same &#x2013; the same idea is to work with our customers to help them save.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we have a defined risk appetite, and we have the tools to track it. And you know the "risk dashboard," and we'll talk about that later. But the key thing is that we select the businesses and assets we want to invest in. And we are not sucked in like getting into all sorts of toxic assets, because we want to make nice money on the trading or the inceptions or on the value on the upside.</p>
          <p>Yes, I recognize that in the last few years, we have forgone some earnings. Yes. But I think that was the right strategy, and I think that today, it pays off. Realize also that ING, we are here to invest against our liabilities and our deposits, so we are in essence a long-term investor. I have said that before, but this is key. We are essentially a long-term investor. And we aim to hold most of our assets to maturity.</p>
          <p>Of course, to maintain flexibility they are booked as available for sale, which makes them subject to revaluations. But they had been revalued against assets in the years and nobody ever asked any question about it. It just happened in the last few weeks, everybody is concentrating on this. But this is kind of interesting because when revaluing up quite dramatically in the last few years, our interest rate went down, there was no question asked. And I always said to my guys, "Well when it goes in the other direction, we'll have few a questions." It's exactly what happened. But the reality is as those instruments were revalued to equity, get close to maturity, they go back to par. So, essentially you have to look it from that standpoint. Because you have to look at it as an ongoing institutions, and not an institution will liquidate itself.</p>
          <p>The assets we buy, we use our own credit quality. And the credit quality is very simple. People forget about what means credit quality. Credit quality means simple. You look at the borrower; do you know the borrower? By the way sometimes nobody knows the borrower anymore. Do you know the borrower, and do you know if he is able to reimburse you? Simple, stupid question, but kind of useful from time to time. Second thing is, if in the case he doesn't reimburse you, do you have a collateral? And what is the value of that collateral? Simple question to ask you. And finally, is that documented some way, in way that is understandable by anybody that looks at it? Also, a third question which is pretty simple. But you know, over the years people have forgot to ask those questions. And they buy instruments but without asking, who is the borrower? Who is going to repay me? And what is the collateral? Where is it? What is the value of it?</p>
          <p>I think this is a job that our risk management has to do and is doing. And as a result, we have a ratably conservative risk profile of our assets and credit portfolio. Now of course, as a big financial institution, I think assets, we are also subject to markets' inconsistencies and to market volatility. I mean, this is very clear.</p>
          <p>But I think the question is to make sure that we are managing that in way that is sustainable over the long term. I would like to say also as a clear, we are not an originator CDOs and a manufacturer of RMBS. We're not. Okay? And that's important because if you were in this business of manufacturing those things, basically, you were tempted to keep some tranche of it, and I think when you see a lot of losses in the market is because people kept it.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have a conservative selection of assets with a high structural credit protection and this is Alt-A portfolio, and of course, we'll go through that in a few minutes. So, I think that I'm not going to repeat this and go to through the slides because Koos will address this risk cost in greater detail. But I think generally speaking, I would like also to insist here on this, that during all this credit crisis, our liquidity position has always been very healthy and very comfortable, and our funding has always been pretty easy, and didn't create any problem for us.</p>
          <p>Now, we end up the year with strong capital positions with ratios well within target. And I think that's an important thing, because as we start the year, we feel comfortable to concentrate on our business, on our client franchise, rather than to scramble for liquidity or deposits or capital. And we have the capital &#x2013; our capital has been used to support growth, make acquisitions, buy back shares and pay attractive dividends.</p>
          <p>It's interesting that at the end of the year 2007, we have a spare leverage capacity increased compared to the start of the year, despite of all the market turmoil. And even more, since Basel II risk-weighted assets are more than 100 billion lower than Basel I risk-weighted assets by all the to rules of today, basically, our Tier-1 ratio is going up to 9.9% as of the 1st of January. And this frees up about 7 billion of Tier-1 capital in the ING Bank. So, I think this is quite an important &#x2013; we always mentioned that to you. And it was subject to the Central Bank review of our portfolio. It has been done, and I think that this will be confirmed within a few weeks. So, I think we start the year with very strong position.</p>
          <p>And if you look to &#x2013; we did use the &#x2013; our capital and cash last year, essentially &#x2013; basically, this is an important slide because it shows the capital movements. First of all, we had a spare leverage of 3.1 billion at the start of 2006. We have increased our hybrid limit at the ING Insurance by 3 billion. We add the net contribution of ING Bank, the net contribution of ING Insurance, and all this available cash or leverage opportunity was compensated because we spent 3.2 billion on the share buyback so far. 3.3 billion was paid as a dividend to shareholders, 2.6 billion was used for acquisitions. As you can see, we returned more than twice money to the shareholder that we used to make acquisitions. And some divestments bring some cash into the company. So, by the end of 2007, our spare leverage had increased to 4.8. Now, if you add to that the impact of Basel II as of the 1st of January, which add another 4.7 billion, then our spare leverage at the first of 2008 is about 9.5 billion, which is kind of nice number.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to spend with you some time on the strategy. I now that it's probably not the right time to go over that blank, because your mind is geared toward other questions today. But I would like still to re-emphasis the fact that if you look to what I've done in the last four years, after restructuring the portfolio, I think more recently and certainly going forward, we are recentering our business around four business lines, which is essentially banking, investment, life insurance, and retirement services.</p>
          <p>And this because we are looking at the trends outside and what are the trends outside, we see people are living longer and need to take more responsibility for own retirements. We see people are getting richer, particularly in developing markets. We see technology which is changing the distribution of financial services, and we see customers that are demanding value for money and simplicity. And finally, more recently we see the value of trust starting to creep again, which we think is a very good fact for companies like ING.</p>
          <p>Now if you look back and you take those trends to the filter of our mission, which is setting the standard in helping our customer manage their financial future, and if you look that through the filter of our strengths, we feel at ING that we have three fundamentals strengths in this business. First is the product range, the distribution capacity and the brand.</p>
          <p>On the product side, if you look to &#x2013; we have basically all the capacity developed, all the retail product that needs to help customers save money. We have a very strong capacity to deploy the right distribution in any market we want to get in, and we want to develop and we are developing a strong brand. So, essentially, if we look through those filters and you try to concentrate to what you see in the market and what are our strengths, basically we have decided to sharpen our strategic focus to banking, investment, life insurance and retirement services.</p>
          <p>I think this is going to decomplexify the Group, because we concentrate on essentially what is the essential part of our business, collect savings, and invest those savings in the market. Collect savings and help our clients invest that money. And it doesn't matter if those savings &#x2013; the manner it comes into the company, through savings accounts, through mutual funds participations, through life premiums, through pension contributions, it's always the same thing. We want to catch the client through his saving cycle.</p>
          <p>And our priorities will be, in retail and mass affluent clients, in bank distribution, because we believe very much that bank distribution &#x2013; as insurance products and life insurance is shifting to investment products, it's more essential than ever to have enough access to bank distribution to developing markets. And by the way, we believe very strongly that there are two core capabilities that are required to do this job properly. Number one is a good asset management capability, and number two a good asset gathering capability.</p>
          <p>I said that many times in the past, I think the recent past has shown that I was absolutely right, and that if you are able to build you own assets, you're in a much stronger position than if you have to permanently rely to the securities market to do so. And I think that &#x2013; I think if there is something of the credit crisis which is very clear, is that a previous crisis has shown the limit of securitization. And that building your own asset base, maybe it's a little bit old fashioned, but it's damn efficient, and that's what we intend to do.</p>
          <p>And what we want to do is to take the clients by the end through his life cycle. And what we want to do is basically look at all the phases that the client has to basically save money. And typically any young kid will start to open a current account, okay, and will basically at the end of his life cycle enjoy a pension annuity. That's basically what it is. More and more it is the situation because less and less governments are able to basically built their own pensions. So they are looking to the private sector, and we have seen that in Romania, we have seen in Poland, in other countries, this is a very important business for us.</p>
          <p>So, basically what we intend of do is to basically take the client through his life cycle from the opening of a current account through the shift to a savings account, through the fact that the first big important decision once a young person gets married or is getting to his working life is to save, buy a house and taking a mortgage. It's a very important step in his savings process. By the way, it also creates very good assets for us. Than when he has done that, he is going to go into mutual funds, unit-linked investments, then he will probably start having a pension &#x2013; a pension contract and a big pension contribution. He will take a life insurance, maybe a term life, and then we'll have to shift that back into annuities because you will have to make sure that he gets the sufficient cash flow to basically live from 60 to 90 years old.</p>
          <p>This is what's going to happen. This is what we want to do. This is what we want to cash. This is the core of our business. And we believe very much that this is a trend. By the way, this is also a business in which there is a permanent fuel of business, because you got those savings coming all the time. And the idea of buying the pension business we bought in Latin America to get 5 million clients is, you get those clients today, but you're going to get a fuel of cash coming in for the next 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. That's a very good business, because it's a retail franchise to get savings into the shop. And that's what we want to do.</p>
          <p>Now, if you think about it differently, and I think that we are going to expand on this in the next few weeks and certainly at our analysts meeting in April. You can look at ING as a succession of savings buckets, in which we want to basically get the client in. And I think the franch of ING has to be measured about how quickly and how fast are those savings buckets growing, and what is the spread that we collect on all those savings buckets? And I think that's clearly something we want to expand on, and this is not the day today, I think because their mind-sets are somewhere else. But we certainly will do that at a different occasion in the coming months.</p>
          <p>And I'll give you an example, the best way to look at this is our situation in Poland. Poland is a fast-developing market with dynamic economic growth, and we have there the full range of the products that I mentioned before. ING Bank &#x15A;l&#x105;ski has 2.2 million retail clients. We have about 10% market share in deposits. In Insurance, we have 400,000 clients. In Pension, we have 2.6 million clients, and Wholesale Banking &#x2013; also very important by the way &#x2013; offers the asset gathering on all the assets we need to serve those deposits.</p>
          <p>So it's very important, and if you look through our retail product categories that I mentioned before, current account, savings deposit, mortgage lending, assets under management, pension, retirement and life insurance, this is kind of a nice number of billions that we collect. Now we collect them from different sources, from different distribution channels, but at the end of the day, it is a very powerful way to get a critical mass of the Polish savings.</p>
          <p>And I think this is exactly what we want to do in various places. We want to attract the largest possible share of the savings, and it's not only by the bank channel, but it's also by the pension channel, by the insurance channel that we get that. And the overall critical mass makes us a special player in the market, and that's what we want to do, and that explain our efforts. For instance, I could make the same slide for Romania, and I will as a matter of fact in one of the future presentations.</p>
          <p>In that context &#x2013; and in the context of having refocused the strategy, we are actively managing our capital in line. Now, we have already started last year, and I'm not going to go through all the slides, but what this slide means &#x2013; first of all, there was a lot of activity at ING last year of business acquisitions, business restructuring, divestments and they were all in line with what we want to do, retail, distribution, developing markets and asset management and asset gathering.</p>
          <p>So all what we did in the last year is already in line with this refocused strategy. This is also the way you have to understand little bit what we did in Latin America. In Latin America, we decided this is an important market, but we want to shift out of non-life, and we want basically to reinvest the proceeds into savings business and pension business and life business. That's what we did and that's why &#x2013; now the sequence was a bit different. We first acquired a very large pension business in Latin America.</p>
          <p>We are now in a very substantial position throughout America in the pension business. And we basically finance that partly by selling our Mexican business, and I think that's good a trade, because it's a trade to refocus the strategy of ING the way we want; it's a trade that leaves us a very strong presence in a very fast growing market, Latin America. And in a number of markets, we have good positions and market share position, and we intend to grow them as we find opportunities to do that.</p>
          <p>So, in short &#x2013; and before I give the words to John &#x2013; I think what we have to remember is that 2007 has been a year where we have delivered on our strategic priorities to generate long-term value for shareholders. Full-year profit was up 20%. Quarterly profit, by the way, were up about 20%. We had a limited direct impact from the credit crisis. We had robust commercial growth. We had a strong capital position, and we came out starting 2008 with a very sharp and strategic repositioning of the group through banking, investment, life insurance, and retirement services. And by the way I think that this year will offer quite a lot of opportunities for strong companies like us, and I hope that we will be able to show you the results of that during 2008.</p>
          <p>John, your turn.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Michel. I'm going to go fairly quickly through my section. There's a lot of slides that we typically produce on the earnings and the sections, but I will slow down when we get into some of the more fascinating areas of IFRS accounting dealing with impairments and valuation of securities of interest.</p>
          <p>There are five key points though, in terms of the financials in this quarter. And as I summarize it, the fourth quarter profit was impacted by positive equity, capital gains, and a low tax rate amid some market volatility. We had a limited direct impact of only 194 million pre-tax from the credit crisis.</p>
          <p>Our disciplined capital management continues with a very strong capital position. And we've taken some quotes from our quarterly report that summarize the insurance and the banking results. The high sales and the value of new business, driven by good commercial performance. And our profits were boosted in insurance by capital gains but we did have lower revaluations compared to '06 in real estate and private equity.</p>
          <p>On the banking side, we think our banking business has held up quite well amid quite a bit of market and credit turmoil. The profits were slightly up, supported by commercial growth, low risk costs, reflecting the limited impact.</p>
          <p>This is the slide we produce each quarter that shows &#x2013; breaks down the quarterly profit and highlighting the realized capital gains from shares and insurance, which is one of the big items that varies a lot quarter-to-quarter. And essentially the piece in the middle that's highlighted shows the fourth quarter was essentially the same as the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In looking at some of the special items, I'd like to highlight just a couple things. I mentioned already our low tax rate. That was driven by the insurance capital gains, which are essentially tax-free, and also we had some good settlements in taxation with the tax authorities. We had a strong growth in underlying net profit and some divestments in special items, which are highlighted on this slide. We have signed an agreement to sell NRG, a run-off with PNC Reinsurance Company. We participated in an investment in Sul America in an IPO that was a gain.</p>
          <p>We've set up restructuring provisions in our Wholesale Bank to help revitalize and improve our general lending and trading operations. We also had de-continued provisioning and costs related to our combining ING Bank and Postbank in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>We had quite a low effective tax rate for the entire year, 13.9%, and also it affected &#x2013; we had a lower tax rate also in banking as well. This was driven by lower statutory rates moving down in the Netherlands, higher taxes and gains on the shares, as well as tax provisions that were released. I've given some guidance; we've said generally that we think our tax rate is going to be between 20 to 25%. But for '08 it's looking like we're going to be on the low end of that range, 20%, just to give you some clear guidance on that component.</p>
          <p>Now, just what we've always wanted to become experts in is IFRS accounting policy, when it comes to fair value changes. The vast majority of all these core assets that we hold, the assets of interest, let's say, the subprime residential mortgage-backed securities, the Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs/CLOs, these are almost &#x2013; the huge majority is held as available for sale.</p>
          <p>And how this works is that the fair value changes of these securities are held on the asset side of the balance sheet at fair value, with the offsetting difference in shareholders equity, it's called a revaluation reserve. But these securities &#x2013; each quarter we look at these securities, and decide are they impaired? And what that means is that, you are impaired if you don't think you will get back your principal plus your interest. And all the securities are examined by risk with models and we look at the model to decide if they're impaired.</p>
          <p>If they become impaired, if a security becomes impaired, that's held is available for sale, the difference between the book value and the fair value is immediately taken through your P&amp;L. So you have a loss by that amount. And that's different from assets that are held like loans, commercial loans, where you set up provisions over time for impairments. We have a small book that is held as fair value through the P&amp;L. And that of course, the fair value changes each quarter directly go through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And I think it's very important when you analyze from company to company to understand how they're holding these assets. Some banks like us hold it as available for sale, because we buy these assets to support our long-term &#x2013; and all of our liabilities. We plan to hold these to maturity. Other companies may be trading these or record these all as fair value through the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>You can see the right-hand side has been the impact, the 194 million, is in the lower right-hand corner, and we've split these into three key definitions. Impairments, that's available for sale that becomes impaired, that I just mentioned. A markdown is an asset held as a fair value through the P&amp;L, and of course the price is then marked down in the quarter. And you may have a trading loss; you're actually trading securities. You don't own that security any more, but we lost money in trading relative to these securities. So that's the trading loss of 17 million. And this includes not only the three assets classes of interest, but also the impact to monolines that we had to adjust for one monoline that was severely downgraded, and we don't think we'll get our money back on that. And investments in SIVs and asset-backed commercial paper, where we've had small investments that we've had to write down.</p>
          <p>The lower right-hand corner sums up the total revaluation reserve in terms of the balances. So this total is 1.3 billion negative revaluation reserve for these asset classes. Our total amount &#x2013; and this is pre-tax &#x2013; the total amount in our balance sheet for debt securities is 1.9, which I'll get to in a minute, and you can see the current market value. I think it's really important to also focus on the market values of these assets relative to these percentages, 90% for subprime, that's quite a bit above the ABX index, because the quality of this portfolio that Koos will go through. Our Alt-A RMBS that a lot of people have had a lot of interest in is holding up very well at 97%, and CDOs and CLOs at 93, although it's a much smaller group.</p>
          <p>The next question is, well, how do you calculate these fair values in these tough markets? And there are three ways to do it in IFRS. This was a little-known footnote in the back of the annual reports that everyone's looking at now. The first one is a reference to a published price quotation in an active market. The second is where you may not have an active market for that security, but you use a model that uses market inputs and you interpolate. The third area is that you have a model but you cannot get observable market inputs even for that type of instrument, so you have to model it in terms of an intrinsic value.</p>
          <p>Our total 603 billion of available for sale assets, you can see category A is the vast majority, 450 billion, 147 billion of category B and only 4 billion worldwide in our category C. And of the three asset classes of interest, it's only 17 million. And all of this review of course we do, but we've had our auditors. KPMG and E&amp;Y, be reviewing all this as well.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the shares and bonds, in terms of these revaluation reserves, there are two components here, and this gets confusing sometimes. So I just want to be clear on this. We have a revaluation reserve for equity shares. So that's the value, the shares, the market value of those shares are above the book value, and when we sell these securities, then we record it as a capital gain.</p>
          <p>You can see between June and September, the value in the banking operating went up quite a bit, and that's because of the IPO of Bank of Beijing. Okay, we have a three-year hold on that stock, but you can see the impact of that. It went down between the third quarter and the fourth quarter because we sold ABN Amro and Numico, and then the value of that goes through P&amp;L, it comes out of the equity revaluation reserve and goes through retained earnings. So total equity doesn't change, but it moves in these categories.</p>
          <p>There's also debt securities, and these revaluations are affected by many things: interest rates, credit spreads, liquidity of markets, and you can see the transition as interest rates have risen around the world throughout '07. You can see the negative revaluation turning down, as well as credit spreads widening.</p>
          <p>Now, this is only important to the extent that you may have to sell these or you plan to sell these or they become impaired. And again, as I said, we test all this on a quarterly basis where we plan to hold these to maturity. And of course, when you have an asset, it will get close to this revaluation where several decrease as you get closer to maturity.</p>
          <p>Michel spoke briefly about our Basel II risk-weighted assets, and I won't go through a lot of detail here. But essentially, there are many different ways to measure capital, and we previewed some of this last April to you. We have on the far right-hand corner, our economic capital. That's how we measure capital. And under Basel II, in terms of requiring capital, we have to take the higher of the 90% of Basel I. That will move to 80% next year. And the following year, then you only go in two measures, Basel II pillar 1 or Basel II pillar 2, which keep our risk managers very busy calculating all these along with working with our Dutch regulator, but suffice to say, we have a very solid buffer.</p>
          <p>We also look at our capital on a pure economic basis. And we look at the economic capital that's the risk capital we think we need to run the group, compared to the full available financial resources, essentially mark to market our entire balance sheet, assets less liabilities, and you can see we have a significant buffer on an economic basis at the end of the year as well.</p>
          <p>Our share buyback is 74% completed to the 15th of February. We had significant trading volumes from December to the 15th of February. We have to time the share buyback in relation to how much trading volume we have in a day, and we had significant volumes in the past little while, so the team that did that brought some more shares. But we are on track to complete this at the end of May, and you can see we've bought an even amount, each area. I also had some questions, so I've given you a table here to track through the shares issued and outstanding, how much we have in treasury, how much we're in the market.</p>
          <p>Because we have had these Warrants B that have been exercised to the first week in January, because that was when they expired, was on January 5th. And they were a two-for-one deal; each warrant gave us two shares we had to issue, and they've all been issued across the board. So, that has dampened the impact on the shares in the market. But that's gone now, that's done, and the share buyback will be driving through directly now with of course the hedge program that we have for personnel stock options; we have to issue shares for the hedging.</p>
          <p>In terms of insurance, we've had very strong value in new business growth, up 38% year-on-year. We reached over &#x20AC;1 billion. Now, about 115 million of that was from the Romanian in pension fund, which is really more like a one-time event, certainly in Romania. But even still being a billion from where we were 800 million last year is a dramatic rise in our sales and our value of new business. It's been a keen focus for our organization worldwide, and it's happened really across the board.</p>
          <p>Likewise, driven by the strong VNB on embedded value growth, a 17% return in Life Insurance embedded value. We took some dividends of excess capital out of our insurance operations. We took these gains and took the opportunity to have good capital management take it up to Group. Our Group EV is now 21.19 per share.</p>
          <p>In Insurance Europe, the earnings are down year-on-year, driven by lower revaluations of private equity, real estate. Also a year ago we had about a 100 million release in the non-life sector. And one thing I've highlighted for you here in the lower right-hand corner is the year-on-year trend. And you can see that, yes, the Netherlands Life is down, okay, in '07 versus '06, as is the non-life. But the Central Europe is coming on, it's growing at a very dramatic clip, and is making up for that over time.</p>
          <p>In Insurance Americas, the &#x2013; particularly the U.S. and the currencies were hurt in the quarter, and the equity markets being down a bit relatively, caused DAC unlocking to drive this down. But they have had record variable annuity sales in the quarter. I think we were in top three in terms of market share in the fourth quarter with our VA products. That's accomplished by a new product as well as we've expanded our wholesaling network. We added 18 wholesalers in the network and increased our penetration across the board through all our distribution channels.</p>
          <p>And you can see the trend here year-on-year is also quite interesting. Because to think about the U.S. business, given how much currency's gone down in the last few years, they're still making very solid growth. If this was in U.S. dollars, that would be quite a different &#x2013; even more increasing graph.</p>
          <p>Insurance Asia/Pacific was down 19% in earnings. It was actually up 17% if we exclude the big swing in Japan. Japan was driven by, of course, high volatility in the earnings due to increased volatility in all the markets in the SPVA business. You can see it in the lower right-hand corner, the swing year-by-year in these earnings in Japan. We are working to improve the accounting for this to smooth this out a bit over time and adopt our hedging program to be a little more smooth in terms of the underlying earnings. But this is still a volatile business from time to time. So you can see the strong growth in the other areas outside of Japan, and very good value of new business growth, 35% increase in the year.</p>
          <p>Corporate Line Insurance. Just to remind you that this is where the excess gains on equities is booked for units that have the equities, particularly &#x2013; it's almost all in Insurance Europe. They get a 3% return we put into the accounting directly and put the volatility in the corporate line of insurance.</p>
          <p>In Banking, we had very low loan losses in the quarter. We had a large release and a provision in Wholesale Banking, 115 million. We finally settled a long outstanding discussion with somebody, and that happened just before the end of the year. But I think that the 23 basis points for the year or even the 24 basis points gross addition in the quarter, although it's gone up a little from the third quarter is still a very respectable loan loss provision, which is reflecting the high quality our overall portfolio. In terms of interest margins in the bank, we saw a slight uptick of 3 basis points in Q4 from Q3. And ING Direct basically stabilized, so it is at lower levels than it was in '06.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking, we had this release that happened through, you can see it in the addition to the loan losses, and we're continuing to execute to improve cost income ratios across the board. But their costs were essentially flat in the year. We have a note in the lower left-hand corner for you, just want to highlight that we will be transferring the mid-corporate client business in the Netherlands to Retail Banking, effective for the first quarter of '08. And that's about 13% of Wholesale Banking's profit. And you can see the wide distribution of Wholesale Banking that's asset gathering business, where we put money to work in solid assets, it's actually quite diversified.</p>
          <p>Retail Banking we think did quite well in really a toughening environment. The earnings were flat but there was a release, a gain a year ago, so it's up 10% excluding that gain. And year-on-year you can see the steady progress in the Benelux as well I've seen now an increasing growth of earnings in Poland and the other developing markets. So these earnings are happening while we're significantly investing in the lot of other businesses as well and improving the business in the Benelux.</p>
          <p>OYAK Bank we purchased and made the announcement on June 19th. We wanted to give you the final numbers here because the U.S. &#x2013; we made this deal in U.S. dollars in June, and it improved across the board by the end of the year. And in addition OYAK Bank had much better earnings in the year then people had thought. So the ending price to book that we bought this at was at 2.75, which we think for the opportunity to be in a market that's growing in the 20% a year range for retail deposits and retail mortgages is really an exciting opportunity for us. And this will be rebranded this summer as ING Bank.</p>
          <p>ING Direct was down in the &#x2013; compared quarter-on-quarter, driven primarily by the UK, which had a higher loss in the quarter but we expect that to head down throughout '08. And also Canada had a write-off of an asset-backed commercial paper investment. The Canadian market for that stopped, and so they had to write down that piece of that investment.</p>
          <p>You can see the growth year-on-year in the lower right-hand corner. I think when you step back from this and take into account that in 2007 we had increasing or flattening yield curves in almost all the currencies in which do business, we really held up pretty well across the board. And we see an opening up of the yield curve, first in the U.S. already, and that might happen later on this year in Europe. So we expect this to get a little better.</p>
          <p>ING Direct UK, we spoke about earlier. We've essentially reduced the outflow dramatically down to only 600 million in the quarter. We've spent a lot on marketing. It did result in a loss of 76 million in the quarter. We expect this to be the peak and the losses to be down less, but we do expect losses generally throughout '08.</p>
          <p>Corporate Line of Banking is a bit of a complex thing to look at. But it's &#x2013; the capital management reflects the difference between our earnings on our excess capital and the economic capital. We changed our models a bit in the second quarter. After the second quarter that turned what was a loss and now it's a positive across the board and this should be about this level moving forward for the next little while.</p>
          <p>So I've covered this key point. I wanted to keep this fairly quick. We give you a lot of information here. But of course, I'd be happy to take questions. Because I think you're all waiting for the man of the day here, our Chief Risk Officer, Koos Timmermans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you. What I would like to do is to guide you through our total portfolio in ING. And we do it on a risk management basis. So we're not going to go asset-by-asset, because it will take a bit longer. But I have structured a presentation, where you will get quickly an insight and we'll stop a little bit further with some of the assets, which are of more relevance. But we'll make a decent tour there.</p>
          <p>But before doing so, some of the key points which I'd like to note. Again, it is not being in the business of originating subprime. This is one of the fundamental points, which plays a role, so that is why we have been, point B, selectively a buyer of product. And we have been a buyer of product with the intention to hold it. So we do credit analysis before, we want decent credit enhancement, because we think we're going to sit on this product for a long time.</p>
          <p>The other point is, in general, we are not &#x2013; well in general &#x2013; we are just not in the business of CDOs. And the reason that I say so is that these products they give a lot more pricing uncertainty there. So that is an important factor for us. And if you look at our portfolio overall, then you can say, like our subprime has been outperforming the ABX, and we will come to that. And also if you look at, why is that one of the bigger drivers for us, is credit enhancement.</p>
          <p>And if I give you the typical example, current losses in the Alt-A's, if I compare that with credit enhancement, then things can get eight times worse. Now, I know that current losses are another good predictor, you got to look a bit further, but that's what we'll do in this presentation.</p>
          <p>To give some order, one of the things is let's look at ING on the far right-hand side. What you see is we got 1.3 trillion of assets on our balance sheet in total, bank and insurance. Now, what I'd like to do in this presentations is not to zoom in on all of the 1.3 trillion. We will look at the investment portfolio. So that it is 293 billion, which you see in the middle, and specifically segment out of there, which is the ABS portfolio, and we will go through that in a lot more detail.</p>
          <p>But before doing so &#x2013; and then not to forget is we will also talk about liquidity and some of the off-balance sheet exposure like the monoliners. We surely don't want to exclude them. But before going through all these, there is two things which give uncertainty in a market with regards to valuation. One is embedded in the product, and the other one is embedded in the process.</p>
          <p>But let's first talk about the products, because that is what we have here. We are an investor in AAA RMBSs, and why do I say so? I mean, if we look at RMBSs structure, is there on the left-hand side, what you see is we buy RMBSs and that's a pool of mortgages. And those mortgages basically are tranched. And the tranched is which we are buying our AAA tranches. So in other words, there is a lot of credit protection is embedded in the notes which we buy.</p>
          <p>So we start to get losses, but only after the excess spread has been taken out. And the excess spread, that is the coupons and the payments of the mortgages which are just bigger than what is embedded in the note. There is over collateralization, there is BBB tranches, the A tranches and the AA tranches, they will get hurt first before our note get hurt. That is the first part on the RMBSs which is important. If you look at it, the price graph of the RMBSs is what you see above there that is the light blue. So what you see is in the graph an underlying deterioration of mortgages will affect your RMBSs, the AAAs, not in the beginning, but at a later stage. But that price graph is not really context.</p>
          <p>Now let me create another type of security, and the other security would be, let's create a similar structure like what we have on the left-hand side. But then, not as an underlying pool mortgages, but as an underlying pool we take the A tranches of these RMBSs, and this is a CDO. So if we create a CDO, then it is we have, for instance, A tranches of RMBSs. We stick them in a pool, and we start then to create tranches and we start then to create AAA tranches. If you invest in that, that is little more complex. Now why is that the case? If you have losses creeping up in the underlying pool of mortgages, your A tranches, they get hit first. So if you create a note, a CDO, which is full of these A tranches, the whole CDO price starts to move. And that is why what you see, and that is the yellow graph, CDOs in case of deterioration of the underlyings, they start to lose value quicker.</p>
          <p>At the same time what you also have is these days there is uncertainty, especially if you look at the subprime market like how much are the expected losses? If you move from &#x2013; well, I mean, I've seen the Moody's reports as well between 12 and 24. If we look at S&amp;P's they say like 19% revised up. So the loss expectations, there is a big variety in there, so that means like there is also uncertainty about the value of these CDOs. The good news is, those are the one we don't have. I mean we are setting on these AAA RMBSs. So that is the first part which creates our more certainty about the pricing, why I can talk about it here relatively comfortably.</p>
          <p>The second part more has to do with process. And if you look at process, then let's look at pricing methodologies. I think John, he alluded to already level A, B and C type of prices, and if I just fill you in on how this works in practice. Let's take an example, the ING Alt-A portfolio. The way how it works is as follows. I mean, we buy prices, and we buy that for instance from, financial FT Interactive. We buy prices from Bear Stearns. And what you actually buy is the following. You just say like, "Here, this is collateral. This is what the weighted average life is. This is what the rating is. And this is what the originator is." So who is originating the underlying mortgages.</p>
          <p>So we give them tables, and then they come back to us with spreads. So, they look at where, at what spreads, did all of these securities trade. That's called market prices. We ask that from two sources, and than we do it ourselves is well. So we basically have three sources of pricing. There we start to compare, and if we compare and the prices look very much similar, than we say like, "Okay, we are fine, nothing to be done." If there is big price deviation, well, we first start to call back every seller &#x2013; are you certain, was this the prices or not? Than we have to take a decision like is it price of them, price of us and that's in each of these individual cases assessed.</p>
          <p>So, we call the A, that is, if we say like, if we got independent sources two times and our own prices and all of them are alike and they're within a range, then we feel like that's an A pricing on market observed. If we feel like there's a deviation between them above a threshold then we say like, "Hey this is not directly market observed," and we call it a B. So, if we look at the Alt-A portfolio, you see the division under there in the table.</p>
          <p>The other part, let's look at the CDOs because we have some. But there with the CDOs, one of the things that's important is you have CDOs and you have CDOs. The first thing is, if you take CDOs and you have them which are very closely linked to the iTraxx then you have a market observable price. If I start to create a CDO and it's on a customized, personalized basket of securities, which is a very bespoke tranche than I don't know where I need to get the underlying correlations from, then you end up in a level C. That's where we have 17 million, which means our CDOs look very much like the typical iTraxx 36 type of tranches. So in that sense that gives you bit more the comfort on how we are pricing these.</p>
          <p>I just talked a bit about with the first bullet, about &#x2013; let's go through all the assets. And I think we should start with the subprime portfolio. We look at subprime, 2.8 billion, that is the U.S. &#x2013; that is the euro 2.8 billion total portfolio, biggest part we own in U.S. Insurance, and I think one of the things is fair value of it at 90 at this moment. Now, it did deteriorate, it did deteriorate over the last quarter. But then again it's again consistently sort of in line, but higher than where the ABX is trading.</p>
          <p>Now why is it trading higher? There's a few reasons for this. I think the one is you have to look at composition of what the ABX made of, and the ABX it could own floating rate tranches, could own fixed rate tranches, a lot of them in the ABX are more floating, even in the AAA side. Also what is important is, are the securities underlying the index, are they sort of what is called front- and/or back-end loaded in terms of prepayments. Who is first getting repaid, and there is differences in the individual securities. The other part which plays a role is we are really, we try to buy this paper, which has a decent amount of credit enhancement.</p>
          <p>And that brings us to the next page. And that is if we look at our RMBS portfolio in total, the credit enhancement which we have is 27.2%. Now let me explain, because that is in the graph there. In the graph the light blue bar tells the total amount of credit enhancement, which we have in our subprime portfolio. Then, if you look at the red bar, what it shows is those are the 60-day delinquencies, 90-day delinquencies, foreclosures. So this is the part where you say like, "Hey, trouble, or something is happening." What we assume here in this graph is that all of this is going to end up in default. And we're going to lose half the amount of money, so that brings me to dark blue part, the 6.8%.</p>
          <p>This one we can compare it with the 27, and we said like, well, we have still a four times credit absorption buffer, but then again I agree with you, you don't need to look at what's currently happening, you need to look at what is going to happen. And then, we do realize like you have Moody's, you have S&amp;P's and they say like, what you can expect as total amount of losses they gave ranges, and if I look at averages they say like it's more in the range of 18% losses, which are anticipated in the subprime portfolio. But nevertheless, then it means that our credit enhancement is higher, is way higher, than what is still expected as losses. So this is our subprime portfolio doing well against an ABX in terms of pricing, and one of the biggest reasons is the credit enhancement.</p>
          <p>Alt-A is a slightly more crowded slide, but it's also a bigger portfolio. So if we look at the Alt-A side, what I'd like to do is let's have a look at how should we look at Alt-A. One of the things is the definition &#x2013; of course we always had a definition &#x2013; is not clear. Alt-A is anything what is not prime and anything what is not subprime, so &#x2013; but that leaves gap in there.</p>
          <p>One of the ways how to communicate is &#x2013; and that is on the far left and bottom &#x2013; that was to say like, well, we had the and-and, or-or discussion. And so we have three criteria, the FICO, the LTVs and the low doc, and our decision was if it hits one of the criteria it's Alt-A. You could also if it hits three it's Alt-A. I think there's actually a better way of looking at this portfolio. And the way how we did it is more looking at what are the prices of our Alt-A portfolio, and what is the best way to explain differences?</p>
          <p>Now you can explain differences along all kinds of criteria, and-and or-or, that is not the best one; regional, that was not the best one. I think the best criteria for making a distinction in what drives pricing differences of the securities we are holding, the best one is first it is product, and second is vintage. So if we look at this table, what you see is you see on the left-hand side you see product. Fixed rate long-dated hybrid. No reset risk. That is why this it's a separate distinction. Negative am, that is the one where your LTV will go up, because people, they can add to their total principal amount of borrowing. Third category is the ARMs. So that's the hybrids. There the amount can go up, but you have reset risk. Those are the biggest categories in trying to explain.</p>
          <p>Second one, I think vintage plays a big role, and that is because old vintages &#x2013; well, underwriting standard were maybe different but a bigger factor is that the underlying housing had at least the opportunity to build up some equity. And that is not the case in the '06 and the '07 tranches.</p>
          <p>So this is why we have the table which explains something about vintages and explains something about product, and what you see is that the unrealized gains and losses, you first see it split out over the vintages. And that is the totaling the 810, but also what is important there to see is the build-up of this portfolio. And what you for instance see is a larger amount of negative amortizations. And in the negative amortizations, you see a loan-to-value which is higher, which make sense because people can add to their total amount of borrowings.</p>
          <p>But you also see there in the negative AMs, you see a large amount of credit enhancement. You see lesser credit enhancements, so that's the last column, in your fixed-dated mortgages, and you see in the middle, the amount of credit enhancement in the ARMs. So a decision to buy something or not buy something is a function of different parts.</p>
          <p>I think on the bottom end, you see the graphs and there you see the dispersion of pricing. Because averages, I mean, yeah, you can hide a lot in averages, because if we say like eight times increase in current losses we can absorb could before a portfolio starts to take impairment discounts on average, but if half your portfolio is pretty badly deteriorated and the other half is excellent, then you could still have impairments. But what you see in the graph under there is that prices look very much alike. So it's not a large distinction in terms of that you have securities trading at 70 and the other ones at 100.</p>
          <p>Then why is it holding up well? First thing again, it's key credit enhancement. So we have firstly mortgages in our portfolio, and if I look at the graph there it's the similar type of graph as what we had on the subprime portfolio. On the left-hand side, you see the total portfolio, average credit enhancement on our Alt-A, 12%. If you look at the expected, so the pipeline of people, so defaulting 60-day plus, 3.9% with a 35% LTV, or LGD, that will result in 1.4% projected loss currently in the portfolio. With a credit enhancement of 12 times, that means like you can eat it eight times.</p>
          <p>Please note that what we do in this assumption here as we say like all of the red is going to turn into something dark blue, and the 35% LGD is something which is what we take on average on our portfolio, and we say like that counts for the '06-'07 and that is what everybody is doing for Alt-A. But it also applies for the '05-'04. So we have just taken 35 across the board.</p>
          <p>Now '06, there you see we took out the slice '06, and there you see we have an 11.2% credit enhancement, and the total amount of losses which we assume based on current data on the portfolio, 1.9%. By the way, if you look at the expected losses which are arising in these portfolios, S&amp;P's, they give some forecast there, and they say like on ARMs it's 6.7% on the NegAms it's 6% on the fixed it's 2. So you can compare credit enhancement again with the type of projected losses as well. And projected losses, I mean that's looking in the future so that can't be perfectly right, but just to make sure we don't only look at the 1.4 or the 1.9 on this page in the graph, we also look at where does this portfolio migrate to.</p>
          <p>So, we see a decent amount of credit enhancement in our Alt-A portfolio on average, and we specifically look at the NegAm portfolio, the negative amortizations. Now what does it mean? It means that you have a mortgage, and if you don't pay your interest, it's added to the principal, and debt can go up for quite a while. And the quite a while is until the loan is at the level of either 115 or 125. And then we end up in a so-called recast period. Recast period means like from now on, we're going to recalculate the mortgage with the new principal. And that is either, that is done in the recast period, if we hit that total amount over 115 or 125, depending on the contract or after five years. That is what a NegAm is.</p>
          <p>Now with the NegAm portfolio, if we look at it &#x2013; I mean on our side, in terms of pricing, 90 to 95, so that is the one which has in its Alt-A portfolio the biggest price deterioration. Nevertheless, if I look at the credit enhancement, the credit enhancement is quite large on this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now, you can say like why buy this or why to enter into this product? There's a few things. I mean, clearly what you see with NegAm if the principal can go up, then it also means that the loan-to-value, which is starting at 70, that could go up to 95. Because if you can allow the principal to go up, then the loan-to-value can go up. So, that's a negative. On the other hand, that's a negative in case the client defaults.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you do get at 10% more credit enhancements upfront. So, this is a little bit a trade-off. If less than 50% of your portfolio defaults, then yes, this LGD increase, you can absorb it because you get the credit enhancement. And it's this type of trade-off, these type of considerations play a role in whether we buy NegAm or whether we buy something else.</p>
          <p>So, this is out of the ABS portfolio, and then we've talked a bit about both the subprime, as well as the Alt-A portfolio. The next topic there in the ABS is our collateralized debt and the CDO/CLOs.</p>
          <p>Gross exposure, 3.1, net exposure showed 3.1 long and 1.2 short. Included in this what we call CDO exposure is if we buy an iTraxx tranche 0.3 on an underlying pool and we sell something else there, then we call that CDO exposure. So, all of this is in there.</p>
          <p>Net exposure 1.9 billion and it increased, and that was for a simple reason that in the past we had one CLO, the super senior tranche, and it was hedged. And it was hedged by one of the monoline insurers, and if it doesn't exist, then you have no hedge anymore. So, then the exposure goes up. And this is why the amount was increased. That was not because of the result of active position taking.</p>
          <p>Negative impact on P&amp;L, relatively modest, fair valued at minus 134 million. Most of the underlying of our CDO portfolio is more in the corporates, it's in the bonds. So, it's not &#x2013; there's 15 million in notional, what has to do with subprime.</p>
          <p>Just for completing the part, we have finished the Alt-A portfolio, we finished subprime, we talked a bit about the CDO portfolio. Let's look at the other part, CMBSs. CMBSs is part of our ABS portfolio. Where is it held? IIAM in Atlanta. How do we value it? We use price insurers, again externals like the IDCs. Loan-to-values at around 67. What is the meaning of this portfolio? What we are doing there? This is basically an investment portfolio which we are benchmarking against, for instance, the Lehman Ariza Eligible Index and this is a AAA type of index, which we try to outperform. If you look at last quarter, what you typically see happening is in their performance versus U.S. Treasury, U.S. Treasury down so interest rate exposure makes up that you don't end up at a loss there. Credit spread widening was negative; interest rate was positive overall, sort of a small result there. So this is the CMBS portfolio.</p>
          <p>Next to that, we have some other ABSs, and the other ABSs are &#x2013; well, just for completion here those are the credit cards, and some other miscellaneous. Then basically we sort of finish this, the wheel on the left-hand side, the ABSs, and let's have a look at the middle section. We have the investment portfolio, the 293 billion. In the investment portfolio there's a few things to note. One is equities, because equity markets go up and down, and the other one is corporate bonds.</p>
          <p>If we look at the equities, yes, we do have an equity exposure. What you see here is 19.9 billion, that's what you formally find in the annual report. At the same time please note that 3.2 billion of it is seed capital in fund. Formally in accounting term it's equity, but nevertheless it doesn't behave like equity, so as a risk manager I don't feel it's equity. But this portfolio, where do we have these equities? The largest part is in the insurance company the 13.1 billion, and there's a part and those are the stakes which we have in the banking side.</p>
          <p>We do from time to time buy put options for this portfolio. If you look at the corporate bond portfolio, corporate bonds, the reason that I put it here is we had this portfolio the breakdown, which you get in the table there, shows that it's relatively a high-rated type of bonds. And it's something different from the rating table, which you see in the annual report. And I'd like to use the opportunity to talk a bit about that. Because what you see in the annual report, you will get a rating table and it always shows a bias more on the BB type of rating. And why is that? Because the rating tables in our annual report, they are issuer ratings.</p>
          <p>So me having a mortgage, I'm probably a BB type of client. The only thing is there's decent collateral in there and that is the house. In a rating table, you look normally at the issuer, and that is why if you are a large originator of mortgages there is bias of relatively low ratings. And here you take the corporate bonds so, we are not talking about collateral here, we are just talking about bonds, and it's a relatively high rating. This is always a choice which you make in your risk management, that &#x2013; well, Michel alluded to it, that is, you look at the borrower and you look at the collateral, and not in isolation.</p>
          <p>So, if we then move from basically the investment part, where two things stand out, the corporate bond portfolio and the equities. Let's then move to the total assets. On the total assets side, well, first thing is we have real estate. Real estate, you find that both in the investment section still a little bit, but also in the section Other, the 78 billion. So, we will talk about the real estate part. What do we have? We have investments, and we have investments on the insurance side. But we have seed capital in funds. We have &#x2013; part of it &#x2013; we have a development company. And then we have the buildings, which we own ourselves. In total we have 17.2 billion of real estate. I think this is the part, which I mentioned in the September presentation as well.</p>
          <p>If you look at the real estate portfolio, we have a table in the bottom, and that table there the one of things which springs out for me is, well, it's diversified in terms of what type of real estate is it, like is it residential, retail, offices? But it's also diversified in terms of countries. And like I said, why is it important? Well, for instance what you see there is the U.S. real estate gets a lot of focus. It's a relatively small part of our portfolio. The way how we valuate it is with external appraisals. If we look at it, and this is something I gave in September, the diversification in the portfolio means that you could have individual revaluations, which are pretty large. If you look at it by and large over the whole portfolio, then our 1 in 10 type of scenario is more that you can get an 8% loss on the overall portfolio. This is the type of scenario which we forecasted there.</p>
          <p>Now why are we saying like is there a diversification? Well, office is clearly one of the things which plays a big role, is rentals, and even if I look at the U.S. for instance, in the U.S. these days where you see the rental market in New York, the rental market in Boston, is great. The rental market in Phoenix and in Atlanta is poor. So even within a region, you can have huge diversification. The rental is a big driver for the office market. Drivers for residential are entirely different again. But overall, it's a diversified portfolio in terms of how we build it up.</p>
          <p>So here you see again we give the breakdown, what goes via P&amp;L and what goes via equity or amortized costs. What goes via the P&amp;L, the wholesale side, that is the seed capital in the funds, part of the development business and the insurance business, so the biggest part of that, the 5.9 billion; that all moves directly via the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>If you look at the right-hand side, there you see like we have projects, some assets held for sale, which are at amortized cost. You also see that the property in own use, the 2.1 billion, that is fair value through equity. So this gives you a breakdown of the valuation methodologies and how it goes and connects to the accounting side.</p>
          <p>Leveraged finance, not a lot to mention on that side. I already told you before, like we are in the leveraged finance part, we have an underwriting pipeline and you have a hold book. The hold book is small pieces, and that was the amount of 5 billion in there. You have the underwriting pipeline that's the 2.3 billion, and that's where you have the larger pieces, which you try to syndicate out, and there's not a lot of progress in that part.</p>
          <p>Monolines. So basically we have gone now from the ABSs to the investments to the bigger wheel, the total portfolio. Now we start to move more to the off-balance sheet part. One of the things is monolines. On the monolines, 3.5 billion is our total exposure there, what we insured with monoline insurers. Now, what did we insure? I'll give you a breakdown in different forms. The one is 0.7 billion of this 3.5 is derivatives, 0.8 billion is available for sale, and 1.7 billion is at cost. That's sort of an accounting breakdown.</p>
          <p>I could also say it differently. Out of this portfolio of monolines, the underlying, there is 21% is AAA anyway; there is 2% is AA; 13% A; and there is something 42% is BBB of the insured exposure underlying there. So that is more a breakdown in terms of ratings.</p>
          <p>You could also give a breakdown in terms of what is actually that we're insurer &#x2013; what we are insuring. Well, a part of it is ABSs, that's a little over a billion; a part of it is deferred payment type of securities; part of it is CLOs; and part of it is bonds. So the deferred payments is something like 900 million, the CLO 600 million, and the bonds 300 million. So that is more in asset types.</p>
          <p>Now question, the what-ifs. If monoliners would stop insuring us for whatever reason, so if it's not there anymore, then we will lose money and take a P&amp;L hit on the derivatives. And then we are talking more in the order of 70 million. But then again please note that these kind of amounts, they can vary, because I mean &#x2013; because of day-to-day mark to market valuations.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the rest of the portfolio, part of it is available for sale, so there you have to take a price hit, so you would take a mark probably through equity in the order of 100 million, and the rest is in our books, which are just at accrual. And in general I would say the underlying collateral is performing, so we really have to think here in terms of two things need to happen. One is the monoliner needs to default, second part is the underlying asset needs to default. But you don't see a large concentration here on sort of rescuing our total subprime portfolio by buying insurance in the monoliners because that's what we haven't done.</p>
          <p>Liquidity. I think one of the things always for me as a concern is the liquidity part. Yes, we do benefit from the fact that we have the multiple funding sources. And so I'm more than pleased that we have an ING Direct. I'm more than pleased that we have good retail base, so you have your retail funding and at the same time we have Interbank, and at the same time we have the different types of funding for our balance sheet, which is important these days because credits spreads are high on the long end and funding very low on the short end.</p>
          <p>You look at asset valuations in general. Yes, we do have a prudent investment policy, so we think it's important for us to make sure that we invest decently because we are a buy-hold investor. That is also why you see that relatively speaking, our subprime portfolio deteriorated over the last quarter with 6% and the Alt-A portfolio with 1.5%. But then again we are just a buy-hold investor looking very much at the credit enhancement.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the last point, I mean &#x2013; we are &#x2013; this is the business. We are selecting the securities we want. We look at this credit enhancement, and this is what we are buying. And I hope that I told you enough about both the valuation side, the performance of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>And I'd like to give the word to Michel. Over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much, Koos. Well, I guess now you know it all. So I think we have been as transparent as we can be. And I think that it also should give you confidence that we are managing this big 1.3 trillion in a prudent way. But also that we know what we're doing, and that we know all those economics work. And that we are alert to the risk.</p>
          <p>And I think that when you manage a large &#x2013; when you invest 1.3 trillion of deposits, you get one side, you invest on the other sides. And I think you cannot only invest in government bonds. That would not be a very appropriate thing to do. So we have to invest and buy a number of assets, generate a certain number of assets, that's part of our business. And to have diversified portfolio that is part of business. And I think managing risk, this is part of our business. And I hope that the results of today and the presentation of John and Koos has convinced you that we are managing our business in appropriate way and have conservative risk profile.</p>
          <p>Questions. Yes, sir.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. Mike Feiss, Sockjen Two questions. One I guess more clarification on slide 56 about the Alt-A book. You state that on let's say the more general definition on Alt-A it's 9.7 billion. If I remember well, that was in Q3 6 to 7 billion, so what is happened down there? The second question perhaps -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to answer that first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I answer that straightaway. Yes, we both &#x2013; we increased our exposure in what is called the NegAms, and that is the part which are forming part of this &#x2013; the or-or-or on this part of the portfolio. So it moved from 6 to 9 for two reasons. One is an increase and the other one is if in the current portfolio clients withheld their principal payment and it was added the principal then your LTV starts to move up, so automatically, it migrates a little bit as well. So there were two functions why this was happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, moving away from the credit issue perhaps for shortly. Mr. Tilmant, you fairly clearly showed that you have a lot of let's say excess capital, in your view. Your shares arguably are not expensive. You're almost finished, well three-quarters finished with your share buyback. Why didn't you raise let's say your amount of planned share buyback if you have in your view 9.5 billion of spare leverage. What are your plans with let's say the excess capital -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I would like to say that we have shown to the market that, first of all we have a lot of capital management discipline, and that we manage our capital actively. And the purpose of our capital management is to optimize our capital base, and also to make sure that we have enough capital to grow organically, that we have enough capital to make acquisitions. And that we have shown to the market if something is left we don't hesitate to return it to shareholders.</p>
          <p>As you enter this year, I think this policy hasn't changed. On the other hand, I think that we believe that we're entering 2008 with an interesting situation where opportunities could arise, number one. And number two, where I think that it would not be probably very smart to announce a share buyback right now, because there's still a lot of market volatility out there. So I think that &#x2013; we keep our strategy clear, okay. And we are looking for opportunities this year. And we'll see. And if we feel at one point that we have surplus, we'll just do what we have to do. But I don't think it was &#x2013; when you are in a strength position is to use it. I have learned that. Okay, we are in a strength position today. So we have to look what's out there and stay put.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions. Looking at the real state portfolio in your kind of operational business in ING real estate. You're still talking about revaluations and sales sort of falling, but still getting kind of inflows. Everywhere you look globally, regardless of the fundamentals, you're seeing kind of panic in the market, and people wanting to take their money out, institutions and retail, and funds shutting their businesses, their outflows, because can't sell properties fast enough. How are you going to avoid this downturn? For example, are you going to go more into finance, that's kind of question number one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that is, we have a specific real estate asset management business in the sense that it is essentially geared towards institutions and it's closed-end funds. And those who invest in this, in our portfolio, are actually long-term investors. As a matter of fact, that's why they accept to invest in closed-end funds, otherwise they would not do it. And we &#x2013; and the reason we have only closed-end fund or so many closed-end funds, is because we don't want to sell open-end funds, because we feel that it's not a right instrument. Let's put it that way. And I think we have proven right. I think our real estate business has been very careful not to engage in retail, open and real estate funds. And I think that was wise, because the real estate is not essentially an investment which is geared to a open-end fund. So that's my answer to that.</p>
          <p>Second I have to say that, it's just kind of interesting that the demand for real estate as a diversification in investments stays, and the demand for real estate on a global basis is still quite high. I think we have to be very careful not to concentrate ourselves on New York or the center of Rome, those places. I mean the world is a bit bigger than that today, okay, and I think that there are places where there is still a lot of demand toward our business and for real estate. So I think that's why we have built, if you look at our real estate portfolio ourselves, and if you look at our funds they are pretty diversified, in many instruments and many countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you're saying is you don't think there's a big risk of negative valuations on market value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that &#x2013; I think, also the real estate that we essentially typically buy, basically are also covered by long lease. So the value of those properties are based on the long lease. Now, I think that you are not going to see a lot of revaluation like you have seen in the past, generally speaking for real estate, this year. I don't expect that. But you see some revaluation down the years. So I think that there might be in the business, but I think generally speaking, I feel that our business is in relative terms pretty strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then just one final question. There's been a theme across the banking business, but especially in wholesale banking of releasing provisions. It's a question we ask every quarter, but it seems to have really saved you this quarter. I mean, you got a big release in sort of euro terms, 115 million. I mean, again when you look at what you see in the markets, you'd expect that both the gross provisions will go up rapidly and the ability to &#x2013; the desire to be a bit more conservative on your existing provisions will mean that you won't release as many. I mean, are we going to &#x2013; surely we're also going to see quite a big uptick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you telling me, are you finally going to see that? Because we expect that since eight quarters, right? That basically what -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly. That's my question. When is it going to happen?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we don't see a fundamental dislocation of our portfolio by any kind of means. I think the quality of our portfolio remains strong. We don't see many issues on the horizon yet. So I think that you have to remember that we also &#x2013; our wholesale business is very much geared to the Benelux market also. So I think that we don't see any major deterioration. But I don't know, if you want to say something.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would just add that we haven't seen the gross amount go up very much yet at all. And, of course, that is very calculated, and IFRS doesn't allow to put prudence in. You have to look at your trends of what's going on. We have to remember that in the total bank in particular, we have a lot of retail risk in there. We have ING Direct, which has very low growth provisions on an ongoing basis. We have wholesale banking, which even at the height of the cycle will have higher provisions clearly.</p>
          <p>But that's highly geared to the economy, and the economies in Europe are still going okay, and we're not in credit cards and we're not in the big areas that have seen &#x2013; if you look at the banks who've had a big change already in the provisions, a lot's driven by U.S. exposure and maybe some emerging markets or credit cards, particularly the consumer side, which we're really not in in a major way at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to say if you look to our portfolio we have been experiencing provisionings much lower than the expected loss since now quite a number of quarters. And I think that most of the analysis I see on ING are taking the expected loss as the potential loss, but we have beaten that in the last quarters systematically and I hope to continue to beat that.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's William Elderkin from Citi. First of all, can you give us an update as to roughly where your embedded value and net asset value have got to given market movements year-to-date, and also if you could give us an update on the revaluations on the pressurized asset classes, again given more recent market movements? Secondly, could you give us your thoughts on the sustainability of the earnings of the structured finance business within the Wholesale Bank and also the real estate lending business of the real estate activities, and that's all. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, we give a sensitivity in our embedded value report. I think it's 1.9 billion &#x2013; let me just find it here &#x2013; for a 10% change to equity markets. So I would expect that to be the basic sensitivity that you can use. And I'm sorry, what was your second question on the wholesale -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No real change. I mean, clearly the leveraged finance piece has gone down quite a bit as compared to say '06, but they do a lot of other different business. In the quarterly report we actually give you a profit distribution between the different types of structured finance business they do, and we're continuing to see business that we can do and, in fact, at better returns and yields than we've had in the past, and we're one of the people out there bidding on things now. So we can do a little more -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a very good point because I started receiving calls from CEOs of large companies saying are you still in the business of lending? I say, of course I am. Why are you asking the question? So I think that you can see there that for companies like us, who have kind of capital strengths, there are opportunities today in the market at very nice spreads to build our book, so &#x2013; and very reasonable risk quality.</p>

          <p>I think that you have to make &#x2013; if you look back last year, I think the first six months were probably better than the last six and I think that probably the last six are probably more reflecting of what could happen in the next six.

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our real estate finance, I think that, I don't hear anything that it's &#x2013; that it might decline next year. So, we feel that, if you look over last year, I don't think that it will expand dramatically, but I think that there is no reason that it goes dramatically down either.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but half of that portfolio now is outside the Netherlands, but it's in Europe, and it's very well diversified again, like all of the real estate is, and we're very pleased with that portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mark Taylor from UBS. My first question is can you talk about the negative leverage in the bank, because the costs continue to grow much faster than the revenues, in particular clearly based on the initiatives that you have in direct banking, but that's also the case in wholesale. Can you talk about what you could do about this negative leverage in the medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that we continue to be very clear on what we want to do on that front. I think, on one hand, we are basically making a lot of efforts to invest to reduce long-term costs &#x2013; costs over the long term in our traditional franchise. And we are invested &#x2013; with our restructuring of Poland is a big restructuring, which takes costs, but also basically adds some benefits. We do that in Wholesale also. We've announced a number of projects. So, on that side, and if you look to the &#x2013; and we make in the analysis a difference between the mature market and the others. And you can see that in the mature market our costs are very much under control.</p>
          <p>I think that you have to ask yourself, where do we &#x2013; why is the cost increase of the negative <mark type="inaudible" /> because we are investing in our future franchise. And I don't think this is a time to slow that down. I think the time is a time to accelerate that. Because we have a competitive advantage of doing that, and developing Poland, developing Romania, developing India, it's &#x2013; next year we'll have the <mark type="inaudible" /> bank which will be included.</p>
          <p>So, all this we are going to continue to invest. ING Direct, we have opportunities to invest in payment services. We have the opportunity to invest in new countries. We just started Ukraine. I think that we have to make choices. If we want to develop our businesses long-term, we need to do it, and that comes with cost. And I think we have to accept that. That's why also in the report we make a difference between the cost of the mature business, that we control very, very, very strongly, and at the same time the investment we make in franchise. By the way, I remind you also that we built the Romanian business, with expense, okay, and not by buying a big goodwill. Now, we have made the definite choice that if we can build business by, on organically, even starting from scratch, it was a better economic gain for our shareholders over the long term than buying big goodwills. That's what we're doing, when we can do it. And I think that has some expense, but I feel very good about it, because it's building our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; and you can go through business line by business line so in Insurance Europe, we have the Benelux, which is mature, and Central Europe, and we're keeping that low and Central Europe going up. In your question on wholesale banking, it's the real estate division that we're allowing the expenses to grow to invest and get market share and grow those businesses, whereas the other core businesses are quite under control. In Retail Banking the Benelux is under control, but we're growing Poland and Romania and &#x2013; so you can go through section-by-section see where we're letting in the expenses to invest and grow, and the other ones being kept down.</p>

          <p>Hello, I've been attending meetings for something like 18 years in Amsterdam. And I'm very disappointed that you decided to shift priorities &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>Related to that, I understand that you are transferring 5 billion of equities from Nationale-Nederlanden to the corporate center. I assume first that this means that you will continue to be invested in equities, but in due to course, the corporate sector will plow the money somewhere else, in one of the other sectors. Does that mean that your equity exposure in the Netherlands is going to be reduced over time in next to one or two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally, you have -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the last question, I think, because I had this question already this morning by the press. I think that, first of all, we have engaged in the last two years in a more dynamic capital management. And in that context we have decided to optimize the capital structure of all our businesses and to upstream the capital to the Group. That's a simple exercise, that was disciplined that did not exist before. So we implemented a much more sharper capital management discipline. So we upstream the unnecessary capital from our business unit, we put into the Group and from there we deploy it in the way we think is the most appropriate to grow our franchise.</p>
          <p>I think that we also want all of our business units to &#x2013; and especially on the insurance side &#x2013; to optimize their asset and liability management, which the asset and liability management requirement is that they are for their own business. And therefore that's what Nationale-Nederlanden will do in the future. And when the capital is upstream to the Group then we will decide where to put it. Normally we intend to put it to grow our business franchise and not necessary to buy equities. So &#x2013; but that doesn't mean that we might not have from time to time equities in the group. But necessarily the capital we upstream is to redeploy in the building of franchises.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now to answer your question on the equity exposure. We have 13 billion in insurance side in equities. The majority that is in &#x2013; a good piece of that is in the Insurance Netherlands. Now a lot of this, of course, is held for our own client accounts to back pension liabilities and longer-term liabilities. We have had some other areas that of course have been not needed for that, that's been in our surplus, and so this was the piece that Michel's been speaking about.</p>
          <p>But to give you the rough sensitivity, we have in total a 5.9, 5.8 billion revaluation reserve in total, 3.5 for the insurance operations at the end of the year, so that's market value above book value. So you take the 13 billion and assuming the AX is down 10% or 15%, and you do the mathematics and see how that impacts. So we still have enough buffer here in our revaluation reserve, but it's getting less certainly than it was back 5.6 billion at the end of September.</p>
          <p>We also took the opportunity &#x2013; we didn't sell many equities directly to take these dividends out. We took a lot of the gains from ABN Amro and Numico and the gains throughout the year, as those came to cash. That was the amount that we moved up to Group. And in essence we redeployed some of that cash to other areas around the world, like OYAK Bank and TMB Bank.</p>
          <p>So it was just smart capital management. We clearly have more than enough regulatory capital in our insurance entities in the Netherlands. It's a very solid risk-diversified portfolio that includes an equity component to it. But we don't want to keep a lot of excess there, and we want to use that for the advantage of the shareholders.</p>
          <p>I think there's another question from Amsterdam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My name is <mark type="inaudible" />. I'm working for Amsterdam-based Rabobank Netherlands. I would like to ask a question about page 28. It's the development of the revaluation reserves. At the end of 2006, the &#x2013; for the bonds, only for the bonds &#x2013; the revaluation reserve was 2.8 billion positive, and at the end of last year, it was 1.9 billion negative, the difference of 4.7 billion is &#x2013; well, you say it's in my view after-tax figures. The 4.7 billion is declared by the 1.3 billion of the pre-tax due to the pressurized assets, but in my view the &#x2013; well, and then the balance primarily due to interest rates and credit stress. But is it not the crisis of, well the current crisis, that causes the 4.7 billion? And, well, that was what I would like to ask.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How this mathematically works is &#x2013; we have a portfolio of bonds that have a duration and are just sensitive to movements in interest rate. And although we may not remember it, but interest rates went up in many currencies around the world all throughout 2007, and the yield curves flattened, and that causes the bond values to go down.</p>
          <p>Likewise these bond values had gone up. In the prior years, if you look at this over a five-year period or a six-year period you'll see this moving up and down year-by-year, as the interest rates move up and down. So it's first driven by the basic interest rates in the currencies and the businesses where these are invested. We in particular had, in addition to interest rate movements, spread widening, credit spread widening, in the latter half of '07 that also added to this.</p>
          <p>Of course, in '08 we've seen in the U.S. currency already interest rates coming down, and they'll move it the other way. So, this moves up and down. These numbers are not taken into account, this value, by the rating agencies or by our regulator when we do this, because they know we're buy-and-hold investors. We match our durations of our assets to our liabilities, and this will even out over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to say that &#x2013; two things. First of all, this is a phenomenon that exists since many years, but to some extent, nobody focused on that, because their mind-sets were somewhere else. But you have seen those fluctuations in the past already, number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, I think that economically, most of those securities will be held to maturity, unless we get close to maturity, they go back to par. So, this is only the value of those securities if we liquidated them. And I think that it is to some extent &#x2013; this is the mark-to-market accounting consequences, which has been imposed many years ago. But economically, I think, for us those securities will go to maturity and be back on par.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My next one just on &#x2013; if we assume markets remain where they are, what sort of level in terms of write-downs and revaluation should we expect for the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if things stay where they are, then always the solution is simple, because then you don't have any other revaluations. But, if I give you just an illustration, end of January, if we look at for instance the Alt-A, subprime and CDO combined, we see in terms of valuation no material change there, to be honest, and so it's sort of moving along sideways.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, interestingly enough also what you might see is that interest rates went down since the beginning of the year. So, you might see that because of that you have revaluations on &#x2013; positive revaluations &#x2013; because interest rates went down. So, it's kind of an interesting situation, and so, in this case, we will see. But so far I mean, that's what caused that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe finally one strategic question. How do you deal with the worsening macroeconomic environment in terms of life sales going forward? Is there any particular initiative, that you are focusing more on guaranteed product, changing marketing campaigns, and &#x2013; how do you deal with the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think one of &#x2013; first of all the first priority is to add sufficient savings products, that if you cannot catch the money one way you catch it another way. And I think if you go back to my fundamental slides in the start of our strategy, this is the fundamental point of our strategy also. Don't get exposed yourself to one product. And I think that's why also you want to expand your franchise in key countries like in Poland, where what you cannot get through the life premium at one point of time, because that market is relatively closed, you get through bank savings. That's the first line of defense, the most important one; to get a portfolio of business were you can catch your savings different part.</p>
          <p>The second thing, I think that we have in this context, I think the first responsibility if you want to have a sustainable business also is to think what is right for the clients. And, therefore, I think our troops in the field, if they want to build a sustainable business over the long term is to think at this point of time what is right for the client. And I think that today, given the appetite and risk profile to the client, I think the &#x2013; what you have to say sometime on the retail side, by the way I have what I have learned many years is when people should buy, which is right now, which is when many sell. Okay, which is kind of a interesting twist. So we have to make sure that we communicate well to our customers throughout the system, and that's a very important point. It's not always easy because intuitively the retail client acts countercyclic. So this is something you have to manage through the communication and the marketing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Farquhar Murray, Fox-Pitt Kelton, here. Two sets of questions, if I may. Firstly, just at a strategic level, I mean, the old mistake from ING in the last cycle, effectively was going on a shopping spree when it shouldn't, and effectively being unable to buy stuff when they probably should have. Now, you told us you've got retail focus, you've told us you've got global ambitions, you've got &#x2013; you're a long-term investor, and you've got 9.5 billion of capital. And so I was just wondering where the opportunities were given the distress you can see. I mean, is that in selling, is that in pushing mortgage volumes when everyone else is fighting for deposits, is it investing in acquisitions, or real estate when there are forced sellers, or is it by continuing to buy back your shares?</p>
          <p>And then second question, maybe some points of detail with regards to the negative amortization mortgages. And the key thing there I want to know is if people exercise their options on those mortgages to draw down to the maximum, are we going to see that the '07 and '06 vintages significantly rise from the figures we're seeing here, and if so what would those figures be? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the capital position, I think the first rule is &#x2013; I know one thing, when you get rich, you can make mistakes, right? And I don't intend to do that. I think that I pride myself that I feel capital management, capital discipline is an integral part of what we have done since four years, and I intend to keep it that way, and to look at opportunities with a sharp pencil. Because, I think, that it's not the time that you want to waste shareholders' capital.</p>
          <p>What you want to do now is to make sure that &#x2013; the interesting thing now, starting 2008, we have enough capital to basically be comfortable to grow organically our business first, and I think that's very important. We also &#x2013; we are not distracted by trying to raise capital and all those things. We just &#x2013; we can concentrate on our clients, and in 2008 starting to &#x2013; there are many fine institutions out there who are concentrating on all those things, but their clients. We have the luxury to concentrate on our clients. So first of all, organic growth.</p>
          <p>Second, I think that clearly there might be some opportunities in the market to basically acquire some companies, but we will exercise the same discipline done in the past. And I don't think that &#x2013; the danger right now is that you &#x2013; we are offered a number of assets to purchase, but they might be attractive financially, but they are not attractive strategically. So I don't think we want to do them. I think that's not &#x2013; I'm not going to start doing things which are not strategically focused at the time I'm trying to focus a strategy, that doesn't work, that doesn't compute. So we're going to keep very focused on the strategy, alongside what I mentioned. And if there is a good opportunity in that, well, we'll move, because we have the ability. And if we don't find anything attractive, then we'll see what we do with this surplus capital during the year, or at the end of the year. So we'll keep the discipline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe a just to fill in quickly on the NegAm, as I tried to say, we don't have the specific limit that we say like we don't want NegAm. For us the choices of products which we buy is really a function of collateral as well as the credit support. And indeed, in the case of NegAm what you could see is that a loan-to-value which is currently at 70 because of people adding to their principal could move up to 90, but at the same time &#x2013; so your LTV moves &#x2013; of your LGD in case of default moves up.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless yet the big trade over there is a 10% extra credit enhancement, and I think if that relationship between credit enhancement and increased LGD is favorable, then we will buy NegAm. So it's a trade-off between the two which plays a role. If you look at it little bit more macro-economically I think there is at the moment a little bit more tendency in the market that there's agency paper offered and less of private label, so it is for us harder to pick and choose the securities which we want right now. So there is external market factors still playing a role there as well.</p>
          <p>But it's a complex decision because, the third thing to fill in there is we also look at the interest rate movements and fixed ARMs for instance are from a credit perspective maybe better, although they have lesser credit enhancement. But then again they've got to fit in our interest rate profile, and we don't want to have too large an interest rate mismatch as well. So different factors playing a role in how we fill in the Alt-A portfolio in Direct.</p>

          <p>On real estate finance it's 67%. Thanks. Also ING Direct UK, can you run us through a little bit why you expect the losses to come down over '08 and what the components of it are? It strikes me that this is a market in which there's still a lot more competition for deposits than there is for assets, and that isn't going to go away anytime soon. And indeed you are competing quite aggressively for deposits, I might say. And finally I didn't have time to go forward through all the U.S. tax supplement before I came here, but the fund flows in the U.S. retirement services business have been pretty weak. What is going on at the moment in fourth quarter? Is there any sign of improvement? I mean I know the claim of the U.S. life business to be one of your growth engines is somewhat tenuous in terms of how you declare you measure it. I'm just wondering how are things going there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can do UK. We have raised our rates and become more competitive, which has squeezed the current portfolio because the assets are from last year, and rates have risen in all '07. Just to raise our rates we get squeezed, and squeezed the most in the fourth quarter. Plus we really spent a lot more on advertising to redirect and do more targeted advertising. So, why's it going to come down? Because the new money coming in we can invest at a much better spread, at an appropriate spread. So, we have new money that will be helping reduce the negative points and then the older assets are maturing.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there's new money coming in. So there's money going out, but there's new funds &#x2013; and we can price that new amount. We have funds &#x2013; we have cash flow maturing that we can reinvest at the better rates. So that's moving through all of '08. Sorry, so even if the net amount of funds are the same, we have a turnover of cash in the portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was negative in the fourth quarter, as you can see, so &#x2013; but that will be improving throughout the year.</p>

          <p>Now, in the U.S. statistical supplement, we &#x2013; the flows are less than they have been, but we're actually being quite targeted in how we think about these flows. And the businesses that we really like are the 401(k), the Educational and the IRA business. Throughout '06, we had larger sales from time to time in the health care, government, stable value, and others. Those are much thinner margins. So although &#x2013; we're being much more selective in targeting to make sure we always get the returns we like, the variable annuity flows were very strong. We sold 3.3 billion in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter. That's almost double what the running rate of all of last year. Fixed annuities are really just about the same. So, it's a stronger growth in variable annuities, but being a little more selective in these government and stable value flows.</p>

          <p>Impairment was very low in relation to that. But I'd like to come back onto UK, I think your comment about a number of banks scrambling for deposits is true. You wonder as a matter of fact they are paying so much sometimes. We wouldn't pay so much &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> we wouldn't pay so much. But at the same time you're going to see in the UK that probably the yield curve reopen, and that probably there would be no other &#x2013; the yield curve will have to reopen. And in our comments were saying that they will be continuing losses during 2008, although much significantly lower than the fourth quarter of last year, doesn't integrate &#x2013; does integrate the interest rate situation right now. But if the situation of the interest rate will improve in terms of yield curve, the situation will also improve dramatically.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Bruno Paulson, Sanford Bernstein. Firstly with ING Direct again, in Japan where are we up to now and how much is it likely to cost in the next year or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me respond to that. The running cost in Japan is 2 million a month. So, that's not a &#x2013; that's an acceptable amount. I think that basically, we continue to &#x2013; in discussion with the authorities there. I think we are going to re-goal to our cycle of retesting our operations. Because there's a chance &#x2013; in the regulatory organization, there was a change of person in charge the file. In the meantime, I think we basically agreed to go through another cycle of testing. So, it will take a few more months of delays. But the running cost is not dramatic. It's just commercially annoying because we would like to start, but this interim running cost is not material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a broader question. So far, you've been dealing with indirect effects of the credit crisis, and I think while it's been mild, the next potential &#x2013; the next stage is the potential recession slowdown in various markets. Which bits of your business are you most concerned, worried about &#x2013; which bits of your business be most sensitive, if there is such a slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; probably where you are sensitiveness is of the indirect effect of the equity level &#x2013; equity, because equities have &#x2013; the level of the equities has impact on our business in the U.S., of course. As a indirect effect there quite significant, a significant effect on our assets under management and therefore on the fees. So, you have a number of our business which are affected by the level of the equity market. And so, that's I think something which might have some impart.</p>
          <p>I think on the lending side, I think so far, we feel our portfolio is pretty strong, and I think that it is not so much away at this point. Now, interesting enough also what you're going to see is interest rates going down. We see that &#x2013; that's good for the bank, certainly for a certain period of time. You're going to see the yield curve reopening, which is very good for the time. So, to some extent, if we have to summarize it, if you look to the last two years, we say that we benefited from a very strong equity market, a very strong real estate market, and a very strong private equity market. This has affected <mark type="inaudible" /> also positively our <mark type="inaudible" /> business. But also we suffered from a negative yield curve and interest rates going up.</p>
          <p>Now, you go to the flip side, this year, we think we get to volatility into equity market. We don't think, we get &#x2013; we have significant revaluation &#x2013; positive revaluation in the real estate portfolio. We think that the private equity market probably be at a standstill for a short period of time &#x2013; some months. But on the other hand, we start seeing that the yield curve is reopening and that the interest rates are going down.</p>
          <p>So, you have different &#x2013; to some extent, also that's the benefit to be a diversified group like us. Through the cycle, we are relatively having some positive and negatives on different sides and basically benefits of the growth. So, the key thing to some extent when you look to a group like us and that's what intend to show in April, is if you look to basically all the assets that we have &#x2013; and all deposits we have in the company &#x2013; through the entire company &#x2013; and the asset side. We have a margin on all the savings we collect in the company, okay, and in over a long term, those savings at the margin was basically circling around the same kind of level. The question is one year it's a bit higher, one year it's a bit lower. One year it's higher in the bank. One year it's lower in the insurance company.</p>
          <p>But I think what we are going to try to show you is that basically if look to our fundamental business of collecting savings and reinvesting that, that's a business which over the long term is some sort of margin. And around that, especially because also of the IFRS situation, you have plus and minus that you have to deal with. But therefore the key thing for us going forward, the key thing for us is to continue to build our franchise and customers, to build our savings base because that's the fuel that gives us the ability to make that margin over the long term.</p>
          <p>It's a pretty simple thing to do, as a matter of fact. It's just to be mentally sure this is what you want to do. And I think that it is clear that the entire machine of ING is geared to get &#x2013; collect those savings.</p>
          <p>Yes, sir. I think I'm afraid that for this session it will be the last question I can take because I'm asked to go to the press afterwards. You can join also.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Tony Silverman, Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Just a couple of questions of a wider nature. You mentioned the areas you're concentrating on. Does this mean we can likely see more sales of non-life businesses around the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to a positive statement there is a consequence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question was, are you relaxed about buying '08 vintage Alt-A's?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that &#x2013; let's put it this way. Historically, if I look over the long term I think mortgage has always been the most preferred, less risky assets of any financial institution to put on its balance sheet; let's not lose sight of that, okay? And therefore, I think that this business will continue because there are new people buying houses and there are new people coming in the market, and so on. And I think we should not be paranoid by the current situation, which has been created by the situation in the U.S. And I think we should concentrate on our basic business.</p>
          <p>Now, are we going to continue to book mortgage? Yes. And are we going to continue to look at quality of the borrower, quality of the collateral, quality of the documentation and are we satisfied with the portfolio and the risk profile? Yes, of course we are. I mean, we're not going to stop doing business because mortgage worldwide is a fundamental business for us. It's a fundamental basic requirement of most of our retail customers, so we'll continue to do that. Now you call that the way you want. They only thing I'm going to tell you is we need to keep the same discipline in underwriting those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And another question was just on the European and new business sales and particularly Romania. Is that &#x2013; are we finished yet with the length of new business there, which was Q3 and this was -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends. First of all, Romania strategically is a country that we have chosen as a country or chose to develop our retail business. Remember we were there with an insurance business a long time ago, traditional insurance business. We have start a bank a long time ago, about three or four years ago. And the private pension market opened late of last year. The private pension market opens once. It doesn't open twice. It's generally opened once when people are basically &#x2013; the government basically says people, we established private pension funds, please join.</p>
          <p>And then you have the massive number of people joining, and then you basically have people joining as they join the work force. So the one-time shot on the pension side in Romania, it's a one-time shot. I can't do it twice, because once I get everybody, I get everybody. But what it is very interesting is that first of all that business is to be seen is the fundamental approach that we take to cash the savings from various angles, and second this has to be seen as a very attractive business because once you get the client, you have 40 years of basically increased deposits and increased opportunities to manage those assets for a very long time. So it is a very attractive business over a long period, and it just fits what we want to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I appreciate that. But will this very high level of new business in Q1 '08 as well or -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I gave you the answer to that, that I cannot get the customer twice, so the value of new business the way it's calculated yet by the rocket scientist is only one way, and I cannot make it &#x2013; if I could make it twice, I would, but I can't.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>I'm sorry, but I have to go to the next &#x2013; because the press is waiting for me. But I would like to thank you very much for joining us. And I hope that you feel very strongly about how much we feel at the start of this year. Thank you very much.</p>
