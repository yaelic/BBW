          <p>I don't have a mouse here. I need a mouse. I'm very sorry about this but I do need the mouse. Thank you very much, Tomas.</p>
          <p>Good morning. And as Tomas has already said, welcome to this presentation of the BBVA Group results for the second quarter of 2011. I'd like to start just jogging your memory. Talking about the kind of environment we're operating in, what's most important is that we're managing two-thirds of the Group's business in a non-crisis environment and that's very important for our group. The second thing is that the other third is in complicated environment.</p>
          <p>Greece is probably the focus of the tension at the moment but behind that we have the entire situation throughout Europe with a lack of integration, the lack of coordination that we're seeing throughout Europe. All of this means that we're seeing a weakening in the growth of the Euro area countries' economies and as a consequence of that there's some weakness in lending and in banking activity in those countries, which has led to a deterioration in the markets, not just in Europe but across the borders, in America as well. And worst of all with enormous spread on sovereign debt has been something that hit us, especially badly here in Spain and in Europe.</p>
          <p>But once again despite that environment BBVA has very sound results and the main characteristic is that we have very resilient earnings because of five key factors. We have been rated as the most solvent bank amongst the big European banks after the 15th of July EBA stress tests. The second thing is the resilience of our profit in all our earnings and all the different items on the P&amp;L. The third important factor is that for the sixth quarter running, if you look at the risk indicators, you can see that they are really stable. The fourth thing is the way that we've managed to anticipate our needs to cover funding for 2011. We've already covered them now as we did last year as well at this time. The fifth thing is that we have very, very sound franchises, very dynamic in the emerging economies and very resilient in the developed economies, as we'll see later.</p>
          <p>I was saying that on the 15th of July, we came out of the tests as having the highest capital adequacy levels in the big European banks. We've got a 9.2% core capital ratio without even taking into account &#x2013; without even including the convertible bonds which we converted in July, which would have had an impact of 0.6%. As you can see on the screen there's a big range &#x2013; a big spread in terms of the different banks in Europe. This has to do with the capital structure quality, our capacity to generate operating income, which means that we can deal with the impairment on our loan book. And then fourthly, we have a much lower impact on our RWAs because we are focusing on a retail business, which is very customer-centric and that's both true of our Retail Banking and our Wholesale Banking businesses and we've got a very diversified portfolio and of course, we are very prudent in the way we manage risks.</p>
          <p>The results moreover, incorporate the possibility of continuing to cope with the payment of our dividend so we're going on with our payout policy whatever the stress scenario. The logical consequence is that we continue to be the most profitable bank in stressed scenarios. In the baseline scenario, in fact we're above 16.5%, in an adverse scenario 10.3%, so we come out very well compared to other European banks. The other logical consequence is that we are able to generate capital organically this quarter. That's two decimal points, which along with what we've got in the first quarter, that's four decimal points of organically generated capital in the first six months reaching 9% at the end of the half year with an increase in the dividend in interim dividend, the first interim dividend with 11%.</p>
          <p>The second factor is the resistance of our profit's resilience. In the quarter, we've got a profit of &#x20AC;1.28 billion that's significantly higher, 3.4% up on the last quarter or 7.6% down against the previous year. The three main highlights here would be the dynamic growth we're seeing in revenues from emerging economies, the resilience of the net interest income. You can see that this drop in Spain is really flattening out now. And then thirdly, the fact that the risk premium is improving in all of our franchises, the net interest income has shown growth of 1.3% against the previous quarter. And here, once again, that's thanks to the diversification of these revenues, which have grown more than 9% in the emerging economies and pretty well flat in the developed countries.</p>
          <p>The recurring gross income is growing in a sustainable manner, because of the structure of our businesses. 1.7% up on the previous quarter or 6% down on the previous year where we're comparing against the very worst possible baseline in 2010 that we could, before the net interest income in Spain fell between the second and the third quarter. Whatever the case, the total gross income you can see shows greater volatility, in both dividends and in trading income; obviously, it's lower there than it has been in the previous quarter. And the revenues for this quarter are slightly below what was predicted for a normal quarter and that's slightly up on the previous quarter, and that's because of the across the board problems in the market, above all in the USA.</p>
          <p>This is thanks to the diversification of our businesses. As you can see, Spain is still bringing in about one-third of the total gross income. Mexico is slightly below 30%; South America, 20%; United States is at 11% and the rest of that region, that's Europe, the rest of Europe and Asia, 8%. So if you look at the mix between emerging and developed economies, you can see as emerging economies account for 53% of the total and the developed economies only 47%.</p>
          <p>What about costs? We're still investing in the future of the group very clearly in most of our franchises. In the quarter, we've seen costs grow against the previous quarter by slightly more than 5%. This is impacted by the incorporation of guarantee, which is now bought completely onto our books, and there's a growth of slightly more than 10% against the same &#x2013; or slightly below 10% against the same costs for the previous years.</p>
          <p>In the emerging economy, you can see we're investing more that makes sense because we've got very important growth plans there bringing in more than 4,000 new employees in South America or Mexico with more several new offices being opened, more than 1,500 ATMs being set up in that region to improve the productivity of the branch offices with an emigration of human services in the branches to the ATMs.</p>
          <p>And in the developed countries, we're becoming more efficient and more productive, and if you compare against the previous quarter, you can see there's a reduction in the costs there. This is accompanied by all the loan loss provisions, which after several quarters are still going down in terms of total volumes and in terms of risk premium, with a drop of 6.5% quarter-on-quarter, and over 26% against the previous year. These lower loan loss provisions are being seen everywhere, in the United States, in Mexico, in South America, and they are totally stable now in Spain. At the end of this quarter, we still have the same volume of generic provisions as we had at the end of last year. That means that we haven't ever reached the minimum.</p>
          <p>Our P&amp;L then. The income statement has one obvious characteristics that that it's very resilient. Given this very complex environment that we're operating in, we've gone beyond &#x20AC;2.3 billion and the return on equity is nearly 13%, whilst return on assets is 0.94%. And we're still outperforming our peers. You can see the book value per share. And here, we've pretty well tripled the performance of our peers since 2006. But also, if you look at earning per share in the same period of time, we've generated earnings per share which is 30% better than that of our peers.</p>
          <p>The third important point I wanted to talk about which really sets us apart from our competitors is that for the sixth quarter running we've got stable risk indicators. Coverage, the NPA ratio and the cumulative risk premium are all going down and the coverage ratio is stable. So, we are already covering our funding needs for 2011 and we are ready for all the maturities we have during the year. We've taken advantage of every window of maturity to improve the balance sheet structure. In the last year, we've improved the liquidity gap by over &#x20AC;19 billion in the euro area and this quarter, over &#x20AC;2 billion. The funding in the Eurozone balance sheet has improved more than 20%, close to 5% in this quarter compared to the previous quarter. The deposit-to-asset ratio is the best for our entire peer group, 50%. And we don't have any dependency on the European Central Bank and we've got available collateral which is worth &#x20AC;60 billion in the euro area.</p>
          <p>Finally, all of these factors mean that we have a very sound franchise. We're very dynamic in the emerging markets and we've shown enormous resilience in the developed economies. And when I talk about the thriving emerging markets for us, I'm talking about our ability to bring on board new customers and to accompany all the people moving into the banking system in Mexico and South America. With over 1.6 million new customers in Mexico and 954,000 in South America, which means that our loan books are growing over 10% in Mexico and in South America close to 28%, whilst customer funds are growing close to 15% in South America and 10.5% in Mexico.</p>
          <p>This is where we see the best risk ratios in the group, with an NPA ratio which is stabilized at 3.4% in Mexico and in South America at 2.4%, which has made it possible for us in these franchises to get fantastic earnings, both in Mexico, about &#x20AC;900 million, growing slightly more than 10%, in South America, &#x20AC;529 million, growing 19%. And we also see a lot of earnings now coming in from Turkey, from China and from the rest of that region, &#x20AC;319 million. But also in the developed markets, we are seeing that our business is very resilient using our franchise and our branch networks, where we are continuously gaining market share in both deposits and lending as well.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, 240 basis points up in deposits and 50 in lending, that's in Spain. And then the USA where we are changing the mix of our business portfolio still, in the USA, we're generating a growth in lending as a market share without taking commercial real estate into account, growing by 26 basis points and we are improving our customer spread in more than 16 basis points in Spain, and in the United States in this quarter, just 2 basis points, but it's been more than 15 in the last year.</p>
          <p>And risks for the sixth quarter running in both regions have been stable; in Spain, at 4.7%, with a slight improvement over the period, and in the United States, 4.2% quarter with an improvement over the entire period. And what does all of this mean? Well, it means we've got this distribution of earnings. When we started the presentation, I said that not all the environments that we're working in are under stress. One-third of the geographical areas where we are operating are being managed as a complex environment, as we call it, but the other two-thirds, as you can see in this pie chart, are places where there really isn't a crisis. Mexico, 30% of the total earnings, South America, close to 20% of the total earnings, the total net attributable profit, and the rest of Europe and Asia, EurAsia, to Turkey and China with 15%, and then Spain which is 31%, and the United States is growing 5%.</p>
          <p>By way of conclusion, then, five key factors. We are the most solvent big European bank when tested for stress. The second thing is that our income statement is very recurrent, very resilient. We've got a net attributable profit of &#x20AC;2.339 billion in the first half and the risk indicators show that we've got stable risk premium and if you look at the asset quality, you can see the key indicators are stable. Every quarter, nonetheless, our peer banks are seeing impairments on their asset quality. Our funding needs are already covered for 2011, and above all, we don't have to depend on the European Central Bank at all. This is thanks to our diversified business structure, a highly dynamic business in emerging economies and we are gaining market share and enjoying very resilient performance in developed economies.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's move on to the geographic regions. Starting as always with Spain, I'll skip this. The keys to the results in Spain and the financial data for this quarter first of all, general market share gain in loans especially in individual mortgages and also in consumer funds financing. At the same time, we're also generating better spreads in most of our sections, both in banking, in purchases and mortgages, consumer financing, which is enabling us to improve our spreads as we shall see.</p>
          <p>Deposits on customer funds, we have 55% of all the new deposit flows over the last 12 months. 55%, that's almost &#x20AC;30 billion in the financial system. At the same time, we've also reduced the cost of our liabilities over the same period over the last 12 months by 58 basis points when the Euribor has gone up 68 basis points. And this means that we've improved our spreads in 16 basis points from 1.6 which was the floor on 31st of September in the fourth quarter to 1.8 that we have reached now in the second quarter, which confirms, as I said at the beginning, that the decline in the net interest income is stabling off, it's slowing down in the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>The NPA ratio is not only important because of the improvement of 19 basis points, but also if we compare this with our peers, where everybody else quarter-after-quarter are showing general increases in the NPA ratio, which means that we can maintain a risk premium of 0.7% for the fourth quarter and the NPA ratio is stable, as I said. So, this takes us to the P&amp;L, which generates profit in our businesses, Spain, of around &#x20AC;900 million. It's true that there is a drop of 34%. But the impact here has come from the general provisioning that we made, especially in the first quarter, harnessing the enormous growth from the trading income.</p>
          <p>The rest EurAsia, the rest of Europe and Asia, thriving business. This was &#x2013; Turkey is included for the first time in the full quarter which gives us a gross income of over &#x20AC;500 million in Asia, with the incorporation basically of Citi coming on board and all our other wholesale business in the region of around &#x20AC;300 million. So we're now talking about our region that is over &#x20AC;800 million in gross income. So this is one-third and so a third is the rest of Europe and two-thirds is from China. We're talking about &#x20AC;450 million and over &#x20AC;900 million by the end of the year. But the growth is over 65% here.</p>
          <p>Moving onto Mexico now. Despite the fact that they have an important market share with the different products we have in Mexico, we're continuing to generate growth both in deposits and in lending, over 10% in both, and more in target at cards and consumer finance, but also in mortgages. And also, in consumer finance as well. And deposits we're growing in investment funds but also in deposit funds and in both of these where there are improvements in the market share. If we look at the net interest income, it has grown by 5%. But there's a negative effect that we've had in these first six months especially in markets which is includes global customers. So if you look at the underlying retail business in Mexico, the net interest income is increasing by 12.1%. This is an important thing because we're following quarter-after-quarter the same trend. So we're talking about a quarter that once again is setting revenue records for the franchise.</p>
          <p>Improvements in loan loss provisioning, this is stabling off compared with last year. The NPA ratio is over 3%, it's 3.4%. The coverage rate is very high, one of the best we can see in the group and the risk &#x2013; the cost of risk has stabilized around 3.4% with a clear fall from the levels we saw last year or the year before. So the income statement from Mexico with these numbers, we have almost &#x20AC;900 million which is just over 10% growth on each of the lines.</p>
          <p>South America, the strength here is even greater if possible and this is all over the region. We're talking about growth of 28%. Deposits are growing by 15% and as I said before, the &#x2013; on balance sheets, we're talking about a growth of over 26% and this is general for the entire region as we can see from the slide. If we analyze Chile, Colombia and Peru, which is thriving like Mexico, lending is thriving, very sound franchise all over which gives us a growth and the net interest income of over 24% and a gross income that's increased by 19%.</p>
          <p>In general, over all the franchises, the NPA ratio is the best indicator we have in the whole BBVA group which has also improved the coverage rate where we have the best coverage rate in the group as well, which is even higher than Mexico. And the loss loan provisioning, despite the investment in lending, has stabilized, so it's practically flat, and therefore this has improved the cost of risk. The income statement is over &#x20AC;500 million, which is 19% improvement, as you can see in all the lines.</p>
          <p>The United States, as I've said before, we're continuing to work to improve the mix, the balance, both on the assets and the liability side in the United States. From this point of view, in individual banking and companies, without bearing in mind commercial and real estate, is growing by 17%, and commercial and real estate is falling by over 30%.</p>
          <p>Deposits, once again, we're improving our liability structures. We're growing the cheaper balances, so the non-remunerated deposits at 19% -- are growing by 19%, and the remunerated ones have fallen by 5%. And this means that we can grow our market share on the lending side, except in commercial real estate. And at the same time, we have reduced the cost of deposits as a consequence of the improvements in our liabilities mix. And this leads us to improve the customer spread by 15 basis points during this period, and the net interest income, which is net of the cost of risk, when this is the effect of the change in the mix when they go on the balance sheet, which has improved by 7% over the quarter.</p>
          <p>We're seeing a sustained fall of 35% year on year, which obviously, has reduced the cost of risk which is now down to 1.2% by the end of the year. NPAs in the balance have fallen. We have an NPA ratio of 4% &#x2013; of around 4% which means that we can improve the coverage by 5 percentage points during this period. The attributed profit from United States is &#x20AC;159 million which is up by 14%. It's also true that there's an enormous impact as we saw in Mexico by the state of the markets of global markets which gives us a growth of 47%.</p>
          <p>In the retail franchise, wholesale banking. Despite the volatile and complex market and the setting, if we analyze the two main business, Corporate and Investment Banking and Global Markets, the former despite the fall in lending by 6%, companies are delevering the net interest income as a consequence of managing our prices is growing 1.1%, and as a consequence of applying high added value products to the customers, fees are up by over 9%.</p>
          <p>Global Markets in this volatile setting have clearly improved the entire customer franchise with increased revenues by 44%. But the fall, the greatest impact of this volatility has fallen on the trading market where the net trading income has fallen by 20% and the gross income quarter-by-quarter in global markets has grown by 3.6%. So the conclusion would be this is thanks to the resilient customer franchise that we have in the group. And this brings us to an income statement for the wholesale banking for all the geographies in the group in wholesale banking of &#x20AC;671 million. But due to the volatility of the markets, has fallen by 6%.</p>
          <p>So, conclusions. The five keys to the results of this quarter, solvency, once again, we have shown just how strong our solvency is with a top major bank in the league of our European rivals. Second, the resilience of our earnings in all geographies, some are thriving more than others, some are more resilient. Asset quality, the risk indicators being stable, but what's even more important is when we compare this with what our peers are trying to do. We are in a very comfortable position with regards to funding, because we have in 2011, where it is entirely covered. And finally, the diversification of our franchises, which is the main feature of the resilience of our balance sheet, between &#x2013; the balance between the franchise and the emerging markets and the developed markets.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'll hand over to Tomas Blasco now to take the questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, &#xC1;ngel. As usual, I will try and put the questions together into groups that come in over our webcast so that we can answer as many questions as possible. So let's start with group questions. Rohith Chandra from Barclays and Britta Schmidt from Autonomous, Ignacio Cerezo from Credit Suisse, all ask about the performance of the net trading income this quarter. The figure that you've given about net trading income for this quarter, is this the normal level that we are going to see in coming quarters, and why has the tax rate fallen in this quarter? Ignacio Cerezo asks about whether we should expect to maintain this rate over coming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Although Manolo will come in after me, I'll talk a little bit about trading income. As I've said in the presentation, this figure for the quarter was obviously lower than it was last quarter which was normally much higher. That of course doesn't mean to say that this is going to be the most recurrent level. Obviously, that would be over &#x20AC;400 million. That would be really the recurrent level. But we shouldn't forget that last quarter; we took advantage of the enormous growth in trading income to set aside generic provisions. As I've said, especially in Spain where we were able to continue to have the same level of generic provisions as we did at the end of last year, because of the net trading income, so we had excess provisions over and above the minimum that was necessary. Would you like to add anything Manolo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no. Not really. Just to remind you that the trading income for the first quarter was helped along by a lot of different factors that we've mentioned. And we can't expect it to be recurrent. There were one-off things like the exchange rate, hedging, and what happened in Venezuela, the diverse &#x2013; the sales that we made from our portfolio on the euro, and the dollar, and the Mexican portfolios in the ALCO. And then Global Markets did very well throughout the world which had a big impact on the net trading income. And so this quarter in markets didn't look so good because of these one-off events happened in the first quarter that weren't repeated in the second. The drop in the tax rate, well, there are several things to say about this. In the quarter, we have the Telef&#xF3;nica dividend impact. We had it this quarter but not the previous quarter and that means that we've got more than &#x2013; we have more than a 5% stake in Telef&#xF3;nica and we don't have to pay tax on that.</p>
          <p>The second thing is more equity accounting of the earnings that we get from our subsidiaries including Citi above all, and so the gross operating income is net of tax, so that goes straight down to the last line without having any tax added, bigger stake in the earnings coming from emerging economies which have a lower tax rate. So that means that the overall tax rate goes down. And then the fourth thing is the revision of the deferred tax that we had for the group as a whole, which has meant that, when we looked at the deferred tax, we could bring down the total tax burden. So the question I'd imagine that you're really interested in finding out about is, how do we think this tax burden will look if it normalizes? Well, it would be between 24% and 25% we think in general of the order, of course. There will be one-off issues in different quarters like we've had now but that would be underlying tax rate, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there are various other questions which I've grouped together. From Antonio Ramirez, from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous, Santiago L&#xF3;pez and Mr. Cerezo again from Credit Suisse, they're all asking about why we brought forward the conversion of the convertible bond issue? And then capital, do we think that the 28 entities that again have systemic risk will need an additional capital buffer and what would our position be in that case, talking here about Spain? In your core capital do you include impairments, because of what has been done with the whole bond portfolio as a whole? Does that mean that there are adjustments in the way that we mark things to our books? And then with respect to those adjustments in the valuation, what kind of impact have they had on the core capital for this quarter as we change the values that we were booking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all of these questions are for you Manolo. Maybe I could just mention the world of the globals. I think that irrespective of when the list is published, whether it's published in November or December. We are a global bank when with systemic relevance. So whatever formula is used, I don't think this is debatable but one advantage that we've had is something that we've said systematically is that we have a far less complex business model than most of our peers. As I said, this is in the retail market leveraged in all our &#x2013; on the customer in all our franchises and also as you can see, we have 9% capital, core capital, which is way above the requisites. So any of the buckets that you look at, I think we will meet the criteria for any stress tests. So we're comfortable with our core capital or any capital requirements that might be applied. We'll have to see what the situation is at the end of year. But what is true is that we are a global group and we act as such. We have an important footprint in many, different geographies and above all, our business model is far simpler than many of our peers. Manolo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the question on our valuation adjustments. If we look at the impairments in the quarter, we're talking about &#x20AC;793 million. Of these, &#x20AC;602 million concern exchange rate differences. This valuation adjustment is included in the core capital. Over and above that, we have the &#x20AC;157 million which is an adjustment of the available and for sale of equity. And we have &#x20AC;34 million for adjusting for the available for sale for bonds. Neither of these evaluation adjustments either of in equity or for bonds portfolios are affecting the core capital. But the important part the &#x2013; most of the evaluation adjustment is the impairment in the exchange rate which is included in the core capital figures.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the question now that several of you asked about the reason for converting our convertible bonds in advance, if we compare this with other convertible bonds that have been issued in the Spanish financial system is a bond with an original term of five years if you remember. And they have one special feature which is a variable conversion price in exchange for which there were options to convert the bonds in advance on each payment date of the accruement from the first year of conversion. So this was a convertible that was designed to minimize potential losses for retail customers, but at the same time designed to give the maximum flexibility to the bank to convert the convertible. We decided to do this in advance for two basic reasons. As we saw the definition of capital in Europe that didn't include in the core capital &#x2013; that didn't include these convertible bonds in the core capital, we decided &#x2013; and acting, thinking that this was going to be included in Basel III, so we decided to convert this convertible bond in advance so that right from the beginning, there would be no difference between our public capital ratios, or our main capital definitions, and in the EBA definition of capital.</p>
          <p>So, what we wanted to do is to move into the new regulatory setting that's coming. The second main reason for this is to look for a second conversion period that will be as &#x2013; to be able to absorb, to be able to be absorbed by the market, so we thought that this was &#x2013; there was a quarter where we have a cash dividend payment, and then on the 15th of July we have the convertible bond, was the ideal time to mark a difference from the conversion periods of other convertible bonds that have issued at the moment, and in the Spanish financial system. And then these are the two main reasons why we decided to convert this bond in advance, and we're delighted to have done so, and we think that the market has behaved well. I think it's been a successful operation for our customers, for the bank, and once again, it has reinforced our core capital ratios</p>

          <p>The interest income, there are several questions, Rohith Chandra from Barclays asked about the interest margin. There's a fall in the interest margin in the quarter. What is this due to? How much is due to the consolidation of Guaranty and how much of this is due to the underlying trend &#x2013; business trend? Antonio Ramirez from Keefe asks about the net interest income, in the second quarter, has held up better than expected and maybe you could give tell us a little bit more about the re-pricing of the lending by segments and the cost of the new and time deposits?</p>
          <p>Alexander Pelteshki from ING Bank asks about the funding process in Spain. How has this performed and what are we expecting in coming quarters? And the final question in this block on the net trading income, Francisco Riquel from N+1. Net interest margin in Spain, he said it's practically flat if we look at this quarter against quarter despite the fact that the customer spreads in euros has deteriorated from 190 basis points to 160 basis points in the quarter. Maybe you could explain this, give us a bit of color about what has driven this and what can we expect in the quarters to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we start with Guaranty or &#x2013; yes, okay, right. The contribution, well, Guaranty is presenting results for the 3rd of August. So the data that I have are the effects of the incorporation of the Guaranty earnings, incorporating consolidation adjustments to bring them into the BBVA levels, so they are not exactly the same results that Guaranty will be presenting on the 3rd of August. The effect on the net interest income for the second quarter was &#x20AC;123 million, so the net interest margin without Guaranty is pretty well flat excluding the impact, then, of the incorporation of Guaranty for this quarter. Okay?</p>
          <p>I think the repricing is the next question. If you look at Page 29 of the presentation, you can see that we are seeing an improvement over the last 12 months of 34 basis points. Mortgages for buyers have gotten improved, whilst consumer prices as well have improved, so that's the improvement that we have seen in the loan book. Well that's also true, as you've seen that the lending activity has been about flat with all the re-pricing being brought in for the new contracts. If you look at the deposits, on that side, there's something you can see in the presentation, which is that the prices that we are applying now in July, compared to what we were applying in the same period of last year, was 58 basis points lower. If you remember at the end of June, maybe part of July, we peaked in terms of term costs, but for individuals &#x2013; because for businesses, there's always a lower rate, but for individuals, the peak was 345, and now, we're at 268. And now in the new contract, what's happening, well, for individuals, 268 and for businesses, it's below 220.</p>
          <p>Well, in page 29 as well, you can see what's happening to Euribor. 12-month Euribor over this period of time has gone up 86 basis points. And that means in businesses here in Spain that we've got that improvement of the customer's trend of 16 basis points, and that's the main reason why the net interest income over the second quarter has pretty well been flat against the previous quarter repeating the same figures. But if we look at it in retail banking, business banking and global customers for wholesale banking that are located here in Spain as well we see that the growth is pretty well flat or in fact going up very slightly.</p>
          <p>For several months running, we've seen continuous improvement in net interest income here. Without yet having applied the impact of the repricing from the growth in Euribor, which as you know has a direct short-term impact on a lot of the deposits whilst on the loan book it takes time to have an impact. There's a definite time lag of about two quarters before the changes in Euribor come in as we change the prices for a lot of the assets on the balance sheet. So when we're talking about tendencies and that was the question you asked, that means that it's possible that we're still seeing and we will for another couple of quarters maybe remain at the levels we are now with some slight growth even between now and the end of the year, taking advantage of that time lag. As the Euribor goes up, then there's a time lag and then it has an impact on a lot of the assets that we have on our books.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question about the funding costs as well here in Spain, and I think that your question refers to the wholesale funding costs because the retail funding costs have already been discussed by &#xC1;ngel. We'll be talking about an increase in the cost of wholesale funding year-on-year of 60 basis points. So the first half year, this year's season increase in wholesale funding costs is 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>Paco Riquel asked about the difference between the customer spread in the euro area and the customer spread that we were talking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what's important here about customer spread or whatever you call it, is looking at the resident sector and that's definitely improving, as we said before. The Euro spread basically if you compare that to the rest of One Incorporates branch offices in Europe. So that brings in the wholesale business where there is hardly any retail because there is hardly any retail offices here in Europe and that distorts the figures. So if you just look at the margin in Spain, what's important is to see what happens to the customer spread for the resident sector.</p>

          <p>Raoul Leonard from the Royal Bank of Scotland have asked about liquidity and the interbank rate for funds which has gone up significantly in the second quarter whilst the wholesale debt has gone down. Is this an ongoing policy for the future or is it just that it so happened to do that the day that you closed the books for this quarter? And what's our intention, are we going to start issuing on the markets again or should we wait until there's a drop over the next few quarters which will mean that we won't be so exposed to the interbank market? And Raoul Leonard goes further and wants to have more color added to our explanation of our performance in commercial paper in the United States quarter-against-quarter. And could we give some guidance for the future. So what's the outlook over the next few quarters?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we can see on page 13 of the balance sheet, the increase in the quarter of the deposits in central banks and credit institution, this increase for the quarter is closely linked to the increase in our trading portfolio that has also occurred in this quarter. So and that's it. The market area in balances had increases in their trading portfolio. And obviously, this is funded beneath by interbank loans and this explains the increase in the interbank funds. There are a whole series of effects that the funds business that we have with central banks which is a significant business as you know, having fallen has grown &#x2013; started to grow slightly. But this is the main issue.</p>
          <p>With regard to market issues, in the current situation of sovereign debt crisis in Europe, this is not something that &#x2013; like in 2010 that might have a special effect on Spanish banks. It's a situation that's affecting all major institutions Europe wide without exceptions. So the greater the dependence on the capital markets, the greater the weight of the wholesale business, the more difficult it is to handle this situation in a time of crisis like this. But all these entities, we in BBVA have a contained balance. We have a small balance in relative terms at retail components as in Spain. We're making a major contribution to liquidity. As &#xC1;ngel said, we've funded all our maturities which are very small relatively in comparison with other European banks.</p>
          <p>We've done this in advance. We've got all our needs covered. So in this environment of weak lending and we feel very comfortable without having to go into the capital markets for a long, long time yet. Obviously, I think market discipline is something that we all have to respect. And I think we have shown time and again that we go into the market when we think it's the right time and we've accepted the market prices when we think it's the right time to do so. So BBVA feels no pressure to go into the capital market.</p>
          <p>With regard to the performance of the Commercial Paper, we have significantly reduced in 2010 our short-term funding from the American market. The balance we have which is very marginally in the quarter is very, very small. I think we only have &#x20AC;2 billion in Commercial Paper programs in the United States. So, the exposure we have to reductions in funding from the United States to Europe, I think, is virtually nil.</p>

          <p>Sergio Gamez from Merrill Lynch and somebody from the Royal Bank of Scotland is also asking a question on the ALCO and their contribution to the margin. Bearing in mind that the corporate center and the attributed profit by corporate activities highly volatile now has been over recent quarters, maybe you could explain what's happening there, especially if you could give us some sort of guidance for the quarters to come? Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca asks how sustainable is the figure for the interest income in comparison with the improvements in the cost of deposits? And Carlos Berastain from Deutsche Bank says that in light of what other Spanish banks have published, the BBVA interest income is quite disappointing. Why? Why is it performing so badly and what can we expect looking forward? When are we going to see a change in this trend?</p>

          <p>Manolo, do you want to start then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about ALCO, well, I think your question is about the euro balance sheet because obviously, we are also managing the liabilities and assets for different amounts, with different structures, in different places depending on the different situations. But for the euro balance sheet, there we've got a contribution of &#x20AC;320 million to the net interest income because of ALCO portfolio and quarter-on-quarter, because interest rates have gone up and there's been a slight reduction in the total balance, there's a lower contribution slightly below &#x20AC;20 million which we had in the first quarter. And then corporate activities, I think that in the documentation, you can see what we're talking about and what we mean by corporate activities. And as you can see, they're not that volatile the results, although the structure itself can be volatile and basically net interest income includes the yields on the ALCO portfolios for the euro area and we've got the cost of wholesale funding beyond the cost that was originally budgeted for the different business units.</p>
          <p>So that's the difference between the budget and the real. As for the costs that haven't yet been allocated to the different areas with the new platforms that we're building up in various different parts of the group to improve the IT, well quite honestly, until they are under operation and they go live for the business areas, all the development costs have been booked to the corporate center apart from other costs which, by their very nature, can't be distributed out to the business areas because they can't manage them directly.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of provisioning, there you've got the generic provisions and there was a big endowment made last year and then the loan loss provisions for closures and purchase of real estate assets. That's the main things that we have booked to corporate activities and what's important to interpret them. And then the sustainability of the net interest income which you asked about and the sustainability of the cost of deposits, I'd imagine what you're referring to here is whether we think that the pressure we've seen over the last few quarters on the cost of deposits will continue and what I can say here is that what we've been observing over the last few weeks, well almost months, I could say, not many months but a few months here, is that there's lower pressure on deposit costs which has made it possible at a time when we are starting to renew a lot of the deposits that we brought in exactly a year ago and we have to renew them now.</p>
          <p>So, we are seeing there that from one month to the next there's been a drop of over 40 basis points and even more if we compare that against the previous year at the same date. So from now on, we can expect to see things not become more relaxed because they're still quite a tight market, but it's not going to be nearly as competitive as it has been. So, we can expect to see continuous improvements in customer spreads because of two things. First of all, there will be a continuous improvement in the cost of deposits for us, and we'll start to see how re-pricing at higher rates, because of the year Euribor going up, will start to have a bigger and bigger impact as the year goes by if you look at our assets.</p>
          <p>Then there's the question about net interest income in Spain. Maybe there we should remember various things. One is that, if you remember, at the end of 2010, and we're comparing ourselves against all the Spanish banks, the only net interest income figure that hadn't dropped from the beginning of the crisis to end of 2010 in Spain was BBVA's net interest income. All the rest of the banks had seen a full loss since 2009 throughout 2010, so we'd shown much more resilience maintaining our interest income throughout the crisis. Moreover, we were the last to start to offer higher prices for deposits to bring in more deposits. We started to bring in higher-priced deposits only at the end of June last year, and of that moment, that was when we started to put up the cost of deposits.</p>
          <p>And, as I said in the presentation, that was when we were able over the last 12 months to get more than 50% of the new deposits coming into the entire financial system in Spain and at the same time, we were able to bring down the cost of deposits, on average between 50, 60 basis points lower price paid than what we were seeing our competitors paying. So we were the last to come in and put up the price we paid for deposits, we've shown the highest resilience, keeping the highest volumes of net interest income compared in absolute figures against what happened before the crisis or at the beginning of the crisis, and in the last few quarters, we've been seeing the effect of the higher impact of the deposit costs. But in relative terms, very clearly, we've outperformed our competitors.</p>

          <p>And then there's another block about asset quality, Rohith Chandra from Barclays and Britta Schmidt from Autonomous ask about the performance of the NPLs or the NPAs throughout the group with growth additions growing against the previous quarter, it seems. So they're at the same level as the fourth quarter of 2010. How can you explain that? Why did the NPAs perform like this? Rohith Chandra from Barclays also asks about the generic provisions. How much generic provisioning is left in Spain and what would be the regulatory minimum? And <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:23) from Morgan Stanley asks about specific provisions over the next quarters and how we expect our specific provisions to perform here in Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, gross entries or gross additions, we saw a spike in this quarter. I don't think this is a trend. What we usually do is to carry out a subjective analysis of our portfolio and in this quarter, we're talking about the mortgage portfolio. And we've done this subjectively with transferred subjective NPAs, they are not mature, they haven't fallen into a hold. We have &#x20AC;450, &#x20AC;450 million that are on the watch list. But this is only now in this quarter.</p>
          <p>An important factor here is to bear in mind the following and that is, the expectation that we see in Spain of how the NPA ratio is going to perform in the industry and we're seeing general increases quarter after quarter. So, we could've presented a fall in the NPA ratio to the markets, but we thought it made more sense. But until we see recurring improvements in the economic situation here in Spain, we prefer to be prudent, highly conservative rather than showing these positive data before we should which would gross additions to NPAs are in line with what we're seeing in throughout 2010 and the first part of 2011. So, we continue to think these are in line with what we're seeing before and so I don't think this is important and I think that trend is exactly the same. But what we prefer to do is to put all these gross increases in this one figure and give it out now.</p>
          <p>If you look at the move to markdowns has been lower than we've seen in previous quarter. Generic provisions, I think it's at the same level as the end of the year. It's around &#x20AC;450 million, and although this does vary, we're talking about &#x20AC;200 million more than the minimum that we need at any one time. With regard to specific provisions, after the continual fall that we've seen in recent quarters, and they seem to be stabling out now, what we hope to find now is a specific cost of risk that will be in line with what we saw for the first two quarters of the year.</p>

          <p>In terms of cost <mark type="ph" /> Ronald Lamont (61:38) from the Royal Bank of Scotland and for Autonomous and Santiago Lopez from Sun asks about the growth of costs that's above the growth in revenues. Will this continue in the next few quarters? And why have costs grown over the last two quarters and, more specifically in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cost income ratio, what's our objective in the short-term to mid-term, costs. In costs, there's a logical increase, which we should expect because of the change of parameter. It's not just well, it's obvious we've brought in Guaranty but we've also over the last 12 months incorporated Cr&#xE9;dito Uruguay in Uruguay and we'd also incorporated under global incorporation our car finance business, Forum, in Chile. So &#x20AC;140 million more there and that's what's relevant. And then, another thing that's had an impact is the increase in rental, selling off all the branch network property in Spain.</p>
          <p>And then, as I said, during a crisis period and, more specifically, over the last year and a half, we've been working on various lines to get growth. But above all, looking at the future, opening new branches in regions where we still think that we have not enough popularity. And here, we're talking about countries in South America, Chile, Peru, even Colombia and, more specifically, Mexico, where we want to have more than 2,000 branch offices by the end of 2012. So, in these 12 months, we've grown or we've opened more than 140 branch offices and brought in more than 4,000 new employees that we've hired. That's important.</p>
          <p>One thing we are demanding of any growth in costs is that we'll get a return on our capital, or first of all, the generation of revenues has to finance the higher cost from year one. And secondly, the efficiency of the growth in costs has to recover the original standards of the group or the franchise where they're originating in not less than two years, in practice, we are saying that it has to be within a year and year and a half.</p>
          <p>The next point that's relevant and this forms part of one of our most important strategy plans which is to improve productivity across the board throughout all the regions, especially in Mexico and South America. because that's vital for us. We have to bring down the number of transactions that we have to generate physically in our retail branches. So, we want to substantially improve commercial productivity. Over the last 12 months, South America has seen a more than 20% improvement in productivity of employees.</p>
          <p>And so, there are two lines of action there. First of all, to increase the total number of ATMs, more than 1,600, as we've already said, have been installed over the last 12 months. And then secondly, we have to increase the different things that the ATMs can do so that they can do more things and therefore, not so many human services are required in the branch offices.</p>
          <p>In terms of cost income ratio, we will see the fruits being borne in the future, they are already coming in, but they will be more and more results coming in as productivity goes up over the next few quarters. What we've been doing on a sustainable basis in technology is very important, too, because we think that the way that we should distribute products and relate to our customers in the future will have to be different. And that means we're investing in technology in the core banking system here in Spain, in the United States as well, with a new platform for global businesses.</p>
          <p>And we are taking advantage of technology, taking advantage of investments made in the holding company in Spain and in the other franchises in Mexico and South America, we can do that. In Spain, the platform should be ready for the end of the year. At the moment, we already have a package that can be used in any transaction that we wish. And that part was fundamental for us because that's the keystone to be able to roll this out everywhere. It's only four years only since we started this whole plan but we are already beginning to see the results of it, and everything will be ready for the end of the year here so that we can see tangible results.</p>
          <p>And then after that in the future, what will be most important will be what we've seen happen in the second compared to the first quarter, the developed economies are seeing synergies or positive impacts of the investment in technology that I was talking about. And in the emerging economies, the impact will be seen more in efficiency as of next year in the cost income ratio rather than in the performance of costs alone. So, as of 2012, costs will probably be growing below inflation. And we shouldn't forget that between Mexico and South America, inflation in this period was 7.5%. So, that's another thing that should be taken into account when you look at the growth in costs. So, to sum up, inflation, parameter, investment for the future to improve efficiency as of 2012 and be able to generate better revenues coming from each customer, that's it.</p>

          <p>Well now, &#xC1;ngel has explained our exposure to Greece, Portugal and Ireland, which is minimal. The impact of the sovereign debt crisis on the net trading income, basically, the revenues from global markets have fallen quarter-on-quarter, but they continue to perform pretty well especially in relative terms, if we look at the figures from more wholesale banks or more investment banks that have reported their results to-date. As we can see from the presentation, we have a very limited weight of trading within our franchise, and our franchise is more exposed to a falling business activity or a falling demand from transactions from customers rather than the trading itself or how volatile markets are. As we can see from the presentation, the trading revenues are only 30% of the income from the markets division and the fall in the first quarter in comparison with the first quarter of last year is 20%. But we don't have &#x2013; we're not so exposed to this volatility.</p>

          <p>So, let's start on the Spanish questions now. Rohith Chandra from Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, UBS and Natixis, all ask about how are loans, the growth in loans in Spain going this quarter? What's our best criteria with regard to how long this deleveraging that is going on is going to last in Spain? What are the drivers of growing loans and lending in Spain? They also ask about the possibility of finding out a little bit more about the loan deposit ratio loans in the second quarter, it's 169%, which is higher than the industry average that everybody's reported so far. So, why are we maintaining these ratio and are we going to continue to do so in the coming quarters? Matteo Ramenghi says that lending in Spain has grown by &#x20AC;9 billion whereas the rest of the industry are reporting a major fall in lending, so what is the difference between ourselves and our peers, the difference between BBVA group and others? Frederic Teschner from Natixis asks about the sustainability of our growth in lending in Spain. So, as you can see, all of this has to do with lending here in Spain, what is our position on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer first about the growth in lending and then I'll leave the liquidity ratio or the loan to deposit ratio to you Manolo along with that one-off growth in our loan book. How long do we think the deleveraging will go on in lending here in Spain? Well, it's difficult to answer but obviously for four years now we've seen gradual deleveraging or not so gradual and we can perfectly expect it to go on for another year even two years. Over the last few quarters we have seen a very low demand for lending above all from businesses either big corporates or SMEs where there's a lot of deleveraging going on. Or the only thing is to change bank loans to debt and so this year and next year, we'll probably see a drop in the system for lending, might be 5%, it might be 7%.</p>
          <p>Sometimes there's a time like but nonetheless we'll see the deleveraging continuing we think. As the way we see it is that we're expecting to go on gaining market share, not very fast because there's not very high flows it's difficult to increase the more flows there are like in deposits, for example, the more easy it is for us to gain market share as I was explaining when I answered some of the other questions, you put a big reduction in consumer and the mortgage lending although we're gaining market share in mortgage lending as you saw in the presentation. The volume of the new mortgage lending is falling off at the same time we're increasing the spread on the new business.</p>
          <p>So when we talk about sustainability, we continue to think that we will go on gaining market share in lending in general, especially in products such as mortgages which tend to lead to further cross-selling and increasing the value of new customers for us. That may not many changes compared to previous quarters and we think that that's probably the tonic out we can expect for the next year, two years. But definitely things aren't going to change within a year.</p>

          <p>You asked about the loan-to-deposit ratio. There I think there's a, certain confusion. Whenever we can we always try to correct it, which has to do with the way we measure things and what it indicates exactly. Does it indicate a problem of sustainability on the balance sheet or in liquidity? In that case, everything is properly broken down in the documents you've been given. We've got an investment in the residence section without the public sector of &#x20AC;175 billion at the end of June 2011. We've got &#x20AC;7 billion of securitization of loans which are put out of the market, which means we've got a net balance of &#x20AC;178 billion net of securitization which have been placed out on the market. Given this figure, we've got deposits with the residence sector, as you can see, of &#x20AC;110 billion, and a balance of mortgage warrants of about &#x20AC;45 billion. So, residence business here in Spain is being helped with the mortgage warrants and the funding and there's some wholesale funding as well, and with the public administration here in Spain, we are seeing our entire business covered with deposits made by the public administration.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And to add to what you're saying, Manolo, if you'll allow me, what we are expecting to see in the future? Well, obviously, this ratio will continue to improve, as it has done over the last four quarters, it would depend on how we look at it. Deposits to loans, or loans to deposits, but anyway, it's &#x2013; we've seen a substantial improvement over the last four quarters. What's the most relevant here, quite apart from the scarce demand for lending, which we have been saying is the &#x20AC;30 billion new deposits that we have brought in over this period of time, which has made it possible to generate new market share. But it has also made it possible to substitute or replace interbank short-term funding by funding from the more retail business that we have in the bank. And simply, to continue with the information, which you can see anyway in the document, but quarter-on-quarter, in current accounts and time deposits, you can see that quarter-on-quarter we are seeing very positive performance in the residence sector in our structure of deposits.</p>
          <p>And continuing with the question of that &#x20AC;9 billion growth in lending, as I have &#x2013; told me to do, I can give you some color. Look at page 14 in the quarterly information and you'll see a breakdown of customer loans. You've got the snapshot for other residence sectors, which is excluding public sector that's where we see the main growth, because there's not much growth in the public sector. And if you look at that line, the highest growth, well, everything's pretty well flat. It's growing slightly except for other financial assets, which are growing from 4.1 to 12.06.</p>
          <p>And the group is, as I said, pursuing a very conservative policy regarding its liquidity and with that excess liquidity that we're maintaining over and above the minimum to regulatory minimums, we've got the assignment of liabilities to assets, which, means that, in the public balance sheets you see the figures with that increase. However, lending is flat with very slight drops as we are &#x2013; if we eliminate this factor, excluding the public sector in Spain. And that's a better performance than that of our peers. And it doesn't have an impact &#x2013; that growth doesn't have an impact on our liquidity and the tendency is what I was talking about before and what Manolo has reiterated as well.</p>
          <p>So finally, to end up with Spain, with respect to property developers, we've got a question as to whether the provisions we've got are sufficient to cover the &#x20AC;15.7 billion risk that we have there with developers. We've also got a question whether the speeding up of sales of real estate assets could or whether they could be accelerated even if it means selling at a loss just in order to bring down that total balance.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley, there we have a question, we've answered about the performance of the growth in lending here in Spain. And Carlo Digrandi from HSBC asks about the growth of our market share in Spain. What are the reasons for it? And in general terms, what categories of loans are we seeing the highest increase in our market share in? Juan Tuesta from Banesto wanted information about what's happening to the risk premium? How do we expect it to perform over the next few quarters? And when would we consider it to be stable? Francisco Riquel from N+1 asks about the tendency for NPAs in Spain excluding developers. So, talking about SMEs and individuals, so how do we expect that to perform over the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with developers. I think the most important thing here and this, concerns our operating income both in Spain and the rest of the group and that's our capacity in general to absorb impairments or losses in the lending book, but also in the real estate from the developing world. Our policy here is highly prudent both in analyzing our promoter portfolio in fact if we have &#x20AC;3.8 billion in NPAs which is 24% of the NPA ratio, in developers, the way we value this portfolio which we do constantly, what we do, we bear very much in mind the value of the guaranteers underlying the loans. So what we have at the moment, we have a loan to value of 70%. It used to be lower, obviously but we still have an excess of guarantees and collateral for the developers. So, from the point of view of the needs for provisioning, obviously we can do this, but from the point of view of offering a more faithful image of the collateral we have for the loans, I would repeat, we have 70% loan-to-value and it's true that it was lower, but we do have a surplus, quite an important surplus in the loan-to-value.</p>
          <p>The next important point is if we want to we can sell. But of course, there are certain components that we think is better to provision for even if we do it quickly such as land rather than selling them in the current market when the liquidity in the real estate market is in such short supply, but this varies enormously from one geography to other. We said this in the presentation, the variability that we're seeing and the fall of prices or price discounts on sales have on our stock of properties. We have sold over 1,000 units during these six months with a price discount or price reductions which vary enormously depending on whether we are talking about the cities, the north, the south or on the coast or in the inland, we're talking about falls of between 5% and 8%, where our stock &#x2013; we have a very small stock of houses in the center or in the north, or reducing the prices of around 50%, 55% in the south or on the coast. But in any event, we require no additional provisions to cover our losses while making small profit, bearing in mind, we're over 30% &#x2013; well 32% cover of these assets in as an average, so we see no significant need for additional provisioning for these loans. We are not concerned at all, because the capacity we have quarter after quarter to generate provisions to cover these assets.</p>
          <p>Moving to asset lending now, throughout the year, we have over nearly &#x20AC;700 million that we're using for provisioning property assets. The cost of risk that you asked, I think we answered this question on several occasions, the specific cause of risk here in Spain in our opinion, we think, is going to stay on the same levels that we have seen over the last two quarters, and the quota, basically in mortgages, consumer finance and then non-financial companies.</p>
          <p>Now, we're talking about developers, we're talking about industrial companies, commercial companies, this is where we are seeing the increase in the lending. Where we are seeing falls, significant falls, is in public institutions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mexico, now, we have a single question concerning what they &#x2013; why we've seen the weak performance of lending in Mexico? What's our best outlook for the second half of 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just one thing to add to the answer to Paco Riquel's question about NPAs outside the developer loan book where we've grown from 21% to 24% in the period whilst in the rest on the other items are pretty well stable. We're not seeing improvements or any worsening either, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty but despite that they're pretty well stable. But we've been prudent in anticipating one-off situations that could occur over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>So in our specific case, we will continue to see the stability in the NPA ratio here in Spain with the performance that we talked about, about developers. And you talked &#x2013; told about Mexico where we've seen excellent performance with consumer lending and card lending and SMEs in Spain but a lower growth in other mid-caps and large corporations and global customers.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, what we've seen in the first part of the year has been a certain change of lending for debt or borrowing for debt above all in our big customers. But if we look at the pipeline we have in Mexico what we can expect in the second half year is some recovery not just in the rest of the items but also in the exposure we have to the main or the biggest corporate customers in the second part of the year. Growing probably at the same rates as the midcaps are double-digit growth albeit low double-digit growth in the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>And then Guaranty, one single question from Antonio Ramirez from Keefe. Will we remember that there are time limits established in the shareholder agreement? Are we going to increase our amount that we have there and are we going to put out a public takeover bid once we go beyond 50%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have answered this question on many occasions. So we haven't certainly haven't forgotten it. We answered this many times in the road show. First of all, the impact, the windows to increase our holding, we do have an option after five years or we have the right after five years to buy an additional 1% of the holding of our partners. And it is from them this is where it would trigger the global control or total control of the bank. Instead of the 25-25 we would have 24-26. So that's the first option.</p>
          <p>The next option is to grow the combination of the two holdings of over 50%. At the moment, we're at 49.9%, i.e., below 50% which is the threshold &#x2013; the legal threshold for controlling the bank in the Turkish market before we make a takeover bid. If either of us had just over a tenth or a couple of tenths and then between the two of us, we'd have over 50%, then we've have it to make it a takeover bid for 100% of the bank in the market. This would have to be done at the highest price paid over the last six &#x2013; the previous six months. That is the theory. In practice, there are some interpretations of what the previous prices are.</p>
          <p>So when we're talking about six months. We have to make consultations about this. But basically, what it means, that we're not going to increase our holding and either of the two partners is going to go above the 50% between the two in the next year and a half or two years. From then on, even though we made a takeover bid for 100% and the control premium has already been paid right at the beginning when we first went in to Turkey. We wouldn't need any kind of extra special premium to takeover a large percentage of the shares that are on the &#x2013; in the market. So just &#x2013; all we need is to buy a few additional shares to get over 50%. But we have no plans to do this in the next year and a half or two years. And of course this will depend on the kind of prices we find are in the market. As you can imagine, we'll do everything possible to generate as much value as we can for our shareholders.</p>

          <p>I think most of the questions have been answered. But there is &#x2013; a few questions here that I suppose on the table, these are different. They concern the M&amp;A strategy that we may have. From Generations, we have a question, what plans do you have for Telef&#xF3;nica? The stake you have in Telef&#xF3;nica? Carlos Peixoto from DPI asks if we are interested in the CAM auction, and what are the geographies would be interesting for BBVA here in Spain? They also asked on whether Poland is &#x2013; could be an interesting market for the BBVA. Irma Garrido from Ahorro Corporaci&#xF3;n asked the same question about our non-organic growth policy in Spain with regard to new opportunities that may appear. And the same question, Marcello Zanardo from Bernstein. And to close this group of questions, Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca asks about our criteria with regard the discussion on debate that is ongoing in the United States. The debt ceiling for the U.S. could disaffect us. What ideas do we have with regard to this debate that's going on in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, Telef&#xF3;nica, I think we've answered this very often in the past and in the road show as well when we moved into Guaranty. Telef&#xF3;nica is a financial holding, therefore, the idea isn't to stay there for the long term, nor for the future, but at the moment when we don't &#x2013; if you don't need capital. If you don't see any opportunities that, requires that we want to take advantage the very high yield we get on that stake, the generation of cash dividends which come in every half year is important and so we see that as an opportunity to incorporate capital into the Group.</p>
          <p>Obviously, however, we'd had to look at the timing to see if it made sense to do anything else. You asked about Spain and savings, banks, auctions, CAM, above all. If you &#x2013; it's the same idea as we've always have. We want organic growth. Our strategy plans for Spain focus very clearly on gaining market share systematically. We want to bring in all the new flows of businesses that are being generated in lending and in deposits, but above all, we want to incorporate a lot more customers and bring them into our banking franchise here in Spain. And you can see it, this is happening. If you get 55% of the new flow of deposits in practice that definitely means that more and more customers are being attracted to our franchise.</p>
          <p>And if there are any auctions, obviously, these times are very turbulent with things really just starting now. We don't know what these savings banks auctions are going to look like, how they're going to work. And so our main fundamental objective is to get organic growth. Poland, we haven't even incorporated it within the scope of our analysis and as to the debt ceiling in the U.S., well, over the next week, we'll get the final agreement on the debt ceiling. We think probably, we believe there will be an agreement. Anyway, we're not exposed to this kind of debt in the United States, so it won't have much impact on our portfolio, either in terms of capital or of earnings in our United States franchise.</p>
