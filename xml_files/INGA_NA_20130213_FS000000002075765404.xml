          <p>Good morning. This is Camellia welcoming you to the ING's Q4 2012 Conference Call. Before handing this conference call over to Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Groep, say that today's comments may include forward-looking statements such as statements regarding future developments in our business and expectations for future financial performances and any statements not involving a historical fact. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. A discussion of factors that may cause actual results to differ from those in any forward-looking statement is contained in our public filing including our most recent annual report on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and our earnings press release as posted on our website today. Furthermore nothing in today's comments constitutes an offer sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.</p>
          <p>Good morning, Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Welcome everyone, to the ING fourth quarter 2012 results conference call. 2012 was a transformational year. We worked hard <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:14) the group further and preparing bank and insurance for independent futures. Results held up well for the year despite a sovereign debt crisis in Europe and a weak economy which we endured during all of 2012.</p>
          <p>I will now talk you through the presentation. Patrick Flynn and Wilfred Nagel are here with me from the Executive Board. Also Delfin Rueda and Doug Caldwell, respectively CFO and CRO of Insurance EurAsia are here with us and Ewout Steenbergen, CFO of the Insurance Company U.S. is on the call. So we're all available to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Slide number 2, results held up well, came in at &#x20AC;2.6 billion underlying net profit, which is down 5.2% from 2011. The fourth quarter results were impacted by the Dutch bank tax and various market <mark type="ph" /> related (2:16) items and leading to an underlying profit for the group of &#x20AC;373 million. The bank underlying result was &#x20AC;184 million and it had to deal with &#x20AC;188 million negative credit adjustments, &#x20AC;151 million of de-risking losses and &#x20AC;175 million of Dutch bank tax.</p>
          <p>The insurance operating results improved compared to the third quarter. They came in at a little less than &#x20AC;300 million as the investment spread strengthened and the underlying result before tax rose to &#x20AC;272 million.</p>
          <p>You'll see the full year results on slide 3. Net profit for the group was almost &#x20AC;3.9 billion including the gains that we had on the sale of ING Direct USA, ING Canada and Insurance Malaysia. Net results also included &#x20AC;452 million of restructuring charge, which will help to drive future performance.</p>
          <p>We announced today an expansion of our change program in the retail Netherlands as well as a new program in Belgium. These come on top of the initiatives that we announced last quarter in commercial banking and in Insurance Europe, as we invest in operational excellence and we make sure that we have process improvements so that we can serve our customers better. At the same time we are adjusting our cost base as necessary by the tough economic environment.</p>
          <p>On slide 4 you see that combined the measures will reduce expenses by about &#x20AC;1 billion by 2015. Cost initiatives that we announced at the end of 2011 are ahead of schedule for retail Netherlands. We have already scored &#x20AC;162 million in cost savings so far out of the &#x20AC;330 million that we expect to gain. Today we announced <mark type="audio gap" /> (4:18) program. Basically because we need to meet the rapidly changing needs that our customers are showing in the way that they use, quickly to mobile banking.</p>
          <p>In the Netherlands we aim to realize cost savings of an additional &#x20AC;100 million by 2014 and &#x20AC;120 million in total, including a further head count reduction of 1,400 FTEs. In Belgium we are trying to achieve &#x20AC;150 million savings by 2015, reducing head count by roughly 1,000 full-time equivalents through natural attrition. I will come back on these programs a little bit later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Good progress was made on the restructuring program that we have agreed with the EC. We divested the U.S., ING Direct US, we sold our stake in Capital One, we announced the sale of Insurance Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand, two joint ventures, and the investment management units in Thailand and Malaysia. The U.S. &#x2013; Insurance U.S. filed a registration with the SEC and it's making good progress for later this year for preparation for an IPO.</p>
          <p>We reached an agreement with the European Commission last year including an extended deadline and a solution for the WestlandUtrecht Bank. We have repaid another tranche to the Dutch state making now the total payments already to a total of more than &#x20AC;10 billion and we upswing to an additional &#x20AC;1 billion from the bank to the group in order to reduce the core debt. And at the same time we continue to work on the process in Korea and Japan and continue to work hard on making sure we do the IPO in the U.S. and getting ready in Europe for one as well.</p>
          <p>You can see on slide 6 what this all means for our balance sheet. We reduced the core Tier 1 to 2.25 billion. The core debt of the group is now down to &#x20AC;7 billion. Proceeds from Malaysia were used to redeem a bond, a hybrid, of &#x20AC;1.25 billion in insurance that we called in December. We had to do that to make sure that we can divest the insurance company going forward later.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong and Thailand is expected to close in the first quarter this year. They'll bring in &#x20AC;1.6 billion in proceeds. But we will wait until we have a complete picture, including the sale of the remaining Asian businesses and until we have the solution for the Japanese VA businesses before we will decide how much we can upswing to the group to further reduce the double leverage here.</p>
          <p>And of course we want to make sure that Europe and the U.S. are well capitalized on a standalone basis before we do an IPO. The proceeds from selling Insurance was &#x20AC;27 billion of equity, should be more than sufficient to cover the &#x20AC;7 billion remaining leverage in the group. But everything requires time and I think it's important that we take the time to execute as well.</p>
          <p>On slide 7 you see that the bank is already meeting most of Basel III and as we had agreed last year on the investor day, the priorities were that we would transition quickly to Basel III, that we would limit our balance sheet growth and RWA growth, that we would execute a balance sheet optimization program, further simplify our business and take a prudent approach to capital and funding given the unstable market conditions. I think we have delivered on all these objectives and priorities, and we are basically meeting Basel III requirements today.</p>
          <p>The core T1 ratio is at 10.4 on a fully loaded basis, exceeding the target that we have set for ourselves of 10%. The LCR is above 100 and the Basel leverage ratio has reached a maximum here of 25%.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet optimization is on track. We have reduced our balance sheet by &#x20AC;137 billion since September 2011, and it's already below the target we have set for 2015, which was &#x20AC;900 billion. Of course mainly because we are selling and have sold assets in ING Direct U.S. and ING Direct in Canada, which accounted for &#x20AC;85 billion of the decline.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits have increased by &#x20AC;30 billion. Customer lending increased primarily in retail banking, although the growth has been quite moderate given the weak economic environment and the reluctance of businesses to invest.</p>
          <p>On slide 9 you see that we have actively reduced our short term funding while at the same time growing our customer deposits and long-term debt. Our professional funding was reduced by &#x20AC;62 billion and customer deposits grew by &#x20AC;30 billion. Long-term funding was increased by &#x20AC;14 billion and it all, I think, has added to strengthening the credit profile of ING Bank. In 2012 we issued &#x20AC;33 billion of debt with a tenure of more than one year compared with &#x20AC;18 billion of long-term debt that matured in 2012.</p>
          <p>On slide 10 we have been transforming the bank securities portfolio into a liquidity book. And that's part of our overall strategy to optimize the balance sheet. We've sold &#x20AC;6 billion of debt securities as part of our planned de-risking program that resulted in &#x20AC;600 million of losses, but it also reduced the risk rated assets by &#x20AC;7 billion. In addition, we sold &#x20AC;3.5 billion of bonds to facilitate the sale of ING Direct U.K. The quality of the portfolio improved substantially and has now a positive revaluation reserve of &#x20AC;1.3 billion. It is more liquid and it is Basel III compliant. So we have basically completed our de-risking of the investment portfolio and of course we will continue to monitor that very closely and should there be any need for action, we will take that.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 you see that 2012 was heavily impacted by de-risking losses and negative credit adjustments for a total of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, and that includes &#x20AC;600 million of losses in de-risking from the portfolio as we explained in the previous slides, while credit adjustments moved from a positive &#x20AC;275 million to a negative &#x20AC;587 million in 2012, as spreads were narrowing.</p>
          <p>On slide 12 operating expense modestly increased by less than &#x20AC;0.1 billion or 0.9%, despite a &#x20AC;0.2 billion of normal cost inflation and again, &#x20AC;0.2 billion, so &#x20AC;200 million, of higher regulatory costs including the Dutch bank tax. So we're able to offset these impacts mainly through the savings program in the Netherlands, which has delivered &#x20AC;162 million in cost savings so far. Market impacts were also lower, reflecting impairments on real estate development.</p>
          <p>Going forward, the plan is to keep the expense levels stable. Between now and 2015, we aim to offset the impact of <mark type="audio gap" /> (12:32) and higher regulatory costs by structural cost savings of about 900 million.</p>
          <p>Benelux retail banking has already pushed forward on operation excellence and mobile banking. They'll result in &#x20AC;400 million of additional cost savings in 2015. Commercial bank review is expected to result in an additional &#x20AC;300 million of cost savings. Procurement initiatives that are underway, we expect that we can get another &#x20AC;200 million per year. And it's important to note that the Dutch government has decided to impose a one-time levy of &#x20AC;1 billion to all the banks that helped to cover the cost of the recent nationalization of SNS, of which the share of ING will be between $300 million and &#x20AC;350 million.</p>
          <p>We talk about cost saving initiatives, but we are striving to simplify the way we work, to streamline the IT and the processes we operate, to adapt the business model to the way customers want to do business with us. That means we are embracing new technologies by customers even faster than we anticipated.</p>
          <p>We saw in the Netherlands that the Internet is already the leading channel, representing more then 60% of sales. Mobile traffic increased from 9 million visits per month to 25 million per month over the course of only one year. And that means that we have to make significant investments in IT to handle the increased traffic and to continue to improve the functionality and the experience that the customer is getting. It also means that we need fewer employees that are needed in call centers and in back-office functions to process these transactions.</p>
          <p>I'll give an example on IT. In <mark type="audio gap" /> (14:34) has de-commissioned already 568 applications out of 1,800 since 2007 and we expect the total IT applications will be cut in half by the end of this year. These are far-reaching improvements in the way that we work and it also means more convenient service to our customers.</p>
          <p>In retail Netherlands we have shown a strong reduction in operating expense over the past five years starting with the merger of ING Bank and Postbank. And as I mentioned earlier, the cost savings program announced in 2011 which is expected to deliver &#x20AC;330 million in cost reductions in 2014 is ahead of schedule, already realized &#x20AC;162 million and the head count has been reduced by more than 1,800 out of the 2,700 we had planned.</p>
          <p>Retail Netherlands is now expanding that program including further streamlining IT, integrating a mobile banking offering and is backed by another &#x20AC;100 million of investments in IT. The second phase is now expected to result in additional cost savings of &#x20AC;100 million per year by 2015 and that is bringing the total to &#x20AC;430 million. Additional head count reduction is 1,400 FTEs, of which 400 are external. And we will create 250 new front office jobs in order to better serve our customers.</p>
          <p>Then in Belgium, slide 16, ING Belgium is accelerating its strategic projects further aligning products and services with the new mobile banking reality there as well because customers have embraced the new technologies much quicker than we had anticipated. The change will result in a reduction of FTEs by 1,000 by the end of 2015 and we can do that fully by natural attrition. And as well we add cost savings of about &#x20AC;150 million at the same time.</p>
          <p>Let's go to Q4 results. Well, you see on slide 18 that the group was &#x20AC;373 million, the bank was &#x20AC;184 million and insurance came in at &#x20AC;296 million, and an underlying result before tax of &#x20AC;272 million. On slide 20 you see the adjusted gross results and if you make all the adjustment of special items that happened in Q4 this year versus Q4 last year, then you see that gross adjusted results were down by 2.2% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>On slide 21 you see what happened to credit adjustments at the commercial bank. <mark type="audio gap" /> (17:39) sizeable numbers. In Q4 the results were impacted by &#x20AC;50 million from negative debt valuations, so DVA, and that has the result of tightening the spreads of our own structured notes. That was coupled with &#x20AC;81 million of credit value adjustments on derivatives that we sell to clients. And normally they move in opposite direction and then they loosely offset each other. But this time they did not.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, you'll see that net interest margin held up well at 133 basis points. And margins on lending were better and we are very strict and formal on our pricing and re-pricing in the commercial bank. Savings margins continued to be under pressure that reflect the impact of low interest rates and also the fact that we had de-risked our portfolio of securities. Total interest result declined by almost <mark type="audio gap" /> (18:40) from a year ago and almost 4% sequentially, mainly as a result of financial markets, effectively have higher liquidity cost and we have lengthened our funding profile and we had lower returns on the bond portfolio because of de-risking and lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Expenses. They look like a significant increase in expenses if you look at the cost income ratio, but expenses were kept flat compared with a year ago, except for the &#x20AC;175 million charged in bank tax. Cost income at 63.4 if you exclude the market impact and the Dutch bank tax and CVA adjustments.</p>
          <p>And I mentioned already that we have a number of programs that will bring &#x20AC;840 million of cost savings for the bank by 2015 of which we have already secured &#x20AC;162 million so far. Risk costs were up by &#x20AC;34 million compared to Q3 and they reflect that fact that we still see a very weak macroeconomic environment. The increase of &#x20AC;34 million was mainly in structured finance and concentrated in a relatively small unit, the acquisition finance book. Risk cost to real estate finance was stable and we expect that we will see elevated risk given the economic climate we are in.</p>
          <p>NPL increased slightly to 2.5 from 2.3 in the previous quarter. Again, here mainly driven by mid-corps, by SMEs, by real estate finance and by leasing. So the same people as before.</p>
          <p>Loan book is well collateralized and provisions have historically exceeded our write-offs. The proportion of <mark type="audio gap" /> (20:44) were the write offs over the past 12 years has been about 40% releases, demonstrating a prudent level of provisioning and a significant cure rate. Coverage ratio as defined as the stock of provisions divided by non-performing loans was 37%. And please note that these ratios are difficult to compare between banks because you see differences in business model, and the rate of re-provision, write off policies and definitions. Our coverage ratio reflects the fact that the loan book is not collateralized. Approximately 80% of the total loan portfolio is asset-based lending, such as mortgages, real estate finance, lease and structured finance.</p>
          <p>The risk cost of real estate remains stable compared to the previous quarter at &#x20AC;103 million. Actual losses in the portfolio remain low, and the non-performing loan rate decreased to 7.6% in the third quarter. The Dutch real estate portfolio is well-diversified. 50% of the total is in the Netherlands, and the overall quality of the portfolio is holding up well, relatively well despite the challenging conditions of the commercial real estate markets. The, as you can see from the top, the book is well diversified. We have almost no exposure to construction finance.</p>
          <p>The average loan-to-value has increased modestly to 73% and we calculate it quite conservatively. And all values were updated versus the second quarter 2012 by ING indexation and based on external indexes and internal observations. We also do back tests compared with actual sales prices based on customer transactions and I think we feel comfortable that we have here a conservative approach to our risk in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Dutch mortgages, the risk costs have increased in recent years and it's mainly driven by a decline in home prices. Write-offs have increased modestly. It's a bit higher foreclosures, but the number of foreclosures are still quite low and the NPL in the mortgage portfolio is now at 1.4%, and that's supported still by a relatively low unemployment rate in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>I think I mentioned already the core Tier 1, 11.9% at the end of Q4, including the repayment that we made to the Dutch state and the upstreaming to the holding company of &#x20AC;1 billion. There is an accounting change for pensions effective January 1, and that is 60 basis points so that will reduce the ratio to 11.3. But then on the next page you see if we fully comply immediately, Basel III, that will decline to 10.4%, still ahead of the target we have, which is the 10%.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have a number of management actions going that we expect to reduce the risk-weighted assets by at least another &#x20AC;18 billion, of which &#x20AC;11 billion was achieved so far to bring the pro forma level to 10.6%.</p>
          <p>When you look at Insurance, on page 33, operating results up by 25%, almost &#x20AC;300 million, a much better investment margin. Compared year-on-year on operating results <mark type="audio gap" /> (24:50) by 15%, with the U.S. at last year, a significant one-time gain by a release of a pension provision. And then the first quarter results improved before tax to &#x20AC;272 million, reflecting lower market related type of impacts.</p>
          <p>Investment margin was better. The rolling average four-month &#x2013; four quarter average was at 135 bps. Investment performance increased to &#x20AC;447 million and there's also included in here a release of a provision for discretionary profit sharing to policy holders in the Netherlands that resulted our assets under management in particular and the retirement services were growing, resulting in higher fees.</p>
          <p>Slide 35 you <mark type="ph" /> see fees (25:51) premium-based revenues were up as to &#x20AC;786 million, up almost 6% compared with a year ago. Mainly due to the U.S., driven by improvements in the equity markets, better in-flow in retirement and higher fees in investment management.</p>
          <p>Technical margin was &#x20AC;118 million and it was equal to last year. We saw a decline in the Benelux, but it was offset by improvements in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Administrative expense, I think, well under control, except when you compare with last year, there was this one-time &#x20AC;45 million non-recurring pension release in the U.S. Eliminating that, expenses were down by 2% so reflecting that we continue to pay good attention to cost control.</p>
          <p>Looking at Europe, results were better. Operating results, a better investment margin here as well and also lower expense. Underlying results continue to be impacted by negative non-operating expense which reflect the volatile markets, also reflecting de-risking and the fact that we are hedging to protect our regulatory capital here. The Benelux had lower sales compared to the fourth quarter of last year, but they were offset by higher sales in our Central and Eastern European units.</p>
          <p>We had good results in the U.S., slide 38. Operating results a little bit down, but we explained that already as the one-time charge. Otherwise they would have been up by 15%, a good performance as strong CMO revaluations where private equity returns were a little bit negative last year.</p>
          <p>The previous quarter also included &#x20AC;173 million of net favorable DAC unlocking. Sales were up almost 19% and 21% compared to Q3 and that was mainly because of retirement sales, a little bit offset by lower sales in our Life business.</p>
          <p>The VA block also had improved results. Underlying result came in at &#x20AC;136 million. It reflects gains we made on the hedges as equity markets declined in this quarter, it creates a gain on the portfolio of hedges. Reserve adequacy improved to the 72% confidence level and that means that even if we have a 25% downward shock, we still have reserves that are adequate.</p>
          <p>The focus continues to be on capital protection and to make sure that we have positive <mark type="audio gap" /> (28:55) IFRS P&amp;L and the positive variance to be expected in the sensitivities in the quarter was driven by market out-performance of the underlying funds.</p>
          <p>And then the final slide on the U.S. progressing on the capital position, capitalization improved again this quarter. RBC ratio at 531%. The U.S. would like to have a debt to capital ratio of 25% and also like to redeem the special contingent capital letter of credit that it has from the ING Bank before it goes into an IPO. Last week they did a very successful capital market transaction, issued $1 billion of debt at very attractive spreads. So we're quite pleased with the performance of the U.S. and the improved capital structure that it has been able to accomplish.</p>
          <p>So as a summary, the results held up well, underlying net profit for the group of &#x20AC;2.6 billion. At the same time, we took significant action to de-risk and restructure &#x2013; de-risk our balance sheets and to make sure that our businesses are prepared for the new future.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to open it up for questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> The first question comes from Michael van Wegen from Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Morning, guys. Mike van Wegen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. First question would be, earnings outlook for the Benelux retail bank. Can you talk us through how you see net interest income developing there going forward, taking into count the savings rate adjustment that you've put in place in Q1, and also how you see the loan loss provisioning developing for 2013? So that's question one.</p>
          <p>The second question, on the disposal program, can you talk us through, first of all, Japan, what alternatives are you considering and, B, you're talking with the U.S. IPO now about timing-wise later this year. I think previously you said that you potentially should be ready from Q2 onward. Is there a change there in language? Or how should we look at that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The latter one is pretty simple. We have not changed our timing for the U.S. IPO. We are preparing them as quickly as we can, and you can see that in the way that they are progressing on the capital structure but also on the filings they have done on the S-1. So there's language that I think later this year is later than today, huh? But we will do it, the markets are ready basically for us.</p>
          <p>Japan, we're working diligently on alternatives in Japan. We have a number, but I don't think we are at this moment at liberty to discuss them. Only can say that, it requires a lot of discussion with local regulators in Japan, and we've been working on two or three different alternatives, but we are not ready yet to go forward with it.</p>
          <p>On the Benelux retail, Patrick, you want to do net income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you asked about the interest margin in the Benelux. If you look at the interest margin overall, as Jan mentioned, it's held up pretty well at 133 basis points. It declined in aggregate <mark type="audio gap" /> (33:01) in &#x2013; partly in financial markets and also due to the lengthening of the funding profile, which comes with an additional cost. That was offset by reducing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:12) in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The things we've seen before pertained again in Q4. We've seen a mild strengthening in commercial banking margins where we continue to apply discipline. I mean that applies &#x2013; that discipline applies across the total bank in Netherlands as well and Benelux as well. And on the weakness has been on the deposit side, where the declining interest rates have hurt margins and deposits.</p>
          <p>That said, in January and February of this year we've cut deposit rates in the Netherlands by &#x2013; twice by 10 basis points and in Germany by 25. So the outlook for the net interest margin overall, and it will also apply in Benelux, is to stabilize by virtue of <mark type="ph" /> a reduction (34:03) in pressure we see on deposits and the ability to reduce them. Longer term, we remain committed to the longer-term targets of 140, 145, which we will aim to achieve by a continued focus on discipline in loan pricing. But we also need a little bit of help from growth in the economy to add some volume on the lending side to interest margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've been saying for a while that we expected risk costs to remain at elevated levels and indeed, Q4 showed that as well. And looking forward and your question being specifically about the Benelux business, if you look at what went on in Q4, developments that we expect to continue with softness in the business lending, the SME mid-corps book, the real estate finance book and also we expect that the mortgage portfolio in the Netherlands, as you've seen, the NPLs, showed another mild uptick, but it does keep going up. So we also see potential for indeed continued elevated risk cost there. So that's the outlook.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Farooq Hanif from Citi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you can hear me, just two questions on the insurance business, if I can, please. Firstly, just want to understand the improvement in investment margin that you had because of the release of the discretionary profit sharing within Q4. I mean is this something that could happen every fourth quarter or should we just assume that your underlying guidance of investment margin declining in Benelux will continue from here? Could you please explain that?</p>
          <p>Second question is, just on the RBC ratio in the U.S. Apologies if you've already answered this in your literature, but what would happen to the 531% ratio if you <mark type="audio gap" /> (36:06) that letter of credit? Does it affect it? And also presumably the debt that you've been able to raise recently in the U.S., presumably that doesn't count towards the RBC ratio. Can you confirm that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will just stay with the U.S. one first. The difference between the 531% and the 425% is about $1.5 billion, which conveniently is somewhere similar to where the CCLOC is. It's a little bit more complex than that because the CCLOC supports the offshore entity, which is measured on a <mark type="ph" /> CT-95 (36:47) overall aggregate basis. But what we've been saying is that our target is a minimum of 425% RBC and we want to upstream capital to the holding company with a view to distributing it and ideally we would like to redeem the CCLOC, which if we did, would have to be replaced in cash. And the final part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Debt level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The debt issuance is debt, it's not capital. It's part of the funding profile and will contribute to the overall funding and sits within the maximum 25% leverage ratio that applies in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically what you're saying is you don't really need a lot more capital in the U.S. because you'll still be above target if you repay today, but you're just waiting for the right time. Is that what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean you talk about &#x2013; and I &#x2013; Jan mentioned, when you IPO companies, you need adequate capital. So you might need a buffer as well. So like we said last time around, it's maybe &#x2013; it's nearly there, but maybe not quite there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that's a discussion we will have to have with the investment banks by the time we go to market. So I think it's a little premature now, but we'll see what comes up.</p>
          <p>Your question on the discretionary release is the following. We make accruals for that during the year, but at the end of the year the management has the ability to decide whether to pay that, yes or no. And this time the discretionary decision was that we don't pay that, given the overall results of the Benelux organization.</p>

          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Just one question from me. With regards to the U.S. IPO, more recently we've seen some variable annuity block transactions with suggestions there's possibly more to come. Could just a transaction be an option for ING U.S.? Or realistically given the IPO timetable, would it have to go with the VA book <mark type="audio gap" /> (39:11) presumably? In particular, actually, could I also ask how separable is the legacy business in terms of legal entities? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say in principle we are looking at all the options that are there, including selling the VA block separately, but also including it in the IPO. So nothing will be excluded, but basically is used to be the IPO. And I did not get the question on the legacy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The legacy question was actually just with regards to legal entities, i.e. is the variable annuity book within a separate legal entity and therefore immediately separable?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions going back to the Netherlands and the asset quality. I know you've given guidance of still mild deterioration going into 2013. Can you just give us &#x2013; you've provided us very helpfully a stress test last year. Do you have an update on the mortgages, for example, on increase in unemployment, decline in house prices, which seems to be faster right now, what your losses potentially would be in that scenario?</p>
          <p>And then if you can give us just a couple of data. What is now your LTV for your mortgage book in the Netherlands on the retail side, if you can give us an update? And also overall, what is your updated reserve coverage? You said 37% on a comparable basis, how was that the last quarter and how you're expecting that to trend. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To start with your question on the stress test. I mean, the portfolio is fairly stable, it hasn't really changed in either composition or size since we did this last. So there is not really any significant development there. And we're still very comfortable that we're adequately provisioned for the book as it stands.</p>
          <p>Your question with regard to the cover ratio, it's hovering around 38%, between 37% and 38% already for a while and that is a reflection of a very prudent provisioning process where we make the best estimate of expected losses on the NPLs. And I don't see a particular trend there. We do these assessments every quarter for the larger chunks in the portfolio, on a case-by-case basis. And this is the outcome of our best assessment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then for the LTV of your retail mortgage book in the Netherlands and if you could give us a number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry. I missed that one. The last quarter number was 89% for the Dutch mortgages and that was up 1% from the 88% it was in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have the percentage of your mortgage book that has an LTV already above 100%, if you could disclose that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not a number we track or disclose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much and just going back for a second to your stress test, if I remember correctly and I've got a slide here, and please correct me if I'm not right. You were stress testing with effectively a 15% reduction in house prices &#x2013; sorry, 25% reduction in house pricing, and 10% unemployment as a peak. The unemployment probably still seems quite high. Do you think the 25% reduction in house pricing given what we have seen already in the last few quarters of 2012 is still sufficiently conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we think it is. And when you look at it from the peak, we're already down 16 and certainly our house view is that we will continue to see some declines in the next two years, but not to the level that the stress test suggests. And looking at unemployment, again, it is trending up, but nowhere near the levels that we're taking into account in that stress test. So we think overall we're well within the range that that test was considering.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. First of all, just following on again, your comments about the strong standalone balance sheets for the U.S. and Europe that you made on slide 6, thanks for what you said on the U.S., but I wondered if you're thinking that there's any further action that may need to be taken in Europe with regards to total capital or the mix between capital and debt.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, to the extent that the strategic review of commercial banking is ongoing, <mark type="audio gap" /> (44:18) that you're sort of thinking additionally to what you told us back in the third quarter? Again, you're referring to sort of future potential changes in the future. Or is the basic picture you gave us at the end of September still what stands there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the commercial banking review, I think, is ongoing, but I don't anticipate, let's say, significant adjustments here. We have basically done what we wanted to do already and announced it last time.</p>
          <p>With respect to the balance sheet, yeah, by the time you go to market and by the time you split up your business, you need more capital. If you have capital at one level, it's more efficient to have it at one place than if you have it at three, four different places. So you always will have regulatory questions related to capital and the only thing we wanted to make sure is that we say keep it into your minds when you look at our numbers. Plus, in particular in Europe, we have no idea which way solvency will go. We had a Solvency II regime that was worked on for some time and that is off the table today. So there was an uncertainty what the capital requirements will be and the capital frame will be that companies will have to live by.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; you said there was some billion more risk weighted asset reduction to come? Can you say how much revenue will decline as a result of that? Presumably the revenue decline we're seeing is coming because you're reducing your balance sheet. So &#x20AC;11 billion seems to equate at about &#x20AC;200 million, and I wonder if &#x20AC;7 billion would then equate to &#x20AC;150 million? I don't know if that makes sense.</p>
          <p>And then asking Will Hawkins <mark type="ph" /> question (46:22) again, so the shareholders equity in Insurance is &#x20AC;27.3 billion. It was &#x20AC;25 billion in September. What's the actual requirement to run this business? Is it &#x20AC;27 billion, is it &#x20AC;30 billion, is it &#x20AC;20 billion? And I know you kind of hedged the &#x2013; you didn't really &#x2013; you said you don't know. But you certainly have a better idea than I do. Is there a number we can have here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the RWA reductions, part of that can be simply non-P&amp;L sensitive, such as netting and balance sheet optimization. And some of it could be run off. We've already said we were going to prioritize our leasing business and some of them &#x2013; or those will be run off. I think that's already wrapped into the guidance we've already given you.</p>
          <p>Within that framework we still fundamentally believe we will achieve our 10% to 15% <mark type="audio gap" /> (47:23) 2015. So it has no bearing on achieving those targets.</p>
          <p>Yeah. Capital requirement in Europe, Solvency II, we don't know what it is, but clearly there's the Solvency I ratio there and yeah, we currently meet &#x2013; obviously meet the requirements on Solvency I in each of the entities we're in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. I have two questions relating to the bank, please. Firstly I wanted to refer to slide 13 and your revised cost target 2015 of &#x20AC;8.8 billion. That's broadly in line with the &#x20AC;8.9 billion target <mark type="audio gap" /> (48:26) at the January 2012 investor day, and that's despite an extra &#x20AC;0.4 billion of cost savings. So I was just interested, and I mean part of that seems to be a higher starting point, but also the procurement initiative has declined from &#x20AC;0.5 billion to &#x20AC;0.2 billion. So I'm just interested to know what moving parts are there on the cost side?</p>
          <p>Second question just pertaining to asset quality, it would be very useful if you could please provide the coverage ratios for the eight bucket that you identify in slide 25, and if you could also just highlight any significant moves that there were during the quarter? I know you said at group level it had been broadly stable. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect to the costs, first of all the &#x20AC;500 million we announced previously was procurement and other &#x2013; and part of the other is what we've announced both in Q3 and Q4. We will continue to manage cost diligently.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second point, I think what we've said at the investor day that we would try to absorb the impact of regulatory changes and inflation. What we've got now with the &#x20AC;880 million additional cost saves that Jan referred to in the slide by 2015 is we're actually bringing it slightly below that, and we're aiming to reduce costs a little more in light of the weakness in revenues that we've seen. So it's a smaller business as well, due to the divestments. So we still believe that we can achieve the 10% to 15% ROE.</p>
          <p>You also need to remember that the income is depressed. Yes, it's depressed in the bank, look at some of the reasons. In 2012 we had &#x20AC;600 million cost due to de-risking exercise. That program is finished. So that cost program will not recur. That's not to say we will not be diligent in de-risking. CVA/DVA was a whopping &#x20AC;600 million for 2012. So there's been some big one-off impacts there that have brought costs &#x2013; our revenues artificially lower &#x2013; non-recurringly low is maybe a better way to put it.</p>
          <p>Interest margin, as I said before, we still believe we can get it to 140, 145. I won't repeat that. The balance sheet, we said we'd keep it around 900. It's actually below that and as Jan mentioned we're ticking the box on Basel III fully-loaded. We're ticking the box on LCR and we're ticking the box on leverage ratio. So we don't have to do extra to achieve those. The cost income ratio is high, 63 as we mentioned but largely because of that we are tackling that with these initiatives that have been announced of &#x20AC;880 million by 2015.</p>
          <p>And then finally the risk costs which were another part of the program, they're elevated today. Average for the year is 73. The target in the normalized basis is 40, 45. So when you add all that up we still believe that the 10% to 15% ROE by 2015 is achievable.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Taking the main buckets from Slide 25 that you referred to: residential mortgages is about 20%, stable from last quarter; corporate loans 51%, slightly, slightly down from previous quarter; leasing, 31%; <mark type="ph" /> the other (51:50) 24%; real estate finance 35%; SME mid-corps 42%; and structured finance 38%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions please. The first one on the insurance. I just wondered whether the 132 basis points investment spread on the four quarter rolling average was sustainable? And basically just wanted to understand what drove the improvement there and what the outlook would be for the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the bank. If you look at basically the pre-tax underlying profits adjusted for one-offs, you get to about &#x20AC;700 million this quarter. I just wanted to know if you see this as a representative level for what we can expect in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things. On the 132 basis points, that included the benefit we had one-time in the discretionary release in the Netherlands. So you should <mark type="audio gap" /> (53:34). I think in general we have seen positive development in the U.S. but we show more assets under management, equity markets being up, that had an impact on the fees so that there was a plus. On the other hand, I think you will see a bit of a decline in the Netherlands and that will certainly offset that. So I would think that this might be a little bit lower going forward. And then on the bank side, Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean I think you also &#x2013; you have rightly added up the impact of the de-risking, the impact of the CVA/DVA and the bank tax, which are hitting in the fourth quarter. But you &#x2013; but that's not the only thing, you also got to remember that this is seasonally, a very low quarter. If you look back over our results for a number of years, you'll see fourth quarter's the lowest typically financial markets. It starts low &#x2013; starts high, and then into the cadence throughout the year and we expect that pattern to sustain. So Q4 is typically a low quarter. I would not say that's representative of the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And basically the pace of loan loss provisioning is something that you could see going on in 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Loan loss provisioning, yeah, I think Wilfred mentioned already that this could stay elevated.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. I just had a question on the mortality tables in the Netherlands. I was wondering, in terms of the provision that you guys made 15 years ago, how much of that is left? And how does that compare against what you expect the impact is of this new mortality table? And then just in addition to that, do you have any large contracts coming up for renewal? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think starting at the end, in terms of how this develops, I think it's something that we have a portion of the business that comes up every year. I think there's been a trend continuing toward defined contribution plans, which impacts exactly how this will play. There's also been an impact of how these decisions are being made by clients. So in terms of exactly how this will develop, we're not really &#x2013; cannot make projections exactly because there's still a lot of pieces that are moving and the way this can play out. In terms of a figure, the best I can do is point you to the ending Life report from a year ago, which showed the reserve at &#x20AC;385 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Jan Willem Weidema of ABN AMRO. First question, I'm just saying, your own position &#x2013; have your own thoughts of those, of the supervisory board's or the Dutch Central Bank changed following the news surrounding SNS Reaal? That's one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, are you satisfied with your current maturity profile for funding?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, are you considering issuing relatively more secure debt for your funding needs in 2013 and 2014, given what's happening to your unsecured debt yields?</p>
          <p>And finally, the non-life result in Q4 was up quite significantly sequentially. Can you indicate whether that result is sustainable or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did not fully understand the question with my position at SNS. I don't think I work there. I work at ING. So I don't think that has any bearing. And my position is that I have a contract until the annual meeting and the supervisory board decides on my contract and on my succession and I think we will leave it with that. Until they have decided I have nothing to add.</p>
          <p>Then you had a question on the funding. Patrick, you want to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you asked about funding. Last year, as we said in the slide, we issued &#x20AC;33 billion of debt with a tenor of more than one year, which compared to &#x20AC;18 billion which is maturing, so significantly exceeded the funding requirement last year. We're a regular player in the program in the markets. We have diversified our funding profiles from public bonds. We tapped the Japanese yen market. So we have a diversified program, do RMBS as well. We've done some of that recently this year. I think you can expect us to continue.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Beno&#xEE;t P&#xE9;trarque from Kepler. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just on the net interest margin, the first question. Do you think the savings rate decrease you have done in 2013 will be enough to offset the impact of the low interest rate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:05) 2013? You have now a large debt security pot for you, which is rather liquid. So I guess average yield would come further down in 2013? So that's question number one. And maybe you could go through the different operations and tell us where you think you can further decrease the savings rate in 2013?</p>
          <p>And then the question number two is on the commercial bank. Yeah volumes were down sharply in the fourth quarter. I think total loans were actually down 4.5% in just one quarter. Just wondering where it comes from, what geographies and what was <mark type="audio gap" /> (59:45) outlook for 2013 on volumes, how you're going to further decrease your loan book on the commercial bank.</p>
          <p>And sorry to come back on the funding profile lengthening, but are you done now with the lengthening? I mean are you happy with the current maturity of the debt or are you going to further work on this issue in 2013? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In terms of the net interest margin, the reductions we've seen in Germany, 25 basis points, two sets of 10 in the Netherlands and there was some in late Q4 as well. We think that should lead to a more &#x2013; a stabilization of the interest margin, and if I go back a quarter I think that's what we guided to and it sort of happened a bit. It may have come out one basis point different. So in the near-term we think that's &#x2013; in the very near-term it should lead to some stabilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The commercial bank was a bit down, but we don't anticipate that that will continue. In fact we anticipate that we will step up our lending and one big item in that lending profile had to do with we were taking deposits away that we had with the Central Bank, European Central Bank. Funding profile &#x2013; Patrick, one more time or Wilfred?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the funding profile, yeah I think, as I said, we've done a lot. We've got it into a good position, and there obviously will be maturities so you'll need to replace them in due course.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Good morning. You mentioned in your report that there's no dividends until all remaining Dutch state is repaid and you meet your regulatory capital requirements. Can you just remind me what these regulatory capital requirements are to meet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. First of all, as long as we are a group and we still have insurance in our portfolio, we also have to look for other requirements in the insurance company and that's why we have an uncertainty related to what are they exactly, in particular in the Netherlands where we don't know exactly where Solvency II will end up.</p>
          <p>Regulatory requirements more and more you see that before you can pay dividends, regulators will have to give you also approval for that, and that is basically a caution that we have given to you. That even if we expressed that we want to, we also need to make sure that we don't have an issue with our regulators.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Two questions, please. First on Alt-A, there is a Bloomberg headline that a sale of the portfolio triggered an interesting gain for ING. Could you be a bit more specific here on what the P&amp;L and capital implications could be from any sale at current market prices?</p>
          <p>And then second on the, to come back on the investment margins in insurance on the outlook, you mentioned that you would expect a further erosion in spreads. Was this relative to the 130 basis points including the provisional release? Or would you expect an underlying deterioration from current Q4 level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't know where Bloomberg gets the gain from. We have indicated that if the government would sell their portfolio today based on what we know the prices are, that we think that they would make a gain. All that we will do is we will reduce some of the risk weighted assets we have based on the guarantee that our, in a small portion related to this Alt-A but we have not commented on ING making a gain. The other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Investment margin in insurance, further spread erosion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, go ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the investment spreads, it's of course difficult to predict the future. We have indicated that there is some pressure not only in the Benelux but also in the rest of the countries in Europe. I guess that if you look at the four quarter rolling average and you see some decrease from there, that would be itself an indication for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you mean a decrease from the current reported level including the provision reversal or excluding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excluding. So you should adjust the amount of the profit sharing, the &#x20AC;51 million, and then basically there is a trend there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from Anke Reingen from Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. I had two questions please. The first on the bank <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:04:52). I just wondered how often do you go into the review in the bank's capital for potential to upstream capital to the group? Is this going to be like an annual process? Or how should we think about it?</p>
          <p>And then do you think the SNS development will have any impact on the supervisory in terms of how residential and commercial mortgages are risk weighted?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly, sorry, on the cost income ratio target you have a 50% to 53% I mean by 2015. Clearly in the current revenue environment it looks probably more challenging. So will you do more on costs? Or is the target of 50% to 53% basically not set at the moment as long as revenues remain depressed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On capital and upstreaming from the bank, we look at that on a regular basis. But we cannot say that we have formal <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:05:54). It is done on a regular &#x2013;  based on capability. And of course we do that in good consultation with our regulator, because they will have to take a look at that as well.</p>
          <p>Cost income, our targets still are that we want to be at 50% to 53% by 2015, and the steps we are taking to reduce another &#x20AC;1 billion of expense that we have announced today is a big step in that direction.</p>
          <p>Revenues, yeah, I simply also would like to see our revenues increase and if the economy begins to improve, it certainly will have an impact on revenues as well, at the same time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just I have one question, please. On the risk weightings, do you think that your supervisor will take a more conservative approach on risk weighting of mortgages or commercial real estate as a result of developments at SNS? Or is there no discussions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you talk about residential mortgage, would be unlikely, because there were not all a major factor or even a factor at all in the whole SNS saga. What was the case was &#x2013; and that comment was made by the central bank at the time of the announcement of the nationalization is that the commercial real estate book of SNS was described as one that was uniquely problematic. And indeed if you look at public information about that book, it is very different from what most other banks would have on their books at this point. So and again, the problem was more under provisioning and less credit on the writing standards than a specific risk weighting issue. So a direct connection between that and an adjustment of risk weightings, we do not quite see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Lemer Salah from SNS Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions from my side. First of all, on slide 13, can you maybe give us a breakdown of the &#x20AC;800 million, which you have reserved for the inflation and investments? I'm just wondering, because I mean it seems that the investments are for the next upcoming years will be <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:07:57) also considering that IT systems will decline by 50% in 2013.</p>
          <p>And my second question is with regard to the Alt-A portfolio. Let's presume that the Dutch state wants to sell this item. How much capital will be released and what will you do with that capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What we have done with the &#x20AC;800 million inflation is we have looked at, let's say labor contracts, which are the main reason for inflation. We have looked at normal cost inflation that you see in energy and all type of cost categories. And that's how we have come to this increase of &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>One of the targets that we have &#x2013; yeah, there's a 2.5%, 2% to <mark type="ph" /> 2.5% (1:08:58) increase. One of the targets and objectives of course is, can we make that less? And part of that is by smarter purchasing. You see that we do a &#x20AC;200 million reduction in purchasing expense, procurement, but maybe there are other ways that we can deal with that as well. It certainly is an item that we will put on the agenda and have on the agenda to constantly watch our exposure to inflation.</p>
          <p>And then your question on the Dutch state, will they sell the Alt-A portfolio, was that the question?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a question still on the Alt-A. I think if the state is selling the Alt-A, we will be able to release about &#x20AC;2 billion of risk-weighted assets that we have as a guarantee on the portfolio that the Dutch state still has. It's a small guarantee, but it's about <mark type="ph" /> &#x20AC;2 billion (1:10:00), maybe a little bit more, &#x20AC;2 billion risk-rated assets.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a question regarding asset quality. So basically could you please tell us what the level of renegotiated loans? This is an item which &#x2013; on which I couldn't see any figure and the last time I could &#x2013; I was able to see a figure on that was in 2010. It was about &#x20AC;10 billion. So if you could give me some color on that? And how this has evolved? And which type of loans are the most concerned? That would be great.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this will come in more detail in the annual report. I think if you are talking about our watch list, which I suspect it is, then we are looking at fourth quarter at an uptick of about &#x20AC;0.5 billion to &#x20AC;14.9 billion.</p>

        <plist>
