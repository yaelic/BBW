          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the presentation of Hennes &amp; Mauritz Full Year Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode until we conduct the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to today's chairperson Nils Vinge, Head of IR. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello everyone, and welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's full-year and fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen and our Head of Communications, Kristina Stenvinkel, are with me today and we will answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to the fourth quarter, I'd like to make a brief comment on the start of our new financial year.</p>
          <p>Sales in December and thus far in January have been satisfactory. The positive development should of course be seen in the light of easy comparables particularly for December and the fact that sales have been partly markdown driven.</p>
          <p>That said, we also note that our earliest Christmas collections have been well received.</p>
          <p>In December, sales including VAT increased 16% in local currencies and comparable unit sales increased 3%. From 1st to the 26th of January sales increased 13%, compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide fourth quarter 2009. Sales in the quarter excluding VAT reached 28 billion, an increase of 6% in Swedish kroner and 3% in local currencies, however with great differences between the various markets.</p>
          <p>Sales in comparable units decreased 6%. Sales were negatively affected by restrained consumption in most markets due to continued economic recession and the fact that the market was discount driven.</p>
          <p>The autumn was unseasonably mild, which had a negative effect on sales of weather dependent sales such as jackets and heavy knitwear.</p>
          <p>Gross profit increased 13% to 18.6 billion, corresponding to a gross margin of 66.3%, compared to 62.4% last year. The currency hedging of the market on internal sales to the subsidiaries had a positive effect on the gross margin of 120 basis points, compared to a negative effect of 150 basis points in the fourth quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Among other things, the gross margin was also positively affected by greater surplus capacity at suppliers, more efficient buying process and year-end effects mainly related to lower shrinkage than estimated.</p>
          <p>Increased markdowns had a negative impact on the gross margin of around 50 basis points. Following a review of our currency hedging policy, we've chosen to end the hedging of internal mark-ups with effect from 1st December 2009.</p>
          <p>Forward contracts maturing in the first half year have already been entered. This means that the majority of the internal mark-up for the first quarter is currency hedged, which is expected to have a positive impact on the gross margin based on current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The effect will diminish gradually in the second quarter and disappear thereafter. We've also decided to apply currency hedging for 100% of our flow of goods instead of as previously 90%.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M maintained a good cost control also in the fourth quarter. Selling and administrative expenses were 10.7 billion, up 11% in Swedish kroner and 9% in local currencies, compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year, despite an expansion of as many as 148 new stores net.</p>
          <p>We successfully countered the effect of the recession by keeping a tight rein on costs and adjusted our store operations to the current market situation. Costs in comparable stores decreased from last year. Operating profit for the quarter rose 16% to 7.9 billion corresponding to an operating margin of 28.2%. Profit after financial item reached close to eight billion, a rise of 12% from the year before.</p>
          <p>Net profit increased to just about 6.1 billion corresponding to earnings per share of 7.44 kroner. Sales, excluding VAT, rose to about 101 billion, an increase of 15% from the year before. Including VAT, sales increased 14%. In local currencies the increase was 4%. Comparable unit sales decreased 5%. Gross profit was 62.5 billion and the gross margin increased 10 basis points to 61.6%. We maintained a good cost control throughout the year, keeping sales and administrative expenses low, despite the largest expansion in number of stores in the history of H&amp;M thus far.</p>
          <p>Costs were 40.8 billion, compared to 34.3 billion a year before. The operating margin was 21.3% in the year of weak sales developments. Net financial items amounted to 459 million, a reduction by half, compared to the previous year and the direct result of lower interest rates. Still, profit after financial item rose by close to one billion to 22.1 billion.</p>
          <p>With a new reduced Swedish corporate tax rate, the tax rate for the Group was 25.9%. Profit after tax rose 7% to 16.4 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of 19.80, compared to 18.48 the year before. The recession increased the supply of good store locations in 2009 and made it possible for H&amp;M to sign more contracts than originally planned and at favorable terms. Therefore, we opened as many as 250 stores net, considerably more than the 225 planned at the start of the year.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter alone we opened 159 new stores. The majority of the openings took place in Germany, UK, the U.S., France and Italy. We closed 11 stores. H&amp;M is now present in 35 markets with 1,988 stores, of which 36 franchise at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Germany, our by far largest market with sales of more than 30 billion Swedish kroner and 262 stores for the full year, continued its solid and profitable growth. In contrast, the situation in the three large markets, the U.S., Spain and France was tough last year.</p>
          <p>We continue our expansion in these markets, however, and see many new and exciting opportunities for H&amp;M.</p>
          <p>In France, we opened 21 new stores during the year and refurbished a large flagship store on Boulevard Haussmann. In Spain, we opened 15 new stores and although sales development in comparable stores was weak, profitability was <mark type="inaudible" />. In the U.S., we opened 20 new stores during the year and refurbished the Fifth Avenue flagship store. The first stores in Florida and Arizona opened during the year.</p>
          <p>Sweden developed well last year with sales up to &#x2013; up 10% in the autumn. Meanwhile in the UK, the development was decent with higher sales in local currency, a weak earning however had a negative impact on profitability and growth translated into SEK.</p>
          <p>China and Japan both had a good year. We entered China only two and half years ago and opened our first stores in Japan, a little more than one year ago. Sales reached 2.7 billion Swedish kroner in these two countries combined last year and our expansion continues.</p>
          <p>China is among the markets where we are expanding the most number of stores already in 2010. After the successful start in Russia last spring, sales continued developing well. At the end of 2009, we had four stores in Moscow and one in St. Petersburg.</p>
          <p>And now some &#x2013; a few words on some key figures. The stock-in-trade increased 20% to 10.2 billion, compared to the same time the previous year. Approximately half of the increase was due to the expansion and the remaining part mainly due to the weak sales during the autumn.</p>
          <p>As sales were weak during the fourth quarter, the stock-in-trade for the 30th of November contains a larger proportion of mainly weather dependent garments compared to the same time a year before. This will lead to larger markdowns during the first quarter 2009, 2010, compared to the first quarter of last year. In relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 10.1%. Historically, it's still a good level.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations was approximately 18 billion, about the same level as the year before. Investments amounted to 5.7 billion kroner, which is a lower level per store than the year before. 2010 investments are expected to reach slightly more than six billion.</p>
          <p>Our finances remain very strong, liquid funds and short-term investments were 22 billion. The Board of Directors will propose at the Annual General Meeting a dividend of 16 kroner per share corresponding to 81% of net profit for the year. Return on equity was 42.2%, compared to 44.3 last year.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M maintains a very positive view on the opportunities for future expansion. Our target remains to increase the number of stores by 10 to 15% per year and continue to drive profitability. We plan to open around 240 stores net in 2010. The plan includes 12 COS stores and 25 new Monki and Weekday stores. The expansion will take place in all our markets, with the majority of the openings in the U.S., UK, China, France, Germany and Italy.</p>
          <p>We are opening our first store in South Korea on the 27th of February in Seoul. We view South Korea as an exciting market that offers great potential with its many fashion interested people and its strong purchasing power. We see good growth potential also in our other large Asian markets, China and Japan.</p>
          <p>Israel will become a new franchise market this spring. Moreover, we will expand our Internet sales to the UK in the autumn of this year. This will also make H&amp;M Home available to our British customers. The development of COS, Monki and Weekday is going according to plan. This spring, we will open the first Monki and Weekday stores in Finland and the first Monki store in the Netherlands in Amsterdam.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, finally, we want to say that despite tough market conditions, we delivered strong results for 2009. Clearly, we were not happy with the sales development during 2009. And even though sales in the first quarter of 2010 has started well, we focus strongly on our target to increase sales in comparable units with continued high profitability.</p>
          <p>Experiences that we have gained during the recession are of great value for us, as we continue working for further improvements. We are looking at all parts of our business, everything from assortment mix, logistics and marketing to store design and how we display our garments. We are increasing efficiency in our buying and production processes, which will generate gains that we will invest in order to further improve our customer offer. This may involve lower prices, but it could also mean more fashion and quality at the same price.</p>
          <p>We still look at our markets with great respect for the economic development. And our strong business concepts has proven profitable, also at times of tough market conditions. We will continue to expend to new markets and see room to grow in existing markets, as well as to develop our new formats COS, H&amp;M Home, Monki and Weekday.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And we're now happy to take your questions. Hello?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Karen Howland from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I was wondering &#x2013; I mean the gross margin improvement obviously was very impressive, the 400 basis points. I know you talked about the hedging being a positive 120, the markdown being negative 50, so netting about 300 or so. That's I guess buying and/or additional sourcing capacity.</p>
          <p>I was wondering if you could give some color as far as, is that sustainable? If we should expect that same sort of improvement going forward or if this was somehow a one-off this quarter that shouldn't be repeated in the next quarter? And how you actually were able to get those sort of a benefit &#x2013; those sort of benefits and the magnitude of benefits that we saw? Kind of one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As you mentioned, the main components affecting the gross margin in the fourth quarter was the internal hedging of the mark-ups. And of course there are other things with a positive effect like surplus capacity of the suppliers and also some efficiency to the increased efficiencies in our own buying processes. And also, there is year-end effect, which is relating to the shrinkage. It was less than we have been calculating for during the year. So, of course we don't want to go into more detail when it comes to our own measures that we have done. For competitive reasons, we want to keep that for ourself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the efficiency improvement, there is no reason to think that this was any sort of a one-off that would be this quarter. It should continue going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we believe that some of the efficiency things we have done in the buying process will continue. But of course, as we've many times said, there are so many different factors affecting the gross margin. So, there are positive things and negative. So, of course we think that these efficiencies we have done will remain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain from Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, afternoon gents. Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just had a question on the &#x2013; on your inventory position at the end of the year. How much of the 20% increase was related to currency and how much to expansion effect, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Currency effect on the stock-in-trade at the year-end, it's around 1%. And as Nils said it &#x2013; the half of the increase approximately is due to expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Half due to expansion. Okay, thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Peter Farren from Bryan, Garnier. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. So, then my one question will be on the quantification of the internal hedging impact on the gross margin assuming that FX rates as they are today, if you could quantify the Q1 and the Q2 impact, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't want to quantify it in absolute figure or a percentage. But with the current exchange rates, we are estimating that the effects will be positive in the first quarter this year and a little bit less positive in Q2, and then they will be done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I have a quick another one, if I don't have an answer. It's on the CapEx. You're guiding for six billion for 2010, which is higher than 2009, yet you're opening a lower number of stores and the FX should be a little more favorable. Is there any explanation for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in the CapEx, it's not just the store openings, there are other things as well in the CapEx such as strategic investments in IT et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, they will increase, okay.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Fraser Ramzan from Nomura, London. Please go ahead ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Yes, could I ask a question about the long list of improvements you said you were going to be continually making to your offer? I think you said assortment, logistics, marketing, design, buying efficiencies, reinvestment in price, quality and fashion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Impressive, isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, of course, I'm sure you're always busy working on those, but clearly in some of your key markets, like the U.S. last year, your like for like was down more than I think might be just purely explained by the economy. So, what should we expect to see happening in your stores?</p>
          <p>And I appreciate you don't make big step changes and everything is incremental in part of the mix and all that kind of thing. But do you feel you need lower prices in some places and is that significant enough that you actually want to make a comment about it like you have today? Or do you feel &#x2013; and do you feel you really do need perhaps a slightly higher proportion of fashion in some places? And I appreciate it's a quantum, it's a continuum, and you're always doing these things, but you went to a great length to list, lots and lots of things you thought might be defected with your offer at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a long question. But, yes, I can confirm that we look at all the &#x2013; all of those things always actually. But of course in a weak year like this, we put even more focus on improving the customer offer, and that could of course vary from market to market. And if you strip out the pricing, that is of course very important and in some markets it's more important than others. But we will invest in even a stronger offering to the customer and that is already &#x2013; you can see it already in the stores today.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Robert Miller from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's actually on a similar theme. Can you tell us what your price positioning is relative to last year going into the new season and particularly in some of these new markets where you've been &#x2013; you've underperformed the local market particularly badly like France and Spain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Robert, we don't give any guidance going forward when it comes to pricing. We don't want to give that out to the competitors. But I promised you that we --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see your prices, Nils.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but why tell them in advance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In which case, can I ask you a different question relating to costs? Your average number of full-time employees was basically flat year-on-year which is an astonishing performance given the amount of physical growth in the company. Can you tell us a bit about what the phasing was of the significant like for like reduction in employees and what the outlook is therefore for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we have mentioned, we have a good cost control in our comparable stores and also we have been talking about the flexibility we have in planning the staff hours in our stores. And this is simply relating to that we are using a lot of extra staffs for weekends, evenings, peak selling periods, et cetera. And of course with this weak sales development that we have had that we haven't had the same need for those hours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it's fair to assume that it was weighted broadly with the degree of weakness in your like for like sales through the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And do you think that going back to your predecessors often guidance that cost to sales ratio of 37 to 38% was sensible for your business. Do you think the business is headed back to that ratio in the near term? Do you have a <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have had a lot of focus on the ratio. And as we have said, we have a really good cost control and we are confident that we will work really good with our cost in the future as well. And as you see in absolute figures, the increase in SG&amp;A expenses is purely relating to the expansion and in comparable stores we have decreased the expenses. So, of course it's also &#x2013; yeah, a matter of top line. If the selling is with us, so of course the ratio will look better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Fred Bjelland from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. My question is quite similar to Robert's. It's &#x2013; basically you've now had two consecutive years of decent gross margin expansion, yet your EBIT margin is going down, and I think you're touching on the OpEx ratios. But is there a certain level of like for like that you think is necessary to get operating leverage back in the model? And presumably, if the gross margin stays at similar levels, I mean where &#x2013; when would you expect to get that kind of operating leverage through?</p>

          <p>It's a very difficult question. We don't look at it really that way, but I mean we always try for a positive like for like, and this year unfortunately we haven't succeeded. But if we do that, I'm sure we will continue to grow in a profitable way.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And going back to the OpEx, even a situation with tough conditions, we can present a strong result. So we are not focusing so much on the ratios when it comes to OpEx. We have a good cost control and --</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean it's a fairly generic answer. But I mean ultimately over the last three years you've delivered like for likes of five minus one and minus 5%. And in &#x2013; so it's basically not just an economic conditions problem, I mean the cost to sales ratio has gone up in every single one of those years, both in good and in bad years. And I was just wondering, is there more cost you can take out or do you think that this ratio will continue to worsen? Or do you &#x2013; is it purely a matter of the like for like getting back up?</p>

          <p>I think, of course, that the best way is to get up the like-for-like figures and we're always planning to get it up, but still I think we have the flexibility in a situation like this to handle good profitability.</p>

          <p>Hello there. Going back to the underperformance in U.S. and France and Spain, and but also thinking about expansion into newer markets, for example the Far East.

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a number of different factors that drives the gross margin, where currency is one and where markdowns is another and source increases is third.

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. A bit of a lower expectation of an answer here, but try anyway. I just wondered you're talking about the, stopping the internal hedge mechanism. I wondered whether that was related in anyway to a change in the internal markup behavior that you engage in? I note that nearly 80% of your operating profit is booked in group functions in 2009. Are you going to reduce the level of markup that you put on product before you set it on to the regional companies? That's the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The transit pricing model would continue as it has been since we introduced this in 2007, so that will be the same. It's only the internal hedging of the markup as we are reaching a strong December 1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you not &#x2013; does it not worry you maybe that this is contributing to your sales performance in the regions? Are you passing on prices to the subsidiaries that are too high?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I see that you have an imported number of stores for the non-H&amp;M brand earmarked to open in 2010. Could you give us an idea where you stand on the concept development for these new formats on COS, on Weekday and Monki? And whether you feel that they are actually ready for an international rollout and they are mature for that, or whether you're still in some cases experimenting and fine-tuning the concepts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As we start with COS, we follow the defined objectives and are satisfied with the development, but we do not comment more into detail. But we do have 23 stores, COS stores today in five, six different markets, and in 2010 we plan to open another 12 COS stores. So, I think that answers some of your, perhaps worries about, yeah, new COS.</p>
          <p>Regarding FaBric, today we have 46 Monki and Weekday stores. When we acquired FaBric Scandinavien we had around 20 stores, and we have more than doubled and we have started to roll this out internationally. We plan to open around 25 Weekday, Monki stores this year. And new markets, as I said, will be Finland and the Netherlands. And finally H&amp;M Home, we launched it this spring, or last year and it sold well. And we wouldn't &#x2013; and we opened the first H&amp;M store or showroom in Stockholm and it has been very well received. We now look for additional opportunities to roll out stores in the group.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much for the follow up. I was wondering when you look at &#x2013; I mean your gross margin obviously, a significant improvement, I think it's the highest across retailers globally right now. How do you weigh that gross margin improvement with your pricing? Because I mean your sales obviously were quite weak, begun to see some stabilization now. But, the negative 5% like-for-like for the quarter, coupled with this significant improvement in the gross margin, I guess how do you weigh between giving that back to customer to shy that out of sales, versus maintaining the margin for yourself?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the valuation in the &#x2013; for the stock in trade is to purchase price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right so you take no advance provisions against stock at year-end regardless even of when &#x2013; even if you've effectively already sold it at a lower price to your valuation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but we are not selling it under purchase price. And according to --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...the regulations we have to evaluate the stock either to the purchase price or a lower price. But of course we are having the purchase price, and if you are referring to make some kind of accrual for obsolete stock, if you are referring to that, that we can't do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And when did you start your promotions? Did that actually start across the board in December or was that just in the UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have run promotions continuously as well. But of course there is always a more focus towards the end of each season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and if I could just ask a follow up. <mark type="inaudible" /> In terms of your buying conditions I was intrigued by your comment that buying conditions have effectively improved which is unusual halfway, effectively in the second half of the collection. I mean did they improve later on in the year or was that pretty much there all the way through autumn, winter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been good throughout the year but a slight improvement towards the end.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Yeah, thanks for taking the follow up. Just a follow up on Simon's point there, I wondered if you are seeing really any signs of any sort of supplier pricing pressure coming through. I mean obviously the dollar has weakened a little against the kroner in recent months and are suppliers now starting to push back a little bit and demand better terms in response to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It looks pretty good so far but of course in the long term when economy comes back again, I'm sure we will see prices and cost come up. But again I think due to the long-term relations we have with suppliers, we still have very good &#x2013; good terms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right and presumably excess capacity as well. And then just on a &#x2013; a follow up again on gross margin, you talked about the currency hedging, the mark-up on sales of goods to the subsidiaries having a 120 basis point positive impact on gross margin. Was there a significant currency effect from the dollar-kroner exchange rate, particularly on the unhedged portion of the buying in dollars?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>The effects on the unhedged 10% approx effect was immaterial &#x2013; insignificant.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, just a very quick question to do with some anecdotal stories I have been hearing in terms of availability in the store of a product that you advertised on your posters, obviously the quite aggressive pricing that you advertised. Are you happy with the availability of the product that you actually advertised? Is it something that's changed over the last two years or so? And sort of a follow-on to the same question is whether you are getting frustrated by the fact that so many other companies seems to be copying this method of advertising now and whether that may in fact cause you to change the way in which you advertise?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course. And sometimes we really want to have even higher quantities. So, yes, sometimes we are selling them out really quick. And of course in those situations we always want to have even more to sell. That's quite natural.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My final question regarding your expansion in the U.S. Is it still focused on large cities or are you looking more at regional expansion?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just thinking about your investment program in the existing store base. I think it was 2006 when you pretty much stopped investing in refurbs, because you weren't happy with the new format. So, could you tell us what proportion of the estate you have upgraded since then so in the three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's true that we didn't stop, but we made a say half halt and then we increased dramatically quite a lot and we've been at around 100 and plus that in the last couple of years since. So, three, 400 stores roughly that had major refurbishment. Then of course in old stores we do small uplifts continuously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the &#x2013; I suppose the reason for the question is the 300 stores or so in the context of the Group is not very much. Has the focus of that been on flagships? And is the -and is there any reason to suggest that in the market where you've done particularly badly you think it could reflect under investment in your space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we've under invested in space in the last years. Perhaps if you go back five, six, seven, eight, nine years ago, we might have &#x2013; if you look back, we could have invested more. But I wouldn't agree that we've under invested the last three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the plus 100 per year is quite a good level for refreshing up our stores. And of course with the high expansion rates we have had in the past years, the stock or the portfolio of stores are quite new, when for instance, during 2009, 250 new stores.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, again. I had a question on the space component, which in the couple of months of the New Year seems to have flipped up to 12%. Is that just a timing issue or are we starting to see some of the areas where you're opening proportionally more stores, like Japan actually contribute more to sales for each new store opening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is a combination of many things and we have been discussing this space conversion for a while and people love to see trends in some direction. And as we say, this could vary up and down depending on where we open and what kind of stores were opened, and this is exactly what it reflects. So, I'm sorry, I can't give you any trend. But I agree it looks better beginning of this year so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course there are also some timing issues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the topic of timing issues, I suppose looking back at last year you had a couple of periods when in August you were short of stock and then November you had too much stock. Is that a function of primarily weather or is it how you adapt to the downturn, or is there something else in terms of logistics issues within the group which is making it more difficult to control stock levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we've become even better than ever to control the inventory, but it is &#x2013; to run retail business is quite difficult. I don't know if you've tried it. So, even though we have some problems &#x2013; I mean it's still all in all we are very happy and the quarter is very profitable as you've seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there are no &#x2013; any logistic issues behind it. For instance, the level of the stock in trading and November its mainly due to that we are heavy on the weather dependent garments like jackets and heavy knitwear.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry. I am going to ask second question because everyone else has been anyway. Just on this, sorry, coming back to the transfer of pricing that I discussed with you earlier, have you not had any &#x2013; do you have to get some sort of tax agreement with the tax authorities in the countries that you trade in? Just surprised that people sort of agreed to let you write the profits into Sweden where you've got a lower tax rate, nice for you. But I am surprised that some of the other tax authorities don't think that's a bit of money out of their pocket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course we have had a lot of talks with different tax authorities in different countries and, of course in some countries it's, yeah, as you mentioned it's kind of an agreement than in other countries. It's just a discussion and we're trying to give them a picture how our transfer pricing model is done. So, yes, we are having discussions with the local tax authorities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you sort of justify the fact that you make most of your profits in Sweden when you got sort of relatively small portion of your sales there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the basic is of course that the creation of the value is here in Sweden where we have the buying office, the design, the head office and buying office functions. And so, the creation of the value is clearly in Sweden.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the creation of 80% of the value in Hennes &amp; Mauritz is in the buying office in Sweden. Is that what you sort of argue to them?</p>
