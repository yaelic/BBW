          <p>Bonjour to those of you joining the webcast and the conference call. The presentation will be made in English and followed by Q&amp;A session. Prior to that, I would ask you to switch off your mobile phone and handhelds. Thank you. So now, I will hand over to Gary Saage.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for braving a very windy and wet Geneva morning, for those of you in the hall. And good morning to everyone watching the presentation on the Web.</p>
          <p>First our financial highlights; sales rose by 37% in the historic terms, 27% in constant currencies, excluding NET-A-PORTER, it was up 22%. We experienced growth in all of our business regions and all of our segments; in particular, the United States and Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>Retail continued to outperform wholesale. I think these sales results reflect our Maison's product creativity, success with both local and new clientele, and our successful openings of new stores.</p>
          <p>We've improved our operating margins. Our profit rose to &#x20AC;760 million, a 95% increase on the previous year. This reflects the strong pricing power of our Maisons, better utilization of our manufacturing facilities, operating leverage from our business model, and we cannot forget easy comparatives of last year.</p>
          <p>We're generating significant cash flow from operations, &#x20AC;598 million. I think this reflects our good results, but more importantly, the continued discipline of our Maisons with respect to working capital.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the economic environment, no question that the environment in the first half helped us. We had positive currency tailwinds on the sales line. The financial crisis for the moment is contained. We have increasing importance of our growth markets, and we had continued momentum there.</p>
          <p>However, the economic situation remains uncertain, we would say. The currencies as of this morning and we believe will become headwinds in the second half, particularly on the sales line and probably on the margin line as well.</p>
          <p>And the basis of comparison will most certainly be more difficult. We returned to double-digit growth last November and it continued from there. So I would caution all of you not to extrapolate our first half results on to the second half so directly.</p>
          <p>Before we get into the detail, I want to spend some time and give you some color on our recent acquisition NET-A-PORTER.com. This business model is a little different than our existing Maisons. So, I want to give you as much color as I possibly can in order for you to put this into your models.</p>
          <p>Sales were &#x20AC;120 million for the six months ended September. We record this entirely as retail sales. Their major regions are Europe and United States. Total expenses, including amortization of intangibles, were 70 million. As noted in May, we expect this business to be breakeven at the operating line in 2012. Excluding intangible amortization, we expect to be breakeven this year.</p>
          <p>This business has significant growth potential, has a fantastic management team. The growth potential is going to be aided in the future by continued and regular increases in new customers. They launched in September a weekly iPad application, which is proving to be successful, and they are launching a site dedicated exclusively to men, MR PORTER.com sometime in the first quarter of next calendar year.</p>
          <p>This business we expect will add much value to Richemont. However, we once recognized that it will dilute the overall ratios at both the gross margin and EBIT lines.</p>
          <p>Turning now to sales by geography, and my comments are going to be on a constant currency basis. First Europe, our number one region, comprising 38% of our sales. Sales in Western Europe increased by 27% overall.</p>
          <p>We would say that the local clientele is back. All countries grew in the region for the first half. I think this reflects successful initiatives that the brands have undertaken to develop our sales with the Western European consumers. But we must say that non-local travelers continue to account for over 50% of the sales in this region.</p>
          <p>The Middle East and Russia did return to growth, albeit slower. The Middle East rose by 7%, and Russia by 5.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to Asia. Our number two region with 36% of sales, grew by 36% over the period. We enjoyed excellent performance across the region. I think it reflects the leadership of our Maisons, most particularly, Cartier, Piaget, Vacheron Constantin, Jaeger, IWC and Montblanc. Given this economic momentum and demographic base, Asia-Pacific remains a strategic region for us, where we continue to see the most growth potential.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Americas, comprising 15% of Group sales; America itself 11, sales for 37% over the previous years, but as a reminder, this needs to be compared by a sales drop last year of 39.</p>
          <p>Retail is growing, up 62% in the period. Of course, this result is flattered by the addition of NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>I think wholesale overall faired pretty well. We were up 23%, year-on-year. And this is in spite of the substantial door reduction and volume reduction that we announced in May. What is certain is that we have a sound base to work from. The US is a very large country. I'm very positive on America; you can probably know that from my accent. And we continue to be confident in the US in the long-term.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Japan, it's still our second biggest single market. It comprises 11% of our Group sales on par with the US. I think obviously, when you take into account the traveling Japanese, which have renewed their travel, based on the yen's level, it accounts for more. In local terms, sales were up 4%. I think we have certainly gained market share in a shrinking pie, by launching attractive products that are targeted for the market. This is a good result. But it doesn't change our conservative view overall on this market. Certainly business is stabilizing, and the yen is certainly helping us from a profit point of view.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to sales by network. First, retail; again our retail channel now includes our directly operated retail locations as well as the NET-A-PORTER business. Retail is a strategic direction for us. We want to grow organically. So, we focus most of our investments on the retail channel.</p>
          <p>We experienced good momentum in the first half, sustained, obviously by successful new store openings, mostly in the growth markets &#x2013; mostly in the growth markets. But we did enjoy superior growth in Asia Pacific with watches and Cartier leading the way. And the particular of note, the watch brands that did particularly well were Piaget and Vacheron Constantin. This channel represents 47% of the Group sales at September.</p>
          <p>And our wholesale performance, as I said with the US plus 20, reasonably happy with that. We achieved this despite a reduction of our wholesale network. And I would say that the replenishment from the dealers continued and is ongoing. So, what we are selling in is selling out.</p>
          <p>Just to touch on the Maisons highlights for a moment. The main point to remember, I think the takeaways, Jewellery Maisons and Specialist Watchmakers profitability was healthy. Our Writing Instruments Maison profitability rebounded. Fashion and accessories, which is in the other category was profitable as a Group, and is certainly improving. And we reduced our losses on a small scale in the non-branded manufacturing facilities.</p>
          <p>I want to hand the presentation at this stage over to Sophie who is going to go through the actual results by Maisons &#x2013; results by segment, and also give you the marketing initiatives that went along with those results. So, Sophie, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gary. We'll start with the Jewellery Maisons. Sales were quite robust 32%, supported by positive strong retail. Cartier's growth was broad-based both in terms of geography and product line. Watches were very much in demand, especially in retail, whatever the price point or material.</p>
          <p>Likewise, the performance of jewelry was quite remarkable. Clearly, Cartier is stronger than ever. Van Cleef's performance was equally notable. It's recorded a double-digit growth in sales in nearly all regions. Similarly, most product lines did very well. And the High Jewellery was popularly acclaimed at the Biennale des Antiquaires in Paris. Operating contribution rose to &#x20AC;541 million, partly due to an operating margin of 33%.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the main developments within the Jewellery Maisons over the past six months. Starting with Cartier, Cartier's broad-based double-digit growth in sales is the result of an effective development strategy in growth and established market. The increase in bridal activity, thanks to true differentiation based on product customization and service, the successful development of a meaningful Haute Horlogerie offer, remarkable success of Love and Trinity Bijoux, Ballon Bleu, Miss Pasha and Calibre watches, and strong sell-throughs for all product lines supported by a dynamic and increasingly selective network.</p>
          <p>Indeed, Cartier continued to grow its retail distribution and wholesale distribution. 27 boutiques were opened &#x2013; sorry, 27 boutiques were renovated to adopt the efficient <mark type="inaudible" /> concept. Net openings reached 21 boutiques, mostly in Asia Pacific and the Middle East, and the wholesale network was streamlined further.</p>
          <p>Finally, this prestigious Maisons benefited from impactful ad campaigns such as the <mark type="inaudible" /> theme and some major PR events such as the exhibition of a classic collection we've had at the Biennale des Antiquaires in Paris.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at Van Cleef &amp; Arpels that also registered a double-digit growth in sales overall. Creative jewelry, Bijoux and watches did very well. Its ongoing creativity was enhanced by further launches in all product categories. Let me just name a few, like the Voyages Extraordinaires High Jewellery collection or the Charms Mini watch. Awareness continues to be raised further with nine stores opened, primarily in Asia-Pacific and Middle East, as well as through exclusive exhibitions.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our specialist watchmakers. They all enjoy growth rates above 30%, except for Baume &amp; Mercier, which nonetheless posted double-digit growth. The negative impact of the Swiss franc on cost of sales was fully absorbed by higher production levels and strong sales momentum. As a result, operating contribution rose to &#x20AC;259 million, reaching a margin of 29% of sales.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the main product and network development of the specialist watchmakers these past six months. Starting with Piaget, outstanding growth was driven by retail in Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>In terms of product line, Piaget retains an effective balance between jewelry watches, elegant men watches and jewelry. Its Polo 45 chrono and Altiplano watches were particularly successful with the introduction of the Altiplano 43 millimeter, which is the thinnest automatic watch, housing the thinnest automatic movements in the world.</p>
          <p>The new celebration rings designed to mark the 20th anniversary of the Possession line were particularly successful and actress Sienna Miller is its ambassador. Piaget improved the navigation and contents of its website now available in ten languages including Chinese. It covers the whole of Piaget universe including its manufacturing know-how.</p>
          <p>Piaget's retail network was further strengthened through its 69 boutiques, of which 40 in Asia-Pacific and 8 in the Middle East. In October, a flagship boutique was opened in &#x2013; on New Bond Street in London.</p>
          <p>A. Lange &amp; Sohne, its sharpest increase in sales resulted from strong &#x2013; from the strong presence in Asia-Pacific and from success of its whole collection, for instance, the Lange 1 and the Lange Zeitwerk. This particular model was awarded L'Aiguille d'Or, which is the first for a non-Swiss brand.</p>
          <p>A. Lange &amp; Sohne renewed creativity was illustrated by a number of striking models launched over these past six months. Let me give you a few examples. There was the 165 years Homage collection, including the 1815 Moonphase. The Lange 1 Daymatic with a new self-winding movement, the Saxonia Annual Calendar, which is a complication now <mark type="inaudible" /> of the collection, and the Lange Zeitwerk Luminous which is pictured here in the slide.</p>
          <p>Development in Asia-Pacific and South America was supported by new commercial organization and a boutique in Shanghai moved to a better location during the summer in Huaihai Road.</p>
          <p>Officine Panerai, its solid growth was the result of retail of Americas and Asia-Pacific and of continued success of watches bearing in-house movements. For instance, the Luminor Marina 1950 3 Days Automatic and the Radiomir 10 Days GMT, which is again here on this slide.</p>
          <p>Officine Panerai continued to focus on its retail network expansion through external partners this past six months in Moscow and Boca Raton. And with three new internal boutiques in Hong Kong, Kowloon; Shanghai, IFC Pudong, and Paris, Rue de la Paix.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to Baume &amp; Mercier, where the situation has improved in spite of its low exposure towards the growth market. Indeed, 75% of its sales are made in Europe and the US, its 100% wholesale exposure, and the fact that it operates in a highly competitive segment.</p>
          <p>2011 is for Baume &amp; Mercier a year of transition, with new products being launched in April 2011, in a much reduced and much more qualitative network, under the leadership of a new CEO.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Vacheron Constantin, which showed significant growth in all markets, but Japan. But then Japan only represents 2% of sales. Let me give you two example of successes. The Patrimony line, high-complication watches and Atelier Cabinotiers which are special order timepieces.</p>
          <p>Vacheron Constantin's reputation of a master craftsman was also strengthened with the new La Symbolique des Laques M&#xE9;tiers d'Art Collection, which combines watch making skills with the most sophisticated Japanese lacquer art.</p>
          <p>Vacheron Constantin also opened four external boutiques in Asia-Pacific, of which three in Mainland China and renewed investment in production to face mounting shortages.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn to Jaeger-LeCoultre. This specialist watchmaker enjoyed its strong performance overall, limited, however, by the availability of its products. It benefited from a rich collection of Classic &amp; Complications pieces. For instance, Reverso line with new Duetto, the Master line with new Chronograph. Our New Duom&#xE8;tre &#xE0; Quanti&#xE8;me Lunaire was awarded the prestigious Grand Prix de l'Horlogerie de Gen&#xE8;ve. Its global network was further improved with six new boutiques and a further reduction even in the number of wholesale brands.</p>
          <p>Now, IWC has shown substantial upturn, especially in Asia and Middle East, driven by Iconic Portuguese and Pilot's lines, successful launches, especially, Portuguese Yacht Club Chronograph and higher demand for Complications watches and precious material pieces.</p>
          <p>It's also opened five boutiques, for instance, in Beirut and Shanghai, and organized a number of PR events to enhance its visibility. One of them was the exclusive IWC book launch in Zurich with live reading by Paulo Coelho.</p>
          <p>IWC was also involved in a number of CSR [corporate social responsibility] initiatives, such as the non-stop bike race, TORTOUR, around Switzerland, with Laureus, a charity partner, have helped children to raise themselves out of poverty through sports.</p>
          <p>Roger Dubuis, it's increasing &#x2013; its significantly increase in retail and global sell-out across all regions demonstrates renewed confidence in products and operational know-how. The period was marked by strong demand for high complicated limited series, such as the Excalibur Double Tourbillon at &#x20AC;200,000; the redesigned Excalibur collection which comes with two new movements, COSC and Poin&#xE7;on de Gen&#xE8;ve certified; and EasyDiver that Roger Dubuis re-launched with success, in particular in Japan.</p>
          <p>Roger Dubuis' internationalization is now completed with all markets, with all regions now integrated within the Richemont distribution platform, mainly in the US, Europe, Russia, Middle East and Asia.</p>
          <p>So this table here shows the result of Montblanc Maison exclusively. All product categories, and in particular watches and writing instruments, did well. In terms of geographies, Hong Kong and France were particularly strong.</p>
          <p>Retail showed a double-digit growth, despite strong comparables as retail returned to growth in August 2009. Wholesale grew as well double-digit despite the continued streamlining of its wholesale network, mostly for pen. As a consequence, the operating contribution rose by 66% to reach 16% of sales.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the main developments within Montblanc. Montblanc market growth reflected the sustained demand for watches, in particular the Nicolas Rieussec Chronograph, which boasts an in-house movement, and the Vintage Villeret 1858 collection, as well as for pen, in particular, the Meisterst&#xFC;ck Diamond collection. Strong growth surrounded the introduction of the Metamorphosis and Exo-Tourbillon <mark type="inaudible" /> and the worldwide launch of the John Lennon pen collection is expected to expand customer base.</p>
          <p>Montblanc's ongoing upgrade of its wholesale and retail network focuses on store improvement, rather than mere expansion plan and on Asia-Pacific including India.</p>
          <p>Finally, Montblanc is raising its profile through special events such as the Culture Art Patronage Awards in 11 countries.</p>
          <p>Finally, the other business area. This segment comprises the fashion and accessories Maison, NET-A-PORTER, and the facilities involved in the manufacturing of watch components to third-party and to our Maisons. The fashion and accessory business generated &#x20AC;7 million profit against a &#x20AC;9 million loss last September. The majority of a 19 million loss this year in the other business area relates to the non-branded watch manufacturers &#x2013; the non-branded manufacturers of watch components.</p>
          <p>In fashion and accessories, Chlo&#xE9;'s contribution tripled while Alfred Dunhill generated a small profit and Lancel getting closer to breakeven. In manufacturing, losses were marginally reduced, thanks to improving order flows in the first half.</p>
          <p>So first, Alfred Dunhill, sales improvement was driven by leather and Asia-Pacific now 65% of sales. In leather, the newly launched Chassis and Bladon collections performed strongly.</p>
          <p>Alfred Dunhill has continued to expand its retail network, by raising its number of stores to 134 from 131 at year-end after the opening of Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, Shanghai IFC and Hangzhou Mix City. It has further upgraded the quality of its wholesale distribution by closing many external point of sales.</p>
          <p>Work continued on improvement of merchandising, showing better sell-through on the seasonal collections and better in-stock position on continuing offer. This goal will be facilitated with the rollout of new centralized merchandising and ERP systems.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to Lancel that posted a strong double-digit growth in sales in all channels. Lancel, clearly, regained market share in France, its home market, and made successful inroads into Russia, Japan, Hong Kong and China. Lancel also successfully launched a new iconic bag named Brigitte Bardot, the B.B. Bag.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, sales were supported by the efficient store concept. Therefore, Lancel continues its strategy by focuses on iconic lines, bags and related small leather goods, France, Russia, Middle East and Asia. There again, to support growth, new ERP and retail systems are being deployed.</p>
          <p>And finally Chlo&#xE9;, the Maison also enjoyed a double-digit sales increase, thanks to strong retail, particularly in China and Europe. Most of this can be attributed to the excellent performance of leather and handbags, thanks to the Marcie, Paraty and Ethel in particular.</p>
          <p>Retail sales were softer, but the Chlo&#xE9; Winter collection showed an encouraging sell-through. The positive reception and press feedback on Love, which is Chlo&#xE9;'s new fragrance, enhanced Maisons' visibility and bodes well for future.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Gary. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sophie, for providing details on the brands because after all that's what this business is all about. Now, let's turn to our operating profits. We've discussed the sales before, plus 37% in historic terms, 22 at constant, excluding NET-A-PORTER. We enjoyed much improved gross margin over the period, and we've contained our underlying growth in operating expenses. This leads us to an operating profit almost doubling to &#x20AC;760 million or an operating margin up 23.3%.</p>
          <p>Let's move into the details on gross margin and expenses. Gross profit rose by 44% to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, representing 64.8% of sales. This is a 330 point margin improvement over the previous period. This improvement reflects the pricing power of our Maisons, higher production levels, positive results relating to our hedging program, and certainly currency tailwinds affecting the sales volume.</p>
          <p>Nearly all of our Maisons improved their gross margin, Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Vacheron Constantin, Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne, Montblanc, Alfred Dunhill, Lancel and Chlo&#xE9; had the most notably increases.</p>
          <p>Moving on to expenses, our net operating expenses grew by 26% or 11% at constant currency, excluding NET-A-PORTER. This was well below our sales growth. The ratio was reduced to 42% of sales, down from 45 a year ago.</p>
          <p>Given the wild moves in the current season in this period and our acquisition of NET-A-PORTER, we've tried to provide you a bridge from the reported expenses in '08 to the reported expenses in September '09, and you see that in the upper right-hand corner of the graph of the slide. So let me go through that now.</p>
          <p>The weaker euro added 8% of growth on September '08. The integration of NET-A-PORTER accounted for 7%. Our increased communication spend in value terms added 3, and then all the rest of our expense base, what we call, selling and distributions and administration expenses, grew by 8%.</p>
          <p>S&amp;D cost, which were 56% of total expenses rose by 27%. This reflects the opening of 38 new stores mostly in the Asia Pacific region. The underlying growth however of S&amp;D was contained to 14%.</p>
          <p>Our communication cost rose by 29%. The ratio is currently at 8% of sales. Clearly with SIHH in the second half and the holiday period coming in the second half, we tend to spend more on communication in the second half rather than the first. So we continue to guide through yearly ratio of 11% for the year.</p>
          <p>Administration cost rose by 21%, but we're contained to plus 4 on an underlying basis.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the items on the P&amp;L below operating profit. Our net finance costs were &#x20AC;120 million; of this, 119 million relate to mark-to-market losses on our cash balances due to the strong Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>As of reminder, upon consolidation, this has no effect on our equity position. We've recorded a one-time accounting gain of 102 million, which we disclosed in May; it just relates to the revaluation of our 33% stake in NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the period, which we project for the full year is 15.4%. This is primarily due to positive profit mixes in low tax jurisdictions such as Hong Kong. We expect our normalized tax rate in the medium-term to continue to be 18%.</p>
          <p>As a result of all of this, our net profit for the year rose by 87% to &#x20AC;644 million or 19.8% of sales.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to cash flow from operations. I think we had solid improvement in cash flow from operations. This obviously is a result of higher operating profits, but I think also, and more importantly, a limited swing in working capital; thanks to the continued discipline with respect to capital management of our Maisons.</p>
          <p>The major elements on working capital swing as always at this time of year. We increased our production outputs; however, inventory rotations due to the strong sales were 18 months versus 20 last year.</p>
          <p>And obviously at this time of the year, we have a seasonal effect on our accounts receivable due to our wholesale shipments, but I'm happy to say that our recovery rates versus September of last year have actually improved. And I think this is the biggest indication in the wholesale network of the desirability of our products and the turn that our wholesalers are enjoying.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at our fixed asset investments. Our gross investments were up 50% to 2.3% of sales. We continued the investments in our manufacturing capabilities. We opened up new retail stores, and we started to catch up on our renovation programs.</p>
          <p>We're generally still fairly selective on the openings, and most of the openings occurred in Asia Pacific and the Middle East in the first half. At a gross spend of 75 million, this remains well below our deprecation level of 99 million.</p>
          <p>For the current year, we maintain our estimate to be 5% of sales, but for next year, we expect this ratio to rise to 6% given our investment plans at this stage.</p>
          <p>The next slide is going to show the detail of the fixed assets. By category, close to 60% of the investments related to our retail network, the most notable retail project as Sophie touched on before, was Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, where we have eight brands: Cartier, Van Cleef, Piaget, Vacheron Constantin, Jaeger, IWC, Montblanc and Alfred Dunhill.</p>
          <p>And Cartier opened up substantial boutiques in Shanghai, Hong Kong Plaza, Macau, the Wynn project and also the Mall of the Emirates in Dubai. Close to 30% of the spend was on our manufacturing capabilities as I noted before. And the other category, which we show on the slide relates to investments in NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our free cash flow, our financial model and business model, we think is a strong one and continues to generate positive free cash flow. Before accounting for the acquisition of a NET-A-PORTER in April of this year, our free cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;390 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now quickly look at our balance sheet. Fairly unchanged from a year ago, equity remained at 70% of the total. After a cash payment of &#x20AC;92 million in ordinary dividends in September and after our investment in NET-A-PORTER last April; our net cash and investment position remains at 1.9 billion, consistent with March.</p>
          <p>If I can now move to the conclusion before we take your questions; first some color on October. October constant currency sales were 27% of the previous year, and reported sales were 36% of the previous year. If you exclude NET-A-PORTER, the reported sales were up 33%.</p>
          <p>What are the main drivers? All regions continue to grow strongly, except for Japan; but Japan in yen terms did post 5% growth for the month. Retail continues to be strong, not only the regular stores, but also NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific, I think in general continues to outperform. We do see local resiliency, and we do see the traveling effect continue to take place. And the growth markets are strong, both home and abroad.</p>
          <p>I would say, let's not extrapolate this performance into the second half. As a reminder, we did turn positive from a growth perspective in November. It's too early to say how November is going to be, but we started to see double digit growth as of November of last year. So the comparables will be challenging, if I can say it that way.</p>
          <p>Foreign exchange will certainly &#x2013; based on rates today, who knows where they're going to go, but certainly the currency has become a headwind on our sales line for the second half.</p>
          <p>As I noted before we will have increased communication spend in the second half to get to the 11%. We do have expenses related NET-A-PORTER in the launch of MR PORTER.COM. And as Sophie mentioned, we are repositioning Baume &amp; Mercier and most of those costs are going to come in the second half, albeit mostly on the gross margin line.</p>
          <p>But for us, we continue to take a long-term view, and what we can do is continue to execute our business model, which I think as you can see from the results is proving successful.</p>
          <p>Just a word on strategy. It's unchanged. We do want to reinforce our leadership in watches and jewelry category, the luxury premium category. We're going to focus primarily on organic growth through retail. What we've learned from the crisis and you've seen it in our figures is the retail channel continues to be more resilient, but we'll continue our investment there.</p>
          <p>We will continue to exert greater control over our wholesale network. Despite closing the wholesale doors last year, the wholesale business grew and grew strongly. We will exercise greater control over the wholesale network. We will have less partners, but we want to more successful partners because there will be more partnership and greater business for them.</p>
          <p>We'll continue our regional focus on the growth market, where we do see superior growth, I spoke about Asia before. We will continue to streamline our processes. SAP continues to rollout quietly, and the launch of an ERP system for the fashion and accessories went live in Alfred Dunhill in London this month. We're going to support this growth with further investments in our production capabilities.</p>
          <p>To the conclusion, before we take your questions, we do have a unique portfolio of high quality Maisons. And what's clear in the marketplace is their quality works, good brand works and efficient business model works.</p>
          <p>We want to maintain our leadership in prestige jewelry and watches. We think we have great potential in this business given the universal appeal of European luxury goods. We continue to have strong exposure from growth markets, both at home and abroad, across all our Maisons, particularly our biggest and strongest, Cartier.</p>
          <p>And we think the cash flow continues to be the only true value &#x2013; true measure of long-term value creation and we focus on that. Cash is our fortress; it will finance our investment programs. It will allow us to increase dividend in good times and bad. And it allows us to have a competitive advantage to seize opportunities whey they're presented.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention to everyone and now I am happy with Sophie to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Luca Solca from Sandford Bernstein. I have three questions. The first one about your concerns and your suggestion not to extrapolate so directly the first-half results, other than comps and forex, what other potential threats do you see to the business going forward and to the broader luxury goods space?</p>
          <p>The second question about channel strategy, you are indicating a constant move to retail. I was wondering if this could also involve the shift to a fully integrated vertical-controlled model for some of the brands, most especially Cartier, and if you could shift to a 100% retail model at some point in the future for the brand?</p>
          <p>And third, there has been a lot of speculation about Richemont and Lehmans potentially being closer. Do you have an interest in Lehmans and would you go as far as considering a merger with this company at the expense of dilution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the outlook question I would say &#x2013; there is certainly no reason for us to sit here and say that things are going to get worse, so we'd happy that would be &#x2013; that wouldn't be true, I don't think. However we were relaxed, but we have to be vigilant. We have to be vigilant because we don't know how the world is going to go. There is clearly a feel-good factor at the moment, but that could disappear at any time.</p>
          <p>On the extrapolation question, as I try to highlight in the presentation, the expense base will clearly be higher in the second half than the first year, in the first half. The communications spend, if you're at 8 and you're going to get to 11, that's quite an increase.</p>
          <p>S&amp;D, we do have the launch of MR PORTER.COM that will add something. So &#x2013; and, traditionally because of SIHH and what have you &#x2013; our second half tends to be on a margin level, tends to be lower. And let's not forget the repositioning of Baume &amp; Mercier, which is going to cause something in the second half. And we think it's going to be fine, but you have to deal with these things and notably dealt with in the second half.</p>
          <p>Regarding your vertical integration question, we see very much space for the wholesale network. It is not our goal to be 100% vertically integrated at the retail level, but we need to exit &#x2013; exert control over our wholesale partners little more. With respect to the acquisition question and I want to be clear about this, I am here to talk about the half-year results and nothing more. And we don't comment on acquisition rumors in the marketplace.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. I have three questions. The first one on watches and capacity constraints. Can you remind us which brands and which lines are affected, or were affected, by bottlenecks and whether you've resolved those bottlenecks? And, if not, is there still, in the wholesale channel, an order backlog looking at Christmas and, overall, H2?</p>
          <p>The second question also on Watches. You indicated the sell-outs in the wholesale channel was good. If we look at the last two, three months, how does the sell-out, roughly, in wholesale compares to the selling? I'm not sure if you have access to that data from your main wholesale customers?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on taxation. There's been changes to the Swiss tax regime to take effect in January. Is there any benefit for you, thinking in particular in terms of dividend payments? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Thomas. On the capacity bottleneck question, I mean, we certainly grew our watch business quite significantly in the first half. Okay, there is some effects in certain brands, I wouldn't project that to the entire portfolio. But I would say it's manageable &#x2013; I would say it's manageable as a portfolio. There are shortages out there. But that's not necessarily bad thing. That's not necessarily a bad thing. And the wholesale selling &#x2013; sell-outs, what I'm going to say is completely anecdotal in a way, but clearly by looking at the receivables and improvement in the receivables, the retailers in the marketplace are narrowing their portfolios to the brands that sell. And you can see that because they are paying their bills immediately because they want the product flow to continue. That's quite clear.</p>
          <p>There is a fine line between what people tend to call restocking and what I like to call replenishment. For me, we're in the replenishment stage. So, the wholesale is generally matching what's going on over the corner in my view anecdotally. With respect to the change in the Swiss tax law, we're aware of it, but we're looking at it &#x2013; our tax department is looking at it. So, I can't really comment at this stage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Jon Cox with Keppler Capital Markets. I have a couple of questions for you. I'll start just on the &#x2013; you seem to be cautioning on the SG&amp;A in H2. I just wondered if you could give us some words on the gross margin side of things. Do you think price increases you've put through are enough to offset some of the, maybe, FX pressure and maybe we can maintain that gross margin for the second half of the year? It's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second, just on the cash situation, obviously you have a huge cash pile. You alluded to the fact that you would increase your dividend in good years and bad. Historically, I know you've paid a special dividend within the overall dividend. I know it's related to VAT in the past, I'm wondering if you think that could be an option going forward with regard to what you may do with the cash pile?</p>
          <p>Third question, just on &#x2013; I'm just wondering, on mainland China, can you give me an idea of how much the sales account for Group at the moment?</p>
          <p>And then just a last question on the run up to Christmas. I'm just wondering what &#x2013; do you have any feeling about how Christmas is looking? Obviously, it looks like your organic sales growth actually accelerated in October from the first part of the year. I'm guessing this is more to do with Asia-Pacific rather than continued growth in the Americas? A sort of a pre-Christmas question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wrote down a lot of questions, John, serious. On the gross margin, we don't guide on the gross margin because we have no idea where the currencies are going to go. Certainly, we put through some price increases in the fall. Putting aside the currencies effects, remember last year that we started to put the factories back on line more or less in December or so. I don't expect if we just &#x2013; the other items that are usually in margin provisions and things. I don't expect a huge difference between here, between the second half of this year and the second half of next year. Why, because we're going to incur significant costs in the gross margin line for Baume &amp; Mercier. That's quite clear, so that's what I would say to give you a little color on margin.</p>
          <p>In terms of the special dividends, you're quite right, when you say that that had more to do with VAT than the luxury goods side of the business. We stand by our position. We want to increase our dividend year-by-year. With respect to the cash pile, what is our strategy, we want to grow organically. We've signaled that we want to increase our CapEx spend for next year. So, this strategy is unchanged. We want to grow organically, and we feel we need the cash position to do that.</p>
          <p>With respect to China, I really don't want to get into the splits, we don't do that. The run-up to Christmas, it's a little too early, okay you've seen the October numbers. But if I can say, we're relaxed but vigilant, relaxed but vigilant, extremely vigilant.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Leopold Authie from Exane BNP Paribas. You internally opened 38 stores in H1, given that you're increasing your CapEx to 6% next year, could you give us, maybe, again, how many stores you're likely to open this year and next year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you talked about price increases. Quickly, is that possible to quantify? And third, what is the impact of NET-A-PORTER on your inventories, because it seems that it has increased a bit the inventories incrementally? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Timing is always everything, but I think we're probably looking at a total of between 45 and 50 for this year. It's a little early to say what the split is next year. I don't have granularity on that, but it's probably similar, I would say, probably similar.</p>
          <p>On the NET-A-PORTER, you know it is seasonal fashion business. The management team there is exceptional at managing their inventories and actually buying what is going to sell. It's very fast turning. In that type of business, it's not significant at the end of the day. I mean the buy is large, but the inventory position at September or March doesn't add a huge amount to our inventories.</p>
          <p>On the price increases, I mean we don't &#x2013; I've said this, price increases let's leave it go with that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Will Hutchings from Goldman Sachs. Two questions. One on, more generally, on your tourist travel spend, more generally, whether you could give us a bit of an update how much you're seeing increase in Europe, but also in Asia, in particular, in terms of travel across the regions where you &#x2013; how much pickup you've seen in travel move there? And also in terms of retail opportunities, in terms of space opportunities, I wonder if you can give us an update on the pipeline of available space, in particular in China, that's coming available?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean on the traveling question the ratios that we've seen, a little over 50% of sales in Western Europe being travelers; that has remained pretty constant. With respect to the Asia question, the growth in Asia was pretty broad-based. I would say every, every major country grew. So that was fairly broad-based.</p>
          <p>Retail, I'd rather not say, I mean, but there is opportunity. Certainly, the retail is becoming more concentrated. Retail is becoming more concentrated, I think because of the traveling. So, we have to look at that carefully and we have to react to it. So maybe last year, we said, it's all Asia Pacific &#x2013; it's all Asia Pacific. This year we opened up, as an example a Piaget store on Bond Street in London. So we need to, the retail marketplace is changing, becoming concentrated. So we need to be vigilant for that.</p>

          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank. Good morning. Firstly, regarding the gross margin, which has increased in H1 330 basis points, what has been the increase, excluding NET-A-PORTER?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you were mentioning October sales up 36% in euro terms and excluding NET-A-PORTER it was 33, is that right, so the impact was only 3% of their 5% in H1, so what's...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And thirdly, regarding the real estate market in China, what's your opinion about it, does it make you any headache, are you &#x2013; do you see any risks of a bubble there? And lastly, regarding this extra-ordinary costs coming out from Baume &amp; Mercier in the second half, could you give us a hint how much this will be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the NET-A-PORTER gross margin question, we didn't provide the margin and we won't. But I think you can work it out yourself, right. I mean, the one thing different about NET-A-PORTER is it's not a completely integrated business. They buy at wholesale and they sell. So I think you could probably come pretty close on your own, what you think the margins are there. With respect to real estate in China, it's competitive. But with people like Cartier and Piaget and Montblanc and Alfred Dunhill, we tend to basically have access to those spaces.</p>
          <p>With respect to B&amp;M, we said in May, we have two loss making brands, Roger Dubuis and Baume &amp; Mercier. Things were certainly better in the first half than we thought. I expect those losses overall to be marginally reduced to the full-year, marginally reduced in that the provisions that we took for Roger Dubuis will not reoccur.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It would be at the gross margin level. Yes, because I mean, we are introducing new product lines. We have to deal with the inventories that we have existing. So, most of the cost is going to be within the margin line.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hello. Sorry. Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. I have a question about China and also Hong Kong. In the past you've given us an indication that Hong Kong was the biggest market, around 50% of sales and Mainland China 7% or 8% or something like that. And that has probably growing. You indicated Hong Kong is still the biggest market. Can I ask you about the strategy going forward? And how much of the potential of Mainland China you have tapped in already? Are you open now &#x2013; you opened up now a few big flagship stores in the big Mainland Chinese cities. Did you &#x2013; is it just scratching on the surface, or is there a lot more to go in the big cities? And at which stage do you have to go to, maybe, also lower tier cities?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the retail question, it depends by brand, where we are in terms of development. Some brands are more developed than others; some brands have more franchise relationships than others. I think the trend has been to internalize franchise arrangements. Cartier is going through that at the moment, that doesn't mean you're going to make it entirely retail, but in certain places we recapture the relationship. So, there is still growth there, but to say what do we think, I mean, some brands are slower than others, but there is potential there even for Cartier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Mario Montagnani, NZB Neue Zurcher Bank. Most of my questions have been asked, but I have a couple of them still for you. The first one is on your like-for-like sales growth in retail. Will it be possible to just get a feeling for your H1 as well as for the October trading update like-for-like growth in retail, will be the first question?</p>
          <p>The second one is on your outlook. You are pretty much cautious on your wording for November or Q3 and Q4. Obviously, you mentioned the tougher comps for H2. On the other hand, if I look at October, you have an acceleration from 20 &#x2013; low 20s to 27%. Could you just elaborate on this 27%, in terms of, first, channels? You have that, but also in terms of like-for-like, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>In specialty products, is jewelry accelerating or watches mostly? And particularly on watches, which kind of segments are driving growth in October? Do you see growth stemming mostly from the top-end segment or the, let's say, mid accessible segment? That would be the second question.</p>
          <p>And the last one is on margins. If I look at your watches and Jewelry, margins for the key divisions, you reached peak levels in H1. Without quantifying, I just wonder &#x2013; I'm just wondering if in this upcoming cycle, you see margins trending higher, especially considering all the investments you've done over the last ten years, especially manufacturing and watches, if these margins especially in watches and jewelry can trend up?</p>
          <p>And probably the last one is on taxation, if you could guide us on taxation in H2? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the like-for-like, I'm sensitive to the impact that NET-A-PORTER has had on the retail numbers in the first half. That's certainly why we have tried to disclose as much as we can to give you an understanding of NET-A-PORTER's effect on the retail business. We don't disclose like-for-like sales at any time for any of our brands.</p>
          <p>With respect to the watches, we are in the premium segment, so the high-end is mostly our space. So you can look at the overall results and conclude that the high-end is doing well. Although B&amp;M did better than we thought in the first half, but I wouldn't read into that because they're repositioning. So I don't really have any color on that.</p>
          <p>With respect to the margin question, fair enough, but I don't know where exchange rates are going and I don't know what's happening there. So I can't really &#x2013; I can't really say, but I think the results do demonstrate the operating leverage that the business model has. And you see that we've contained our administration costs for. And despite opening up a whole bunch of new stores, the S&amp;D underlying was fairly contained as well. But I would ask you to draw your own conclusion on where margins can go.</p>
          <p>Taxation, for the half year, you're required to estimate your taxation rate for the full year, so we expect 15.4 &#x2013; 15, 16 in the second half.</p>

          <p>Maybe I saw Eva also wanted to ask a question. So maybe two more questions. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning. It's Eva Quiroga from UBS. I have two questions please. On NET-A-PORTER, we're seeing the Mr. Porter next year. What do you think the next big opportunities are, and I'm thinking especially about Asia, given the sheer amount of people who have access to the Internet and use it a lot?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the other businesses, Marty Wikstrom's now been running that business for a year-and-a-half, can you maybe share a little bit what her thoughts are and what's changed in the business, both when it comes to sales growth and profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the NET-A-PORTER question, clearly, we can't ignore the Asia-Pacific, but I think if you look at the sales that we had in the first half, it's challenging and it's a growing business. So yeah, it's there, we have to look at it. Natalie Massenet and Mark Sebba and their team are an extremely talented management team. And the second tier management is extremely talented. But when you grow X percent, you only can do so much you want. So it's clearly something we have to look at in the future.</p>
          <p>The fashion and accessories as a group was profitable. Marty is focusing on systems. Alfred Dunhill has installed an ERP system just this month. And she is getting them to focus on sell-through rates and the sort of scientific things as opposed to the arts things. That's for the creative side. And the one thing I can say is the improvement in the operating results for that category is down to gross margin. So there is an Alfred Dunhill being an old Dunhill guy to be profitable in the first half, that's pretty good news.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Aless Migliorini from Helvea. I just have a quick question on the other businesses. You mentioned you are running up production, your plans for watches since last December. We have had a 38% increase in sales of watches and yet you're losing money at the watch component manufacturing activities. Is that an operational loss or is there some clean-up going on there, integration, I'm not quite sure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sometimes, I think I'm not very smart because that's an operational loss. But you have to remember our business model in a way. Each brand runs its own business and they are responsible for their own results. And sometime there is a conflict between what a brand wants to do and what a brand can pay for something, and what's good strategically for the group long-term. So most of those losses in the non-branding manufacturing is what I would call the make-by differential on movements. Probably we should allocate that to the specialist watchmakers in the future. And it's something we're thinking about, but that's what it is.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think there are no more questions. So, let's turn to Jon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on that watch manufacturing and the loss there, as a result then that thing will never turn profitable in the way your report now or do you see signs of a pickup in reordering from third parties coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, there is &#x2013; we do third-party losses &#x2013; third-party sales...</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sales is down. They're still down. That's how they're still down.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a slow burn. We did improve a little bit. So it will be a slow burn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
