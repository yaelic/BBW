          <p>Good morning. My name is Cherez and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the PNC Financial Services Group Second Quarter Investor Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Callihan, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial Services Group, on what I know is a very busy morning for all of you. Participating on this call will be PNC's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Rohr; and Rick Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>The following statements contain forward-looking information. Actual results and future events could differ, possibly materially, from those we anticipate in our statements and from our historical performance due to a variety of factors.</p>
          <p>Those factors include items described in today's conference call, press release, related materials and in our 10-K and 10-Q and other various SEC filings available on our corporate Web site. These statements speak only as of July 22, 2010, and PNC undertakes no obligation to update them.</p>
          <p>We will also provide details of the reconciliations to GAAP of non-GAAP financial measures we may discuss. These details may be found in today's conference call, press release and our financial supplement, in our presentation slides and appendix, and in various SEC reports and other documents. These are also all available on our corporate Web site at PNC.com in the Investor Relations section.</p>
          <p>And I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Rohr.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Good morning and thank you for joining us. This was an excellent quarter for PNC from both a financial and a strategic standpoint. We have executed our business plan in the first half of this year, and are well positioned to deliver solid results in the second half. I will say more about the financial results in a moment, but first I would like to highlight some of our strategic accomplishments.</p>
          <p>The first one, we completed the final wave of National City customer and branch conversions last month. I believe this process was handled as well as any large client conversion that's been done in the banking industry.</p>
          <p>In total, we brought 6 million retail and business clients in nine states on to PNC's technology platform. We completed the process six months ahead of our original schedule, client retention was within our expectations and we've already significantly exceeded our original cost savings target.</p>
          <p>Second item, sales across our franchise were 126% of plan through June 30. On a linked quarter basis, total sales were up 6%. In our western markets, sales were 113% of plan through the first half and up 15% linked quarter. I believe that this reflects our customer focus throughout the conversion process, and what I'm very pleased about is the rate of customer penetration in our corporate bank.</p>
          <p>Across the company, cross-selling is at 132% of plan year-to-date. In the western markets it's 110% of plan through six months. While not as robust as the levels in our eastern markets, this reflects both the tremendous progress we're making and the opportunities for growth. With the conversion behind us, we're now investing in people to help us serve our customers in these markets and we're implementing the PNC business model across the entire franchise.</p>
          <p>Now another strategic highlight this quarter was arranging for the sales of residential mortgage loans and brokered home equity loans in our distressed assets segment. While the income statement effect of this sale is recorded in the second quarter, the balance sheet effect will take place in the third quarter as those sales close.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that the majority of these loans are seriously delinquent, and they represent approximately $2 billion in customer balances. With the market for these loans opening up, we see this as an opportunity to reduce risk with reasonable valuations and Rick will discuss this in more detail in a moment.</p>
          <p>Finally, the regulatory reform legislation is now in place. We support many of the changes, such as the creation of a systemic risk regulator and the extension of consumer protection laws to non-bank financial companies. We believe core elements of the bill should contribute to a stronger more secure financial system over time.</p>
          <p>There are a variety of issues in the legislation that we are currently studying. There is much more to come in the hundreds of regulations expected over the next few years. One thing is clear: The reform bill will impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business. However, we believe that the expected changes will be manageable for PNC, and will have a smaller impact on us than the Wall Street banks.</p>
          <p>Now another important topic is capital, and we are well positioned from a capital standpoint. We closed the sale of Global Investment Servicing on July 1, which added to our capital. As of June 30, our estimated Tier 1 ratio was 10.8% and pro forma as of July 1 after the sale of GIS, Tier 1 would be 11.4%.</p>
          <p>The Tier 1 common ratio was 8.4% at the end of the quarter estimated and reflecting the sale of GIS, the pro forma as of July 1 is 9% for Tier 1 common. Since we closed on the National City acquisition, we have nearly doubled our Tier 1 common capital ratio when the impact of the GIS sale is included.</p>
          <p>Now overall, this was an exceptional quarter for PNC and we're well positioned for future growth, despite the challenging economy.</p>
          <p>Now let me provide you with some highlights of our financial results. We produced second quarter earnings of $803 million or $1.47 per diluted common share. That's a 20% increase in net income on a linked quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Excluding integration costs of $0.13 per diluted common share, second quarter earnings per diluted common share would have been $1.60, an increase of 22% on a linked quarter basis after adjusting the first quarter for integration costs and the early redemption of our TARP preferred shares. Page 16 of the press release summarizes these adjustments.</p>
          <p>For the first half of the year, our net income of $1.5 billion was double that of the same period in 2009.</p>
          <p>Starting with revenue, our second quarter net interest income was up linked quarter, reflecting our ongoing success in re-pricing our deposits and lowering borrowing costs, somewhat offset by lower yields on investment securities. Non-interest income was up linked quarter, primarily due to higher loan servicing and residential mortgage loan sales revenue, debit card income and net security gains, partially offset by declines in our more market-sensitive fee categories.</p>
          <p>Regarding credit costs, our second quarter provision was $823 million. Excluding an additional provision of $109 million related to the arranging for the third quarter sales of some distressed assets that I mentioned, the amount is lower than our first quarter provision of 751 million. Assuming continued economic growth, we believe that the credit quality is stabilized and some metrics are showing signs of improvement on a linked quarter basis, namely our delinquent loans and our non-performing loans have shown meaningful declines.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter expenses were down 5% linked quarter. Enough said. Our financial results, frankly, were driven by our business segments and we're seeing growth opportunities throughout our expanded franchise.</p>
          <p>Retail Banking remained focused on expanding and deepening customer relationships. Checking relationships grew by 20,000 during the second quarter of 2010 and our goal is to deepen these relationships. We saw active online bill payment grow by 5% during the second quarter alone.</p>
          <p>Our Corporate &amp; Institutional bank had a very good quarter. While loan demand remains tepid, we're focused on our goal of adding 1,000 new customers in our corporate bank this year, which would double our new client growth for the combined company. Through six months, we're on target to &#x2013; we're on track to reach that target.</p>
          <p>Now with more of our clients on one platform, we saw increases in treasury management revenue in the second quarter. For the first half of the year, treasury management revenue was up $40 million to 600 million, an increase of 7% over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Earnings for our Asset Management Group were affected, as you might guess, by the second quarter declines in the equity markets. In the quarter, this segment remained focused on deposit growth and adding customers and expense management and this will position the business for improved profitability as the market rebounds.</p>
          <p>Our Residential Mortgage Business posted good second quarter results. Application volume increased largely due to seasonal factors. And I would have to tell you that this business is making great progress as it transitions to a more moderate risk position. A new mortgage origination system was implemented to better serve clients and manage risk, and our mortgage business is continuing to rebuild its sales force, which should help to drive increases in high quality loan originations.</p>
          <p>Regarding our Distressed Assets, this portfolio of $17 billion is down 4 billion since the same time last year, primarily as a result of pay downs, net charge offs and dispositions. However, the sales I mentioned earlier are not reflected in this decline because they haven't closed yet, and we're making progress in managing the risk and returns on our distressed loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now BlackRock had a very good second quarter. Their net income increased linked quarter and nearly doubled that over a year ago. They're making good progress in their merger with Barclays Global Investors, which made them the largest publicly traded investment management firm in the world with more than $3.1 trillion in assets under management. At the end of the second quarter, our share of BlackRock's earnings was 23%.</p>
          <p>Now overall, I believe that we achieved excellent strategic and financial results in the second quarter, but I'd like to spend a few minutes talking a little bit in detail about our well positioned balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 4, we believe that our balance sheet differentiates us. It remains highly liquid and it's well positioned for the current environment.</p>
          <p>On the asset side we remain patient with our investment securities and continue to focus on short duration agency and government securities. Total loans were down 2% in the second quarter, which we believe was consistent with industry trends. Loan utilization remained soft across the country. However, the pace of contraction appears to be slowing as we begin the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now we recognize the vital importance of credit to our country's economic growth. We originated and renewed approximately $40 billion in loans and commitments in the second quarter, 72 billion for the first half of the year, which includes more than $2 billion in small business loans. And additionally, we're committed to working with homeowners to help them avoid foreclosure where appropriate.</p>
          <p>We completed approximately $1.5 billion in refinancing under the Home Affordable Refinance Program from the inception of the program through June 30. And we've also set out approximately 86,000 workout packages to troubled borrowers under the Home Affordable Modification Program.</p>
          <p>Now on the deposit side, transaction deposits were relatively flat linked in the quarter, but up more than $5 billion year-over-year as we've been enhancing our deposit mix with a focus on customer relationships and increased profitability. We have a strong deposit franchise and we remain core funded with a loan-to-deposit ratio of 86% as of June 30.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet as of June 30 remained asset sensitive with an estimated duration of equity of approximately negative three years. Our balance sheet provides us with the capacity to support clients as the economy gains momentum, and at the same time our position allows for patience in the event economic conditions are slow to improve in a meaningful way.</p>
          <p>We also saw growth in common equity of $1.2 billion linked quarter and this does not include the positive impact from the July 1 sale of Global Investment Servicing. Overall, this was a very strong first half and we accomplished a lot.</p>
          <p>And now Rick will provide you with more detail about our second quarter results, beginning with our ability to deliver high quality earnings. Rick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today I will focus on first: Our strong financial results and the key drivers of our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings; second, the stabilization of our credit quality and the improvement in some of our credit metrics, our related credit costs and the adequacy of our reserve levels; and third, our continued improvements in the quality of our capital structure.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, our well diversified revenues increased and we reduced expenses. This allowed us to deliver pre-tax, pre-provision earnings that more than doubled our credit costs. As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered 3.9 billion in revenue in the second quarter and 1.9 billion in pre-tax, pre-provision earnings compared to our provision of 823 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's begin with the components of revenue. Net interest income of 2.4 billion and our net interest margin of 4.35% for the quarter were up modestly from our first quarter results. A key driver is the ongoing re-pricing of our deposit base and higher than expected interest income on impaired loans, the ladder which you can see on Page 7 of the supplement.</p>
          <p>Our cost of deposits in the second quarter was 71 basis points, down 10 basis points linked quarter and down 54 basis points year-over-year. We have approximately 14 billion of relationship-based CDs with an average rate of more than 2% that are scheduled to mature during the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Assuming rates stay low, and I believe they will, we will continue to re-price these deposits and lower our deposit funding costs even further. Our total yield on interest earning assets declined linked quarter. While loan yields were up slightly due to higher than expected interest income on impaired loans, this improvement was more than offset by a 27 basis point decline in the yield on our investment securities portfolio.</p>
          <p>This downward trend reflects the continuing migration of the portfolio to lower risk asset classes, such as U.S. Treasury and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, along with the impact of the lower rate environment. The yield on new security purchases has declined significantly as interest rates have declined.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, retail deposits should continue to decline, albeit at a &#x2013; retail deposit costs should continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace than we've seen in previous quarters. And I do expect interest income on loans and loan yields to decline as the contribution from impaired loans will decrease, looking more like the contribution in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition, yields on securities will continue to decline as we replace maturities and prepayments with lower risk securities in a low rate environment. As a result, you would expect to see the net interest income and yield on earning assets to decline, putting pressure on net interest income and the margin in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income of 1.5 billion was up 7% linked quarter. The sources of our non-interest income remain high quality and well diversified. While client flows remain strong, asset management fees were affected by declines in equity market values, resulting in a 6% decline linked quarter.</p>
          <p>Consumer services and service charges on deposits were up 6% linked quarter, primarily due to higher transaction volume-related fees and seasonality. We expect that the new Regulation E rules related to overdraft charges will negatively impact our second half revenue by an estimated 145 million.</p>
          <p>Corporate service fees saw higher merger and acquisition advisory fees in the second quarter. However, overall fees were down marginally linked quarter, primarily due to the exceptional special servicing revenue from commercial mortgage loans in the first quarter. Residential mortgage fees were up 22% linked quarter, mainly due to higher loan servicing revenues and improved origination volumes.</p>
          <p>Net gains on security sales and the impact of OTTI contributed 53 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of 26 million in the first quarter. Security gains for the quarter were primarily driven by sales of U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasury securities. Looking ahead, we anticipate ongoing improvement in the OTTI as the economy recovers. Finally, total other non-interest income was down primarily due to lower customer-related trading revenues.</p>
          <p>Now once again, the diversification of our non-interest income revenue streams delivered good value in the quarter. As Jim mentioned, expenses declined 5% linked quarter, primarily due to the reversal of certain accrued liabilities, with 73 million related to a franchise tax settlement and 47 million associated with a litigation indemnification.</p>
          <p>Now if you go to Slide 7, we'll take a moment to talk about our cost savings targets. We captured another 15 million of savings in the quarter, bringing us to 800 million in annualized acquisition-related cost savings in the first six months of the year and our 18 month total comes to $1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Our new goal for the end of 2010 is 1.8 billion. If you recall, our original cost savings target of 1.2 billion represented 10% of the expense base of the combined companies. When we reach 1.8 billion at the end of this year, we will have reduced the combined expenses by 15% six months ahead of scheduled. At the same time, we have remained focused on making investments in support of new customers and product development.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our credit quality and cost trends on Slide 8. Overall, credit quality continued to stabilize and delinquencies and non-performing loans showed signs of improvement. All delinquencies were down approximately 25% in the quarter compared to the linked quarter and for the first time since the recession began in 2007, our non-performing loans declined. On a linked quarter basis, non-performing loans decreased by almost $0.5 billion or 8%, driven by a substantial reduction in loans transferred to non-performing loans, which you can see on Page 11 of the supplement.</p>
          <p>Our provision of 823 million for the second quarter is an increase of 72 million compared to the prior quarter and net charge-off of 840 million increased from the prior quarter by 149 million. As Jim mentioned, we made a strategic decision during the quarter to sell some of our residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans in our distressed asset segment.</p>
          <p>These loans, the majority of which are seriously delinquent, reflect customer balances of approximately $2 billion and represent a carrying value of approximately 1 billion. As a result of the planned dispositions, we increased our provision and our charge-offs by 109 million and 75 million, respectively. We expect these sales to close in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now even with the impact of this sale decision, our ratio of net charge-offs to average loans, while higher than last quarter at 2.18%, compares favorably to industry ratios.</p>
          <p>Now we're beginning to see some more liquidity in the market, providing opportunities to sell our distressed assets to avoid future deterioration and servicing cost. For example, the residential mortgage sales included more than 8,000 loans, the majority of which are seriously delinquent. We believe these actions are prudent, as they will accelerate the reduction of future credit cost and allow us to redeploy our resources to loans with a higher probability of recovery.</p>
          <p>Now even with the &#x2013; with the final conversion to PNC systems, we also increase our reserve coverage on our remaining portfolio of impaired loans by approximately 200 million. We remain comfortable with our reserve coverage, including our $5.3 billion allowance and our marks of 27% on our impaired book.</p>
          <p>Clearly, our ability to deliver well diversified revenues and manage our expenses continues to drive positive operating leverage and provides us with the ability to effectively manage our credit cost, while still increasing common capital.</p>
          <p>Now as shown on Slide 9, our Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the second quarter is estimated to be 8.4%, primarily as a result of second quarter earnings and our lower balance sheet. Since year end, our Tier 1 common ratio has increased by 240 basis points.</p>
          <p>The pro forma ratio of 9% reflects the gain from the sale of Global Investment Servicing and the elimination of the related intangible assets on our balance sheet. The estimated net impact on capital from the sale is 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>We now have a higher quality capital base with 78% of our Tier 1 risk-based capital in common equity, up from 50% a year ago. Our capital position provides us with the flexibility for future growth, while investing in innovative products and services. At PNC we have a disciplined approach to capital management which we believe serves us well.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll hand it back to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rick. Slide 10 is a scorecard that we've been using to measure our progress and we've made great progress in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our focus now is on lowering our credit costs and growing revenue. We're making good progress on credit and with the completion of National City's branch conversion, we're in a better position to provide fee-based products throughout a larger franchise. Over time, we expect to increase the percentage of non-interest income to total revenue.</p>
          <p>Our return on average assets in the second quarter was 1.22% and 1.12% through the first half of the year. We now have the branch conversions behind us and the passage of financial regulatory reform.</p>
          <p>With that, and our strong first half performance, we have confidence to increase our return to average assets goal to 1.5% or greater, which is closer to our historical levels of performance. Clearly, we remain confident in our ability to achieve these strategic financial objectives over time as the economy recovers.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me update the guidance we provided last quarter on our 2010 full year forecast as compared to the prior year. This forecast assumes a slow growth economy and continued low interest rates for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>First, we expect some pressure on net interest income in the second half of the year. However, we remain confident in our ability to keep revenue performance stable year-over-year, but this expectation, of course, excludes the impact of last year's BlackRock/BGI gain.</p>
          <p>Second, our overall credit quality has stabilized, given the signs of improvement we are seeing. We're optimistic, frankly, that the loss provision will decline in the second half of the year, primarily because of declining delinquencies and non-performing loans. And third, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively manage expenses.</p>
          <p>As a result, we continue to believe that our pre-tax, pre-provision earnings will substantially exceed credit costs, and we believe we are on target to deliver a strong full year 2010 and are comfortable with the range of the second half estimates for PNC.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll be proud to &#x2013; we've been proud to announce the second quarter and be happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from John McDonald [Sanford Bernstein].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Rick, can I ask a question about the NIM? Just going to go with the Virtual Wallet, but I figured I'd start with the NIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the forward guidance for some pressure on NII and NIM is the assumption that the cash recoveries would go closer to the 75 million that you had in the first quarter. Is that what you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John. I think you'll see that the cash recoveries in this quarter that that line item, which are somewhat like one-time items, was 164 million. And I'd probably predict that back to 75. And I think if you also look at the accretion table, you'll see that that went up a little bit in the quarter, and I'd go back to the third quarter number. So just a short hand, I would expect the net interest income on impaired loans to drop by about $100 million next quarter from this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so that's the total, right? That was 376 and the 164 this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because the other line in there is I guess the deposits, the accretion from the deposit re-pricing you'll still get some, but that's going to fade. It already started to go down from 167 to 144. Is that the line that's driving that down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, John, just the balance of what we're able to re-price is coming down, so we've got 14 billion remaining to be re-priced between now and the end of the year. A lot of that's back-end loaded. We'll get some of that in the third quarter, but we'll see a lot more of that in the fourth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good guess, yeah. And I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a start.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And moving into credit, what drove the additional provision for the SOP 3 impaired loans this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had a couple. One was the sale we mentioned, which was that 110 million, John. Additionally, in the consumer book as we moved loans and we converted all the impaired loans this quarter, we were able to take a look at some additional credit information, Credit Bureau data research so we could cross-match it against whether those customers had auto loan delinquencies or credit card delinquencies. And so we caught up on some of those reserves. That drove about 100 million of that reserve there and we had some of the commercial book had 100 million of reserve and that was primarily real estate appraisals. So we think having gotten through all that, a lot of that's been caught up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I mean you didn't give a specific provision outlook, but absent the 100 million, 109 for loan sales and then 200 for impaired loans, I mean ex those things, your provision run rate on a quarter looks 300 million lower. Is that fair just to exclude those things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's fair to definitely include the sale. I think the others &#x2013; we hope we are optimistic that that is exactly the case and hopefully what you're suggesting is how it will play out.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. If I could just follow-up on John's net interest income question. If we take out the purchase accounting accretion and the cash received number, I realize those can be volatile, but if we think ex that just the underlying net interest margin and the underlying net interest income dollars, how should we expect that to perform in the back-half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the challenge is going to &#x2013; clearly the low interest rate environment is going to put some pressure on that, but the real determination is going to be loan growth. If we're able to replace loan run offs, then I feel pretty good about that. If we can't replace loan run offs, then that will be a challenge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And your best guess at this point in terms getting some loan growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a pretty challenging environment and, Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say that what we've seen is the decline has slowed dramatically. And so, we're still seeing some decline, but it's not like it was over the last 18 months. And there are pockets of loan demand that we're seeing, especially in the business credit space, but the utilization rate by middle market and above companies is still at an all-time low. And so I think if we're flat for the rest of the year, I think we'd be pleased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just separately, I know we don't know what the new pricing for interchange will be, but can you remind us what your actual revenues are for the debit card interchange?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we were about for the first six months of this year, it's about 215 million. So obviously it would only be a portion of that that we might lose.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, it's little of a, I guess, just a nuance, but if I look at the other intangible assets, they came down a fair amount quarter-to-quarter and obviously that's accretive to capital and I didn't know what was driving that. I think it went from 3.3 billion to 2.7 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You had two factors. One is the MSRs in our residential book came down about 300 million, and we also sold Red Capital, a subsidiary we had there, which also had mortgage servicing rights. So the two of those together is what the decrease is.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. So you increased your ROA target from 1.3 to 1.5?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's your thinking behind that and why now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think we've &#x2013; we're more comfortable with the cost save number that we've been able to achieve. There's no question about that. Obviously, we've &#x2013; we're optimistic about the provisioning in the second half of the year as a result of the delinquencies in the non-performing loans, and we finally have the financial reform in place and I think we have a better handle on what that might mean to us. And so if you take out the integration expense in the second quarter, we were pretty close to 1.3 in the second quarter alone, so the idea of moving to 1.5 I think is something that we're comfortable that we could achieve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when do you think you could get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a big part of that, you got to tell me what the economy is going to do. If the economy continues to have a slow growth, I think we can achieve that over time, over a reasonable period of time. The real question is do we get loan growth back, and if we get loan growth back, then maybe we don't get the 1.5 on assets, but net income goes up significantly, and so we would actually prefer. It's a little interesting. We would prefer perhaps not to hit the 1.5 and get a lot of loan growth which will enhance EPS, so it depends. It depends on how the variables work together, as you well know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Mike, the 1.5% was never a specific date. It was what the business model can achieve through the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And let's assume there's not much loan growth for a while. What are some of your options of how to deploy your capital? And when might we see you deploy some of your capital which is higher than a lot of peers and what about the next acquisition, since National City so far has gone well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think when you look at the capital position, I mean it all depends on how long, right? I think how long we have this kind of environment and if you assume that the loan demand returns in the first quarter next year, we'll be pretty pleased about that and life turns out to be pretty good. If rates go up for whatever reason, which we're not expecting, I might add, or being able to invest in higher yielding assets with our low cost deposits is a real enhancement for the shareholder as well.</p>
          <p>If we remain at this, in this kind of a doldrums, which we could, I think we have the ability to continue to take out cost, but we're not going to bet on 2% treasuries because that's just &#x2013; that's creating another problem for yourself. So I think we have the ability to bring down credit costs and bring down operating costs in order to utilize &#x2013; to generate EPS and the other part is we have excess capital. If loan demand continues to fall, I think at some point we return capital to the shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mike, like you, we'd all like to have more clarity on what the capital rules are going to look like and we all have to wait till the end of the year presumably to get a better read on that. So given that we're in a position where we're growing capital and we want to be on the high end of that compared to our peers whenever a determination is made around capital standards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you say end of the year. I mean how do we know when that milestone happens? It sounds like you're waiting to return capital for more clear indication from regulators. Why at the end of the year do you think you'll get that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the prediction right now as to when there's going to be clarity around Basel III and that's about the best information we have today.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy [RBC Capital Markets].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. A question on the loans that you guys sold, that you're going to sell in the third quarter, I think it was the home equity loans, you mentioned resi mortgages. What price did you receive relative to where you were you were carrying them? I think you said you were carrying them about $1 billion on a face value of $2 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we ended up getting about 10 &#x2013; we took a provision hit for about 10% of the customer balance effectively because it was 2 billion of customer balances. So we were carrying them at around $0.60 on the dollar. We sold them at 50, that kind of the thing. But the key here is what we avoided in terms of future deterioration on some of those costs that would have come in the future and over 8,000 loans that ultimately go to foreclosure and end up with 8,000 properties coming into OREO. I think that's &#x2013; it was the most serious delinquent book we had and we wanted to get rid of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerard, as you know, when you're selling distressed assets and you start with real estate, you break your assets down into the A, B, C, D buckets and you take your C and Ds and sell them as fast as you can because you never get your value back out of them. And you may manage your Bs and you always hang on your As because they recover.</p>
          <p>The same is true, I think, and we looked at this portfolio. This is the worst portfolio we had and we didn't think frankly that the market would open for such assets, but we were delighted that it did. And the operating cost, as Rick said, of trying to foreclose on all these brokered home equities,</p>
          <p>Very expensive. So I think we're very pleased that someone else was happy to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now what type of buyer purchased the loans?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup. How &#x2013; now is it safe to assume all those loans are on non-performing status or were there some performing ones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a portion that were impaired. There was a portion non-performing. There was a portion that was just late-stage delinquency. It was mixed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. You were talking about the higher ROA that you're targeting. I think I saw in our results, your efficiency ratio this quarter is 51%. What type of number do you think that will fall to, to get to that 150 ROA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that depends on the loan growth. If you get loan growth and you drive NII up through loan growth, your efficiency ratio improves dramatically. So if you get no loan growth, then your NII &#x2013; if you want your efficiency ratio to go up, you can drive your NII down. So that's a relative statement. We would love to see loan growth come back actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think you're well aware, we don't typically target an efficiency ratio. We just think it's about continuous improvement, keep growing revenues faster than expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Circling back with the excess capital that you may be having on your books after we find out what the regulators want for the capital ratios by the end of the year. How important will acquisitions be part of that strategy of deploying excess capital, especially if we don't get this loan growth that right now it seems pretty depressing in terms of the lack thereof for the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well acquisitions, we're very, very pleased with how National City has worked out for us and someone asked a question about what you thought about it, and we paid the right price. We had the opportunity to study the assets actually of National City three times, so we understood the risks that we were taking on, and banks are sold, not bought.</p>
          <p>So a lot of it depends if there's a bank that we would find interesting that is for sale, we would have to have the opportunity to look seriously at it and pay the right price. All of those are key factors. I think we're fairly confident that we can integrate very well. So I mean our confidence factor around that is higher than it's ever been, but we also learned our lesson. You can't pay too much, so acquisitions are always opportunistic as opposed to your strategic goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true. One final question on the acquisitions. Would you consider something transformational outside your market footprint or no, you just want to keep stuff maybe inside the footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You never know what opportunity comes toward you, but I think you've seen the history where we've been able to take costs out more effectively when it's adjacent to our existing franchise. And so we can spread the brand and integrate efficiently and so I think acquisitions are really driven by cost save opportunities to begin with and that's a key point. Buying something in Hawaii, while I like to go there is probably not first up.</p>

Just going back to loan modification, it's something nobody has really talked about, and when you guys have transferred and you say very clearly that if a loan performs in six months, you transfer it back performing status, which is a very understandable move.

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>After six months we haven't seen a lot &#x2013; yet, we have not seen anything go back into non-performing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the other issue is and I think you gave, you already answered it in one sense, was your securities. You used to be very comfortable parking some of your capital in the securities portfolio waiting for loan growth to come back. Now you're getting a double whammy with treasuries at such a low rate, so can we continue to see if the treasuries stay here, you selling off some of your securities portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the decline you saw in the current period was somewhat temporary, just a shift between securities and swaps and some forward purchases. So I think that's just a temporary dip, so I wouldn't look at that as a trend that we're going to start to decline our securities book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you continue to park some capital in there, since you are one of the &#x2013; since you do have a lot of it if there's no</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have to be very careful about purchasing longer term free trade securities. I think it's a double edged sword. It might be good for six to nine months, but it could be very painful if rates rise, which I would expect they would over time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean it's just that we're just probably not going to see loan growth for the next six months, maybe up to a year given where the economy is going. And just wondering what a lot of these, what you guys in the financial industry is going to do as you grow that capital base out and you don't see loan growth and you don't have a opportunity to put it in treasuries either?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are opportunities to purchase assets where we can to get a decent yield there.</p>
          <p>So where we see those opportunities we'll pursue them. And there are areas where loans are doing well, as I think Jim said. Our asset based lending business continues to have a very strong ability to originate loans.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Real quick on expenses. There were some reversal of various accruals in the quarter, so just trying to get a sense, obviously x kind of integration cost what an expense run rate should be? So we just take out those two accruals and integration costs and that's kind of a reasonable number? Obviously know there's more Nat City expense saves coming through.

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Good morning. Couple quick ones. You mentioned this in part, but on the delinquency improvement quarter-to-quarter, can you tell us how much of it was due to the pending sale of the 2 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was a modest impact, probably about a third of the decrease what you're seeing in the residential real estate and the over 90 day. And it did not have much impact at all on the 30 to 89 days and it had about a 135 million impact on the NPL decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>135 on the NPL. Okay, got it. So the vast majority of it was core improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct. That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. The other income line was a lot softer than its run for the last several quarters. Is there anything to mention in there? Were there any one timers or adverse items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there were &#x2013; we had a couple of valuation adjustment because of the low rates on some of our MSR assets. But they're all pretty de minimis. Trading was down primarily also due to that factor because low rates and some of valuations of our customer balances there came down a little bit. It was just nothing in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last quick one. Do you have an idea of the size of the step-up in FDIC expense that you'd expect to start seeing next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not expecting a step-up with the change in the way that calculation works. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is going to really help us out because it's now off risk weighted assets less capital and that ratio we do well. While the rate will go up, the balances will come down for us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Hi. I had a question on the loan and the loan portfolio growth. You indicated in one of your comments, Rick, that you would be looking at purchasing portfolios if there was something interesting and available. And I guess I just wanted to understand how well you are to growth the loan book through that kind of activity as oppose to client-focused loan growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be simply an asset purchase, Betsy. We'd look at the risk/return on a portfolio like that and see what the opportunities are. And some people are selling assets because of their capital position, but we would have to look at the risk/return first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't always assume the purchase doesn't mean we can't complement our customer activity within our footprint or within some of the sectors we operate in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I ask the question in part because of the CRE exposures that you have, I mean relatively high quality, small as a percentage of total loans, small for your type of institution. And given the fact that there is some restructurings going on in that space, I'm a little surprised to see that your CRE book hasn't increased a little bit more potentially from this type activity. Is it that you just haven't seen anything that hits your hurdle rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Betsy, I'm sorry, you broke up a little bit. What was the first part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the basic &#x2013; the reason for asking the question is on the CRE book. Your CRE exposures were obviously small relative to peers and I would think you have room there to grow through this kind of purchase activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do, and actually we're looking at our middle of the servicing book which gives us more information on commercial real estate than almost any other opportunity. One of the things, there's a lot of commercial real estate that comes due over the next two to three years and we have the opportunity to look at assets that where we have the cash flows of the asset, we know when the loans are going to mature or when the prepayment penalty rolls off and we have the opportunity go in there and refinance.</p>
          <p>I will tell you, though, that most of those properties won't refinance ahead of time because of the rates that are on the prior financing, because the spreads were so much narrower when five and six years ago when they were put out in the first place. But that is an opportunity for us, yes, and we're pursuing that as those maturities come through.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Rick. Couple quick questions for you. On Page 4 you've mapped out your loans to assets and the percentage of the balance sheet that's in investment securities. Where would you expect to see that in a more normal operating environment once we start getting &#x2013; whenever year we start to see loan growth again, where would that loan to asset ratio migrate up to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see it changing from where we traditionally have been. I think loans have been about 55% of total assets. Given our risk profile, we'd love to grow it, but I don't see us going into sectors that we're not comfortable with. So I don't see that changing dramatically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then regards to the sales that you made, and maybe I missed this in your comments, but when &#x2013; the demand for loan sales is clearly increasing. Do you intend to make more sales going forward? And you said there were several buyers. I'm wondering if you could provide a little more color as to what their demands are in terms of if they've made any requests for certain types of loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's, I mean there's a broad answer to that question. I think you have to look at the risk/return. There's a number of &#x2013; there's a significant portion of our distressed book where we believe that the asset value will be fully recovered at our current book value. So those we would probably not want to sell in a rapid fashion. There are others like the ones that we just sold where clearly they were the low end of the food chain, and we were more than happy to have someone else try and recover those. So it's really a mixed bag across the board. So it's very hard to say what level we would sell them because it depends on the return and the risk that we're taking.</p>
          <p>So I think you'll see it continue to shrink over time, as it has already, but we would be opportunistic in our sales. With regards to buyers, I mean we found multiple buyers for that portfolio. So different people have different appetites, but the market is opening up. I mean, there's a lot of liquidity sitting on the side lines and people are starting to aggressively bid on assets in a way that they didn't even six months ago. I think you saw that there were two commercial mortgage backed securities books that are going to go public in the next quarter or so. I think that really is indicative of how the market is changing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just two follow-up questions. One on expenses. I think, Rick, you had indicated before to me that any further increases I guess in cost savings from National City would start being reinvested into revenue opportunities. Is that how we should be looking at the increased cost savings target right now? Or maybe they'll fall to the bottom line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we've been looking all along through this entire period making investments in our products and services. And we feel it's very important that we develop those today as we have an opportunity to grow this business when the market returns. So I wouldn't look &#x2013; I would look some of that will go to the bottom line. Some of that will be re-invested.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second part of the question was on the Reg E impact in the second half of the year. The 145 million, is that somewhat higher than your previous guidance and does it not assume any loss mitigation efforts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we did was we changed the Reg E guidance to give it you pre-tax. Previous guidance we've given to you after tax, and I think we changed that because I think people were getting confused about the impact on revenue. It's the same number. It just happens to be a pre-tax number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
