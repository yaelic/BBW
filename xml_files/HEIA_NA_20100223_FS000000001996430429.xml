      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. No, I'm not coming out of my bed. A very warm welcome to our 2009 Results Session. Also for the people who are following us through &#x2013; from the webcast, a very warm welcome. As ever, I'm joined by Ren&#xE9; Hooft Graafland, our CFO, who will take over after my short presentation and take you one &#x2013; a little bit more deeply into our regional results and performance.</p>
          <p>Let me start by highlighting the results. As you all know, we went through a fair &#x2013; fairly turbulent year, and that resulted in an organic decline of our volumes sold of 5.4%. However, due to strong pricing that we could exercise over the year, however our revenue level was kept more or less stable.</p>
          <p>And the particular attention we have to our cost management program, and I will come into details to that, allowed us to post a EBIT performance on an organic base of 14%.</p>
          <p>The difference between the EBITDA and the organic number being on the one hand, first time consolidations, and on the other hand, some quite hefty ForEx losses that we incurred this year. And Ren&#xE9; will go more into details in that. And that resulted in a very healthy net profit, organic net profit growth of 18% of the year, for the year.</p>
          <p>Another important result this year is our good free operating cash flow performance. We kind of tripled that. And that has allowed us to reduce significantly our net debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.3 at the start of the year to 2.6 at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now the highlights of that, and I will now &#x2013; sort of a menu of what I will go through with you. We had indeed a quite challenging economy and that has affected our beer sales in particularly in the developed world to a much lesser extent in the developing world.</p>
          <p>But as I said earlier, our revenues were improved, higher revenues per hectoliters and that largely offset that lower volume. Now all regions in Heineken have contributed to the organic EBITDA growth. And we have been focusing this year on three key operational priorities, and that is, the Hunt-4-Cash program, to create that free operating cash flow that we just reported and I showed to you. The Total Cost Management program, which delivered this year 155 million savings. And than a focus from the management on the recent acquisition, the operations that we recently acquired over the last two years.</p>
          <p>And then finally, and also very importantly, it's often said that in crisis times you should take opportunities. We have taken some strategic actions over the year 2009, three main actions. It is the completion of our brewery in South Africa, which was already announced. But it started its operations in September of 2009.</p>
          <p>It is the agreement that we could sign with Dr. Mallya about the future of United Breweries, securing our position in India. And last but not least of course, the intended acquisition of the beer activities of the FEMSA Company.</p>
          <p>Now, let me go now a little bit more in detail. Underlying the good performance is a margin improvement. And here I show you a table, which shows the gross margin's improvement and the operating margin's improvement region-by-region. And you will see that in Central Europe, Africa and the Middle East, the Americas, Asia Pacific, all these regions could increase and the gross margin, that is largely due to pricing action, but also to slightly reduced input costs. And the operating margin's difference being the efficiency that we have been showing in our cost management.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, the change is still slightly negative, but that is due to the dilution effect still of the integration of Scottish &amp; Newcastle into Western Europe. If you would look at it in an organic way, stripping out the effect of the first four months, which were not consolidated in '08 for Scottish &amp; Newcastle, you see a margin improvement both on gross margins and operating margins in all our operations in Europe too. So bottom line, I think that, that is what underlies the good performance that we have been posting.</p>
          <p>Another important success measure is of course development of our flagship brand, Heineken. It's often said and I'm often asked, whether the down trading is not affecting the Heineken brand because it's so premium. Now, this graph shows you that, wherever we have to suffer an organic decrease of our sales, you see that the decrease of the Heineken sales are to a lesser extent than our total portfolio. And whenever we can still increase our sales like in Asia and Africa and the Middle East, which are still growth areas in absolute terms, we could even grow faster with the Heineken brand. That is just to give you also comfort and ourselves, also. By the way, that the strategy of building a strong premium brand in all the markets where we operate is despite the crisis, still the right one.</p>
          <p>We have been announcing earlier this year, on the results of last year, a new Hunt-4-Cash program. And the aim was to reduce as quickly as possible our net debt / EBITDA ratio back under 2.5 times. This followed of course the Scottish &amp; Newcastle acquisition we have been financing by means of cash and indebtment. This program has been launched.</p>
          <p>This has been mainly aimed at improving our net working capital, and all the operations across Heineken have been taking that very much at heart. Now let me say also that all our operations have been properly incentivized to do that job. And also, we reduced quite significantly our level of CapEx during the year 2009, went down from over a billion to around 700 million on a yearly basis without doing injustice to the needed investments for product integrity and safety, I have to say. And of course the increased profitability I referred in the previous chart.</p>
          <p>Now that all has been left to a free operating cash flow as you see that steeply increased, three times the level of 2008. And you see over the year, how the net debt / EBITDA's ratio went down according to our plans. And going forward, being under that 2.5 times EBITDA still remains high on our agenda.</p>
          <p>We also announced at that time, a successor program to the previous cost cutting program, which was called the Fit2Fight and which you will remember over the period seven, six and eight yielded &#x20AC;465 million of gross savings across the Company.</p>
          <p>We are in the first year of the successor program, which is called Total Cost Management. It's base is a bit broader than Fit2Fight and over the first year we are pleased to report that we have been able to achieve 155 million savings before tax in the first year. And that went with 170 million restructuring charges, exceptional restructuring charges that we &#x2013; also before tax.</p>
          <p>You can see from this chart, where did it came from. You see that the lion's share of that program is still coming out of Europe, Western Europe as well as Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the head office, which is located in Western Europe. You see the functional split, the supply chain, which in the Fit2Fight tended to have the lion's share of the savings, is now 36%, still the main contributor to that program. In that, the twelve breweries, all in Europe have been announced to be closed, some already closed, seven out of the 12 are already closed.</p>
          <p>We have also closed and completed four maltery plants. It resulted in head counts reduction of 2,500 people, for a big part also in Russia. It is not a hobby, but it is also a matter of necessity and certainly in the wake of the crisis that we have had to take and that wave we had on our Company, we had to react quite forcefully and quickly on these new realities.</p>
          <p>The commercial departments in some countries have been reorganized for more efficiency, mainly in Poland, Russia, Greece and the U.K. We have been streamlining our wholesale operations in France, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.K., again. And the others that is mainly less charges in the headquarter and on the other hand in the non-product related purchasing that we have been improving in a very significant way across Western Europe.</p>
          <p>There is still more to come, of course but as ever we will not say what is going to come but we will report from six months to six months, what we will have been doing. Mind you, the program is still there for another two years to come.</p>
          <p>A lot of management attention goes into the improvement of the performance of the newly acquired businesses over the last few years. We have been acquiring a vast amount of new businesses. And so, as you can imagine, we have to close a gap for making up for our work. We are not yet there complexibly on all these portfolio, but we are making good steps. And in practically all the newly acquired businesses, we have been making significant progress towards value creation, so that is something we are also very happy about, though I have to mention, the work is not finished yet.</p>
          <p>I have singled out two key markets, which are Russia and the U.K. First in Russia, the market was down quite a bit as you all know and you've known from our competitor this morning. We were even more down. We have been in a exercise of fundamental restructuring. We have been axing all the part of our portfolio of SKUs that were really not profitable and without outlook of being ever profitable.</p>
          <p>So, we've been clearly sacrificing volumes, capacities, organization in order to maintain a market share, which is more sustainable going forward. Having done that, we have also improved our operating results in a very, very significant way in Russia, where previously we were very much on a strategy of volume, we have now also shifted to a more value strategy as we generally pursue in our Company with quite good results so far.</p>
          <p>The second big turnaround operation in the U.K., I said it already at the half year results, we are kind of turning the corner in the U.K. Still the markets were down, but I know of some other markets, which are worse than the U.K. today. Certainly, the U.K. was the first hit by the crisis and the recession, but we see also early signs, still very weak, of relief in the U.K. But what stems us to optimism is that we gained market share. So in a market where complexively if you add Ciders and Beer when still down a little bit north of 2%, we could improve our market share to 1.4% on the long alcoholic drinks, and we saw the category of Cider even in this recessionary time, still increasing at healthy rates.</p>
          <p>We have been reducing the costs of course. But we have also been improving our margins and taking price, taking the lead in this market to restore the margins in this industry to a more healthy level. I've said it many times, the margins in the industry in the U.K. are unsustainably low and it is our task to bring them to a better and a healthier level. You don't do that in one year, but you have to do it year-after-year, bit-by-bit. And together with investments in brands, which we continue to do. We have championed brands here, Strongbow, Foster's, John Smith and Heineken and <mark type="inaudible" /> are all very good brands and so we continue to invest in these brands to continue to increase our market share.</p>
          <p>A final note on the S&amp;N synergies as a whole. We have now been completing the whole synergy program on the whole of the S&amp;N acquisition, which not only encompassed the U.K., but also Ireland, Belgium, Portugal and Finland and the 184 million announced synergies have been realized in full, and these are not included in the 155 million you &#x2013; from the TCM. So we are not double counting these here.</p>
          <p>And you see on the right corner, that we made improvements in all the smaller markets, which we have been recently acquiring.</p>
          <p>Let me now go to the strategic part of the agenda. This is a quite a busy chart, but just to look to have a kind of a recap of all what we have been building, acquiring over the years 2008 and 2009. We have been kind of entering 13 new markets and here you have the list.</p>
          <p>And strategically, Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which we took over in 2008 had the aim of cementing our leadership in Europe, making us the first brewer in Europe and excluding Germany, we would have market share of 30% complexively in Europe. But it's always with the view that a successful operation is the one where you command the number one or a number two position. So in the Scottish &amp; Newcastle acquisition, all the underlying operations had these kind of positions for us to build on. That is one. The second strategic rationale was to acquire a stake in India. It took us quite a while to make that work, but now we're there. That was the second leg of the strategic rationale behind the acquisition of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, I will come back to India. Then we'd intended acquisition of FEMSA for obvious reasons, I will come back for that. And all of these bolt-ons, on the regional or on a national level, which it makes for the latter part of the chart.</p>
          <p>There are three important actions or deals if you will that have been made in 2009. There is &#x2013; that's our new operation in the Republic of South Africa, India and FEMSA Cerveza, those are three actions that have strategically transformed our growth profile for the longer term. And let me take you through these three, one-by-one in the reversed order of appearance in the year, starting with the Americas and the intended FEMSA acquisition. Now much have been said about it, much have been written about it. It is all about transforming our position in the Americas and transforming the global profile of Heineken. But it's all about our position in the Americas, in Mexico, Brazil and the U.S.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., it's about accelerating growth. We were handling the FEMSA portfolio now for five years. We have been showing quite some impressive growth with the FEMSA portfolio, it is motivating and it's a good guarantee long-term for the growth profile of Heineken USA to have the Mexican brands on board. Since they are in here, an intrinsic growth potential is perhaps bigger than with our Dutch portfolio. So we thought there is a very compelling strategic argument for growth and also cementing our weight &#x2013; our commercial weight with the independent distributors' network in the USA.</p>
          <p>Brazil, we acquired a number three. Some might say that that is a too weak position to build on. We've taken on the view, we have had a stake in the Kaiser, the so-called Kaiser operation in Brazil for many years. Under the management of FEMSA over the last year, this operation has been a really revived. Thanks to the distribution network of Coca-Cola, the distribution power is much larger than the market share that this operation in Brazil suggests.</p>
          <p>And the fact that the Heineken volumes have been doubling in the year 2009, arguably from a low base, but Heineken is certainly hot on the spot in Brazil. We think that by owning the platform, there will be much more focus in developing the Heineken brand in Brazil in the years coming forward. And we will benefit from the strong distribution capabilities of what is now still called FEMSA <mark type="inaudible" /> Brazil and what would be renamed Heineken Cerveja Brazil.</p>
          <p>And finally, but the lion's share of the deal is of course the acquisition of CCM, Cerveceria Cuauhtemoc Moctezuma as it is called in proper Mexican. And which is all about a beer market, which is still growing, we expect a growth of 2.5%. We have to look beyond the recession, which is also affecting beer consumption in Mexico. Those are strong brands. We have a strategy going forward for Mexico, we see also a potential, a huge potential for the Heineken brand going forward, a little bit to the extent of what we have been engineering with our joint venture of CCU in Argentina and Chile.</p>
          <p>These brands now command a market share of respectively five &#x2013; or seven and 5% with price premiums north of 35%. And that has all been realized in the last eight years since we have been teaming up with CCU in those two countries. And so we see also in Mexico, a kind of way forward to the development of the Heineken brand in the premium segment in Mexico based on the fantastic distribution strength of CCM in that country.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> you can imagine that the brands of FEMSA are interesting for us. A brand like Sol and Dos Equis have certainly potential outside Mexico. We know it from the United States, but we absolutely believe that there is more to come in all the geographies where we operate.</p>
          <p>We have been announcing and confirming that we would drive 150 million out of cost synergies, out of this acquisitions to be realized by 2013. But the lion's share of value creation in this deal is definitely about growing the brands, it's growing the category, it's growing the brands and growing the Heineken sales. So it is not about cost synergies, that is only the lesser part of the deal.</p>
          <p>We expect completion in quarter two, and it's waiting for approval of competition authorities in the three countries where we operate, and as well as the shareholders' approval that will happen somewhere in the month of April.</p>
          <p>Now, India also, much has been said about it. Enormous population, growing aspirational middle classes, brand-conscious, beer is new, is appealing, is sill hampered by a kind of an in-equal unfair excise duty system, but one day that may change. But it is growing north of 10% year-on-year and we have been acquiring a stake of 37.5. That is a controlling stake together with Dr. Mallya on United Breweries, which is the undisputed market leader with close to 50% market share. This is growth for the coming 20 years. The consumptions and you see here, is what's was the consumption of China in 30 to 35 years ago, so you have to think about it long-term.</p>
          <p>The difference with China is this Company or the Company in the sector has been created by private initiative, these are private enterprise. Whereas in China, it was created by the state and still largely motivated by provincial state income. And that means that the price level and the margin levels in India are much more healthier than they are in China. And the way for growth is still coming ahead. There also we will launch the Heineken brand in India based on that distribution platform that will still happen in 2010, I think in the last quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We are in full swing of preparation for that, and on the other hand, we will look for opportunities for the Kingfisher brand in geographies where we operate brand portfolios and distribution strength, which can benefit that brand. Last is South Africa. The new operation is up in running in near to Johannesburg and Sedibeng. You see here the results of both Heineken and Amstel and you see impressive growth rates of 26% for Amstel and 29% year-on-year for Heineken. This is extraordinary certainly in the market, which was under pressure.</p>
          <p>We have a strategy of pursuing our presence in the premium segment with Heineken, Amstel, Windhoek but also premium cider. We launched Strongbow recently. We do that in a joint venture with Diageo both in the production as well as the commercialization and that has been delivering very strong results up so far. The financial results are going to flow from 2010 because remember that we were importing Amstel, selling a non-returnable bottle of Amstel at the price of a returnable bottle. So we were losing on every bottle we were selling. So you can expect that this Company will turn into profits as from this year and as you see, performance is very encouraging.</p>
          <p>Now all these, I would say these actions in the new markets where we entered recently, have of course changed the global &#x2013; the global profile of our Company. You see here what it means in revenue, and in size and in hectoliters, expressed as a pro forma 2008. We have taken 2008, because we do not have the results of our competitors as yet and also of our own joint ventures not yet completely. But it's just to show you an order of magnitude of reaffirming ourselves in the top league of the brewing industry, where we want to continue to play.</p>
          <p>Another feature is, and I'd like to insist on this one. It is that we've often said that Heineken is underexposed to emerging markets. Now, I want to point out that in 14 of the fastest-growing markets as they are expected to grow, in the next the coming period here, it is a take on &#x2013; I think on the Plato basis from '08 to 2015. Where the numbers will be, I mean this is an estimation of Plato. But those are amongst the 14 fastest growth market in the world and you see that we have sustainable good positions in at least 10 markets out of these 14.</p>
          <p>So, we might not be in with a very significant presence as an example in China, but we entered Brazil and Mexico in a significant way as well as India. Vietnam is a highly growing market and we are the number player &#x2013; the number two player there, but the number one player in value. Vietnam is already today the third largest market for Heineken Premium, as an example and proof to that. So, we have a presence more and more that builds up towards the more emerging part of the world as this slide shows. And finally, what I'd like to share, which is a little bit of constructed picture here.</p>
          <p>First of all those are 2008 numbers. For the same reason we do not have yet the &#x2013; all the numbers for our JVs in 2009. But that is just to show the balance and the weight of regions in terms of volumes and in terms of EBIT operating profit. On the upper part of the slide is without FEMSA and on the lower part of the slide, it is with FEMSA. And that shows you how the FEMSA Cerveza deal has transformed the profile of the Company. I have to add here that India is not counted in, so the whole volume of India is not. It will be accounted as from 2010, so you will be able to add another 10 million hectoliter to the Group volume here.</p>
          <p>But you see clearly how the profile has been changing. It's a little bit a gradation of maturity in the markets. We are now having 40% of our EBIT coming out of the emerging markets, still 60 coming out of the developed. But we pride ourselves also, to drive profit growth out of the developed market, even so in very hard circumstances as we have had in the past years.</p>
          <p>And we are a Company which tries to diversify its risk profile and no one single country up so far have had more than 10% of the operating profit. That might be slightly different with Mexico, I think they will go slightly over that. But we try to have a very diversified appeal, which is a little bit out of historical growth obviously, because our Company started to grow first on an export mode establishing the brand Heineken in 170 countries in the world, where we operate with full fledged portfolios, only 70 countries in the world. So we always pursue that dual strategy.</p>
          <p>Now, that shows you how the latest acquisitions have been rebalancing our growth profile. And once more, the developed markets are there for the cash flow, for the short-term and they can still deliver growth in terms of profits. Markets like South America, are therefore the medium term growth, I think in the coming 10 years due to also premiumization. And whereas our position in Africa, and in the subcontinent of India, they are promised for growth still for another 20 years. So that's how a little bit, how we build up the kind of growth profile of our portfolio of businesses, all over the world on short, medium and longer-term.</p>
          <p>With that, I close my presentation about the 2009 numbers, with giving you an outlook on 2010. The outlook is as following. The consumer spending will remain we think, rather weak particularly in the developed world. I have to add, it's not here on the notes but that's what we mean to say.</p>
          <p>Beer consumption will remain under pressure, once more in Europe at large as well as in the United States. The average price increases that we will be able to take, it will be lower obviously than in 2009. This is largely due to a lower raw material cost, and so less arguments, and also a recession affecting consumer spending.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we see energy costs rising again as you might have noticed as well as a slight rise again on the marketing cost. <mark type="inaudible" /> about the observation of the environment and what concerns our action we will continue to focus on increasing our brand investments particularly in developed world. We take the view that if the pie is shrinking we have to take a larger stake of the pie. Now you can buy it or you can build it. And to build it in a sustainable way with profitable margins, you have to invest in your brands and your customer relations. And going forward, we will certainly pay more attention to that. As early experienced in the U.K. or in Belgium or in Portugal and certainly in France has shown us that that is the way to go forward even in declining markets in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>TCM savings will continue as ever, as well as our cash generation program, the Hunt-4-Cash will still aim at a cash conversion rate, sorry, north of 100%. With as ever and even after the intended acquisition of FEMSA Cerveza, a reduction of our indebtment level back to under 2.5 times EBITDA. We will continue to focus on these new markets. As I indicated, we have to create value there. We have a very strict following-on on value creation in all these 30 new markets that we entered in and we will focus of course on the completion of the FEMSA deal and the integration. And as you can imagine, we are already full swing in the preparation of the integration so that at closing, we can swiftly proceed.</p>
          <p>With that, I close my outlook. Thanking you for your attention, and before I hand over to Ren&#xE9;, I will show you a commercial. This time it is not a Heineken commercial, it's our new brand, Dos Equis. And please discover it and tell me afterwards if that is a brand for the U.K. Thank you for your attention.</p>
          <p>[Advertisement]</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> campaigns, this is already four years old, I believe or five years old. Those are campaigns, which have been designed in the United States of America by Heineken USA, when we signed the contract with FEMSA. So what is very seldom is that the brand owner gives you not only the sales, but also to do the marketing. And this is what our people in the U.S. together with a very good agency have been producing.</p>
          <p>And ever since, The Most Interesting Man is still going on, with his story traveling the world around and touring into the United States. And this has been a quite an unconventional way of doing advertising for beer. Saying, "I don't always drink beer, but when I do." Stay thirsty, my friends.</p>
          <p>Ren&#xE9;, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, as usual I take you much more through the details. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois has given you the broad overview and the highlights. And let me start with the revenues. The revenues increased to 14.7 billion and the first time consolidations added 1 billion or 7% to that. And that is in fact the first four months of S&amp;N, which were not in 2008.</p>
          <p>Currencies reduced revenue by over 600 million or 4.4% and that relates mostly to the Polish z&#x142;oty, which fell 22 &#x2013; 23%. The Russian ruble was 21% and the naira in Nigeria was 14%. On revenues, the U.S. dollar had a slight positive effect. As you can see on an organic basis, revenues were only 0.2% lower despite the 5.4% organic volume drop we had due to the recession, but also excise duties and other economic reasons. But price mix contributed 4.5% and that is driven by higher prices. That is driven by the sales mix. Again as Jean showed, the Heineken brand outperformed the total portfolio and that was also driven by the discontinuation of some lower margin and lower value SKUs. And so that almost offset the 4.7%, which was the impact on revenues of the volume drop. And this proves that our value strategy is effective even in very difficult market circumstances, but it is also a proof of the strength of our brand portfolio that you can do things like you see here on the picture.</p>
          <p>Looking at the EBIT, increased 8.2% to 2.1 billion, and when you take out the ForEx effect and when you take out the consolidations, the organic EBIT growth, which you see here in green was 14% or 264 million. And the key drivers behind that organic growth were better prices across all regions, the TCM cost savings of 155 million and the lower media costs and improved efficiency of our marketing spend as you have seen as a percentage of revenue. Marketing spend decreased to 11.3%, coming from 11.7% in 2008.</p>
          <p>The effect here in red of the first time consolidations was very limited, the 19 million. And that is the  &#x2013; the first &#x2013; mainly the first four months of S&amp;N. The currency had a much bigger effect, 82 million or 4.2%. And on top of that translation effect, clearly countries like Nigeria, Russia and Poland had to pay more in local currency for their imported materials, which have had currency <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Here on the slide, you see the contribution to organic growth of the different regions, and as you can see all regions contributed to the organic EBIT growth. In absolute terms, Africa, Middle East and the Americas were the biggest contributors. In percentage terms, Asia-Pacific but also Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe with mid-single digit organic EBIT growth performed quite well if you place that in the market circumstances they were operating in.</p>
          <p>Going to the net profit, there you see that the organic growth on net profit level was even higher than what we have seen on EBIT level was 18%. The impact of first time consolidations was bigger with 118 million, and that is due to the financing costs related to these acquisitions.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you see that the effect of the foreign currencies on net profit was substantially lower than the effect, which it had on EBIT level. And that is mainly because in the two of the most affected countries, Nigeria and Poland, we have substantial outside shareholders with an substantial minority interest in these companies, so that offsets it again.</p>
          <p>Net profit before exceptional items increased 4% to 1.55 billion, and the reported net profit increased to over 1 billion compared with the 200 million last year. As you know, last year we had significant exceptional cost and this year we had even a slight positive on the exceptional cost.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cash flow, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois already showed it, but since the Company has taken that as a top priority, I will repeat some of the good things which were already in the slides of Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. Because we've incentified and targeted the whole organization on increasing the cash flow and reducing debt with our Hunt-4-Cash 2 program. And you see the results are great, we have a cash conversion in the first year of that program of 148%. We reduced CapEx to below 700 million coming from years of 1.1 billion. And also for 2010, we forecast again a CapEx level of around 700 million.</p>
          <p>Main working capital, reduced to 4.4% of revenues, coming from 7.3% of revenues in 2008. And so this strong cash flow generation and the 1.2 billion additional increasing it to 1.7 billion helped us to lower net debt and bring it down to 7.7 billion and the net debt to EBITDA ratio is now 2.6 times compared with the 3.3 we had last year. And as you know, our aim is to bring it below the 2.5 times.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you on a small tour through the individual regions. Before I do that, one general comment, because I don't want to repeat that by every market, obviously especially in Europe and in the USA. The recession affected markets in a big way. You saw that consumption was going down, you saw a shift from the on-premise to the off-premise and you saw consumers trading down. That's a general trend in these markets, so I won't repeat that for every single market.</p>
          <p>Let's then start with Western Europe, our most important region with 38% of the total profitability. And again in 2009 despite all the difficult circumstances, we increased the profitability in Western Europe. So year-after-year, we increase that profitability. The figures you see here on the slide include the first-time consolidations of S&amp;N, but when you look at the organic figures, we delivered mid-single digit organic EBITDA growth despite volume decline, organic of 5%. And that is the result of better revenues per hectoliter, and that resulted in revenue, which was almost stable in Western Europe and huge TCM savings. A big part is coming out of Western Europe and they contributed 63 million to that.</p>
          <p>The Heineken brand performed better than the total portfolio and decreased in Western Europe only 2.1%. And even in countries like France and Portugal, the brand experienced growth. Individual countries in the region, most contributed to this EBIT growth. Two exceptions, Italy, mainly because of the wholesale suffering from the decline in the own-trade, and Ireland very much affected by the strong decline of the market. But the market like Spain grew EBIT, thanks to cost reduction and strong pricing which exceeded the effect of a 5.5% decline in volume.</p>
          <p>We lost some market share in Spain. You see in Spain a fast increase of the private labels, that is in segment where we don't want to operate in, given the low margins. And you see that we accepted some market share loss there, but overall profitability in the country was good. And we closed during 2009 the Arano brewery in the north. The French market was a bit of an exception in Western Europe, it was a market which was growing, helped by the very good summer. And Heineken France increased its market share as well in volume as in value. As you know, Heineken France is the biggest in the market, value wise and the volume gap with the number one is decreasing every year.</p>
          <p>The volume of the Heineken brand in France grew even over 8% and that confirmed further the value leadership as a single brand of Heineken in the French market. France worked hard on the cost side, they closed the Fischer Brewery in Schiltigheim and their EBIT was up.</p>
          <p>Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois mentioned already the U.K., but also in other former S&amp;N countries like Portugal and Finland, we increased the profitability. Both countries increased the volume of the Heineken brand, decreased cost and EBIT were up.</p>
          <p>The operating margin in Western Europe, down if you include the first time consolidations. If you would strip that out, the operating margin would have been 80 basis points higher. Let's then go to Central and Eastern Europe. Clearly the region most affected by the economic recession and certainly heavily hit by the devaluation of several currencies. Consolidated volumes were down over 10%, organically. Volume decline is not only the result of the weak economy and down trading, but also our deliberate choice of SKU rationalization mainly in Russia, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois explained.</p>
          <p>If you would exclude the decline of Russia, in the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, volumes were down around 5%. Organically, EBIT grew driven by very strong pricing and by lower cost. However the currencies had a negative effect of 39 million on EBIT. That is the translation part of currencies. Next to that, we have 80 million of transaction effect of the currencies, as companies like Poland, like Russia they buy or in local currency, obviously, their input raw and packaging material costs, which are quoted in hard currency, get the hit.</p>
          <p>Heineken brand was 9% lower in the region, but Russia and Poland taking more than half of that decrease. And in countries like Austria and Serbia, the brand was growing. Poland, the market down by 10%, Grupa Zywiec, our company in Poland grew market share and especially Warka and the Desperados brand which is launched a little bit more than a year ago, really performed well and increased volume.</p>
          <p>Obviously, with the devalued z&#x142;oty, the EBIT in euros was lower. But thanks to strong pricing in the region and strong cost measures, the operating margin in the region grew by 110 basis points to 11.6%.</p>
          <p>Africa and Middle East, as we have said already many times, was much less affected by the crisis and the developments in Africa are very positive across the region. All metrics improved volume, revenue, EBIT, although the last two influenced by the naira, but despite that they were up. Organically, revenue was up 9% and EBIT double digit.</p>
          <p>The volume of the Heineken brand in Africa reached now 2.3 million hectoliters and grew 12% across that continent. And in particular, South Africa with 29% growth, Nigeria 22%, Algeria 29% as well had very, very strong growth.</p>
          <p>The total volume of the Amstel brand in Africa was up 24% to a great extent driven by the good results in South Africa. Most countries contributed to the organic EBIT growth, including the countries in the Middle East like Egypt, where the volume development was less favorable as in Africa itself.</p>
          <p>In Nigeria, in the second half of the year, we saw a slowdown of the volumes as a result of the banking crisis. Nigeria had their own banking crisis, but also as a result of the public security situation in some regions in the country, which really affect the on-premise consumption.</p>
          <p>In constant currency, EBIT grew in Nigeria in a substantial way but translated it into euros, it was slightly lower than 2008. Operating margins in this region very healthy, improved again by 100 basis points to 25.9%. The Americas, a bit of a mixed picture. On one hand, we see the volume development heavily influenced by the economy and especially the down trading, which we have seen in the USA.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, financially the region is performing very well. EBIT grew 30%, based on pricing. As you know, we increased prices at the end of 2008 in the U. S. and we were benefiting from that for the full year 2009. And we have major TCM initiatives across the whole region and the operating margin improved in substantial way.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., the Dutch portfolio declined 10%, very much in line with the import segment as it is estimated by the Beer Institute. On the contrary, our Mexican portfolio and we can now proudly say our Mexican portfolio almost, did very well. Sale is up 1%, depletion is up 2.4%.</p>
          <p>Dos Equis was by far the star performer with a growth of 20% in the USA. Heineken brand in Latin America doing very well, 11% up. Countries like Chile and Argentina, which we do via our joint venture CCU, there the brand was growing 8%. In Brazil, again in 2009 the brand grew by over 50%, albeit at a small basis, but now already for a couple of years growing very fast. So it becomes meaningful. And the interesting thing is that since we increased the price in Brazil, and we get now to a price index of 155 to where <mark type="inaudible" /> as the main mainstream brand in that market, we see the volumes growing. And that is obviously a very strong starting point for once we own the FEMSA Cerveja Brazil operation, because that will further give you the platform to grow.</p>
          <p>Then Asia-Pacific, consolidated volumes were up slightly up. That was driven by the good performance in Taiwan, where we grew and Indonesia. When you include the APB of volumes, it was slightly down because of declines in countries like Cambodia and New Zealand. In these Group volumes, the volumes of United Breweries in India are not yet in, because we accounted for them and as long as we didn't have the shareholders' agreement, on a different way. And so they were not in Group volume. But as of 2010, obviously they will be in.</p>
          <p>Financially, the region did very well driven by a higher revenue per hectoliter around 8% in the plus. Cost reductions and the &#x2013; also there the financial effect of the SKU rationalization, which we had in China. In China, we are now fully focusing on the premium segment with Tiger and Heineken. And in the Heineken brand performed very well in 2009 with a growth of 19%. APB, Asia Pacific Breweries, increased its EBIT substantially, driven by strong performances in markets like Vietnam, Singapore and Papua Guinea. They have already published their annual results. They have a different fiscal year. So if you go to their site, you can get all details of that. Our own operation in Indonesia grew EBIT as well.</p>
          <p>And in India, where we have now solidified our partnership with Vijay Mallya, UB continued to grow at double-digit figures, 18% in 2009. And they reached in the last quarter of the year even a market share over 50%. They launched Kingfisher Ultra, a premium variant of Kingfisher, which was launched in Bangalore and Mumbai and has very good success and is well received by consumers. And as we have said earlier, we are preparing the launch of locally produced Heineken for the end of this year.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the end of my presentation. Let me summarize. In difficult economic circumstances, very strong result, organic net EBIT growth 18% underlying the success of the value strategy and the TCM cost saving program. The performance of the new markets is improving. We made very good progress with our Hunt-4-Cash program, tripled free operating cash flow, achieved a cash conversion of 148% and we reduced net debt to EBITDA ratio 2.6 times.</p>
          <p>At the same time, strategically we transformed the Company to a much stronger player in the industry. And we improved the growth profile of the Heineken brand via the joint ownership of UB, the leader in India, the expansion in South Africa and obviously the acquisition of FEMSA Cerveza. So the Heineken you see today isn't fundamentally different, but also fundamentally stronger Company than it was before. It's really one of the top players with by-far the most international and balanced strat with huge opportunities across the globe.</p>
          <p>Before we go into Q&amp;A, you'll get a short film as you are used. You know, an important part of our value strategy is continuing to invest behind your brands. You will see here a small video clip of the sponsorships we have around and behind the Heineken brands or how we support and build the Heineken brand. Have a look, that shows you what we do for the Heineken brand, that shows you our way, also that it is quite fun to work for a Company like Heineken. Have a look at it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Jason Derise here at UBS. Three questions. First, you mentioned that income costs would be heading lower and A&amp;P would be heading higher. I think we can get the energy portion of that, but what we're missing is how far A&amp;P is going to step up, maybe you can give a target as a percentage of sales? Could you talk about in Western Europe, this is the second question, you had the S&amp;N synergies come through, you had TCM come through. But you had probably expected the margin to expand a bit more than that 80 basis points organically. So maybe you could talk about what happened underneath that? And then, the last question, the head office profit went up pretty substantially, maybe just talk a bit about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A&amp;P yes, as I had told you, we lowered A&amp;P to 11.3%, also helped by efficiencies and lower rates. You can expect for 2010 that we go back a little bit more to the level we had in 2008. Margin expansion, I think in Western Europe is the 80 basis points is quite well, if you put it against the backdrop of the decrease in the market, but certainly also the decrease in the on-premise market where we have a huge exposure not only with our brewery business but also with the wholesale business, and so that affected obviously. And then your last question is about the head office. As you see in TCM, there was a part coming out of the head office so that obviously helped. Secondly in the head office, there is a number of businesses like our maltery business is reported under that. And so these things helped to the performance, if you can say the performance of the head office.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would you say that that's the new run rate to use? Or I guess what's so hard for us to capture is the maltery side, so I guess as inputs go down that &#x2013; should we bake in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think you should not see the head office as a separate entity because all the &#x2013; most of the business there or the profits which is made there, relates to the business. If we do more central sponsorships instead of local marketing investments, you will see that shifting the other way around. So don't see it as a separate entity, which should be managed as or followed as a separate entity. It's a bit the end of everything, where you have as a revenue, the license fees and the overhaul fee. You have some corporate cost obviously in it, but also the central marketing costs.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen, three questions, please. First one, in the press release, you talk about a temporary fall in raw material prices. Does that imply, you believe the current spot for barley's too low or that you already hedged for 2010 at a higher rate than you are paying for '09? Second question, relating to Africa. It does look very much a game of two of halves, use an old clich&#xE9;. I think organic revenue growth in the first half was 22%, 9% for the full year. Does that imply that organic revenue growth was more or less flat in Africa? And if so, that would imply falling price mix and perhaps you can just give a bit of color. What went on the second half on the revenue and price mix in Africa?</p>
          <p>And the third question, if you look at the acquired business in Scottish &amp; Newcastle, and what was consolidated first time implied a 1% operating margin on the consolidated business at the time it was consolidated. Since then you've added 184 of synergies, plus the TCM savings. How long do you think it will take to get back to pre-crisis levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first two ones and leave the most difficult to Ren&#xE9;. That's the last one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the one I don't want to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we say temporary fall, it is very difficult to predict what the price of raw materials will do. Now, the raw materials fell quite a bit last year, so what most of the brewers did, they contracted in advance and the surplus we have one of the best harvests ever. And so the corporatives and the agricultural sector stood on a very huge surplus.</p>
          <p>Now the usage of that surplus going forward is very limited. You can just sell it to the, to feed the pigs, right? Barley for malting for beer barley, has to be planted separately and that's a very minute part of the overall barley business in the world. Barley being in itself already a very minute part of the whole cereal business. Going forward, what you will observe is that people will seed less and so trying to recuperate on the price. So you cannot automatically go into the assumption that the prices for barley will continue to go down.</p>
          <p>Now, I am much more relaxed on aluminum prices and hope prices are long term contract, so they don't vary a lot. It's a very oligopolistic market. And finally the glass market is also a peculiar one, because glass producing industry is &#x2013; has only fixed cost. And so the only way, pricing is going, is by shutting down or building up new capacities. And so we don't see really these prices really going south. And that's why we said, temporary. Particularly for the barley commodity we have to be extremely careful there. And the second, of course is the quality of the harvest. That can vary by 30% output by hectare depending on climate factors, which is never predictable.</p>
          <p>So your first question, the second question relates to Africa. Yes, it is absolutely a true observation that quarter three has been particularly weak in Africa. Especially in Nigeria, we have seen the business really going down for all the reasons that Ren&#xE9; has indicated about that. Uncertainty and security in Nigeria has been quite a thing we have been holding up our breath and certainly also the unfolding political situation in Nigeria and vacuum of power.</p>
          <p>We have, and last but not least a credit crisis, which occurred there with many banks had to close and restructure. Last quarter however, we have seen business coming back up again. So it's a bit early days now to say where that goes, but we are &#x2013; we feel much more confident than we were, let's say during quarter three of last year. So quarter four was much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then your last question on the S&amp;N businesses. Yes, they are below the standards we have in the Group. And despite the profit increase they had in 2009, they are still substantially below the operating margins, which we have elsewhere in the Group. And that means, that they need to continue to work.</p>
          <p>If you look at the U.K., certainly on the revenue per hectoliter is absolutely still on the low side. We have always said that is not something you restore in one year, you have to do that consistently year after year. You can only do that, if you at the same time invest behind your brands. A thing we have done in 2009, with all the good results, and we will continue that going forward. And we will continue to work on the cost. We have taken out quite a lot of costs already, but there are still two brewery closures really to be effectuated, Berkshire and Benston and we have to clean up a number of things. And the Globe thing has been cleaned up, but there are still pieces in the business where we have to restructure like the Waverley wholesale business to make them &#x2013; to make them operating according to the financial standards which we have in the Group.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Question on the statement that you made about the outlook for 2010. The global economic environment will continue to lead to lower beer consumption and down trading in the number of regions in 2010. Can you elaborate in how many of your &#x2013; which percentage of your markets you see this kind of environment occurring? Second question is on TCM and retention. Looking to the expectations of this weakness in the market and expected TCM savings, how &#x2013; which percentage of TCM savings in 2010 do you expect to let flow to your EBIT line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first, Ren&#xE9; takes the second. The down trading and the perspective on consumption relates to the mature markets, the mature markets in Europe essentially and the premium market in which we operate in the USA. That is what we mean. So Latin America, Africa and the parts of Asia where we operate are in pretty good shape also for what volume growth concern. So that is really linked to the uncertainty through Europe and the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On TCM, yes. First of all, the majority of TCM has been realized in western and central and eastern Europe. Your question, how much flows down to the bottom line is a bit artificial in the sense that, yes, we will continue in a major way to work on TCM. At the same time, we say we will increase our marketing spend in the market. Is that coming from TCM? Is that coming lower input costs? That is a bit how you look at it. What we will do is for sure, continue the effort on TCM, and that will have an impact on the profitability, obviously in 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Matthew Webb from Cazenove. Three questions please. Firstly on pricing, you've guided that there will be a weaker pricing environment this year. I just wondered whether you'd still hope to achieve a normal level of price mix improvement, of say two to 3% or whether you think, given the environment in Europe and the U.S., it will be difficult to do even that?</p>
          <p>Second, I just wanted to clarify on the guidance you're giving on advertising and marketing promotion. Are you saying that's going to go up perhaps a  percent of sales, because you're choosing to spend more or are you actually seeing inflation in those areas? And then finally, on the timing of TCM benefits, do you think, well would you advise us to be conservative and assume that the benefit is somewhat front-end loaded? Or do you think it's possible that the quantum could be broadly similar next year to this? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

            <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On pricing, clearly in the U.S., we have not budgeted for a price increase, normally we do it once every two year. And the last time Corona was not following, so we have not planned that for this year. If there is an opportunity, we will certainly take it, but honestly I don't think that will be there.</p>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe, you will see a regular price increases because you live in an inflationary environment, as it is in Africa for instance. Western Europe will be in mixed picture, we will obviously try to work on pricing in a country like the U.K. As I just said, it's an absolute necessity to restore margins in a country like Spain. Probably we will be very hesitant with price increases, it is what the brands in the market can bear, but it is certainly not that we won't increase prices, absolutely not.</p>
          <p>And shall I take TCM at the same time? When you started, your question said, should I take a conservative look. I wanted to say, yes. But then you said, that means that it is front-loaded. And then I was mixed up with, you mean with conservative. So I would say, look at it in a conservative way, but not with your conclusion add to it.</p>

          <p>If you can translate, that's something because I did not get what he said there. So. And then finally for the guiding on advertising, now you have to realize that's the most competitive sensible information you asked me. So, what I said in my presentation is that, when the cake is coming to kind of shrink a bit, you want to have a larger piece. Now, that comes not for free and this is not a frenzy spending though. It's not happening in all, it's happening in a targeted way, but I am saying yes. We have clear plans in a number of geographies like we have been showing in France or in Portugal or here in the U.K. to invest behind brands, leading brands. Not only Heineken, but also leading national brands, in order to increase our market share. And that demands some effort but that effort is paid back in market share increase. So in that virtual setting, we are definitely going to do our job.</p>

At the first half, you talked about, I think it was 120 million of annualized savings with a 50 million benefit to EBIT. Is the 155 you're talking about today the benefit realized to EBIT?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Performance has been, I think if I recall well, minus 2% it was last year. Accessing to the ex-S&amp;N distribution platform, we have also big reorganizing the distribution, being more selective in the audience, where we want to be, and sustaining the price premium that we want to have. Obviously, the price premium here in the U.K. is not the one you got in the southern part of Europe. I always make that big distinction in Northern Europe, price premiums are much lower than what you have in Southern Europe or in Central Eastern Europe. That is, that has to be said.

          <p>The production rationalization that's taking place in the United Kingdom, which is leading to capacity utilization improvement and the kind of innovations that you have in markets like the U.S. where you've launched the DraughtKeg suggests that you have in your organization insights that can be shared across countries. And I'm wondering to what extent you see the possibility of doing a U.K. like rationalization in other markets that are burdened with excess capacity. And then also with the roll out of innovative products that the DraughtKeg might be into other markets than the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rationalization like we did in the U.K. we do in many countries, Tom. Only in 2009, we closed seven breweries and we have still five breweries already announced for 2010. So we are heavily restructuring our brewery footprint like we do in the U.K. Obviously, also on the positive side, the revenue side, innovations travel from country to country. When you look at a product like DraughtKeg, it has been launched in former S&amp;N countries like Portugal and Belgium and not only in the Heineken brand but also in their leading local brands like Sagres in Portugal. So we really use the knowledge and the innovations and the power we have in the market in other markets, absolutely.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon, Paul Hofman, Chevreux. Just one question left on input cost. Yeah, your competitor this morning was pretty clear about input costs across the regions. Still some benefits in Northwest Europe and a flattish level year-on-year on Central Eastern Europe. What can you say about your input costs hit or benefits that are spread across the regions, and mostly of course what do you expect for Western Europe? A similar benefit and a rather flattish level in Central Eastern Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The big difficulty is so in euro terms, the benefit in Central and Eastern Europe is slightly higher than in Western Europe, but that has do with the mix of certain purchasing contracts. But ultimately, you don't know how it translates in local currency. So the big question is, what the local currencies are doing. But, so I wouldn't look too much at differentiation in the markets based on input &#x2013; on the euro input costs, but much more on what the expectations are or what the developments will be, because nobody knows what the currencies will do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on your guidance, what can at least can you say about Western Europe, which is of course still your biggest EBIT contributor. Do you certainly believe there that &#x2013; that the lower raw materials you talk about will take place there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but we &#x2013; we once more, we have said across-the-board, we will be faced by lower raw material costs mainly driven by malt, but offset by a number of other elements.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just in Central Eastern Europe, you took &#x2013; you mentioned there that the impact of <mark type="inaudible" /> price and excise, and you took about 10% price just for the organics. Could you &#x2013; why did you take so much price in the Central Eastern European Markets? And could you give us an indication what the impact of excise was on the retail prices? That's the first question. The second question is just on South Africa. Could you give us an indication of the swing in the profitability in your associates, now that the brewery is operational, the order of magnitude or some guidance there? And then could you comment on, you said that you plan to expand capacity, is the rumors true that you want to &#x2013; you're looking at a site to build another brewery in Cape Town, or if you would comment on that? Some of your competitors mentioned that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last point, we are currently already expanding the Sedibeng brewery. And we have no other plans so far. We have a brewery in Windhoek, which we operate which means aiming at serving the Cape Town area, and then we have the brewery in Sedibeng, near Gauteng which is currently already under expansion, that's so to be clear on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a brownfield, by how much &#x2013; what percentage is the expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a brownfield, I mean the greenfield &#x2013; it's still a greenfield. The thing is just up and running. I will not give you the number because I &#x2013; you will recall that we have &#x2013; we are under severe competitive pressure in that market. So, but the good news is that we can expand already. Breweries are mostly built on modular expansion, but you always have the brew house is always very big. And then you put your fermentation capabilities, capacities and the bottling capacities as you need and you add them on as a kind of a Lego piece. So that's well thought over and the site is big enough to certainly more than double the size of our production, if need be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally just a question on TCM. Is TCM a three-year program and there is a targeted cost savings in the internal plans? And what happens after TCM? Does management have a better culture of cost savings or another way at looking at cost going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is of course, yes. TCM succeeded Fit2Fight and something will to succeed TCM. Do we have an internal target? Yes, we have and we do and people are incentivized on that and all projects are identified, and we know what we do. Are we working beyond that horizon? When you come halfway, you start already automatically working on that horizon beyond because structural changes they from times &#x2013; ask for preparation time of over a year. So I think with the Fit2Fight already we have embedded looking at cost in a certain way in our organization in a quite rooted way.</p>
          <p>So I would be quite comfortable that that being adopted as a sound discipline of management within our Company. So that is what I can say. Your first question on the pricing in Central Eastern Europe. To Ren&#xE9;'s point, you have quite inflationary &#x2013; in some countries, some inflationary countries where, where, you know, if you don't want to die, you have to increase your pricing. That's as easy as that. On the other hand, countries like Russia, where you still have an inflation, but you had a very big recession on the volume of beer. And we said earlier, we have been curtailing a lot of unprofitable SKUs. That brings your average price per hectoliter in a way mathematically up. So that is what we have been doing so, our average pricing in Russia has been kind of lifted up. So all of these explanations point out. And then, last but not least, our own effort, deliberate effort to try to have a better margins out of the markets where we operate now. All that added up to quite a significant margin improvement in Central and Eastern Europe this year.</p>
          <p>And then I &#x2013; you had a last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the associates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There was just on the &#x2013; on the &#x2013; what is the impact of the excise increase on the retail price? So we can get a sense of the, the pricing <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Where? In Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but the excise duty rates are very different. We operate in 20 countries, so I mean it's going to be difficult to have an average on that. The most noticeable one has been the &#x2013; has been Russia. It went from three euro/hecto through nine euro to hectoliter.</p>
          <p>So in percentage time &#x2013; terms, it's an enormous increase, in terms of an absolute euro per hectoliter, it's still nine hectoliter is, nine euro per hectoliter is just a bit under what the level in Germany is today. And which is the lowest EU level by far. All right, the U.K. is in euros today I think it might &#x20AC;5 per hectoliter. So, you have huge discrepancies and they translate into higher or lower consumer pricing.</p>
          <p>But then again in Russia, you have to translate that into local purchasing power. And that in the wake of a risk &#x2013; on the backdrop of the recession. So how that will play out, we will see I think, over the first half year in Russia going forward. Certainly, the country which has been the most affected by excise duty increase.</p>

So that we can make a comparison with the figures you disclosed at the time.

          <p>I have a question here on -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Chris Wickham from MainFirst. Just want to go back to Tom's comment on capacity. I mean the scale of capacity obviously in the U.K. is quite substantial. I mean &#x2013; withdrawal, I mean it takes out a reasonable sized country in terms of total production. I mean at what point do you think, either using your definition of Western Europe or your definition of say, Western Europe and some, the normal definition of Central Europe or &#x2013; we will actually move into quite a close balance between capacity and beer volumes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You point out, that's absolutely the right question. We take the view that what can kill our operation is having for too long an un-manned &#x2013; a manned over-capacity. The first thing is to un-man it. And then to decommission it because you have to maintain it. It's square meters of roof and what-have-you machinery. That is what kills an industry if you stay in over-capacity status and you start to consider marginal pricing and do all kinds of silly deals will bring you nowhere in the long term. So we have a very strict view of how we de-commission capacity in view of the demand site.</p>
          <p>And the second dimension, is the logistic dimension. When <mark type="inaudible" /> return on the packaging, you have  to view something like 200 kilometers around the chimney, kind of area of working with returnable packaging. And when you go with non-returnable packaging, you can go further and then you have to look really in detail at the ways of the logistics. Whether that is maritime transportation or railroad or <mark type="inaudible" /> being the most &#x2013; trucking being the most expensive one. Now, we have a whole department in the supply chain group who is allocating and optimizing the investment across Europe. And the distinction between Central and Western Europe does not exist in that way. We look at the whole territory of Europe as a one complexive thing.</p>
          <p>But a fourth dimension is important, which is the brand heritage dimension. In some cases, people &#x2013; it really matters where the beer come from. Not every where, but in some geographies think about Austria, places like Belgium or Germany, or the Czech Republic, there still or German's speaking part of Switzerland, you would really take off a lot of consumer franchise if you would take out the kind of historical production location of a brand of beer. Now you have a mix of factors, and that you have all the time to be, to optimize. And bear in mind, over-capacity and manned over-capacity certainly is killing.</p>
          <p>That you put in quite complex models, the logistic part being the difficult part of the model. Because also cans and DraughtKeg and glass bottles, this is not produced necessarily in the same location. So that introduces a whole area of complexity. But you mix it all up by professional people and good models. And that is how we optimize all the time our production supply chain imprint in Europe. And I think currently we are fairing quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you had a, sort of a number that you could talk about. Whether you, maybe if you think of the current U.K. closures, that's taking about between eight and 9% of capacity in your definition of Western Europe out of commission. Not just your closures, obviously the other two are closing as well. But if you &#x2013; I was just trying to get a sense of where does that get you across say using your definition of Western Europe or using a broader definition of Western and Central Europe. <mark type="inaudible" /> say, well you know, actually we're only, we've only got say 20% over-capacity in the entire system, or ten or I mean what sort of number is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we &#x2013; if you look at what the downside of the sales has been, we have been decommissioned 8 million hectoliter over the total European system, over the last 18 months. That's what we have been decommissioned. But frankly, once it's decommissioned, it's there. We keep it, it's away, it's gone. Where we keep our buffer, is it's essentially in the strategic breweries. We have that <mark type="inaudible" />, we allocate a strategic status. And that's again a combination of state-of-the-art technology and logistics, where we keep kind of a buffer for over-capacity.</p>
          <p>The Netherlands is the principal buffer for capacity, we have in the system. Think about when we decided to take our position in South Africa. A lot of the Amstel came out of the Dutch production system, which they could produce on a two-month notice. We got Amstel imported in South Africa after the termination of the brewing agreement with SAB Miller down there. And so they offered the flexibility of doing that kind of thing and that is because they are highly productive, highly automated and logistically very well placed. And that is where we keep our breathing space, if you will. But otherwise we always try to optimize in all places in order to avoid over-capacity. And to the U.K. this after the closing of Berkshire and Dunston, the U.K. will be absolutely optimized, I would say. That has been done quite well. At the end of 2010, we really operate a very good footprint then.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, gentlemen. In 2009, you were quite successful in offsetting <mark type="inaudible" /> organic volume decline with organic pricing. Do you think you'll be able to achieve that type of offset in 2010? And the second question is really at what stage do you think you will be able to give us some net profit guidance for this year?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>We don't know because we won't give you the &#x2013; and we don't know what the volumes will do. Obviously we have our own plans, but that is for ourselves. And linked to that we don't give a profit guidance for the year as we haven't done in the, I think the last two years now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And keeping with Q1 I mean, for that stage you probably got a better feel for pricing for example, particularly in Western European markets. Do you think you will be able to give us better indication in that stage?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at least in Q1 you will see what we have achieved, but as you know, Q1 is a very, very small quarter in our industry, so you get huge swings, but it will be an indication on how markets are behaving. I don't think we will give a guidance at that time, but you get of course more information and a better view on what markets are doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. I have got two questions. First of all, following up from what you said from the further need for restructuring in the U.K. and the closure of the additional breweries. How long would you believe that it's going to take before you are up to Group standards in terms of profitability ratios? My second question is on the U.S., there's been a hint of a rebound of the Heineken brand in the U.S. in the last quarter. Now how much of that renewed interest, is thanks to the new campaigns, or how much has just been luck?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the timing of the Group standards, I cannot give you a precise answer apart from that, every year they need to close the gap. And it depends a little bit also on the volume developments in a market like the U.K. Obviously, in the stable market that is easier to achieve than in an declining market. But what is important and we have seen that in 2009, that the management here in the U.K. works on the right things. That they are successful on the right elements, which means pricing, reinforcing the brands, bringing down the cost and getting rid of some of the issues around the business. And year-after-year they will continue, they will continue that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the U.S., we &#x2013; it was the Dutch portfolio has been in decrease slightly beyond the total import segment, which points out to not yet improving performance into market share. We have been, I've said it many times, we could improve our performance in the United States of America. We have commissioned a new team, a brand new team at the helm of Heineken USA. I see them working in absolutely the right direction. One has to realize that it takes some time before that is going to have its effect. But we stay committed in the growth of our Dutch portfolio in the U.S. going forward.</p>
          <p>That has been &#x2013; have been said, one has to realize and I point out time-and-time again, in the U.S. the big import brands are prone to down trading. It is not because people don't like their brand any more, but they don't buy it, they buy it less often. What we take the view at Heineken or certainly with the Heineken brand, is not to discount it. We keep the price premium as an integral feature of our premium positioning. What the competitor is doing &#x2013; it's their turf, but we take the view that the first feature of a premium and a credible premium brand is to maintain its price premium. And so to accept to that extent of a 10% decrease of sales on a year-on-year basis, as to remain a credible premium brand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon gentlemen. I have two small questions. The first question is, what was the level of depreciation in '09? And the second question, I think you said that the structure of the FEMSA deal will not impact your net debt / EBITDA ratio. Is it therefore fair to assume that you could already reach a level of below 2.5 in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two answers. Depreciation level for PP&amp;E in 2009 was 795. I say it out of my head, but I'm pretty sure it is 795. And we said at the announcement of the FEMSA acquisition that it would not change the net debt / EBITDA ratio, because the last net debt / EBITDA ratio, which was known to the market, was 3.1. And the net debt / EBITDA of the transaction is around that figure. Now we are lower, you will see that including the 1.5 billion debt of FEMSA that it will go up probably 30 &#x2013; 30 basis points. It will stay below the three times, but we move back a little bit. At the same time that is a good incentive for the whole organization to continue to work on cash flow.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ian Kessler from George Weiss. I just have three questions on the most recent FEMSA acquisition. The first one was, was there something one off to the quarter in terms of the U.S. beer portfolio? It seemed to register a pretty sharp decline in the fourth quarter, I believe it was 9%. My second question is pertaining to the price increases just put into the Mexican market. Can you give us any indication on what the volume development has been like, in terms of the market receiving these price increases?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is, in regards to the exclusivities with OXXO. There has been some concern recently regarding NAFTA reviewing these exclusivity arrangements. Is there any contractual protection in your deal with FEMSA, if these were to be reviewed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, we are not in a position to answer what the effect of the price increases. They have increased prices in the beginning of the year in a substantial way, 7% I think. But what the effect is, is not up to us to comment. FEMSA is a public company. So we will not quote on that or comment on that.</p>
          <p>As we won't do on specific arrangements around the deal. As we have said, we have inherited an exclusivity which is around 10 years or to June, 2020 between FEMSA Cerveza and OXXO, so we inherit that exclusitivity and we assume that that stays there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>U.S. portfolio, I don't know. If you look at, there is a difference between sales and depletion so probably it has to do something with that or the year before where we had price increases. So to be honest, you can look deeper into that with our IR department if there's any question. But not that I noticed anything, which gives us a signal fundamentally where you see that the momentum behind these brands is not continuing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions, please. First one, is on southern Europe around 20% of the EBIT. I'm curious how Q4 has been for this part of Europe for your operations here. Second question is on currencies, whether there is significant impact in 2010. What's your expectations of current currency rates with regard to the impact on the P&amp;L in 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To start with the last one, yes, currencies had a huge impact in 2009. I don't know obviously what currencies will do in 2010, as probably you don't know. But, I would expect that you won't get twice the same hit as you had in 2009. And when you look at over 20% for the z&#x142;oty or the ruble and that is not something, which probably would be repeated. You see that that the z&#x142;oty is gaining a bit of strength at least in the beginning of the year, but that stays uncertain. One thing we know for sure is the effect of the U.S. dollar where we have the net profit on our transaction stream with the U.S. 19 million negative for 2010. Where we have covered now more than 80% against a rate of 137 and that will yield a positive effect of around 18 million. So that is under control. And a number of the other currencies you &#x2013; we just don't know.</p>
          <p>Q4, without going into specific countries, but you saw across-the-board that improvement, which we saw in H2 is very much driven by the third quarter and the good weather we had in Europe. Q4, as you can calculate yourself in Western Europe was not particularly good. And therefore, we continue to say that consumer confidence is not yet back. Yes technically, the recession may be over, financial markets may be much more confident, for consumers that is different. You see unemployment rising, you see the burden on people in countries because of increased taxation, excise, etcetera increasing. So where it is for the economist it's behind us. I think for consumers, they are just in the midst of it.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, what is it exactly &#x2013; what do you mean by swing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think that I know what you mean. We go from negative to positive, but we also go from own EBIT to the line associated where you take your share of the net profit. So you don't get the full effect on your EBIT level and that profit level. Obviously, it doesn't make a difference, but in the reporting the effect of South Africa will be diluted, because you get your share of net profit in that &#x2013; out of that market. But it will be a positive effect.</p>
