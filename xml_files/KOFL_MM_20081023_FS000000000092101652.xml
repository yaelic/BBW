        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to capitalize on the benefits of our growing multinational company with a balanced portfolio of assets throughout Latin America. Across the board, organic revenue growth combined with our acquisitions drove our top-line results. Despite adverse macroeconomic conditions worldwide, we were able to increase our operations total revenue by 14.5% and delivered double-digit consolidated operating income growth of 10.3%.</p>
          <p>Among the main drivers of our top line volume growth were our new Remil franchise territory and Jugos Del Valle juice based beverages, which together generate more than 33 million unit cases during the quarter. This alone represented more than &#x2013; more volume than the one generated by our Central American operations in one quarter, or close to 75% of our consolidated volume growth in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Excluding Remil, still beverages driven mainly by the Jugos Del Valle line of beverages in Mexico contributed close to 45% of our growth. Sparkling beverages contributed almost 25% of our consolidated sales volume, and bottled water including bulk water provided the balance.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated average price per unit case increased 4.1% year-over-year, driven mainly by nominal price increases undertaken in our Mercosur division. During the quarter, our consolidated revenues reached Ps.19.8 billion. Our gross profit increased 10.9%, driven mainly by increased gross profit from our operations outside of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Higher sweetener and resin costs in some of our operations outside of Mexico, combined with the expected lower profitability of Jugos Del Valle line of beverages during this year, were partially offset by lower sweetener cost in Mexico. Our third-quarter consolidated operating income reached Ps. 3.2 billion. This increase resulted from lower operating expenses, which were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of sales than the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated EBITDA reached Ps. 4 billion resulting in an EBITDA margin of 20.3%. For the quarter, our majority net income decreased to 35.5%, resulting in earnings per share of Ps. 0.68 per share or Ps. 6.8 per ADR.</p>
          <p>This decline was mainly due to the following reasons. One, a foreign exchange loss will fall in our integral result of financing due to a foreign exchange fluctuation as applied to our dollar denominated debt. Second, a write-off of some assets in our Mexico division. And third, the reallocation of long-term employees benefit previously recorded as a long-term assets in the balance sheet, as a result of changes in the Mexican financial reporting standards.</p>
          <p>Over the past 12 months, we have sold more than 2.2 billion unit cases, reaching almost Ps. 74 billion in total revenues, and we have generated more than Ps. 15 billion of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about our operations. Our Mexico division posted 2.5% volume growth. Incremental volumes were mainly driven by the Jugos Del Valle line of beverages and the integration of our recently acquired Agua de los Angeles jug water operation.</p>
          <p>In the sparkling beverage segment, brand Coca-Cola in multiserve presentations continued to drive this category, helping us to offset our high year-over-year comparison resulting from the launch of Coca-Cola Zero in 2007.</p>
          <p>Our volumes of flavored sparkling beverages continue to decline in line with the industry over the past few years. One of our short-term priorities is to regain growth in this category. Recently, we have scaled our multiserve packages for our core flavor brands. Toward the end of the quarter we saw some improvement in this segment.</p>
          <p>Our average price per unit case declined 0.8% during the quarter. This year-over-year decline, which was partially offset by the higher average prices per unit cases of Jugos del Valle beverages portfolio, resulted mainly from lower volumes of flavor sparkling beverages and lower volumes from brand Coca-Cola Zero as compared with the third quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>In early October, we implemented an important price increase across our Coca-Cola brand portfolio resulting in a weighted average price increase of more than 4% in our total portfolio. These initiatives will improve the profitability of our sparkling beverage portfolio as we enter the final part of the year.</p>
          <p>Each competitor within our industry faces the same raw material environment leading us to conclude that they will have to follow price increases eventually. The integration of new home delivery routes in the Valley of Mexico from Agua de los Angeles jug water business enabled us to post more than 12% volume growth in our jug water portfolio for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the still beverage category, the Jugos Del Valle beverage portfolio accounted for the majority of our volume growth during the quarter. Our incremental sales volume in this category totaled more than 6 million unit cases. During the quarter, our order lines of still beverage continue to deliver positive results. Nestea grew almost 35% and the new re-formulated Powerade grew more than 27%.</p>
          <p>The Jugos Del Valle platform has also provided us with innovation across the still beverage category. We have been able to develop a strong presence in other beverages categories in a very short period of time. We have launched new products such as Vallefrut, Orangeade. And Vallefrut with high content of fruit to serve the market with alternative products to target different consumption occasions. These two products represent almost 40% of the incremental volumes coming from the Jugos Del Valle line of business.</p>
          <p>Also, with our new bottling line, we have acquired the capabilities to reformulate products such as the new Powerade. For Coca-Cola brand, we have developed new packages for single serve presentations, such as the new easy grip bottle for our 600 milliliters presentation. The sign to differentiate our package adding value and convenience for our consumers, and the 400 milliliter easy grip bottle to create a non-attractive entry point to single-serve consumption.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our Mexican operations total values increased 1.8%. Incremental volumes of Jugos Del Valle portfolio and our bottled water business supported this growth. On the profitability front, we continue to benefit from lower sweetener cost, which declined in Mexican pesos at a double digit rate year-over-year. This helped us to compensate for higher PET cost and the expected low profitability of the Jugos Del Valle line of beverages during this year 2008.</p>
          <p>Our gross profit reached Ps. 4.4 billion remaining flat as compared with the third quarter of 2007. Our gross margin decreased 90 basis points. Operating income declined slightly by 0.5% to Ps. 1.6 billion. These declines resulted from the higher costs of goods sold, which was partially offset by lower operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin declined 40 basis points to 19.9%. Our EBITDA declined 2.4%, compared with the same quarter of last year, reaching Ps. 2.1 billion. As we stated in our second quarter conference call, our consumers continue to focus more on value based transactions because their disposable income is somewhat constraint by the higher cost of food and lower remittances from abroad.</p>
          <p>However, we see different economic dynamics in our territories with the states, such as <mark type="inaudible" /> more dependent on remittances from abroad and the states in the Gulf region experience higher economic activity related to the oil industry. As we enter the fourth quarter, the economic slowdown from abroad will eventually reduce domestic GDP growth.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we believe our Mexican operations will remain the most profitable. The new arenas of growth provided by Jugos Del Valle in our line of beverages will provide us with a broader portfolio to capture market consumption occasions. Regionally, the Agua de los Angeles jug water business will provide us with the opportunity to capitalize on a move from delivering models. Margins in Latincentro division grew 4.5%. Brand Coca-Cola accounted for more than 60% of our incremental volumes. Flavored sparkling beverages accounted for almost 25% and our still beverages portfolio in Central America and Colombia provided the balance.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we complimented our portfolio introducing Jugos Del Valle line of beverages in Colombia, Panama and Nicaragua. This approach will help balance our portfolio with further alternative to satisfy our consumers consumption occasions. As we previously announced in August, our company, and the Coca-Cola Company agreed to jointly acquire the Brisa bottled water business in Colombia from Bavaria, a subsidiary of SABMiller. Once completed this acquisition will expand our portfolio throughout the region. The Brisa brand is one of the most recognized and important water brands in Colombia.</p>
          <p>As per capita income improves, we see an opportunity to migrate consumption from pouch to single serve PET presentations and increase the profitability of this category. Our Latincentro divisions, volume growth was driven by a 2.2% increase in Central America, and a 9.5% increase in Venezuela, which more than compensated for a slight decline in Colombia. Total revenues in our Latincentro division grew 6.7% year-over-year to Ps. 5.8 billion. Our average price per unit gain in Mexican peso increased 2.2% driven by price increases implemented during the quarter. These increases more than compensated for a territory wide achieved in our packaging mix to multiserve presentations and more competitive market dynamics in Colombia.</p>
          <p>Our gross profit increased 3.3% to Ps. 2.6 billion. Driven mainly by higher revenues, which more than compensated for higher sweetener cost in Venezuela and lower revenues in Colombia. Our gross margin declined 140 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2007, when we recorded the highest gross margin from the division in the last three years.</p>
          <p>Our operating income grew 3.9% to Ps. 751 million. This increase was driven mainly by our tight control of operating expenses in Colombia and Central America. Which more than compensated for higher labor and trade cost in Venezuela. Our operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 13%.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA grew 5.6% to Ps. 1 billion and our EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points. Despite bad weather in some of our Central American territories and a more competitive environment in Colombia, our Latincentro division has the ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in the fourth quarter and next year. We remain concerned about the level of inflation across our territories and expect to implement price increases during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk about our Mercosur division. During the quarter, we continued to integrate our Remil franchise territory into our 15 Brazilian operations. These new franchises present an important part of our incremental growth on a consolidated basis. Our Mercosur division volume grew 28.8% in third-quarter. Excluding Remil, our volume grew 4.1%.</p>
          <p>Brand Coca-Cola including the strong performance of Coca-Cola Zero drove these growths in Brazil and Argentina. Our volume growth was 44.3% in Brazil and 2.9% in Argentina. Excluding Remil, our volumes in Brazil grew 4.8%. Net revenues in the Mercosur division increased 56% to Ps. 5.4 billion for the third quarter. Excluding Remil, our net revenues increased 12.1% to Ps. 3.6 billion. Our Brazilian operations contribute more than 60% of our incremental revenues and Argentina accounted for the bulk.</p>
          <p>Our average price per unit case grew 18.4%, this increase was driven mainly by price increases implemented in the division and a positive packaging shift mix store in the representations of sparkling beverages in Brazil. Total revenues from beer in Brazil, including Remil, reached Ps. 522 million for the quarter, mainly driven by the migration of volume previously sold directly by Cervejarias Kaiser to supermarkets in the region of S&#xE3;o Paolo, which is now being sold by Coca-Cola FEMSA and of course by the incremental volume of Remil.</p>
          <p>Our Mercosur division gross profit increased more than 54% to Ps. 2.4 billion. Our higher revenues were partially offset by higher sweetener and resin cost in Brazil and Argentina. Our operating income grew 59.6% to Ps. 747 million. Our operating levers driven by higher revenues more than compensated for hiring expenses resulting from the introduction of coolers in Brazil, and higher labor costs in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 13.7% for the quarter. Our EBITDA grew close to 60% to Ps. 927 million, and our EBITDA margin expanded 40 basis points to 17%.</p>
          <p>As some of you may know, a new tax law applicable to certain sectors of the Brazilian economy included in the beverage industry was approved. This law includes a new mechanism to collect front line taxes based on our information, and after meetings with the main industry participants, with Brazil tax authorities. They have not reached a final decision of the parameters of the new law, which we expect to have in November. Depending on the outcome of these initiatives, we're considering different pricing scenarios as we enter 2009.</p>
          <p>Now, let us talk about the financial performance for the quarter, and our debt structure. As of September 30, 2008, we had a cash balance of Ps. 3.5 billion, a decrease of Ps. 4 million as compared with year-end 2007, mainly driven by cash we used in the acquisitions of Remil and Agua de los Angeles jug water business. Our total debt decreased Ps. 3.2 billion as compared with year-end 2007, mainly driven by the maturities of our Certificados Bursatiles that were paid in April and July of this year. As a result of the above mentioned factors, our net debt increased Ps. 835 million in the first nine months of 2008.</p>
          <p>During the year, our operations have provided us with the necessary cash to both finance our acquisitions and at the same time reduce our gross debt levels. Our short-term bond debt as of September 30, 2008 was Ps. 4.7 billion, and our long-term debt was Ps. 11 billion.</p>
          <p>Our debt maturity profile underscores the flexibility we have to manage our cash sources on this. On July 2009, maturities will be repaid with cash generation and our excess cash balance. The majority of the rest of our debt matures from 2012 onwards. As of September 30, 2008 our net debt to EBITDA coverage ratio was 0.8 times and our net interest coverage ratio was about 10 times, highlighting the strength of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In recent days, we have learned of the impact of several companies that have used structured or exalted financial instruments. We want to share with you some light regarding our financial structure. Rest assured we do not engage in those type of transaction. Our liability structure is comprised by a balanced mix of Mexican Peso denominated debt of 140% and dollar denominated debt close to 55%.</p>
          <p>As of October, approximately 47% of our debt has a fixed interest rate. KOF uses plain vanilla financial instruments with the objective of achieving the desired liability profile. Our total debt balance includes dollar-denominated debt in the amount of $795 million. The effect of foreign exchange fluctuation between the Mexicans peso and the U.S. dollar as applied to our dollar denominated debt is reflective in two lines on our consolidated income statement. On our debt, that was contracted in dollars, the effect shows of on the foreign exchange loss line.</p>
          <p>And on our debt that was contracted in pesos and swapped to dollars the effect shows of on the market value loss and in effective derivative instruments line. Looking at our performance for the first nine months of the year, our operations outside of Mexico, continue to generate the majority for our consolidated growth. Our balanced portfolio of assets presents a competitive advantage for our company with strong cash flow generation of our Mexico division combined with the organic and non-organic growth prospects of our Latincentro and Mercosur division.</p>
          <p>As we enter the final part of the year and despite the lower GDP estimates expected in the volume during Latin America. We have the most complete portfolio of products and have developed the most comprehensive execution capabilities to address the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. We will continue to benefit from our acquisitions, top line growth through the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>We should also benefit from the higher profitability of Jugos Del Valle line of beverages combined with our underlying operations, stable results. We've stated that our new lines of businesses, our recent acquisitions and our organic growth will provide us with sustainable top line growth going forward. We have the flexibility and ability to adapt and adjust our business to the evolving economic conditions. Coca-Cola FEMSA is a reliable vehicle for long-term growth with solid fundamentals and a prudent track record of sustainable profitable results.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to open up the call for any questions that you may have.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I was &#x2013; my question was basically with regards to availability of finance and given what's happening globally in terms of corporations generally finding it difficult to roll over debt and finding new financing. Do you face any such pressures in the territories you do operate and if so, how do you see this impacting your bottom line going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. We shared with you the idea that credit is getting more scarce. I think that the positive thing about our company is that we have these maturities that is close $400 million in July of next year. We basically have around $200 million already in our cash balances.</p>
          <p>And with the cash generation for the next &#x2013; for this fourth quarter plus the first two quarters of next year we don't see any need to go to financial institutions, to look for finances. But we certainly are concerned about that, this lack of liquidity in the financial markets. In case we're presented with an opportunity for growth in the future. But with respect to the operations that we have, the Brazilian operations, we don't have any need to look for resources in finance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally, are you reassessing perhaps some acquisition plans given what's happening at present?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now we don't have any specific plan in our resources. We have always been open to opportunities. And it might be the case that, because of these difficult situations the we see, some opportunities open up for us because people would prefer to leave the business. And obviously, in those cases we'll need to assess &#x2013; we should continue with those acquisitions. I think that we should be opened up for any opportunity and analyze those and check those cases, check those opportunities on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone. This morning we heard from Coca-Cola Enterprises that they've been hit with a reduction in funding from the Coca-Cola Company and also a high single digit concentrate price increase. I was just hoping you could comment in light of challenging market conditions, what your current relationship is with the company and if there's been any recent changes with respect to the support levels that you're receiving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, Lauren. We have not received any news of changes in marketing support. We have had a very positive dialog with the Coca-Cola Company and I'll say there is more, I guess the word is 'us' pushing for this dialog, because we think that is important that given the situation for next year. That we revalue, the flexibility that we need in terms of marketing expenditures for next year.</p>
          <p>In other words, we need to be very careful in not engage in long-term commitments. For example, with TV stations that will take flexibility away from us to adjust the marketing expenses going forward. But if a dialog that is being started by Coke FEMSA and I think that the Coca-Cola Company in our operations have been receptive. And we found that they were basically on the same page with us. Saying that it's important that we maintain this flexibility.</p>
          <p>We always share all these marketing activities on a 50-50 basis, and what we are evaluating right now is the level of fixed commitments with some of the expenses going forward so that we maintain this flexibility. In other words, what we want to maintain is that if we see that there is an important slow down in volumes that we can adjust our marketing expenses accordingly. And maybe in some cases we decided to invest a little higher to capture the market opportunities from original marketing supports so that we better promote our brands. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you also mentioned the intention of taking some price increases in the fourth quarter. Can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of those increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned during this call, we increased during October basically all our Cola categories in Mexico, in all presentations either $0.50 or Ps. 1 depending on the package. And we have been evaluating the possibility of increasing flavor prices as well as some prices on still beverage categories. Because we feel that when you have all these turbulence in the marketplace, us being the leader, if we move prices, we believe that some of our competitors or the majority of our competitors would follow through. Because we have uncertainty with respect to some of the raw materials, with respect to the future and we feel it is important that we value that.</p>
          <p>And we are doing exactly the same thing in every country where we are operating, for different reasons. In Argentina and Venezuela because we have high inflation levels. In Brazil we see opportunity to increase prices in some of the single serve presentations. But the signal that we have to all of our operations is to look at opportunities on the pricing front and obviously to revalue all the capital expenditure programs that we have for next year.</p>
          <p>We have two main focuses, one is to be sure that we got through this additional free cash flow for our commitments. And second, to revalue also and to be very sure what are the volumes that we're going to see in the future from &#x2013; the demand from the consumer so that we revalue the necessity to increase capacity in some of the places.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning guys. I guess the question was partly asked by Lauren, but just wanted to get a sense. When you reached your agreement with Coke a couple of years ago about not raising concentrate prices over a long period of time, did that apply only to Mexico or to every country where you operate, because obviously the news on CCE and watching Coca-Cola stock price, makes me a little nervous that there's going to be concentrate price increases, for example in Venezuela, Colombia, Central America, those countries. So, if you can shed some light on that, that'd be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Jos&#xE9;. The agreement is for Mexico. That is the straight answer, because that's where we've had the increase that created all this turmoil for several months in terms of the negotiations and the business relationship with the Coca-Cola Company.</p>
          <p>Contractually, they can increase the prices in some other territories. We believe that we have a very positive dialog with the Coca-Cola Company. And we have steered our way that this is not a guarantee, Jose,  obviously but we have steered away from this dialog of increasing concentrate price, but rather looking together for opportunities to increase the size of the pie that we are sharing.</p>
          <p>By doing all these innovative processes with Jugos del Valle,. As I mentioned, for example, these two pros that we develop together with the Coca-Cola Company, Biatutus. There were lines of business that were not existent when the company was in the hands of the Albarran family. And in one month, those two products were selling 2.5 million unit cases. I think that with actions like that where we prove that we can execute in the marketplace with new lines of business that we provide new volume and opportunities for growth of the two companies. We don't need to address those. But the straight answer to the specific question is the agreement where we had the freeze of concentrate prices for a long period of time is within Mexico and that's the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And basically in every country, it's still an incidence pricing model including in Venezuela, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Every country where we operate is incidence price model.</p>

          <p>Hey, good morning everybody. Hector, I had a question with respect to the other charge that you took below the operating line, the 562 million. Part of that is stated to be reallocation of long-term employees benefits scheme. Can you expand on that in terms of whether or not this is a defined benefit for employees. The nature of it and what the projected benefit obligation is, as well as its current funding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that one of the main impact is that, is a change in the accounting principle. I believe it's called B, as in baby, 3. Before 2008, you have a computation by an actuary that basically provides for pension liabilities and things like that as an estimate. And any excess over that estimate was taken as a long-term asset that was amortized.</p>
          <p>According to our changes over 14 dues we take out the average life an employee in Coca-Cola franchise according to the actuaries. Starting 2008, the accounting regulators in Mexican government say that these assets have to be taken below the line during 2008, because we are taking on the previous, the accumulation on these assets line from previous years.</p>
          <p>Starting 2009, we have to take as an operating expense, the actual cost of having people on pension etc. I don't know if I'm explaining myself, let me try to rephrase this. The actual profit, the actual differences that is the real cost up to 2007 was taken to an asset that was amortized over 14 years. Now the regulation is saying during 2008, you have to take that lines and take it to your P&amp;L because it's accumulated amount for previous years, you take it below the operating line. This is a onetime event in 2008 and starting 2008, 2009 starting January 2009 you have to take the real cost as part of your operating expense.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess, Hector, what I'm really interested in is, you know, do you, what's the nature of your defined benefits. I suppose what I'm trying to understand and then what's the net present value of those. And I'm trying to understand whether or not you're over funded or underfunded on that present benefit obligation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This, it has to do  basically with pension funds for 100% of our employees. Even blue collar workers and provisions for in the mitigation, remember that in Mexico you have to, if you fire someone, you have to pay three months plus 20 days for every year that the worker has been working in the company. So those provisions and the pension funds for everyone and the provisions are also for a 100% of our employees is what is in this line. The only thing that we have, in the mitigation charge, we have the real amounts and we're basically doing provisions according to the factorial change. With respect to the pension fund, for the total company Coca-Cola FEMSA, we are more or less around 40% funded in the pension fund.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Hector a question regarding potential shift towards returnables assuming that the economies in the region deteriorate. I guess it's fair to assume that the mix between non-returnables and returnables is going to move more towards the returnable side. What -- I mean how should we think about the impact of profitability in each of the territories of Coca-Cola FEMSA, if we start seeing this shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Alan, I think that you raise an important question. In difficult economic times, returnable presentations have always provided us with a platform to have a lower price product, a lower price point to the consumer. And as you are fully aware, basically 99% of our &#x2013; of the volume of our competitors is committed to one-way presentations. We still have and we have maintained, because of strategic reasons because we have such a large price gap differentials in comparable presentations. Remember that we are, one of our competitors have 2-liter or 3-liter presentations in Ps. 12 we sell the equivalent presentations in 17 to Ps. 19.</p>
          <p>We have used returnable presentations to present a good enterprise package to our consumers. In Mexico, around 30% of our volume is in returnables. It's a much higher number in Colombia and Central America, close to 50%. Argentina is also around 30%. So I think that we have the opportunity to continue using those presentations in difficult environment when the consumer doesn't have a large amount of disposal income. And it's basically the possibility of Coca-Cola FEMSA in these territories because nobody else has this presentation. We have some competitors like Bosto in Colombia that has returnables etcetera. but most of our competitors are fully committed to one-way packages.</p>
          <p>When we look at the low-price brands, there is no question that they have the full effect of the pressure on raw materials because they are 100% in one way presentation. So I think that strategically it has worked for us in the past. And I think that it will work for us in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now what would that do to margins? I mean what should be the impact on the margins or of the profitability of these businesses if we see that shift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The profitability approach in our case is very similar to what we have in one-way packages.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the base if it's a large presentation, for example, there is no question that in the small single-serve, one-way package we have a very high margin. In our one-way but it's when it's single serve. When you go to multi-serve, you have a lower margin on those products. But returnable presentation for us a very good &#x2013; has a very good margin between these two presentations that I mentioned, between single serves and multi serves. So nevertheless I'll say that we will maintain our margins basically.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks everybody. Can I ask about the Mexico volume outlook? And I guess when you look at these &#x2013; at your countries kind of out a few quarters, I mean the biggest GDP downward revision seems to be in Mexico with people actually thinking GDP will contract next year. And we've seen the last couple of quarters the margins contracting in Mexico, CSDs now for the last two quarters also contracting in terms of volume. I'm wondering why you guys are thinking or what's behind the price increase of 4% in Mexico. We've seen the brewers try to do a price increase in August and clearly the volume reflects a little bit more than we all thought. And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, are we kind at a trough right now in terms of kind of the volume, the organic volume trends? Are you concerned that this price increase might actually kind of be &#x2013; kind of push us into a little bit more than expected negative kind of contraction in the fourth quarter? And looking out, I know it's early days, in the first half I mean how should we kind of look at basic volume trends in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alex. Good morning Alex. Well, yes you are right. I mean the decision for taking up prices is always hard. Especially when you have such a large margin versus your competitors in Mexico, such a large gap in pricing on the &#x2013; of our representations. But we believe that given the raw material pressures that we have received even though sweeteners have benefited us or the industry for the last few months, but we believe that with the cost of PET and labels and caps and all these things that are related to that that the competitor will follow. I think that the competitor who are desperate for us to give some room for them to move the prices. It's a difficult balance that we need to find Alex and obviously there is always promotional activity that you can do around. But you're right in the sense that we're going through a slowdown in the economy. And normally trends would call for volumes either growing at a lower base or coming down when you compare it to the previous year. We have the benefit of all the other initiatives that we are bringing with the Jugos Del Valle transaction that we are bringing to the table.</p>
          <p>So, I think that when you consider all the variables here, our team felt that it was time to start moving prices. And I think that we feel comfortable at this time that it is a good move. In some other cases, we have reduced prices for example in flavors because as I mentioned during the conference call, we have been suffering over several years on that. So we reduced the prices. We have the positive effect of those prices. And now we're going to increase the prices a little bit on flavors. So usually it's a difficult decision but we believe that when you consider all the variables, it's the right decision.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wonder if I could ask two questions. The first is if I'm not mistaken you're on track to spend something like $500 million this year on CapEx, which is above what your trend has been, which has been more I think in the $250 million range. As you're thinking at least preliminarily about 2009, can you give us a sense of what you think you might have as a budget for CapEx for '09? And then the second question is, you've talked a bit about the proclivity to take pricing because of the raw material environment. And I clearly understand that with currencies weakening that's going to cause some inflation in your cost. But at the same time I would think that some of the commodities might actually reverse like PET and aluminum. Can you talk about how much of your needs are contracted if you will at sort of older prices? And how quickly you'll see the benefit of falling commodity prices? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Lore. Well let me first give you some light on the CapEx and then we go into the commodities and the price improvements. On the CapEx, we have basically a budget for the year for around $500 million as you said. But the fact of the matter is that of &#x2013; we measure actual cash flow that we have paid all the way through September 30th. We are around the $250 million mark. So my best estimate for the full year is going to be between 300 and $330 million, around that range. So we will be below the $500 million mark. The variables that you have obviously to move that are easier and dependent on you in this industry is basically how much you spend in CapEx and that depending on how you see growth and your capacity going forward. And you can tighten the belt a little bit to restrict some addition of the cash flow. The other is the pricing lever and how much you spend in marketing. Those are the three easier levers that you have to try to adjust your company to the circumstance.</p>
          <p>For next year, the call that we are doing to all the operators is to review their &#x2013; obviously we have already gone through business plan processes and have preliminary estimates of what we can expect for next year. But all of that happened before October and before the first half of September. And we are asking all the operators to revalue their capital expenditure needs for next year. In the meantime, we have, as you know, we have a centralized treasury operation and we are having a very tight control on the outflows. And we are asking operators that from here to July of next year and that's basically after we cover this debt payment that we have that I mentioned is around 400 million, the equivalent of $400 million. That they should review very carefully their CapEx programs and that they should basically adjust to the minimum that is necessary to continue with the operations.</p>
          <p>We are also investing in some of the capital expenditures that were in process that have to do with non-carwanary approach, For example in Colombia and Central America where we are launching so much in volume, we have some investments there. But it's important that everyone revalues their analysis of capacity and excess capacity and demand, if the demand is going to be there for those amounts or not. Related to that is also this question about price increases. We also prefer to have a regional price formula, especially when we think that we have the leadership on the industry and that some of the competitor will follow. And maybe adjust volumes a little bit to the downward trend and not to have to be in the necessity of investing in additional capacity. And not to lose capital strength.</p>
          <p>With respect to the raw materials Lore, we have basically very few agreements with suppliers with respect to prices for short period of time. The only exception is in Brazil where we have committed with some sugar prices that are at a higher price where the markets or the prices on sugar that you have right now. Basically to cover and say around half of our needs in 2009 that are committed with prices that are now under the water. If we were, if we needed to do like a mark to market of those agreements that we have with suppliers in Brazil, I think that the number would be around $5 million that, 5, $6 million that we are below the water in that respect. In the rest of the territories, sometimes we have commitments for three months or one month in terms of price for some of the raw materials. So my feeling is that other than this issue with the sugar in Brazil, we benefit &#x2013; we will benefit from most of the raw material contraction in prices in our operations.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's helpful. And just a follow-up and maybe this is implicit in the way you're talking about the business, but I understand the importance of getting some price given what's happened. But is there a tolerance on your part or on the part of Coca-Cola Company in general to accept falling in declines? If volumes end up going negative as a result of your pricing actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes from the part of our company. I know that the Coca-Cola Company in the past has focused a lot on volumes because they &#x2013; for them the volume number is very important. I think that as we have continued to evolve in our relationships over so many years now, the fact that they are on an incidence level in all of our countries, we think that they also appreciate the idea that an increase in prices also benefit them because of the share together with us as we have an easier formula. But the answer is yes, I think that from Coca-Cola FEMSA point of view, we do have tolerance to some reduction in volumes. And the reason we always need to look at the health of the brands and look at market share figures and all of that. But it's important that we maintain the profitability of the business.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Argentina obviously, what is the environment there? I mean we have been commenting in previous conference call that Argentina, that we see a lot of volatility on the market economics we use. Obviously the situation that we have there doesn't help at all, during the year we have suffered blockage in roads that have interfered with the supply chain, of some of our raw materials getting to our production plants. We need to understand the final outcome of this decision to take over the pension funds and the impact that that would have on this consumer sentiment.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, I think that we are having very good performance. We have been able &#x2013; we have pressure from the labor costs, as I mentioned during the press conference. Some of our labor contracts have had salary increases of around 25% during this year. That is more in tune with the &#x2013; let me "non-official inflation that we have in that country". But at the same time, we have been able to pass along some price increases and to grow in our volumes. So I think that it's too early to know what the full impact of, on the Argentine operations with all this turmoil. And basically the, regard to your first question, Argentina is -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Hector to expand on your answer to Alan's question earlier, when you guys face macro dislocation, you expect package mix shifts. But you also shift retail mix and you hurt competition. Can you expand on retail mix opportunities and on market share opportunities that this economic slowdown might bring? And if you could do it by country it would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Carlos. General the past experiences and I assume that it would be the same in these cases, what happens with packages is a movement to returnable presentations as we were saying with Alan's question. And then with respect to the channel shifts, in those locations we start seeing a larger penetration of this more mom and pops versus supermarkets. You start seeing shifts in the consumer patterns that they don't necessarily have a large amount of disposal income like to go to the supermarket once a week and then spend a big ticket on the week supply. And they start migrating again to the small mom and pop that is around the corner and they basically need the daily &#x2013; they buy the daily needs on a daily basis. So that's one of the areas where we think also that can &#x2013; that we can benefit from this trend as we have pointed out in the past for us, the fragmentation of the retail system and the importance of mom and pops, it's very good center to our strategies.</p>
          <p>If we go on a country-by-country, this is more or less the same trends that we see in every country. We can just remember when we have the prior practice in Argentina when supermarkets went from above 50% in our sales mix to around 18 or 15%, if I remember correctly. So our expectation is that if business slowdowns continues during the next year, year and a half, we will see some reversal of the trends that we are seeing with respect to the higher penetration of this supermarkets again moving towards traditional channel.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carlos, this is Alfredo Fern&#xE1;ndez. On a country-by-country basis, revenues or volumes that go to supermarkets in Mexico around 7%. And they probably doubled during the last 15 to 10 years. And in Central America probably would be something around 10% and in Colombia and Venezuela less than that, probably around 5. In Argentina, like Hector was saying, after the crisis around 2001, 2002 our mix of revenues there went from like 40% to around 15% to date. And our returnable mix went from probably 1 or 2% to close to 30 today. So in the recessionary environments, sometimes the mix, the composition of retail and the composition of packages strains the fundamentals of the business. In Brazil, the number hasn't changed much. It's around 25 to 30%. And just developing on the explanation of Hector, certainly would see that in a scenario of a slowdown, we tend to sell and grow more to, our revenues to mom and pops.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just to clarify an earlier comment that you made with respect to returnable margin versus non-returnable, I think I understood you to say that they're about the same margin and I always understood returnable to be more profitable actually. And I would have thought especially with the concentrate increase in Mexico at least and the weaker peso now that would certainly return to being the case, if it hasn't been the case more recently. Can you just confirm that that's the right understanding or are they really, are you indifferent to the presentation package as opposed to size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no let me clarify that Celso. In general, returnable presentations are more profitable. What I was saying is that when you take for example a 400 milliliter Coca-Cola or a Coca-Cola in a can presentation, usually those one-way, single-serve presentations are more profitable than even the returnables. What I was trying to say is that given the fact that we have a mix of single serve and multiserve presentations and one-ways that I don't see a big change in the margins because of an increase in returnable presentations. But at the end of the day, it depends how the single-serve presentation moves and the multiserve presentation moves into with respect to one-way presentations. But just to clarify, in general returnables are more profitable, single-serve one-ways, if you look at the margin contribution of those products are higher than on returnables products.</p>

          <p>Okay that's clear. Thank you. And then just my main question was just a simple one, cash management, Argentina and Venezuela, can you give us a sense of what your current policies are and what you might be doing to ensure that you have the ability to take cash out of those countries? I guess I was referring more to Argentina right now, given how things are starting to look.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me &#x2013; in general and I don't know if this store model will change a little bit, the rules of the game. But so far what we have been doing is in Argentina we have the ability to take out $2 million per month and we have been doing that, extracting $2 million per month out of that country plus dividends whenever we have the profits to pay the dividends. And we have been doing that on a regular basis when you have to go through all the computation of this is the profit that I have and the fiscal profit and all that. In Venezuela, it's more sporadic. It's when we have opportunities to buy bonds that are issued by the government or by Selevasis that are denominated in dollars that you can pay in bolivars and then you exchange those bonds in the market and you'll get the dollars out.</p>
          <p>The other day I was doing a computation of the money that we have extracted in Venezuela since we enter there. And the number is around $90 million of actual dollar that we have taken out of the country through this exchanges of bonds and some repatriation of money that was authorized in the control market by the authorities.</p>
          <p>One important element in Venezuela is that we receive two days ago also the, what is called the labor solvency, which is a requisite to ask for the dollars in the catagory which is the agency that manages the dollar exchange in Venezuela. So that means that we can again reinitiate that work process to buy dollars at the official exchange rate to pay raw materials and if authorized to pay dividends, then we have a request to &#x2013; before the authorities for an authorization to pay dividends that have been there for a few months. I hope that with this labor solvency being arranged that that process continues and maybe at supporting time they authorize those dividends to get out. But that's basically a general sense how we manage Argentina and Venezuela.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to clear, Argentina the dividend payment, that's, you have to make that computation. You do it once a year or is it at your own discretion in terms of timing? And is there a limit on the order of magnitude of that dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's once a year and the limit is whatever your profits are. Your profits in the computation that you have to do there. So in other words, you have to have the profits there in and pay the taxes there in order to extract the dividends. But if you have more profits, you can extract more dividends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the timing of that dividend usually is first quarter, fourth quarter or what, how does that usually work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll say that it's usually first half of the year.</p>
