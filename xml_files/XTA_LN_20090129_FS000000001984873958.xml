        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for attending the presentation at what is very short notice, I appreciate. And as you have seen this morning, we've announced a Rights Issue to existing shareholders to raise approximately $6 billion net of costs. We've also announced the acquisition of Glencore's world-class Colombian coal assets, Prodeco, for a consideration of $2 billion.</p>
          <p>Now as a result of these two major announcements, we have brought forward the announcement of Xstrata's results today. Copies of each of these documents have been made available in the auditorium and are available of course on our website.</p>
          <p>I would also like to welcome those who are attending the presentation via webcast or by telephone.</p>
          <p>The other members of the Executive Committee are, as usual, with us this morning and are most familiar &#x2013; and are familiar to most of you. With me in the front of the room, on my left is the CFO, Trevor Reid; Santiago Zaldumbide, our Executive Director and Chief Executive of Xstrata Zinc; Ian Pearce, Chief Executive with Xstrata Nickel; Charlie Sartain, Chief Executive of Xstrata Copper; Peter Freyberg, Chief Executive of Xstrata Coal; and Peet Nienaber, Chief Executive of our Alloys business; and Thras Moraitis, who's the Executive General Manager, Strategy and Corporate Affairs is, as is his custom, in audience with you, and Benny Levene, our Head of Legal Affairs is hopefully asleep after spending the whole night signing documentation.</p>
          <p>Despite the sudden and severe impact of a global banking crisis that has dramatically slowed economic growth from the third quarter and led to a precipitous fall in commodity prices, Xstrata businesses achieved a highly creditable result in 2008, generating EBITDA of $9.7 billion and an earnings per share of $4.90.</p>
          <p>The impact of markedly lower commodity prices in the final quarter was largely offset by the benefit of record thermal and coking coal and ferrochrome contracts settled during the year, together with robust copper prices for a good part of 2008. However, in the wake of the financial crisis in September, global economic growth projections dramatically declined and the failure of a number of major institutions resulted in the severe tightening in money supply. Indeed liquidity continues to be exceptionally tight.</p>
          <p>The consequence has been a rapid de-stocking and de-leveraging across the world economic system with the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and the Euro zone economies falling into recession and growth rates moderating significantly in the developing economies.</p>
          <p>What has happened in the last few months is simply quite breathtaking when one considers the altered economic landscape and how the financial crisis has adversely impacted stock markets around the world, with leveraged companies attracting the most significant discounts.</p>
          <p>While appropriate for market conditions experienced in the first three quarters of the year, and indeed for the past few years, in the aftermath of this unprecedented financial crisis, Xstrata's absolute level of debt is now perceived as a potential constraint. And obviously, the acquisitions of Jubilee, Resource Pacific and the stake in Lonmin during 2008 are an important consideration in this context, and with the benefit of hindsight, the dramatic downturn would have provided the opportunity to acquire these assets at a later point and probably at a lower price.</p>
          <p>But I remain confident that these acquisitions are sound investments and in fact represents value-accretive transactions of long-life operations that will deliver substantial returns to shareholders over many, many years, far more years than will extend beyond this current crisis.</p>
          <p>The proposed two-for-one Rights Issue to raise &#xA3;4.1 billion, approximately $6 billion excluding costs, would enable us to repay bank debts, providing a significant injection of capital to mitigate the risks presented by the current uncertainty and remove this potential constraint that I spoke about now.</p>
          <p>But I must emphasize that this capital raising is one of a series of decisive, proactive measures being taken by the Group to manage risk and optimize operations in the face of very challenging operating conditions and limited visibility. I'm going to cover each of these in more detail later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>But to summarize, these include a very substantial $3 billion reduction to expected capital expenditure in 2009, whilst retaining our pipeline of growth optionality and options, a revigorated focus on achieving sustainable operating cost reductions across our commodity businesses, and early action to curtail or suspend marginal production and to limit the buildup of our stock piles in those commodities where demand is particularly weak.</p>
          <p>The cumulative impact of these actions is to secure an appropriate capital structure for the Group, in line with our commitment to maintain investment grade credit rating throughout the cycle. They equally provide Xstrata with a strengthened balance sheet and enhanced platform for further growth and value creation for shareholders. The planned rights issue, together with the ongoing support of our major shareholder, Glencore, has provided us with an opportunity to acquire the world-class cash-generative Prodeco coal operations of Colombia for a consideration of $2 billion.</p>
          <p>The addition of these premier operations into the Group will consolidate Xstrata's Coal's global leadership position in thermal coal and strengthen our strategic position in Colombia, from which it supplies both the European and the United States markets.</p>
          <p>So with these brief introductory remarks, I'm going to hand over to Trevor who will take you through the financial results in some detail.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As you've come to expect by now, comprehensive detail on our financial and operating performance is set out in the preliminary full-year results that you have with you. And I'll consequently focus today on the key performance indicators of our business, as we weather the unique economic storm that eventuated in 2008.</p>
          <p>Last year was truly a year of two dramatically different halves. When I stood here some five months ago, we had just settled record coal contracts, copper prices were buoyant, and inventories were low. Ferrochrome settlements had been achieved at all-time highs of over $2 per pound, and all our base metals were trading well above marginal costs.</p>
          <p>The events we have seen in the global economy since have been as dramatic as they have been unprecedented. And today the outlook is much changed.</p>
          <p>I've been reassured by the prompt and decisive actions taken by our businesses to respond to the current uncertain and challenging circumstances. And as Mick alluded, we will &#x2013; he will shortly be outlining these steps in more detail.</p>
          <p>The fundamentals of our business are robust and these steps will further improve its cost-competitive position while seeking to protect precious capital. In addition, we believe that it is both prudent and desirable that we supplement these ongoing management initiatives with the significant capital raising announced this morning. I will deal with that aspect in more detail later, but first let me review the results for 2008.</p>
          <p>Overall revenue for the year declined marginally compared to 2007 to $28 billion. While zinc and nickel prices fell significantly compared to the record high levels of 2007, copper prices traded at or near historic highs in the early part of the year, but fell away sharply as global growth fears took hold. Very tight coking and thermal coal markets supported record spot and contract settlements.</p>
          <p>At an operating level the businesses continued to generate strong cash flows with EBITDA of $9.7 billion. EBIT from operations was 16% lower at $7.3 billion. The effective tax rate for the period reduced to 25% mainly due to a higher percentage of earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>The decrease in net finance cost to $660 million is mainly due to lower interest rates and positive currency movements on third-party loans. Minority interest fell in line with lower earnings at Alumbrera and attributable profit before exceptionals in discontinued operations decreased by some 13% to $4.7 billion, providing EPS before exceptional items of $4.90.</p>
          <p>Now I'll deal with the exceptional items charged to the income statement in 2008 in some detail later. As you would expect, a significant portion of the total $1.2 billion charge relates to the impairment of assets, primarily due to closures or suspensions undertaken in response to the deteriorating economic conditions in recent months.</p>
          <p>Once again, the diversified model showed its value in generating consistent results as record coal price settlements and a strong ferrochrome market together boosted EBITDA by some $3.6 billion and significantly offset the impact of lower copper, nickel and zinc prices.</p>
          <p>Reduced production volumes impacted earnings by $378 million year-on-year as record coal, zinc and lead &#x2013; zinc and lead concentrates, platinum and nickel production were offset by lower copper and ferronickel volumes.</p>
          <p>The inclusion of the acquired Tahmoor and Ravensworth underground coal operations and an additional 50% interest in Narama, together with productivity improvements at Newlands northern underground mine, delivered record volumes and cost efficiencies at Xstrata Coal.</p>
          <p>Zinc production and sales volumes benefited from concentrated expansions in Australia and the commencement of production at the Perseverance mine in Canada ahead of schedule and within budget.</p>
          <p>Ferronickel production was lower as a result of the suspension and subsequent mothballing of the Falcondo operation in the second half.</p>
          <p>The U.S. dollar strengthened against most commodity-based currencies, significantly lowering operating costs towards the end of the year and adding $207 million to EBIT.</p>
          <p>As in prior years, the headwinds of high industry input costs, together with CPI inflation, weighed on earnings to the tune of $1.3 billion. Against this, real cost savings of $184 million were achieved in 2008, marking a sixth consecutive year of cost improvement in a highly challenging operating environment and providing an ongoing endorsement of our decentralized operating structure.</p>
          <p>Higher earnings from acquisitions include the acquired Resource Pacific coal asset following completion of the transaction in February 2008. And other income and expenses includes the negative impact of the introduction of export retention taxes by the Argentine government, which reduced earnings at Alumbrera and higher standing charges at our idled chrome furnaces.</p>
          <p>Now our half-on-half comparison of last year's earnings will show that as a result of the significant and sudden collapse in base metals and ferrochrome prices, EBIT during the second half decreased to $2.7 billion. And the lion's share of these earnings was generated from the coal business. So it is not an unreasonable question, with base metal prices remaining at the sort of levels we saw at the year-end, to ask what will be different going forward.</p>
          <p>I believe there are three key factors to consider. First, our businesses have been quick to respond to the changing environment. And the information we have distributed today details a number of initiatives to stop operations that are loss-making and to reduce operating costs in ongoing activities.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the strength of the U.S. dollar against operating currencies provides a material decrease in dollar-based costs. And finally, the deflation in fuel, energy, consumables and other raw material costs, which has happened at a speed that has surprised us, will start to feed through materially to our cost base.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax exceptional items in EBIT amounts to $1.2 billion. Now we have conducted a Group-wide impairment assessment in conjunction with our auditors, which has confirmed that, on an overall Group basis, the value of Xstrata's assets exceeds book value by some $25 billion. However, under IFRS, it requires that impairment testing is conducted on an asset-by-asset basis, and impairments in certain assets have been identified. As a consequence, an impairment charge of $974 million has been recorded.</p>
          <p>Now this reporting season has already seen widespread impairments from other mining companies. In our case, it should be noted, that the strengthening U.S. dollar against the rand, the Aussie dollar and the euro, have had the effect of reducing in U.S. dollar terms the carrying value of a number of Xstrata's operations which maintain their balance sheets in local functional currencies, and the overall impact of these exchange rate movements has been to reduce the net book value of Xstrata's assets by approximately $5 billion between 30th of June and 31, December, with a corresponding movement in the foreign currency translation reserve, but no income statement impact.</p>
          <p>Turning to the specific impairments, as one would expect, the carrying value of Xstrata Nickel's Falcondo assets in the Dominican Republic has been written down by $455 million, following the decision to place the operation on prolonged care and maintenance.</p>
          <p>In the copper business, the Kidd operations in Canada incurred an impairment of $227 million following a revaluation of closure and rehabilitation costs, while in North Chile, the Altonorte smelter was impaired by $92 million, predominantly due to the impact of weaker domestic demand for sulfuric acid and the cash flow impact of medium-term environmental capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>The Lomas Bayas copper heap leach operation was also written down by $144 million due to higher operating costs compared to the initial assumptions when we allocated the value to those assets.</p>
          <p>In addition to these charges, restructuring and closure costs of $53 million were incurred to close the Lennard Shelf zinc operation in Western Australia in July, and a further $52 million was incurred in shutting the Craig and Thayer-Lindsley nickel mines in Sudbury as they approached their natural end of life.</p>
          <p>The Nickel business absorbed inventory write downs amounting to $93 million as a result of low year-end prices and high absorbed D&amp;A charges, which were applied to higher-than-usual nickel in process inventories at the year end, as output from our Australian mines was diverted to the Sudbury smelter. Tax credits in respect of these extraordinary items amounted to some $330 million.</p>
          <p>The Group once again generated robust cash flows from operations of almost $9 billion. Income tax payments dropped to just under $1.8 billion, substantially lower than in 2007, when tax payments were abnormally high as a result of carryover tax payments from the Falconbridge acquisition.</p>
          <p>Sustaining capital expenditure rose to $1.7 billion, while expansionary capital expenditure of $3.2 billion was spent to progress our pipeline of green and brownfield projects. Expenditure for the year was some $300 million lower than the guidance given previously.</p>
          <p>As the credit crisis and economic downturn intensified last year, Xstrata management conducted a bottom-up detailed review of all expansionary and discretionary sustaining capital plans. Significant reductions have been made to forecast 2009 expenditure, with the intention of conserving the Group's cash, while seeking to retain optionality to develop projects at a later stage.</p>
          <p>As a result, I now expect total capital expenditure for 2009 to be approximately $3.4 billion, some $3 billion lower than our previous guidance for 2009. This forecast comprises essential capital expenditure of a sustaining nature of $1.2 billion and expansionary capital expenditure of $2.2 billion, which is less than half the previous guidance. Approximately $0.5 billion of 2009 expansionary CapEx relates to projects that are currently nearing completion, will be commissioned in 2009, and will start to contribute materially to EBITDA in the period thereafter.</p>
          <p>Now approximately $5.5 billion was invested in acquisitions during the period. The acquisition of a 24.9% stake in Lonmin at a total cost of $1.9 billion was accomplished in two stages, comprising the initial acquisition of 10%, at the price of &#xA3;33 per share, in August, and the subsequent acquisition of a further 14% at an average price of &#xA3;19.79 per share in October.</p>
          <p>The acquisitions of Jubilee Mines, a Western Australia nickel producer, and Resource Pacific, which is the owner of the Newpac underground coal mine in New South Wales, were completed for $3.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased by some $4.7 billion to $16.3 billion bringing gearing on a debt-to-debt plus equity basis to 40% at year-end.</p>
          <p>The average in maturity of Xstrata's gross borrowings of $17.5 billion was extended in 2008 through the issues of three tranches of bonds in May under our euro medium-term note program, including an inaugural issue of sterling-denominated notes. In line with our treasury policy, the proceeds from the issues have been swapped into U.S. dollars at floating rates, raising some $3.1 billion at a significantly reduced cost of borrowing as U.S. LIBOR rates reduce.</p>
          <p>In October, we took the opportunity of the negotiations with relationship banks regarding the proposed acquisition of Lonmin to secure a new $5 billion three-year revolving debt facility with a syndicate of 15 banks. This facility was partially utilized to refinance existing debt, and in January 2009 was increased by an additional $0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>The timely nature of these two initiatives to refinance short-term debt obligations has enabled Xstrata to significantly extend the maturity of its borrowings and removes any material refinancing obligations in the near term. We have $500 million of bonds falling due in 2009, substantially no refinancing in 2010, and the next significant refinancing obligation falls due only in mid 2011.</p>
          <p>Now there has been some ongoing discussion in the market about Xstrata's debt position and in particular its banking covenants. So I'll take a moment now to clarify these in more detail.</p>
          <p>The Group's bank debt borrowings are subject to two covenants related to EBITDA. The first requires 12-month EBITDA to constitute at least four times the interest charge, while the second requires the Group's gross debt to be within three times of EBITDA. The covenants are tested at half year and year-end using the previous 12 months EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So as of December 31, Xstrata's gross debt represented 1.8 times EBITDA against the covenant requirement of three, and EBITDA was 13.5 times the interest charge, very comfortably within that covenant.</p>
          <p>However, despite headroom of some $3 billion in our existing facilities, Xstrata's absolute level of gross debt, at $17.5 billion at year-end, and gearing of 40%, is above the levels that I deem optimal or prudent in the light of the very significant and sudden deterioration in the economic conditions and demand for commodities over the past four or five months, and, more importantly, in view of the uncertainty that prevails in a short-term outlook.</p>
          <p>To address this, our commodity business teams are pulling out all the stops at the operational level to significantly reduce capital requirements, cut our operating costs, curtail marginal production and conserve cash. And I'm seeing a truly impressive level of activity and focus across all the operations teams who have moved very quickly to ensure that their businesses remain cash positive and to take every opportunity to improve their capital and operating efficiency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Trevor. And as Trevor has just outlined the Rights Issue we have announced today plays a major part in securing an appropriate capital structure for Xstrata. But it is, as I indicated in my introduction, only the latest of a series of proactive and decisive steps we have taken in response to a global slowdown.</p>
          <p>In this environment, I believe that Xstrata's devolved management structure represents a true source of competitive advantage enabling our businesses to identify and implement rapid and ongoing initiatives to optimize cash.</p>
          <p>An ongoing review of all capital expenditure projects led by Xstrata's business units has resulted, as Trevor has indicated to you, in almost $3 billion of CapEx deferrals or reductions for 2009, lowering anticipated CapEx for 2009 by approximately 45% relative to previous guidance.</p>
          <p>A significant portion of the remaining CapEx relates to projects that will deliver immediate, low-cost growth and cash flows from 2009 onwards. Those elements of Xstrata's extensive growth pipeline which have been deferred remain, of course, available to be accelerated at the appropriate time when the market conditions allow.</p>
          <p>Our business units have reacted swiftly to curtail marginal production. In July, Xstrata Zinc and Teck Cominco decided to close the Lennard Shelf zinc lead operation in Western Australia, in response to ongoing lower zinc prices in what now what appears to have been an early but prescient decision given the financial meltdown in September.</p>
          <p>In our Nickel division, faced with the confluence of depressed nickel prices and record oil prices during 2008, Xstrata Nickel acted swiftly to suspend the Falcondo ferronickel operation in the Dominican Republic in August, before placing the operation under care and maintenance in early December. Now Falcondo has traditionally been a swing producer, and while the decision to suspend an operation is never taken lightly, ceasing production in a timely manner avoided over $85 million of operating cash losses in the second half of 2008.</p>
          <p>At Sudbury, Xstrata Nickel accelerated the closure of the Thayer-Lindsley and Craig mines, which were approaching the end of their useful lives. The operational review is of course ongoing.</p>
          <p>Now the sudden deterioration of economic conditions has had a particularly severe impact on the steel sector, affecting demand for all commodities used in stainless and carbon steel production. In response to weaker demand for ferrochrome, the Xstrata-Merafe Chrome joint venture is suspended, progressively 17 ferrochrome furnaces in South Africa representing approximately 80% of annual production capacity, prioritizing lower cost, energy efficient production from the Lion and Lydenburg premise smelters.</p>
          <p>Coking coal demand has similarly declined, in line with lower steel production. Xstrata Coal's Oaky No. 1 mine in Queensland, Australia suspended longwall operations as it came to the end of the section. A development unit has been installed to ensure the mine is able to respond quickly when market conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Production at McArthur River mine was reduced to an annual rate of two million tonnes of ore per annum from 2.5 million tonnes per annum in line with the deteriorating of market demand.</p>
          <p>Now operational changes of this nature, especially the closure of operations, inevitably resulted impacts on Xstrata's employees and contractors. And we have sought to minimize these impacts on our workforce and avoid compulsory redundancies to the extent possible, including through offering early retirement schemes, or alternative positions within the Group, or by not filling vacant positions. Overall head count, including contractors, has been reduced by around about 10% or 5,500 positions to date.</p>
          <p>The current economic climate has also provided additional impetus and urgency to our management team's efforts to reduce costs and tightly manage working capital. Around $1 billion of working capital was released in the second half. Now we have long recognized, as you know, that year-on-year cost efficiencies are an important measure of our operational excellence, almost like the shop window into Xstrata. And this is borne out by Xstrata's track record of sustainable cost reductions on a real basis every year since the initial public offering in 2002, when we first entered this market.</p>
          <p>Our approach to cost has always been to progressively optimize productivity and efficiency without sacrificing longer-term growth potential of our operations. And this remains the key objective. So going into 2009, these operating cost initiatives are set to be bolstered by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the major commodity currencies, as well as the benefit of lower prices for key inputs, such as fuel and reductants.</p>
          <p>Our approach is based on our belief that the people who are best placed to identify and realize sustainable cost savings are those at the operations. Operational management teams are incentivized and have authority to implement innovative localized initiatives to enhance efficiency that together amount to cumulative savings without the burden &#x2013; significant cumulative savings, let me say, without the burden of centralized decrees and programs that ignore the realities of individual operations.</p>
          <p>Some case studies; Xstrata Zinc's recently announced series of measures to optimize its Mount Isa operations offers a great example of the initiatives currently underway in the Group. The restructuring of Mount Isa's zinc-lead operations aims to achieve substantial reductions in operating and cash costs, while increasing metal production from the complex to support our array of smelters and refineries.</p>
          <p>The Handlebar Hill open pit mine is now going to be placed into care and maintenance, while production from the large scale Black Star and higher grade George Fisher mines will increase by 35% and 13% respectively. There, together with the stockpiled ore from Handlebar Hill, this will enable the throughput at the expanded zinc-lead concentrator of some 7.3 million tonnes or 20% higher than in 2008, in an optimized way with improved recoveries and increased operational efficiencies.</p>
          <p>So this strategic restructuring of Xstrata Zinc's Mount Isa operations will result in a 23% increase in zinc metal outputs and a 17% increase in lead metal output over 2008 levels. Our planned capital expenditure at Mount Isa is going to reduce by 83% without impacting the integrity of our operations. And further cost savings will be achieved through reducing and deferring the movement of waste material at Black Star by 40%.</p>
          <p>Now in total, if I take the operating costs, they will be reduced by $135 million or 32% in 2009. That is a very significant reduction. And when taken together with the expected increase in metal output and reductions to capital spend, the cash benefits to the Group should be in the region of $0.5 billion in 2009. And this figure excludes any beneficial impact from a potentially stronger U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar.</p>
          <p>And this exceptional result is obviously to the credit of Santiago and Xstrata Zinc's operational management. And that demonstrates the entrepreneurial approach being taken across Xstrata's businesses to reduce costs and improve the productivity.</p>
          <p>And similarly at Xstrata Nickel, the accelerated closure of higher-cost operations at Sudbury, driven by the Sudbury team, together with energy efficiency improvements and low capital de-bottlenecking at Nikkelverk is expected to reduce operating cash costs at the combined Sudbury and Nikkelverk operation by over 30% in 2009 when compared to 2008. And, again, this also includes the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>This substantial cost improvement includes the transformational impact on Sudbury's cost profile expected from the commissioning of the Nickel Rim South operation later this year. And when fully commissioned, Nickel Rim South will more than replace the lost metal volume from the closed mines, contribute significantly higher by-product credits and offers substantially lower cash costs through the application of bulk mining methods. So, more good news to come in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now as I mentioned at the start of the presentation, we've also announced today the proposed $2 billion acquisition of Glencore's world-class thermal coal operations in Colombia, an opportunity which only arose as a result of the proposed rights issue and Glencore's firm desire to remain invested in Xstrata.</p>
          <p>The Prodeco operations in La Jagua and Calenturitas mines, which benefit from the potential to almost double production from the current nine million tonnes per annum of premium quality export thermal coal. Prodeco also controls its own infrastructure in the form of export port facilities, a 40% share in rail facilities and proprietary rolling stock.</p>
          <p>And Xstrata Coal management has a detailed operational experience in these assets, with one of Xstrata Coal's senior operational managers having recently held the position of Chief Operating Officer of Prodeco. And the acquisition represents a highly attractive addition to our industry-leading portfolio of thermal coal. As a related party transaction, this will require shareholder approval.</p>
          <p>However, Xstrata and Glencore simply failed to reach full agreement on an appropriate valuation of the Prodeco assets. And as a result, the transaction includes a call option under which Glencore may buyback the Prodeco assets from Xstrata at any point up to the first anniversary of the closure date, for a total cash consideration of $2.250 billion, plus the net balance of any cash invested by Xstrata and profits accrued but not distributed to Xstrata.</p>
          <p>So the call option agreement ensures that should the option be exercised, Glencore will pay a repurchase price that adequately compensates Xstrata shareholders for the option granted. In my view, these operations are fair to both parties and at the same time facilitate an orderly rights issue process, which is to the benefit of all of Xstrata's shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now many of you may not be aware, but Peter Freyberg, who heads up the Coal business, is very familiar with Colombia through his extensive industry experience in the region. And Peter's therefore well placed to take us through some of the key attractions of this world-class coal complex.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mick. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to have an opportunity today to introduce you to the Prodeco thermal coal operations in Colombia, a complex with similar characteristics to the world class Cerrej&#xF3;n mine, in which we acquired a one-third stake in 2006.</p>
          <p>Prodeco's two coal mines, La Jagua and Calenturitas, are located in northern Colombia, less than 200 kilometers from our world class Cerrej&#xF3;n joint venture. The mines are traditional truck-and-shovel operations, and the coal requires no washing. Together, the mines produced just under nine million &#x2013; just over nine million tonnes of export thermal coal in 2008. This was principally sold to Europe and the Americas where this high-energy low-sulfur coal attracts a premium price.</p>
          <p>With a reserve base of over 250 million tonnes and further resource upside, the mine life at current mining rates is well in excess of 20 years. The EBITDA of Prodeco is estimated to be in excess of 200 million for the full year in 2008. The net profits disclosed in our regulatory press release for the 10 months to 31st October 2008, of $41 million, is of course after interest and finance charges, whereas we acquire the asset debt free.</p>
          <p>Neither this figure nor the EBITDA of 225 million give a true reflection of its profitability going forward. As you all know, a vital feature of any quality bulk mining operation is access to sufficient infrastructure. And in this respect Prodeco is unusually fortunate as it has both dedicated rail and port.</p>
          <p>It recently acquired 19 locos and 660 heavy rail wagons, which will be used on the recently completed rail spur to the main rail line. At Santa Marta, on the Caribbean coast, Prodeco owns a barge loading export coal facility, with a current capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum.</p>
          <p>Following the completion of the rail spur and the purchase of new rolling stock, the operations are transitioning from trucking to rail transportation, which will significantly reduce operating costs, bringing them in line with that of Cerrej&#xF3;n. As a consequence, the operating costs of the asset declines significantly next year &#x2013; this year. When one takes into account other costs that will fall away under our ownership, the EBITDA and net profit will reflect a more than adequate return on our investment.</p>
          <p>Production is set to almost double to 17 million tonnes per annum by 2013 through a brownfield expansion of the mine site and the associated logistics. The first of the new marvel equipment will begin to arrive on site this year, leading to greater ramp up in production. A second rail track is already being laid to double capacity and this is due for completion during 2009.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Prodeco is part of a consortium, which plans to participate in the construction of a new greenfield-dedicated export facility with an initial throughput capacity of 32 million tonnes per year, providing sufficient capacity to meet the planned growth profile. Once completed the expansion will significantly enhance this low-cost, long-life, world-class thermal coal complex, enhancing Xstrata's already strong Atlantic market offering and further consolidating our leadership in the export thermal coal market. As Mick alluded to earlier, my team and I have extensive experience operating in Colombia, and specifically with the Prodeco assets themselves.</p>
          <p>For some time, we have viewed Prodeco as an asset with a rare combination of attributes. Scale, these are low-cost assets with high quality and differentiated product. It has dedicated infrastructure, substantial ground for growth potential, and proximity to two very attractive markets, the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>This acquisition will increase our Colombian presence, providing Xstrata Coal with an interest in two of the three major thermal coal producers in Colombia, and an enhanced platform to seek out further value-creating opportunities in this key strategic region. I'm sure many of you will be keen to get a sense of where we see the thermal price heading. While I will disappoint not providing detailed guidance on potential settlements of the next contract year, I can say that we continue to see the fundamentals for thermal coal industry remaining robust.</p>
          <p>Whilst the global slowdown has undoubtedly led to lower electricity consumption, thermal coal benefits from being a base load energy source and hence demand remains relatively resilient. Thermal coal continues on a cost per unit of energy basis to be the most competitive source of mass energy and, furthermore, represents a secure source of energy for many countries.</p>
          <p>On a slightly longer term note, global infrastructure constraints remain in place and are likely to impede significant increase in supply, helping the market balance and provide positive price support.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand you back to Mick. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So since the listing in 2002, Xstrata has transformed into a major diversified mining group with significant growth options. And this has been achieved, as you well know, in large part due to successful &#x2013; the successful execution and integration of three major transformational acquisitions.</p>
          <p>2002, at the time of our listing, we acquired the former Enex and Duiker coal assets, making us the world's largest producer of export thermal coal. In 2003, we acquired MIM, thereby adding copper and coking coal to our portfolio, and augmenting our zinc lead assets. And in 2006, the acquisition of Falconbridge added nickel and substantially enhanced the copper business.</p>
          <p>These acquisitions delivered Xstrata a suite of cash-generative assets, diversified both by commodity and geography, benefiting from a top-five market position in seven major commodity markets, and a world-class pipeline of brownfield and greenfield projects that provide long-term growth options.</p>
          <p>We've also proactively secured value-enhancing growth from bolt-on acquisitions to supplement our existing commodity businesses, or provide access to new commodities. And Xstrata has established a strong track record in efficient and effective post-acquisition integration expertise.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we have delivered significant improvements in the operating and financial performance of all the assets acquired since 2002. And it's also worth noting that within one year of the acquisitions of both MIM and Falconbridge, safety performance at the acquired operations improved by over 40% and 33% respectively. Following each acquisition, we have implemented a number of initiatives to enhance the NPV of acquired operations through sustainable operating cost reductions, productivity improvements, extensions to mine life and reserves, and the development of low-risk brownfield growth options.</p>
          <p>The focus on continuous improvement is highlight by six years of consecutive real operating cost reductions, and ongoing improvements to operations under our stewardship. As I previously highlighted, Xstrata's evolved structure significantly enhances our ability to act quickly and put in place improvements at the operational level without the burden of central overheard or central decision making.</p>
          <p>The financial crisis has produced a marked lack of visibility into short-term economic activities. And, as such, the outlook for 2009 is at best uncertain. Notwithstanding prevailing near-term market conditions, the long-term positive trend for increased demand for metals and energy remains intact. Now I know this may come as a surprise to some, but I urge you, and especially those who've got religion, to keep the faith, even in the face of current adversity.</p>
          <p>Firstly, ongoing industrialization of developing economies continues, although at a somewhat subdued pace pro tem. But the massive rate of urbanization remains an important driver. In China and India alone, over 20 million people per annum are currently moving to cities. Globally, this number increases some 65 to 70 million people each year.</p>
          <p>Metals and energy intensity trends in economies that have industrialized and developed in the past suggest that the intensity of commodity usage in China and India and South East Asia economies will continue to escalate fueling a sustained increase in demand for metals and energy over the medium to longer-term. Long-term positive demand trends of this nature result in higher average commodity prices and historical norms in real terms, as new supply struggles to keep pace with the increasing demand from emerging economies.</p>
          <p>But what about the dark days we find ourselves in now? Getting through these trying times is the current imperative, before we dream too much of the sunny days of the outlooks. So I've already described to you the initiatives that we have taken at Xstrata. But on a more macro level, there's been a concerted effort by governments to confront the sudden downturn in global economic conditions, and to attempt to restart growth, improve liquidity and secure the global banking system.</p>
          <p>In total, over $1.7 trillion of fiscal stimulus packages have been announced to-date in major commodity consuming regions, including China, Japan, Europe, and the United States. A very significant proportion of this total, for example, more than 70%, or $400 billion, of China's total investment has been earmarked for metals-intensive infrastructure investment, and is consequently expected to bolster demand for commodities.</p>
          <p>Together with looser monetary policy to encourage industrial production and economic growth, these measures are expected to be begin to ease economic conditions. However, the current recession will be deep, and it is too early to tell how long it will last. So what about the response of the industry? I think it is true to say that since the financial crisis in 2008, September 2008, the majority of LME commodities have traded at ultimately &#x2013; at prices which are ultimately unsustainable or below the marginal cost of production.</p>
          <p>It is striking and important to note that the mining industry has responded to the sudden reversal in fortunes with far greater speed and to a greater extent than in previous economic downturns. Restricted access to capital, in particular for junior mining companies or marginal producers, has further contributed to the prompt closure of unprofitable operations and the curtailment of exploration and the development of new growth projects.</p>
          <p>Consolidation of the sector has undoubtedly also played its part, with a smaller number of major producers acting responsibly and rationally in the face of extraordinary financial market conditions and weak demand for commodities. The response of nickel producers has been perhaps the most rapid and significant, with almost one-fifth of global supply suspended or closed to-date, and further cutbacks expected. 1 million tonnes of zinc, or 9% of planned zinc production, has been idled or close. At the same time, significant proportions of ferrochrome capacity, and 34 million tonnes or 13% of planned coking coal production, has been removed from the traded market as cutbacks continue to be implemented in response to weak demand from steel makers.</p>
          <p>And in the copper market too, previously planned global copper production in 2009 is expected to be reduced by at least 9%, or 1.6 million tonnes, due to production cutbacks and suspensions, and ongoing impact of mine underperformance, and a number of major &#x2013; at a number of major copper operations. Perhaps even more noteworthy is the likely impact on longer-term supply growth, as growth projects and exploration expenditure continue to be cancelled or deferred, removing over 2.8 million tonnes of proposed new copper over the next four years, and introducing therefore significant supply constraints.</p>
          <p>So while near-term market conditions remain very challenging, the swift reduction in existing production, and the suspension of loss-making operations will limit over-supply and ultimately result in a more balanced market as demand starts to increase from current depressed levels. And in the medium term, the current shortage of capital and poor short-term visibility are leading to substantial capital expenditure reductions by major and junior miners.</p>
          <p>These are likely &#x2013; there are likely to be further delays in new production capacity to replace aging mines of the declining grades, and increasingly difficult mining conditions. And all of this, ladies and gentlemen, is sowing the seeds of future under-supply and significant price increases across a number of commodities, once global industrial production and demand resume their longer-term growth trend. Keep the faith.</p>
          <p>Previous downturns have shown that companies which act quickly and decisively to secure their future emerge strongly from difficult economic conditions with an improved competitive advantage. And the primary purpose of our actions at the operations in the past few months, and the announcements today, is to ensure that Xstrata remains financially secure during current challenging market conditions, given the lack of visibility in the near term.</p>
          <p>However, looking through the prevailing period of uncertainty to a return of a more benign environment, the proposed capital raising also provides an enhanced platform from which at the appropriate time to initiate the next stage of Xstrata's growth. The current situation is not unfamiliar to me and my management team. And I am confident that the prospects for Xstrata remain very encouraging.</p>
          <p>So that brings us to the end of a rather long presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Anindya Mohinta from Marble Bar. Mick, good morning. Just two questions. The option structure that you have on the Prodeco transaction, does it in any way limit your ability to incorporate the EBITDA from this into the Group's EBITDA? That's my first question. And secondly, could you give us some numbers on the cost structures at Prodeco? And at the time of the Cerrej&#xF3;n deal, was this also an option that was available to you? How does it compare with Cerrej&#xF3;n on cost? Can you give us some more numbers on that please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to actually defer both questions, well, the first one to Trevor, and the second one to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, I'm afraid, under IFRS, it doesn't enable us to record the earnings as EBITDA until the option expires or is exercised. The view I take, given its impact on my negotiations with banks, is that when we test the covenants early in 2010, if we require that EBITDA, we will know whether it's either to going to be EBITDA going forward, because they won't have exercised the option, or we'll be sitting with $2.25 billion of additional cash, plus the earnings in the interim period. And I doubt the banks will be that interested in testing the EBITDA covenant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to respond to you in terms of costs, once the infrastructure systems are up and going, we expect the costs to be comparable to those of Cerrej&#xF3;n, slightly higher to compensate for a slightly higher strip ratio, but recognizing at the same time that there are some very high energy coals that come out of this complex.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, it's Sam Catalano from Macquarie. Two questions. Firstly, are you willing to disclose if management will participate in the rights issue? And secondly, what &#x2013; do you have an estimate, Peter, for CapEx of the brownfields expansion at Prodeco?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your first question, if management will participate in the rights issue, a lot of management own shares. I can't talk for them as to whether they will follow their rights though, and so that's a very difficult question to answer. I suspect that those people who have the financial resources will want to follow their rights because no one would like to be diluted at this stage in the cycle. Second question is for Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To get to the full expansion, it's just in excess of $1 billion. That takes us from the current nine to over the &#x2013; around the 17 million tonnes. In the first year, we expect that to be somewhere around $250 million. Obviously the capital is split between port and mine and some rail upgrading. We are re-evaluating to see what can be done in terms of optimizing the capital spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tobias Woerner from MF Global. Excuse me. The one question which was raised this morning or asked to me was why didn't you go for a larger rights issue? If I look at my numbers, you go to a net debt EBITDA ratio of about 2 for '09, on the estimated number. That has clearly &#x2013; still pretty much leaves you with a good headroom in a way, but you could have provided yourself even with more headroom here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, one has to make a judgment of what we think the market capacity is when doing these things. And, as you know, this is an art, not a science. This is a pretty significant amount of money to be raising as a percentage of our market capitalization. And I guess, in discussion with the underwriting banks, and in terms of our own insight to the market, we felt this is where the sweet spot was. More importantly, we are very comfortable that the level of debt that we &#x2013; the level of cash that needs to be raising in a rights issue, it puts us in the strongest possible financial position, and certainly makes us resilient in the face of the uncertainty that 2009 presents. And so I'm quite comfortable that the right number has been raised, both in terms of what our requirements are, but also in terms of where the market capacity is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, Mick, and I'll just make the point that I don't think it's appropriate to plan your capital portfolio with a view on one debt covenant. I mean, our debt covenants are particularly tight relative to some of the other major mining companies, certainly one of whom has a lot more debt than us. And yet had we those debt covenants, yes, we would be so well inside &#x2013; we just have so much excess of headroom. So I don't think you should be focusing just on the two times EBITDA to get within a covenant of three times EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you say whether there's any priority in amongst your debt instruments for repayment with these funds you'll be receiving? Will you look to take out the facility to have these covenants, or do you get better bang for your buck from buying back bonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have two major bank revolving facilities, one which was priced some time ago at extremely favorable rates, and one which was priced more recently, also at good rates, but obviously more expensive. So I think we'll err on the side of repaying the more expensive debt first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maurizio Carulli, AXA Investment Managers. A question for Peter, I guess. Is it possible to have a bit more of detail in terms of numbers for Prodeco, i.e., EBITDA, total labor costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to break it down into a rough set of numbers that gives you some guidance is, I would put the mining costs somewhere around $25 a tonne, and then the logistics and transport and costs probably another $10, say, and then the royalty on top of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And one of the numbers that has been confused in the market is that we have to put the statutory &#x2013; disclose the statutory net profit after-tax. And I think we &#x2013; Peter gave some indication of why that's a misleading number, in that clearly it's optimal for Glencore to put as much debt into the company as is allowed under the FIN capitalization rules, so there's a significant interest charge. But as Peter said, if you look at an operation which produces greater tonnage than our attributable tonnage at Cerrej&#xF3;n, and which is ultimately going to have a cost structure that is in line with Cerrej&#xF3;n, and you look at what we generate in terms of EBITDA from our Cerrej&#xF3;n operation, which was around $420 million last year, that's probably not a bad proxy to see the sort of current operating potential of the business in its current stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just a quick follow-up. Will the shareholders have the opportunity to propose slightly different proposal at the EGM? For example, if they don't like the coal transaction, can they propose something slightly different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally, what happens is shareholders have a proposal from the Board and they vote yes or no. So that's the options available to the shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you explain again why you set up this option with the deal? I mean, if things recover more quickly, then I would imagine the asset gets called back by its current owners, and if things get worse, then it's yours, and you've probably paid, who knows, 10 times EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start by saying, we're very comfortable to own this asset at $2 billion. That's the number I would have paid under any transaction. And it takes our view of the future, and it takes our view of where 2009 is. We are pretty comfortable on where our 2009 revenues actually are because we have contracts in place for most of the coal. So I don't think there is any risk for 2009. Peter has given you a medium-term perspective of thermal coal. And I doubt very much whether we're going to be upset about the valuation on the price we paid for $2 billion. I repeat again, Glencore has a different view on value. Okay?</p>
          <p>So what is likely to transpire here? What is likely to happen in the course of actually trying to facilitate a rights issue? Glencore could either dilute it, but they chose not to dilute. By choosing not to dilute, and in their own &#x2013; from their own perspective, it was also not a desirable option to draw down on their headroom to support the rights issue of 3.8 billion. It gave us the opportunity of acquiring assets, which we actually wanted, and we acquired at a number that we wanted it at. Because of the dispute on value, we have given them an option. If the option is exercised, if Glencore are able to marshal the finances to exercise the option, we end the year with a return of $250 million of option premium plus whatever the profits that we earn on the asset. And I would say that that would be a return that any shareholder of Xstrata would be happy to receive. If they don't exercise it, we end up with a world-class asset. And again, any shareholder of Xstrata would be happy with that. And in the context of the reality that one has to operate within the real world, I think we've done a pretty good deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At the risk of appearing to be so heretical, the &#x2013; I mean, how much &#x2013; I mean, in terms of, restructuring of your balance sheet, there must be other smaller assets now, which are at valuations which are unprecedentedly low. And while everyone's in retrenchment mode, are there &#x2013; there must be some opportunities within the headroom that you have. Now obviously, I won't  hesitate, this is about raising money to protect one's balance sheet, but at some stage there may be opportunities and you may wish to participate in them. It is, I suspect, too early to make any comment on that other than a broad theoretical one. Do you have anything to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Patrick, I think it's true that the valuations of a number of mining assets out there have &#x2013; are very attractive in respect of the current prices. And they may well become more attractive. I think right now the appropriate approach in this early part of 2009 is to try and get a sense of where things are going. And I think that once you've got that sense of where things are going, I think you can then decide how you are going to action opportunities. And I can assure you when we get that sense, that we will not disappoint you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one more follow-up question to Peter really, with regard to the thermal coal market on &#x2013; in the Atlantic. If you could possibly provide us with what your sort of demand-supply assessment is at this point in time. You mentioned what the prices were at the end of December. Maybe you can give us what the prices are now, and just remind us what was the lowest price in the Atlantic over the last seven years or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back, I'll have to think about the seven years, but certainly our outlook now is that there will be a bit of over-supply in the thermal markets this year as a result of some growth out of Australia, and some switching of metallurgical coals into thermal. But as a percentage of the total seaborne market, we don't believe it is that significant that it will cause the price to significantly fall from current levels. We have seen that it has been trading of late somewhat range bound in around the 70 to $80. We have seen obviously lower prices over the last seven years, but the entire energy matrix has changed. And even today when we look at the competitiveness of coal in the Atlantic market, and the dark spread versus the spark spread here in Europe, coal remains very competitive through the winter periods and similar to gas in the summer periods at the moment.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on &#x2013; you made a point that one should relax on the covenants. But given you've gone to the extent of raising all this money, it is a big amount of money. Have you been speaking to the banks to try and give the market more comfort on the back of raising the money, that they should relax the covenants? Just doing back of the envelope, if your H2 EBITDA, which I think you said was mainly coal, was $2.7 billion on, I guess, old contract prices, if they were to come down, which they possibly could, then an annualized number pro forma could be in the region of, I don't know, in a bearish scenario, 3.5, $4,5 billion.</p>

          <p>EBIT. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. D&amp;A charges are about 1.2 for a half, so 3.9 for the second half EBITDA.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But negotiations with the banks, is that ongoing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I actually haven't had any negotiations with the bank. I was quite taken aback when I was chatting to one of the other people in my position, another bank, and he said at another mining company, he said how are you dealing with the banks. I said well I really don't have to deal with the banks. As I said to you early on, we've got some very low-priced facilities. We've got $6 billion of headroom after this rights issue. If the banks want to come and deal with me, they know where to find me, but we are not in a position of discomfort.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-on from me on the marketing rights at Prodeco. Does that coal now come under your existing agreements for the rest of your coal, or is it going to be continued to market by Glencore?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Coal in the first year was tied up at $75, and we'll obviously review how to best position our marketing in the Atlantic, given that we have this increased portfolio now.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there no further questions? Well again thank you very much for attending. I much appreciate it. And have a good day.</p>
