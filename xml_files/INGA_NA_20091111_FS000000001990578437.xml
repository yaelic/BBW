          <p>Good morning.  This is Salla welcoming you to ING's Accelerating Journey Back to Basics Conference Call.  Before handing this conference call over to Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group; Patrick Flynn, Chief Financial Officer; and Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer; let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of current views, assumptions and variables including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in securities markets including equity markets and underlying economic conditions and changes. These are set out in greater detail in our public filings, which we would urge you to read.</p>
          <p>The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables.  Also in connection with the rights of what we announced this morning please note that the full information regarding that offering will be contained in our prospectus and registration documents we have on file and will be filing as we move forward with the AFM in the Netherlands and the SEC in the U.S.  You should revert to those documents as they become available in connection with the offering.  Good morning Jan, Patrick and Koos.  Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome, a warm welcome to all on the conference call.  I am going to make the presentation based on the slides.  If you want to follow the presentation you can hook up with the Web site and then you can follow our presentation slide-by-slide.</p>
          <p>I go to the first slide, is number two here and let me comment on each slide and then after that Patrick will quickly go through the results and Koos will have a few comments on the risk position and then we can deal with your questions.</p>
          <p>Two weeks ago we announced that we had a plan to separate the bank and the insurance company.  And today I would like to explain why we're saying that this is the right decision and why this is the right time.  We see a great future for both of our businesses.  First, we will work to improve the commercial performance of both the bank as well as the insurance company so that we can create two companies and maximize the value for both of them.  And then we will work carefully towards a separation and deal with the insurance company in various ways that we have outlined before, taking into account the interest of all our stakeholders and balance the interest of all our stakeholders here.</p>
          <p>When I go to slide three, you see that the, why is this is the best way forward.  We see that the financial industry is changing.  There is more demand for simplicity and transparency.  There was an increased need for efficiency and for cost leadership because we see increased competition and we see more commoditized products.  In this context the need for simplicity outweighs the benefits of the bancassurance model that we have maintained for some time and we think that separation now will allow both the bank and the insurance company to really focus on improving their operating results and create excellence in all the operating activities that they have. Plus we believe that we will be much more agile and much more quick to respond to the needs of our customers.</p>
          <p>And then we look at the interest for shareholders we believe that the split is a clear investment case.  It will improve the visibility and the predictability of our earnings.  And we believe strongly that as a result the conglomerate discount that we have seen will gradually disappear and will unlock shareholder value.  And also this was when we look at the discussions we had with the European Commission this strategic discussion which was our decision was really the best way forward to deal with the European Commission.  And this way we can keep as well the bank as well as the insurance company together which if we had not done that would have meant divestments we had to make in concessions that would have left both a weaker bank and a weaker insurance company.  The only thing that you can say is that as a result of the European Commission the decision was made earlier than we might otherwise have made it and there was a time limit, but we don't think that the time limit really is that constraining to us.</p>
          <p>What we have, we have a strong bank, a good franchise, it is an efficient and a leading internet bank, which we believe is the future of banking and we have a good insurance company with strong growth prospects in the developing markets and the leading retirement services business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And when I go to slide number five, you'll see the footprint of our European operation in -- for the bank.  And we are not just a Benelux bank, we are much more than a Benelux bank.  We have a very strong foot print in Western and Central and Eastern Europe.  Plus we are the world's leading direct bank with an unparalleled experience and expertise in internet banking and direct marketing and very innovative in our distribution concepts.  Our customer service and our customer quality is the highest of most other banks in the countries in which we compete.  An example is the retail bank in Germany where we are the number three bank with the number one bank voted I think three years in a row for customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p>We are the only commercial bank in the Netherlands that has its own international network which is very critical for our international customers both in this country here and in this region here as well as in the regions in which we operate as well because they use the international network for doing their businesses here in Europe.  We have good positions in growth markets in Central Europe like Poland and Romania, but also in Turkey and we have opportunities for further growth in North America and Asia, in particular Canada, Australia, India, China and Thailand.  So it is not just a European bank, it is a European, predominantly European bank, but there's a lot of opportunities for future growth.</p>
          <p>When you look at slide number six, you see that there still is sufficient scale even for a mid-size European bank by total assets and if you look at our deposits we really have a very large deposit base and that makes us an extremely strong retail franchise.  Slide number seven, the strategic advantages that we have going forward, I think are pretty clear.  Because in the industry we see a change of lower appetite for risk, probably there will be a need for more capital and more liquidity requirements and we believe that products will become commoditized; they'll become more simple and more transparent.</p>
          <p>And in order to succeed in that environment your cost base is absolutely key for success.  Plus the brand position, and we have a good brand, one of the strongest financial brands in the world, and we have a solid balance sheet.  So, I think we have the situation that we can be successful going forward.  And we have the lowest cost in the Netherlands per customer in Europe and ING has the lowest cost per customer in the Netherlands.  We are driven by efficiency of internet distribution.  We have an internet first strategy in the Netherlands and Belgium and then of course ING Direct has a very low operating expense base relative to assets in the industry.  And not to forget our liquidity position relative to loan deposits I think is a strong one.  So, all overall I think a good position, a strong position to go forward with even in a competitive marketplace.</p>
          <p>On page number eight, you see that the ING Bank has a number of very successful operations and that is reflected in our commercial result, that has been growing by about 7% over the last few years. And actually when you look at the results of 2009 the first nine months are even better than the full year 2008.  So, this is I think encouraging news and also an option that we have to further improve our operational excellence in the bank operations.  So, that I think bodes well for our future and the plans that we have and the ambition that we have for 2013.</p>
          <p>And that is the slide number nine, you see what the ambition is, very simple, we like to grow our top line by 5%, we like to strive for an income, cost income ratio of 50% and we like to go to a return on equity of about between 13 and 15%.  And let me explain in the next few slides how we are going to accomplish that or think to accomplish that.</p>
          <p>In slide number 10 you see what we are going to do with our balance sheet.  We're going to grow our balance sheet if we take the base 2008 by about 5%.  And then when you take the pro forma number that we have, once we have completed the separations of 760 billion excluding divestments then you would see that that is roughly 190 billion balance sheet growth until the end of 2013 and that's mainly in mortgages, in loans and in savings.  We then calculate an interest margin and a relative conservative one of about 100 basis points and that would generate roughly 1.9 billion of additional income.  Currently we have an interest margin of 140 basis points in Q3 and more like 130 basis points year-to-date.  So that's a rather conservative estimate that we have taken in order to calculate the additional income.</p>
          <p>When you look at savings we have started since 2008 we have seen that competition for deposit has normalized in the Netherlands, and we see further improvements ahead.  If the yield curve would move upwards we will be able to invest these savings at a higher margin.  And we expect an improvement of about 25 basis points on the current 300 billion of savings and that would boost our income by about 800 million from 2009 to 2013.  And then on the lending part we believe we have seen a loan book re-pricing.  All-in-all we expect going forward that we will have a positive impact of about 500 million of loan re-pricing for the period 2009-2013.  So this would bring the ambition level of 5% annual growth in income and year-to-date if we exclude the market impact we have seen about a 700 million increase in income so far.</p>
          <p>So that is slide 10. When you go to slide 11, we're going to show how we are going to reduce our cost income ratio to 50%.  Now we have already reduced our cost base in 2009 significantly.  And cost savings are still coming through in particular from the retail banking transformation that we are doing in the Netherlands and in Belgium.  But then we have the One Bank efficiency program that Eric Boyer and his team has been working on, we're going for instance to do centralized purchasing and procurements.  That will take a four billion procurement organization that is spending about 4 billion with estimated savings in this period of about 350 million.  I can say from my experience in other areas that this is a fairly minor type of savings program.</p>
          <p>This is done then on top of all the savings that we have done so far.  We're looking at decommissioning a number of IT applications.  We're looking at setting up lower data centers and we are reviewing our processes and back offices to see how we can deal with support functions and how we can grow to excellence here as well.  So of course we expect we will grow about 2% per annum to support the organic business growth which then is in total of about 800 million for the period 2009 and 2013.  Then we have earmarked a number of investments.  We expect that we need to spend 250 million for investments in commercial operations and internet platforms to further improve the quality of service that we will provide to our customers.  So, that explains the cost income ratio as trends go down to 50%.</p>
          <p>Now on slide number 12, you see the ambition that we have in 2013 for risk costs.  We will see that this cost will trend there is about risk-weighted asset growth of about 5% per annum.  We have successfully done and I think under the leadership of Koos, Koos Timmermans successfully done a lot of mitigation of credit migration on a year-to-date basis.  And after rebasing for divestments we can see that our risk-weighted assets will grow by about 5 to 6% per annum which is in line with our balance sheet growth.  And then we expect that the cost will trend to between 40 and 45 basis points on average credit risk-weighted assets over the cycle and that I think is line with what we have told you earlier.</p>
          <p>And then you look at 2013 what does it mean, when we calculate the return on equity.  Well, that means that we believe that our return on equity will be in the range of 13 to 15%, could be a little bit higher, could be a little bit less, but then saying that's the range that we are looking at and we believe it is well achievable.  If you look at how we have performed and how parts of the bank are performing we believe that is certainly doable.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008 the return on equity was 2.8% but it was heavily impacted by some negative market developments on impairments and reevaluations.  And when we exclude these negative market impacts then the return on equity would have been 12.5%.  Yeah, risk-weighted assets impact would represent about a 3% burden on return on equity.  And we estimate that we will make an extra profit from here to 2013 compared with 2008 that will increase the return on equity by about 5 to 6%.  So all-in-all, an ambition to go to about a 15% ambition level for 2013.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to the insurance company, also insurance we believe has a very promising future here.  On slide 15, you can see that we have in many, many areas where we operate in a leading positions in the market.  And especially the leading position in provider of life and retirement related type products both in mature and in growth markets as well.</p>
          <p>On slide number 16, you see that we have strong position in high margin growth markets relative to the global life insurance peers.  We have about 42% of our insurance sales is coming from markets with high growth.  And you can see that in the slide on the right side of this picture and that compares quite favorable with the global peers that we have.  On the right side then you see the value creation from insurance sales year-to-date, that's about 70% of the value of new business coming from our growth markets and that points to a greater contribution to our income and our results in the future from these markets.  And these markets are really hot, they're doing quite well and we see that reflected in our numbers as well.</p>
          <p>Then on slide number 17, we look for what are the benefits and the savings that we can create following the crisis.  We are expecting that the growth and asset balance will outpace the rate of growth that we experienced in the previous years because people will save more for retirement, that is a trend in particular in the U.S. but we see that also in other parts of the world.  And ING Insurance believes that over the longer term that we will be able to grow our top line and the value of new business by about 10% per annum.</p>
          <p>Slide number 18, how is the capital allocation.  Well about one-third of the insurance book capital is invested in growth markets.  The equity invested in subsidiaries that did increase from 22 billion at the end of the second quarter now to 24 billion at the end of Q3.  And as we explained on October the 27th, all hybrid and debt leverage is held at the insurance holding company and therefore the subsidiary companies are debt free.  And you can see what these are by the various regions as well.</p>
          <p>On slide number 19, we show you the embedded value and here you clearly see that embedded value exceeds the book value as we calculate that in the IFRS.  These are numbers at year end 2008.  We don't have them for the year-to-date so far, but we will have them at the end of the year and then we will present them to you.  We also have made a comparison with the IFRS equity at the end of Q3.  So, this indicates that we should expect to receive proceeds on the sale of insurance that certainly will create shareholder value.</p>
          <p>On page 20, we show you now a margin breakdown of the insurance business.  And you can see here that they were positively impacted by higher assets under management and by cost cutting.  The operational results for insurance gives this very more insight in the earnings capacity that we have as an insurance company.  And what do you see, well, you see clearly that administrative expense are improving and that the cost reduction exercises we have implemented are really working.  That fees on assets under management have started to increase again compared to Q2 where markets have improved.  And you also see that the investment margin in Q3 is under pressure if you compare that with Q2, but in Q2 you get most of your dividend income and dividend payments so that's I think a very logical explanation, plus we have de-risked our operation  quite a lot in 2009.</p>
          <p>In slide number 21, you see that we have 400 billion of assets under management and some 230 billion is third-party assets at the end of June 2009 and they are equally divided over retail and institutional clients and some 45 billion is for risk of the policyholders.  They are planning as we have told you earlier to make the invest management company a separate profit center in ING and will start reporting earnings as of the 1st of January 2010.</p>
          <p>I go to slide 23, what do we do moving forward.  Now we have our goals for 2009 basically all achieved and already now.  Our Back to Basics program has been quite successful in every aspect.  We have delivered on all the elements that we have started some special programs and I think you must be pretty happy with the diligent performance that we have shown here.  And I think that bodes well for going forward.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 24, you see how we are planning to go forward.  This is the next phase of our Back to Basics program.  We believe that we will need about 12 months to disentangle the bank and the insurance organization, could be more, could be less, but that's the planning at this moment.  I must say we're going to take our time to that because we want to do that right, one time the first time right.  At the same time we're going to make sure that both the insurance company and the bank are going to perform to their best performance levels.  So for the next six to eight quarters I would say this is the main objective that we have, really look at performance.  The bank has already taken some steps in a special project and also the insurance company recently has started a special project to really help the company to a better operating performance.  And I must say I have high expectations on that as well.</p>
          <p>We will start the sales process only after we have accomplished that and then considering all the options we have, that could be IPO, that could be rate sales, could be spend, could be anything.  I think at this moment I would not leave any option off the table.  But it's very important that we create the retained earnings during this process and that will help us repaying or at least partly repaying maybe the core Tier 1 securities and the proceeds from insurance will then fund the remainder that we need to have in order to repay the Dutch State and also to deal with the any type of investments we might make going forward.</p>
          <p>We believe that the proceeds slide number 25, from the insurance by itself should be sufficient to repay the Dutch State and to eliminate the double leverage as you can see on the slide here.  I'll let you study that and if you have any questions we can come back on that later.</p>
          <p>Let me hand it over to Patrick who will quickly deal with the results of Q3.  Patrick?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.  I'll take you through the results.  Albeit you would have seen these substantially in the 26th of October so I will not dwell in great detail on these slides.  Suffice to say on slide 27, where we show the P&amp;L.  You saw this in the 26th of October, there is no real surprise here.  Our net result is 499 million which compares to 71 million in the preceding quarter.  Our underlying net results of 778 compares to 229 million in the preceding quarter, these are substantially higher and this is entirely in line with the results we showed you on the 26th.</p>
          <p>I just do want to emphasize a couple of points, the Q3 results do not include the settlement cost, the EC settlement costs in respect of Alt-A, the 1.3 billion was mentioned earlier and in addition the provision for DSB.  These are items which are yet to come; they're not in the Q3 results.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 28, again the commercial result, this slide you'll have seen in the 26th of October so I'll briefly go through it again.  Key points to make here is that the bank commercial result is up, a two billion increasing from 1.8 which is the driver of the overall 2.4 billion commercial result which increased from 2.3.  We have had a strong interest income result in the bank, commission income is higher and cost reductions are coming through.  These are driving the bank numbers higher.</p>
          <p>On the insurance side, it's slightly lower, 346 million as compared to 501 million in the second quarter.  As Jan has mentioned on slide 20 when we talked about the operating performance, the reasons for the reduction are seasonal in respect of receipt of dividends.  It's more a Q2 phenomenon and also the impact of de-risking our book which has led to somewhat lower investment income.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 29, this describes the difference between the underlying result of the Bank before and after risk costs, market impacts I should say.  There are two key things I want to draw your attention to here.  Impairments, is a big number, 664 million and was actually higher than the preceding quarter.  This is, 90% of this relates to Alt-A impairments in ING Direct USA.  And I suppose the key point that I'd like to draw out here is that at this juncture, at this point in the cycle the remaining amount left that can be impaired is &#x20AC;300 million.  The remaining negative mark-to-market that can be impaired at current market levels is less than the charge we've taken.</p>
          <p>Second point to draw out here, revaluation of real estate and impairments 423 million which was broadly split 50-50 between impairments and further fair value write-down on our investment portfolio.  The other big number on the page, loan loss provisions of 662, which is down from the preceding quarter represents 87 basis points of credit-weighted risk assets.  And Koos will give you more detail on the evolution of our bad debt charges in a couple of minutes.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slide 30, here we see the underlying performance of the three different divisions of the bank.  Retail banking is up with a combination of improved margins, lower costs and better margin on interest rates.  ING Direct is a loss, this is driven almost exclusively by the large 580 million impairment on Alt-A I referred to in the preceding slide.</p>
          <p>Commercial Banking, I'd like to take you forward to slide 31 where we can look at Commercial Banking in a little bit more clarity.  Commercial Banking includes our wholesale banking business and also ING Real Estate.  When we're looking at commercial banking, that's the box on the top left, excluding real estate we see that the results of commercial banking are an increase in profitability to 577 million as compared to 432.</p>
          <p>This is driven by lower bad debts but also our revenue levels are holding up very well and have only dropped some 8% as compared to the preceding quarter.  So, we've still maintained strong revenue lines in our wholesale banking operations.  And the other point I want to draw out here is on the box on the bottom left, the cost/income ratio at 39%.  Jan mentioned the ambition for the overall bank to get to 50% cost/income ratio where we can see that some of our, one of our businesses at least is clearly a poster boy for this ambition and is well below the 50% today.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slide 32, interest margin, this has improved nine basis points to 140 as compared to the preceding quarter and we're seeing improvment in ING Direct, and also in Retail Banking.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Insurance, slide 33, this slide explains why Insurance results before market impacts tie out to Insurance results, underlying Insurance results excluding market impacts.  There are a number of market impacts here which drive the higher results.  A couple of points I would like to draw out.  In respect of equity hedges, which is a big negative 366 in particular in Europe the 232 million of cost will substantially reduce as these hedges are running off.  It's also a positive to see some sign of improvement in private equity markets where we recorded a gain on one of our private equity investments.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slide 34, here we show our insurance businesses in the regions and all of these have increased and on the back of the cost discipline we referred to earlier and some sales improvements, basically and these are more clearly identified in the subsequent page, page 35, where we show APE and VNB.  Sales are improving, in aggregate they are up in Q3.  They've turned the corner from the very low period of first quarter albeit they still remain lower than a year ago, but the trend is clearly improving.  The small decrease in Europe is primarily due to technical reassessment of assumptions in our VNB.</p>
          <p>That concludes the finance presentation.  I would like to hand you over to my colleague Koos who will take you through the risk slides.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, page 37, if you look at loan loss provisioning, on loan loss provisioning what you see in the third quarter is 87 basis points, noteworthy is that it's a growth of 112 minus releases of 25 and this is something which is normal if you're progressing through a crisis that you start to see your releases kicking in.  Where does the decline come from, the decline comes from the structured finance and the general lending and commercial banking portfolio.  Expectation going forward, yes, we are progressing through a crisis nevertheless we expect to be around the levels of the first three quarters, that is still the outlook going forward.  It's too early to say whether we have turned the corner on that side.</p>
          <p>We go to slide 38 if we go to the mortgage portfolio which is a big chunk of our total loan portfolio, there what you see is the following.  Overall if you look at NPLs then you see that the NPLs did not change.  The only part where you did see a change is in the U.S. portfolio where it moved from 4.1% to 4.3% and that is basically the U.S. portfolio if you compare it with prime ARMs it is a low number, nevertheless, that is the part which is still increasing a bit.</p>
          <p>If we go to page 39 then we look at the credit migration aspect.  What you see is from Q2 to Q3 you've seen that our risk-weighted assets have gone down.  Now why did it go down?  You have on the one hand you have credit migration and credit migration added risk-weighted assets 5 billion.  Nevertheless actions have been taken to reduce the risk-weighted asset overall.  So you could say and the numbers of assets are stated there on the right hand side, but you could say we have kept the RWAs in check.  Just one thing on the bottom part what you see is for instance the, what we call the double edged sword.  The moment you have credit migration it triggers both two things, a higher loan loss provisions and at the same time it triggers risk-weighted assets, hence our importance which we give to managing this credit risk migration.</p>
          <p>I think if you go to page 40 then we look at the Alt-A portfolio.  On the Alt-A portfolio the news there, the bad news is the delinquencies because the delinquencies have moved up from 20% to 24%.  So that is an ongoing deterioration.  What you do see is market value of the portfolio is moving up a little bit.  Important thing to note on this is if you look at the actual cash losses 8 million so very low still.  That also means that the credit enhancement on this portfolio is still unused.  But if you look at the estimated credit losses for the quarter in Q3 they are 239 million and that led to impairments of 580 million pre-tax.</p>
          <p>Now where does this bring us on the Alt-A?  The first thing to note is that the after-tax revaluation reserve left is 0.4 billion.  So what do I want to say with this, what I want to say is that overall the portfolio is almost brought down to a market value.  So where does that lead us to?  If you look at this collectively over the quarters then you're seeing that the cumulative credit losses on this portfolio they are approximately $680 million which is over &#x20AC;400 whereas at the same time the total cumulative impairments on this portfolio are somewhere over 1.2 billion.  So that is the status of the Alt-A portfolio, so written down to a large extent.</p>
          <p>I go to page 41.  On page 41 you see our movement in the revaluation reserve and what you see in the revaluation reserve is where it was for the debt securities minus 7.9 in Q2, you see it moving to minus 2.8 now.  So a significant progression in the re-val reserve which of course has to do with the contraction of credit spreads and you see that basically in all sectors, also in the ABSs.</p>
          <p>So the fact that the revaluation reserve moves up such a lot, you see that back on page 42 in basically the progression of our IFRS equity.  And what you see happening there is that the re-val reserve so the middle bar, the blue bar plus 5.1 billion contributes a lot to our progress of shareholders equity which moved from 22 billion to 26 billion.  So the fact that shareholders equity moves up a lot, of course has its implication, for instance the leverage ratio which improved with it.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to page 43, if you look at the Tier 1 ratio of the bank, you see the Tier 1 ratio has improved, so despite the fact that we are shrinking the balance sheet, we don't do that with a margin erosion because overall what you see is 7.6% Tier 1 ratio, core Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>Group debt/equity, slight improvement on the group debt/equity ratio, also you see improvements on the insurance debt/equity ratio so overall capital situation improving.  So, that's in a short version the risk story.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Koos.  Let me conclude this short presentation and say that we believe we have made the right choices here, the right strategic choices and that we have made them at the right time.  This is the right time to separate insurance and the banking business.  We see a good future for both of them.  They are strong companies.  They have good market positions and good capital positions.  And they have growth opportunities both and they have a strong foundation in some mature markets.  We first would like to continue to work on improving the performance of both operations and we have I think some good plans to do so.  And then we will carefully work towards the completion of the separation and we will do that I think protecting the interest of all our stakeholders and balancing the interest of the stakeholders I think very carefully as well.  So, that is our plan.  Let me now deal with your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first comes from Spencer Horgan.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Good morning everyone, three things I think and first question is and I apologize if this is way too premature.  But have you had much expressions of interest on the insurance side of things so far and if you have, depending on how those conversations have gone have you changed or altered in any way your view of the preferred exit REIT and I'd like to hear your comments about it taking you to separate them but I'd just be interested in any flavor on that one?</p>
          <p>And then just two numbers questions, the first one on slide 32 you gave the sensitivity I think to a parallel shift in the yield curve in terms of the bank and the interest margin.  Can you give us a flavor on how you see what happens if the yield curve twists?  And then the last thing is obviously you've given us some new information in terms of the Insurance operating profit, and I kind of roughly need to look through it.  But I guess if you look at the trends you can see operating profit tends to average around five or 600 billion a quarter, is that kind of a run rate you'd be happy with prospectively or could it be a little bit higher?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will take the first question, Koos the second one and then, Tom will, Tom McInerney our leader in Insurance will take the third question.  Yeah, we have had a lot of interest expressed already, but I must say we are not really actively engaging in discussions.  This is not the time, we have a lot of work to do.  We I think we have good plan ahead of us.  We want to take our time, we want to do it right, and I believe as the market's recovering this is not a time to let's say be extremely quick.</p>
          <p>Diligence is important here and doing it right the first time is important.  So that's I think our leading management philosophy.  Yeah, there could be some different type of exits, that depends on how well we do our performance.  If we perform very well I think the exit options may shift.  And that's why we would like to keep open what exit options that we have.  But in principle I think you always in a situation like this, you start working normal IPO because that is the normal trend that you have and the normal path that you follow.  And then all the options that can follow can be evaluated against that particular option.  So, no preferred route yet, but I think we follow the normal path of action in a situation like this.  Koos would you like to take two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at question two, so what does the yield curve twist to?  I can't give you the answer straight away.  I mean I can give you some statistics and that is that normally if interest rates go up with a parallel shift by 1%, then what you see is an increase.  Well, the first year you see a slight deterioration because you have to move your savings rate up and the re-pricing of your assets so the reinvestment is taking slower but over three years you're making a profit by it.</p>
          <p>But if you assume the following situation.  We invest our savings money on average in two years, so normally if you have a twist of the yield curve, so it's very short and moves up, then you make less money on your savings, but at the same time what happens then is that you will have less prepayments on your mortgages because with a flat yield curve there is less inclination to repay or prepay mortgages which is a benefit.  So I cannot give you overall a net-net number on that, because that's a bit too complicated to do on the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the third question will be for Tom, I think if you want to follow his answer take slide number 20 and then I think it's a good indication of the answer that Tom will be giving.  Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just referring to page 20, first thing I would say is that's only the life insurance market so it excludes the operating earnings for the non-life and also the corporate account.  And looking at that there are &#x2013; so you can see the operating earnings obviously in the light blue the fees and for assets under management obviously as markets improve we would expect that number to come up and recognize that we don't have to increase expenses to cover those higher fees, those are just fees on assets under management.</p>
          <p>The other, on investment margins obviously they have been affected by impairments.  Again as markets improve and impairments reduce over time you should see that grow and finally we spent a lot of time and effort on managing the administrative expenses so you can see third quarter '08 and third quarter '09 down 10% we would expect continue to focus on expenses.  But hopefully that gives you some sensitivity around operating income today and where it could go.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I hope you can hear me clearly.  I've got a few questions.  Number one, in the U.S. business, which I think you're indicating is about 10 billion of the 24 billion book value.  What would you say is the split between, roughly speaking between retirement services, closed annuity book and then other life?  That's question one.  Question two, just going back to Spencer's question on twisted yield curve.  I mean on slide 10 you've assumed I think I heard correctly 100 basis point net interest margin versus 140 currently for the balance sheet growth, is that right?</p>
          <p>And would that 100 basis points basically reflect kind of yield curve situation in mid 2008?  That's question number two.  And the last question actually I have is that you've given a 13 to 15% indication on ROE for the bank.  What would you say is the kind of ROE you think you're going for in Insurance, and what would say the ROE for example in Asia, what's the ROE in Benelux, what's the ROE in the U.S. could you give some sort of split there as well?  Sorry, lots of questions but if you could answer them that will be very helpful.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me deal with the twisted yield curve question, and the balance, the basis points, yeah that's 100 basis points that we have assumed.  And in 2008 we had a higher basis points, it was about 115 I think in 2008.  Koos is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I need to get the 2008 specific, I'll come back on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the Insurance questions Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the first one on the equity split, we don't, we -- not to comment specifically on the pieces but it is spread fairly evenly over the businesses between Retirement Services, Life, and then on the Annuity side it's split between variable and fixed.  That would be it on the equity and the other, what was your other question just so I have it right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>ROE target ambition or view for the Insurance business plus also some regional split again, where the ROEs are higher and where they are lower in terms of numbers there if possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think a good way to look at that is where we break out the IRRs by the different regions.  It's in the package I think that's slide 16 and so basically, you know, the ROEs are a different order of magnitude.  But I think that the relativity between higher and the emerging markets and then developed markets I think it gives you a better indication of relative.  I would say where we've been averaging is and where you'd expect overall one of the way would be similar to the where the ambition for the bank is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe -- right, so you're saying around about 13%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The range for the bank was 13 to 15.  So I'd say it's in that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And going back on the 100 basis points...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Net interest margin, I mean when you use the 100 basis points because I mean is that &#x2013; were you just basically allowing for a twist in ROI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, Farooq the following is the case.  If you look at the 100 basis points in the past that was a sort of a run rate on the total interest rate margin which we were making.  What you have seen is clearly a benefit right now, because credit re-pricing is very good, so you're re-pricing a loan portfolio and that is why we are currently at 140.  Nevertheless, we need to make the following conservative assumption with the 100 basis points and that is that credit spreads will over time slightly deteriorate nevertheless they will still look relatively good.  Also you have to take into account that our cost of funding, if you look at us as a bank, is still one of the cheapest rate around in the industry.</p>
          <p>So our assumption of 100 which is a sort of a historic rate, despite the fact that you might have a yield curve flattening I still feel that that's a relatively conservative assumption to be made.  Overall what you could say is if interest rates go up and at the same time if interest rates flatten, it has two effects.  On the one hand a very steep yield curve is favorable for the savings money, on the other hand, if what we have right now and that is a steep yield curve but based on very low rates that gives you no chance to price your savings money on our side favorably.  So, in other words if you have short-term rates at around 5% it's easier to pay your customer 4% and if your short-term interest rates are where they are right now.</p>
          <p>And so overall, you could say there is two effects.  If interest rates go up and you have a flattening, a flattening is bad news but interest rates go up allow you to price a little bit less aggressive.  And so you take that factor into account then you take into account that overall savings or credit spread margins which we had over the years '05, '07 were too negative.  Right now we had an extremely rich year, but we do expect credit spreads to stay a bit elevated as compared to the '06, '07 levels and that two together gives us the point that we think 100 basis points on the additional assets is a reasonable target for us to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically you're quite happy, but even in a sort of bad case scenario is that you've forecasted quite solid on net interest margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In your case then you have something different, because then my loan loss provisioning is going to be higher but my credit spread is going to be higher and I will have a more positive yield curve.  So, it's a difficult one to, there are offsetting factors and my assumption is credit spreads will be a bit lower but at the same time that is offset by your provisioning because it will improve.  At the same time you could argue interest rates will go up and you will have a flattening, the flattening is not good but interest rates going up gives you the chance to price a little bit less competitive on savings.  And so it's all those factors together I know that is a complicated one to give an exact calculation but overall you find like going back to the historic 100 basis points on the incremental assets is a reasonable assumption forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  First question is, I was wondering if Tom could provide us with the net amount at risk in the variable annuity business in the U.S. as of the end of the third quarter, the un-hedged bit please, and also if possible the statutory reserves on the variable annuity product in the U.S. as of the third quarter, and if possible.  And then the second question was in terms of the options for splitting up the bank and the insurance group, is there anything that prevents you from repaying down the double leverage through retained earnings over the next four years, before paying back the government?</p>
          <p>And is there anything within the EU agreement which stops you from doing that?  And because obviously &#x2013; and then if you do repay the double leverage with retained earnings is there then anything which stops you just from spinning off the Insurance business to shareholders of ING Group rather than IPO-ing it and therefore letting the ING shareholders decide the fair value of the Insurance operations rather than letting external parties?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tom you do the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the first one, Duncan I don't have the net amount at risk and the un-hedged position handy, we'll look at those and get back to you.  On the statutory reserves overall for the U.S. our reserve adequacy on an overall basis is adequate at both the 50 and 90%.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question, Duncan, the reason that we want to pay attention first to making sure that we have excellence in our operations and that our operations are performing well is exactly because we believe it creates more options for us.  And if we can deal with the retaining would be sufficient to pay down the debt and I think we have different options available to us including the one that you mentioned, a spin is then a possibility as well but we're looking ahead now for a very long time, I cannot &#x2013; I can only say that we would like to preserve as many options as we have for as long as we can and that way we hope to create more value for our shareholders but at the same time also it's an easier execution program that we are then embarking on, this lower risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no predetermined agreement with the EU about paying the Dutch government before paying down double leverage?</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Nick Holmes.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, it's Nick Holmes at Nomura.  Coming back on the net interest margin, which is obviously very high at the moment of 140 bps.  And it's obviously also benefiting from one-offs like the steep yield curve.  We've had a number of questions which sort of look at sensitivities here, but a sort of simpler question is, can you give us an idea of what you think is the sustainable level of net interest margin?  And then I also had a question for Tom on the U.S. business, but perhaps if you want to answer the net interest margin question first.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I think Nick overall it's a difficult thing to mention.  Because normally if we did not have this credit crisis, then I would say like well, you know, you move to something like 100 basis points which is an historical average.  At the same time where I'm a bit more positive on is the following, and that is that if you look at our bank then you find like overall we have a great access to savings money and at the same time a relatively minimal usage of long-term and short-term funding.</p>
          <p>So the liability side looks pretty much okay.  So that means overall we are able to price assets competitively.  At the same time I also know there is a lot of banks who still have less access to funding which means that overall you could conclude that, we will be able to price competitively, we will be able, we have a good margin based off the liability side.  So I would say like, if it was 100 in the past probably it looks more sustainable to see it around 120 basis points.  Nevertheless it is something, I mean you really have to see how this crisis crystallizes out and the sooner the ECB starts to for instance drive up funding access for banks that will have an upward shift on credit spreads which is beneficial for us.  Let's hope but I would say like 120 bps looks a normal one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's, that's very interesting.  And structurally with the business I mean ING Direct has exerted a negative pressure on the net interest margin historically and would you expect that to continue as ING Direct grows?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think overall if you look at ING Direct what we are doing right now is we are trying to normalize its investment income.  So rather than buying a big pool of AA type of credits senior bonds we are trying to integrate balance sheet and also try to make sure that they originate mortgages, so we want more loans in the portfolio.  So overall I would say like also for ING Direct you expect margins to go up.  I can give only one caveat Nick but that counts for the industry as a whole and that is the question on what will happen with liquidity requirements for instance if you look at the FSA and other ones.</p>
          <p>I mean that is a thing I don't have in hand.  Because, look at it simple if you need more liquidity I mean liquidity has a cost and that part is an uncertain one.  Overall, we have already with our Dutch Central Bank we have consolidated liquidity guidelines and we are fulfilling that and in so far as an FSA outnumbers that or if there are different changes that is the caveat I have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much for that.  Can I move on to just one more question which is for Tom, which is looking at variable annuities there has been a small positive new business value in Q3 for the first time for a very long time.  And I just wondered Tom whether you can give us bit more color about what it is that is actually going on with your products at the moment?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Nick as you know we have filed new products and a new lower risk, lower cost variable annuity and then fixed and indexed annuities, those are with the State Insurance departments and we would expect approval for launch in the first quarter.  At the same time, we continue with modest sales of the existing product and because the markets have improved somewhat there is a modest positive VNB because the IRR in the business is slightly higher than the weighted-average cost of capital.</p>

          <p>Well hi, I noticed on page 51 you showed the new bank, the pro forma core Tier 1 and compared to the previous one you deduct 2 billion from core Tier 1 because of insurance subsidiaries.  Just wondered why this is?  And am I right in saying that core Tier 1 will actually be looking stronger than expected after disposal of the insurance ARM, i.e. two billion more.  Other questions are maybe you could shed some light on the net interest margin in Belgium and also the commercial banks, because they were slightly weakish in the third quarter.  And I also noticed quite a nice improvement from in a combined ratio to I think 102% from very high levels though in the second and the first quarter though?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Yeah maybe on page 51, if you look at what we do over there on that page is we say, we basically collapsed a group into the bank and if you do it that way, then indeed you get the support of the core Tier 1 security.  So that's a plus, but at the same time you have to deduct the full insurance company from the capital of the then bank which is there and that goes first from your base capital and then it goes for a residual piece from your Tier 1 capital.  So that is what you see on that page and that is why you have the minus 2 billion deduction of the insurance subs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But this is the revision of 2 billion because previously it was I think the 11 and the 11.3 from base capital and Tier 1 was as reported.  That you added 2 billion deduction compared to the pro-forma numbers you gave before.  So my question is, am I right in assuming if you sell Insurance that your core Tier 1 would actually be even 32.9 instead of the 30.9?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the one thing what you have to see is there is more equity in the Insurance subs.  And that is, I mean if you look at that, so that is basically the explanation as compared to what you've seen before.  All right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two billion more</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, two billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah two billion, yeah, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  What the other question was on the &#x2013; if we look at the commercial banks, the volumes Netherlands you were talking about Netherlands and on Belgium I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Belgium and the commercial bank, the NIM was slightly down in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think overall what you're seeing is a slight deterioration on the volumes in the Commercial Bank minus two, but the income overall plus 10, excluding the Financial Markets business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no -- nothing wrong, the trend, up trend in net interest margin should continue. I think this is just a blip in the usual thing, in the wholesale bank basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there is a bit, of course there is re-pricing I think. So again what happens is you have savings money, savings money is invested, and what you see is overall you get a bit of lower re-pricing right now of the reinvestment yields of your savings money.  And so, if you cannot say like it's part of a trend or something is going on because if I look at first Q '08 we were at 1.29%, now it's 1.35.  Actually what you try to do with savings money is to keep to maintain a sort of a constant or a slightly increasing margin and the way how you do it is by sometimes investing a bit shorter and sometime investing a bit longer.  But what you see right now is you have a runoff of high yield investments replaced by lower yield so that has a downward pressure.  But at the same time you also pay a bit less for your savings money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the combined ratio -- is improving nicely, you think it's improving further going forward to let's say 100%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The combined ratio, we would expect because of the focus on expenses we would expect to continue to be better than 100%.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Marc Thiele.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Marc Thiele from UBS.  Three questions please, first question is on slide 21, where you present the split in terms of the third-party assets under management, does that include some unit link and how much of that?  And then the other question is following up from that is, can you give us some indication of how the profitability looks like, I know you want to give us more detail next year, but maybe you could give us a feeling for how the margins look like or what average fees you generate on these assets?</p>
          <p>My second question is then on slide 12, it's difficult to read, it looks like a 40 or 50 billion reduction in risk-weighted assets.  How much of that corresponds to sale of ING Direct USA, or can you give us the amount of capital that is in that subsidiary?  My third question is going back to slide 10, you gave us some detail on what you expect in terms of the volume effect and the margin for savings.  Can you give us a bit of color on what you forecast in terms of the margins in the loan bucket there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the Investment Management business, I am afraid you're really going to have to wait till the first quarter because we are pulling that out now as we speak so we don't have a split of the Investment Management business at this point.  So that really is going to be a Q1 event I am afraid before we can pull that out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there is no unit link then here is there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let us come back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because it says here there is a general account and then it says third-party, I'm just curious if there is any unit links in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right so if you look...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or are we double counting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at page 21 so the insurance general account would be obviously fixed income.  On the third-party side, third-party institutional, that would be both fixed and equity management for third parties.  On the retail side a reasonable amount of that 32% would be where we are investing say on variable annuities where our investment group is actually managing the assets.  So there clearly are variable annuities and unit linked investments in that third-party retail percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe on the question of the page 12, we're talking about divestments, that's the gray bar -- we are talking here about approximately 34 billion of RWA divestment.  I don't have the precise breakdown, like what is there you have or what is other ones in there, but ING Direct U.S. is included in that total envelope of 34.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your third question Marc, your third question had to do with slide number 10, and then the savings on current accounts, that 800 million. We have calculated here an improvement of about 25 basis points on the current 300 billion of savings.  So that has an impact of about 800 million on income.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine.  And for the re-pricing of the loans what have you assumed there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Oh yeah I just wondered you said 115 basis points, that's what I thought on the entire book presumably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's already in 2009; of that 500 million I think there's already 250 million in there.  And then we have an impact of cross-selling what we &#x2013; I think what we are increasing today that we did not do as rich as we're doing today.  So the impact of that together will be an increase of 500 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Farquhar Murray.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning gentlemen, it's Farquhar from Autonomous here.  Just two questions if I may.  Just starting with the ROE on the Insurance business.  If I just crudely sum the Insurance operating results for the last four quarters I get about 2.4 billion. I presume tax about 25% on that, so I'm looking at about 1.8 billion.  If I compare that to the book equity in the subs sort of 22 to 24, I'm looking at an ROE of about 8% per annum.</p>
          <p>I'm just trying to tally that to the guidance you gave there of 13 to 15%. I just wondered whether that's building in the ambition on cost cutting whether it's post leverage?  Then turning to variable annuity is you've restated the values in your business, just wondered if you could give us some color around the changes you made there whether it was specific to a particular type of product set.  And also whether we should anticipate any adjustments in the embedded value number coming from the in-force book as well at the year end?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the question on the ROE, yeah the ROE, you are right today, but if you go back to slide 20, looking at obviously we would expect as markets start to improve and they already have improved, higher fee income so that will help the operating earnings as well as the return.  Also a continued focus on expense management, and then on the investment margin, there we have de-risked our products and have a higher weighting than we normally would in treasuries and risk free.  So, over time as markets improve we go back to more of a normal allocation within our general account, so that should also help.  So, I would, the range I gave you is what we would expect with improved markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it before or after leverage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The ROE is after leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>After leverage. And just in terms of investment margin, is there a kind of normalized expectation you have around that, how far are we from normal at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have about in the U.S. portfolio in particular we have a weighting of treasuries and then short-term cash investments of about 13 billion out of a 80 billion portfolio, and so that normally you would carry more like a couple billion in those two categories.  So, I think over time it's probably more in the U.S. and then we also in our portfolio in Europe we would also expect some modest improvement in the investment margins going forward, but a big part of it would be in the U.S., since we did significant de-risking there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on VAs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the variable annuities that you've reached over into the new business value, that you've gone through there I just wondered if you can give some color around it and also whether we should expect an impact on the in-force book coming through embedded value at the end of the year?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, in the start of January 2008 the capital factors for risk based capital by the rating agencies changed.  And therefore particularly on the in the money position, so we therefore went back and restated since 2008 for those changed capital factors. That was the change in restatement, because we had gone back based on the new capital factors restated '08 and '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much indeed.  I want to focus on just two issues personally, firstly, clearly we're trying to get some handle on what the normal profits on the Insurance business as well as the Bank.  You talked &#x2013; now I've got sort of you know the appendix five on the press release which gives your -- sort of your underlying results excluding markets by quarter.  And you said Q3 was below Q2 because of less dividend.  Now I can see that being proved through the European result.  It is also true, quite significantly for the U.S. as well.  I am wondering whether the 250 settlement of Q2 or the 201 of Q3 is more representative of what's going on?</p>
          <p>Or are there any other funny aspects there? I'm particularly looking at, you talked about de-risking, you talked about low interest rates, you talked about and clearly and I just wanted to find out what that is, that's question one.  Question two, I am looking at the variable annuities, I see Q3 has now got the re-emergence of outflows which is much lower sales.  I was surprised to see on I think an annuity Web site, that your products are still quite competitive.  Have you put them there to try and stem that outflow or is that an error or other areas in there where you're trying to compete in the VA space, can you help me on that?  And finally, on ING Direct I am trying to get a handle as to why how the profits from almost everywhere outside the U.S. have improved so dramatically over the course of the last few quarters and once impairments are stripped out, what issues are going on there?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Chris hopefully I captured all of your questions.  In terms of the profit...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Looking at page, if you look at page 61 in the appendix of the presentation it breaks down the margins, so I think it gives you good picture.  You are right that the dividend income is in the Insurance Europe and that was lower in the third quarter. We would expect improvement overall in the margins in Europe in the fourth quarter.  And in Q3 for the U.S. keep in mind what I said before we did have a higher treasury in short term cash investments than we normally carry, and so again over time we would expect to de-risk there.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the variable annuity outflow we continue to &#x2013; we have de-risked the product, we've reduced the roll up to 6% and we've gone from a quarterly to an annual ratchet.  We are continuing to sell a very modest amount of that product; we don't want to go completely dark before we get the new products approved.  So we continue to sell at a much reduced level and that we would expect to start selling the new product, the new VA product in the beginning of the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.  We were looking at a Website, I think it's called Annuity Direct or something like that in which lists the most attractive offerings and ING seems to feature well up there with the other aggressive competitors, you don't recognize that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't recognize that Chris and I would say that if you look at our relative sales in the third quarter they were well below where we've been and well below competitors I think we're now.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at where the VRs -- I don't know if all the VR numbers are out for the third quarter but in the second quarter we were down to number 10.  So I would say on a relative basis just looking at sales, I would say that we are not nearly as competitive as some of the other players who have decided to continue to sell the traditional Vas, they've de-risked them somewhat but haven't gone as far as we have.</p>

          <p>The improvement you referred to in ING Direct arises from similar themes that we've seen in the rest of bank. Obviously ING Direct is as all the bank, all the group is pushing forward with cost reductions.  And they are flowing through and that those costs, the costs are down quarter-over-quarter and also versus prior year.  And that's notwithstanding the fact we have to pay higher FDIC deposit guarantee costs.  And margins are also improving so interest rates were, rates were reduced in a number of entities in the U.S., France and Canada for example.  So we're seeing some improvement in margin and cost reductions also coming through.  And the business is more...</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope you can hear me  I just got one sort of slightly general question and a couple of numbers questions if I can.  And the first one is that you, you've given us a lot of building blocks which would add up to the target 50% cost income ratio in the bank.  And I was just wondering how that plays against the whole momentum EU policy which is to try and increase competition certainly in retail and how realistic is it? I mean are you basically taking the view that that momentum of policy will, will perhaps fail in the markets that you're in.  The second two questions were on slide 40, when you talked about it, I think you mentioned that Alt-A market values had gone up.</p>
          <p>I just wondered if you could tell us what they are as a percentage of par at the moment and how that compares to the end of Q3 and Q2.  And finally, on slide 35, you mentioned technical adjustments to the value of the new business in Europe which does seem sort of gone down reasonably substantially in Q3 and I just wondered if that was &#x2013; if you could tell us something more about that or is it similar to the VA changes that you've already talked about?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I would say on the policies going forward and in particular in the retail markets we see increased competition.  The Dutch market is one of the most competitive markets I think you will see in Europe.  We are no price leader here.  We are no price leader anywhere, so we are limited by the market itself and we are really working within the in the market without being a price leader itself.  So I don't think we will have that much negative impact from what you are mentioning from the EU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And this 50% cost/income ratio really consistent with a competitive market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are &#x2013; cost/income means that we are reducing our cost.  We are working on being the most efficient, we in fact we are already, when you look at some slides, one of the lowest cost producer in the Netherlands and in many ways the lowest cost producer in Europe.  So working on lower cost can only be helpful if margins are set by somebody else then we can then increase our margins.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on Alt-A, what we have on page 40, and what we see is the total market value of Alt-A was you know in the second quarter was at 57.4 and right now it is or third quarter it is at 58.9 and I think as per the end of October it moved up a little bit again.  So, you know small improvements on that side from a market value perspective.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  In Europe we increased discount rate, so that raised the cost of capital and therefore lowered the VNB.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, this is Johnny from Goldman Sachs.  Just a couple of quick questions.  Obviously risk-weighted assets have obviously been inflated recently as a result of credit migration, obviously issues in the economy.  But as the economy improves how does this factor into your RWA growth estimates or lack of going forward?  And then the second question just relates to the structure going forward. If you do move to a bank holding company, do you actually have to pay down the double leverage or can that holding company leverage actually sit on the balance sheet of the bank?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Johnny if you look at the RWAs indeed what you see is that on an existing portfolio especially with regards to ABSs, we have seen positive credit migration and that is somewhere for banks in between the 5 and the 10% on an existing portfolio.  Somewhere in the future if you would have a reverse trend, you expect that back although we don't have that in our projection.  So we assume that if there is any headwind in our RWA so in other words if we get a &#x2013; sure, if there is any tailwind in RWAs because it's going to be lower than we think that will be offset by regulatory increases or other things going forward.  So we see that a bit as a wash because our best case scenario is that regulators will sort of reduce pro-cyclicality and get increased capital requirements by the time that you have a positive offset on this side.  So we are not calculating our self rates on this element.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on double leverage Johnny I think you're right.  And the bank debt, that just blends into the overall portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you wouldn't actually have to pay down the double leverage with the proceeds from some of the Insurance sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the double leverage is not earmarked into specific bonds, as they mature they could be refinanced in the normal course of events.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your answer was correct Johnny, your assumption but we still need to get the approval by the Dutch National Bank that we can do so, but that, I think in principle the question that you said the answer was yes, yeah that's the correct question,</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Perfect.   Two follow-up questions.  Number one, if we look at the ROE currently, of the insurance company post leverage, would you recognize the number, just taking Q3 of around about 11% post leverage? So the 8% going up to 11, does that sound right?  That's question number one.  Question number two is, the embedded value split you give on slide 19, and clearly that's going to be very different, I'm guessing at the end of the year, because you are going to move to an MCV like basis, I think and although you've had disposals, you are going to have disposals, could you sort of, I know you probably can't answer about the level of the EEB  because you are still calculating that, but do you think the split of the embedded value as shown is actually reflective, so I mean could Asia be bigger in the new regime?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll deal with the ROE one first. I think the point on the leverage and insurance is that the 22, the assets that generates the income and that is the ROE then is calculated over the shareholders equity, the 15, the lower number.  So, I think you're right, the ROE mentioned earlier of eight is too low.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And that's what you are obviously trying to get up to, 13% at least?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think one of your colleagues had mentioned earlier 1.8, you put 1.8 over 15 you are getting into the lower teens, you are right, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and in terms of the embedded value breakdown, I mean obviously you can't tell us what the level of EEV is going be under your new calculations but just a split, I mean you've had, you've sold Taiwan, you've made a disposal, that was all you changed <mark type="inaudible" />. Can you give some broad idea whether the, you still have that kind of split on page 19?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our comment would be we got to adjust for same store but in general the embedded value of the three emerging markets will go up as a percentage over time, due to their higher growth.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Benoit P&#xE9;trarque from Kepler in Amsterdam.  The first question is on the market risk-weighted assets. The Basel Committee said in September that market risk-weighted assets or market risk requirements will be multiplied by two in the next two, three years, how is it going to impact your total risk-weighted assets please, first question.  Second question is on the CMBS portfolio which is mainly located in the U.S. Insurance and ING Direct, U.S.  Are you comfortable with the 80% market value you are reporting end of Q3?  The reason why I am asking that is I am not sure that you could actually sell those businesses including the CMBS for 80% of par.  And last question is on the ROE figure for the bank what will be then the ROE figure if you assume flat income over years, so you just forget about higher margins and shift in &#x2013; and steeper yield curve.  Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Maybe I'll take the first question on the market risk-weighted assets.  Yes, indeed there will be a tightened regulation on that part.  If you look at it overall, on market risk, if you look at Q3, we have in total, if you look at the amount of capital needed for that, it is 644 which is approximately eight billion of RWA.  So, for us given the fact that it's a relative small part of the portfolio, I would say this is a manageable number which is, which we can sort of catch up with in our normal course of business.  So, although yes, it's a higher number, it is not something very disturbing for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the CMBS portfolio, on the CMBS is the following is the case. Overall what you see is on the underlying part in the portfolio you still see debt service capacity ratios in and around one and a half times which is a slight deterioration as compared to the past.  So, indeed what you see is the underlying economics a bit less, so a bit deteriorating.  The issue with the CMBS is actually more on the fact that the refinancing gives difficulties and there what you have seen is in the U.S. there have been support programs for the CMBS portfolio, because the large refinancing need is recognized in the industry as one of the bigger problems and you could say the U.S. support programs for CMBS have made that the fair values increased from 74% to 79.</p>
          <p>So, overall underlying you could still say there is a deterioration of the debt service capacity ratio. Nevertheless, what you see is the support programs help a bit to address the refinancing issues for the moment.  If you look at credit ratings, yes, 70% of the portfolio is still AAA, credit enhancement is still robust.  What can you expect over the future? Well, overall if you take a portfolio as an average I mean it looks very good, of course you look a bit at some of the more junior tranches, '06, '07 that is where we pay a bit more attention to because there you could have some risk in a portfolio. But overall I mean I am happy with the portfolio as it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the 80% reflects kind of accounting fair value, do you think a potential buyer of the Insurance business will be likely to pay 80% of par, or do you think it will be a bit lower than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is at the moment what the market price is, the question is and that is a little bit what you see overall with your debt portfolio.  We have seen credit spreads shrinking a lot, that is why our negative re-val reserve basically moved from minus 7.9 to minus 2.8, that is also a little bit why for some of these parts you could say like, we are not in a hurry to divest because a lot of the portfolios are pretty healthy and you'll have a pool to par effect and that is why we are not pressing a sell button as of today, because there is some value in this portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and on the array figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of your comments on the bank, on slide 10 we do give a breakdown of where the revenue side will come from in terms of growth and margin improvements.  So, if you wish to take &#x2013; discount the growth which we believe is there and likely to happen particularly over the next four years coming from a very low base, you can compute it, but the point I would also make then is that there are other components clearly where there's cost reductions as well we're going to do irrespective and we also believe we're in a strong position in terms of leveraging our good market position to improve margins.  Slide 10 gives you the ability to disaggregate the computation as you wish.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to sum up on the ROE figure which I've done is take the 16.5 billion total income and apply across to income ratio of 50%, assume risk cost of maybe 40 bps on average and took a normal tax rate and come to this ROE figure of 14 to 15% right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's about right with a little bit of growth in RWAs from where we currently are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question comes from Steven Cart.  Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.  Two questions please, the first one is on your impairment policy on the Alt-A portfolio, you still have annualized devaluation losses; could we expect this to enter the P&amp;L account in the fourth quarter, or do you expect increase in the fair values or why didn't you clean it up altogether in the third quarter now?  And the same is for real estate, if we would assume that there is no market where you change in the fourth quarter will we see more impairment on real estate?  The second question, the 1.3 billion charge in connection to the Alt-A portfolios the value adjustment, how will that be booked and will it go through the P&amp;L account?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay the terms of impairment in Alt-A.  We go through a process with our auditors to evaluate impairment as we can identify it based on projections of bond breakages.  So it's quite a rigorous process and you have to operate the impairment based on the evidence of impairment you see at a given point.  You don't have the opportunity anymore in accounting to &#x2013; clear it out as it were.  The key point on Alt-A impairments is that the residual mark-to-market and remember current accounting requires you to fair value ABS securities when you identify impairments.</p>
          <p>So the residual mark-to-market on Alt-A is just under 400 million.  So if we impaired the entire share of the residual in Q4 it would be 400 charge, which is lower than the 580 we took in the third quarter.  We haven't completed the numbers of the fourth quarter.  So I can't tell you what it will be.  But I'll just give you some dimension of what the residual potential is.  I think you asked in terms of bond pricing, there has been some movements, desegregation in the portfolio with hybrid and fixed ARMs improving and all the option ARMs reducing and so we're beginning to see the market split the two out and the bulk of the impairment charge we took in the third quarter was in respect of the weaker category ARMs.  Real estate as well, yes again we go through in a process to document and evidence the fair value of our real estate.  We would have a full fair value external valuation particularly of our -- the volatile piece, the somewhat Canadian portfolio in the fourth quarter that's done by external valuers and when we get that valuation we will basically appraise it and book accordingly.  So, we have to follow the process and we don't have a latitude to sort of wash it all out. We think, we're fairly valued as we speak.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the charge the 1.3 billion charge for Alt-A?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a present value of the future expected costs as negotiated and that would be booked in the fourth quarter as an upfront charge at the pre-tax level with post tax 1 billion. You will see that in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, to make clear it's a one-time charge, we pay it over time as we go and so the cash impact is lower, but the accounting impact is immediate in Q4.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, hi.  Just a quick question on real estate if I may, just looking at slide 74, and wondering what the 14.4 billion would be if it was gross as leverage?  Have you got any idea what that would be? Presumably the summit things to which you refer is actually the Canadian business of 870, and I'm presuming that again is leverage within there and that's why you've written the value of the investment down by &#x20AC;115 million even though the Canadian commercial property market presumably hasn't moved by that much.  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 14.4 is gross of leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And then the 8.6, is net leverage is that the difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe to add to that, I mean the 14.4 is the total portfolio which contains both investments and that is the 8.6 which go directly via P&amp;L and then there is another part which is development or which is real estate in own use which does not go via P&amp;L.  So, the distinction 14.4 and 8.6 is more a classification of how do we account for it.  What you do see here is exposures and exposures indeed means that if there is leverage in there or for instance 30% then it means that the actual cash investment is lower because we have grossed it up.  So, you're right in terms of the gross up but the reflection of 14.4, 8.6 is more an accounting classification.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have got four questions, first of all looking at page 11 with respect to your assumptions on cost savings and increase in cost organically, you're saying 2% going forward over the next few years.  What are your assumptions behind that with respect to inflation and also increase in FTEs?  Is there any increase in FTEs included in there?  And then looking to page 18, there you give some breakdown on equity in the Insurance business, of course you didn't want to give a full breakdown but you could you just give some indication on equity for the Japanese operations?</p>
          <p>Is that about one third of the equity for Asia?  Could you give us some flavor on that?  And then looking at page 20, you're saying big impact, de-risking the big impact on your margins, investment margin in Insurance business and 13 billion in short-term paper is there any short-term change with respect to the policy to be expected, so that already you could see a quite sharp improvement in Q4, what's your policy going forward with respect to the de-risking?  And the last question is on the interest margin, you've given already some outlook for the longer-term what you're looking at but for the near-term, especially deposit rates still are trending down.  Do you still expect positive impact from that in Q4 in the first half of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's a lot of questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Looks like I have to deal with them one-by-one.  The first question you asked was the assumptions we have made on our costs and the FTEs.  We have not calculated any increase in FTEs for the assumptions.  And we have calculated there's an increase in our labor cost or loan cost by about 3% in the Netherlands in 2010 and then going forward with each year, 1% thereafter.  And then for the other regions more or less in the same &#x2013; in the same category.  So those are the assumptions we have made and we plan to offset, let's say, any type of increases organically and there's the savings we can get in other areas.  The next question Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect to the, I think you asked about capital in Japan of the three point it's about 600, approximately 600 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in terms of the general count I think the best page at least to focus on the U.S. part is on page four of the U.S. statistical supplement. So if you can see there we show the four quarters in '08 and the three quarters in '09.  And, so that first two quarters of '08 were before the crisis, so, sort of the treasury position was less than, these are all on dollars a billion, and the short-term was in the 1, 1.2 billion range.  If you look at where we are today the treasury position is 8 billion and the short-term investments is about 5.5 billion so you can see a significant increase and over time as markets improve you would expect us to over time to reduce that treasury and in the short-term cash positions to be more in line with what we've done historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's more a gradual process than real big steps to be expected...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know it's a little bit hard to say that it would &#x2013; we would re-risk as we see market conditions in the future change.  So it's really somewhat dependent on how quickly the markets improve as to how we would change the weightings in the general account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think on the margins it's a bit difficult one to give a forecast for precisely what will they do in Q4.  I mean in Q4 there is always some offsetting factors I mean there is a bit lower economic activity nevertheless we have still positive re-pricing of our loan book.  I don't expect any changes in the yield curve so net-net you know you might get a small increase but again it's too difficult to sort of forecast that exactly for one quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you don't see still any major impacts from on the deposit side because of due to term deposits rating off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I always like to be a bit conservative on the end you see now in the Netherlands is you see that the environment is improving a lot because we could lower our rates and I think the competition followed on that part so that is a beneficial one but there is a certain point when that stops.  I mean we still like to keep the clients.  So it's in that sense.  I don't expect a major boost out of that because of that we can lower rates a little further.  We have more broader now in line with our other European countries.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for being on the call.  We hope we have given you an explanation why we feel that this is the right thing to do splitting the company going with a strong bank and a strong insurance company.  We will take our time to really implement it well and we will strongly manage our performance for both the bank and the insurance company before we make any steps to go forward in executing the split.  So, again thanks very much for being on the phone and probably we'll see you in the next few weeks when we visit a few countries as well.  Bye-bye.</p>
