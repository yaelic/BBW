          <p>Welcome to the CN Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Robert Noorigian, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Noorigian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, and thank you for joining us for CN Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results. I'd like to remind you again about the comments that have already been made about the forward-looking statements. With us this morning is Claude Mongeau, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Luc Jobin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Keith E. Creel, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mr. J.J. Ruest, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer.</p>
          <p>In order to be fair, as we've done with the other quarters, could you please limit your questions to one each. And with that, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Claude Mongeau, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Claude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob, and thank you to all you for joining us bright and early on this call. It's sunny in Montreal, and the leadership team here at CN is pleased to be with you to discuss our results. I think our second quarter results show a lot of strength. We are very proud that our team of railroaders have been able to deliver strong operating service and financial results throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>If you look at the key highlights, our revenues are up 10% on a year-over-year basis. If we look at them on a constant currency basis, we were able to accommodate that growth at very low incremental cost, and the proof of that is our operating ratio at 61.3%, which is the same as what we did last year.</p>
          <p>You bring these two elements together and that allowed us to show forward an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50, which is up 19% over last year. And free cash flow was, for the first six months, was just over $700 million. So clearly, again, you look at it from a service standpoint, look at it from an operating standpoint, and Keith will discuss some of those trends in a minute, and you look at it from a financial standpoint, our agenda is working. We do have momentum, and we are pleased with these second quarter results at this point in time.</p>
          <p>So, Keith, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Claude. Listen, as we closed out the first half of 2012, I'm not going to hesitate saying I'm extremely proud of our operating team's performance in the second quarter. Our team produced solid results in what proved to be a record quarter in CN's history.</p>
          <p>We moved more traffic than we ever have before, handling on average over a billion GTMs per day. Intermodal, Automotive, Coal, Petroleum and Chemicals and our Metals and Minerals business units all registered double-digit gains in revenue ton-miles driven by economic growth, market share gains, and a labor disruption at a key competitor. And I'd be remiss not to point out that we handled this record volume while continuing to gain traction in our service and operational excellence agenda.</p>
          <p>So let's spend a few moments reviewing the highlights of the key productivity metrics so we speak to each quarter. As you can see, the team produced year-over-year improvements in virtually every productivity category from moving bigger trains, handling increased volumes through our terminals 7% faster; we're using less yard resources per car handled. These improvements in yard productivity, again, I'll remind you, are being done at the same time we were absolutely focused on improving the reliability of our first mile/last mile performance.</p>
          <p>Locomotive productivity improved, and car velocity, I'll note, is at record levels. And again, this is being accomplished against a backdrop of our improved customer service in terms of car supply performance, which is helping drive a lot of our revenue growth.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we achieved 96% carload fill and conformance and provided empty cars by the requested date and time to our customers with an 86% reliability level. The only metric we didn't see improvement on is our industry train speed, which as we all know, is a standard AER metric that measures train speed performance, and I'm emphasis added, terminal to terminal. As you can see, while absorbing over an 8% GTM growth, second quarter this year versus last we were down slightly. This is driven more specifically by line segments where we've experienced concentrated significant growth in 2011 and again in 2012, which has created a strain on our long train line capacity, which impacts this metric.</p>
          <p>One meaningful example of this is our B.C. north territory running to Port of Prince Rupert where in large part Coal, Grain and Intermodal growth has driven 13% volume growth in 2011 and an additional 17% in 2012, so effectively 30% volume growth in a two year time span. To manage this growth, we're in year two of a four year capacity improvement plan. We've got seven additional long sidings that will come online late third quarter, early fourth quarter this year that will increase our long trade capacity, which obviously will help us drive our industry train speed back up and add capacity for continued growth in this key corridor.</p>
          <p>So with that said, we have and will continue to report industry train speed externally to allow an apples-to-apples comparison to other roads. But in line with our supply chain and the end mindset at CN we've also established a network train speed measured two years ago that is an all-inclusive train speed measure which is meaningful to speak to. So whereas industry train speed excludes time spent in terminals or at crude change points, network train speed does not. It captures both road and yard time for our trains. What is meaningful about this at CN is that during the same time we were slightly down on our industry train speed, we've made gains on network train speed in spite of this GTM growth that we've experienced across our network. Our network train speed actually improved just under 3% quarter-to-quarter despite this growth.</p>
          <p>So the network train speed improvement, what's it's done for us is, helped us fuel some of the additional customer flexibility J.J. and our marketing team our converting into carload growth at the same time it's contributing to improvements in our core metrics that you see in car velocity and locomotive productivity.</p>
          <p>Another example of investing in our network for the future are the upgrades that we continue to pursue in the Chicago terminal, leveraging the benefits of our EJ&amp;E transaction. Work will be completed this year on several more key connections, which will enhance our already very reliable and efficient rail corridor around the city of Chicago that connects the Northeast, South and Western portions of our network to one another. In line with these improvements we are working closely with our rail partners in Chicago, developing new interchange agreements that make use of this new infrastructure, which improves the efficiencies of the track flow between CN and our connecting carriers in this key corridor.</p>
          <p>Beyond the connection side of this transaction, in August 2011 we announced our plans to invest $165 million over four years to expand Kirk Yard. I'm happy to say that this work is well underway. This fall we'll complete reconstruction of our hub facility, which will add more capacity to hub additional cars; currently the capacity is about 1000 to 1200 cars. We are creating a yard that will have a capacity to hub consistently 2500 cars a day. Effectively, we're going to expand receiving and departure tracks in line with this expansion this year as well and open our new administration building there in the facility. This sets the stage for Kirk to be a significant player for us as a key switching facility in this key Chicago corridor, allowing us to consolidate our switching activities to this efficient, modern facility.</p>
          <p>These types of strategic investments continue to position us well for the growth that J.J. and his team continue to deliver on, so with that I'll turn it over to J.J. to expand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Keith, and thank you for moving 1 billion GTM on average per day during the second quarter. And good morning to everyone who is on the phone and with us today. For the next few minutes I will review the revenue, give you an outlook, and I will also touch on some initiatives that we have to give you more color on how we intend to keep growing the top line.</p>
          <p>As Claude mentioned, the second quarter was really solid. Not only is our strategic agenda working, but we also had a phenomenal strike performance during the CP strike. With only 72 hours, Keith and the commercial team jumped into the fray, serving pre-selected trusted partners and producing an incremental $40 million.</p>
          <p>In summary, the second quarter revenue were up 13% versus last year and 22% versus 2010. About 5.5% came from volume, the RTM increased 8%, the length of haul was up 7%, and the carload was up 4%. Same-store price on same-store sales increased almost 4%, in line with our guidance of inflation-plus pricing; 2% came from fuel surcharge, mix was slightly negative, and finally the 3% came from exchange. The Canadian dollar was $0.043 weaker this year. All in all, a solid quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's review the revenue by segment, and as always I will do that on the FX adjusted basis. Starting with Petroleum and Chemical revenues, which were up a big 16%. The length of haul in P&amp;C was up 9%, therefore producing solid RTM growth of 14%. We had some brand new long haul crude movement as our team initiated sales from two new crude loading stations, one of them in Sexsmith, Alberta, the other one in Unity, Saskatchewan, both shipping conventional heavy crude. By using rail, small and mid-sized crude producers get a better netback for their barrel. That's why they use rail for better netback.</p>
          <p>Iron ore revenue increased 8%, but the iron ore carload decreased at the end of the quarter. Metals increased 4% but was up 28% versus 2010. We experienced sustained demand from the Automotive sector, Energy and Industrial construction in Alberta. Minerals was up 34% from last year and 51% from 2010, a phenomenal progression, mainly in price and in construction aggregate. Forest Product revenue was up 6%. The U.S. housing start drove a 13% increase in our lumber and panel carload to the United States. Automotive revenue gained 15%. Our carloads were flat but the length of haul was up 15%, producing nice RTM volume of 16% higher.</p>
          <p>The story for Coal remained exciting, supported by our infrastructure export supply chain strategy. Coal revenue was up 13% in the quarter, driven by a 14% increase in revenue ton mile. The 30% drop in our carload of domestic terminal coal was made irrelevant by the success of our export strategy. In any event, the domestic coal is now only about 1.5% of the total CN book of business. Pet Coal from the oil sand also increased 25% in carload using our recent Fort McMurray infrastructure investments. Canadian grain revenue was down 3%. U.S. grain revenue was down 6%. We had weak export for corn and bean, but we had good export for Canadian barley and Canadian canola.</p>
          <p>Fertilizer was almost flat. The North American market is still soft, but we moved the Canpotex exports during the nine-day CP strike. Overseas and Intermodal remain very strong and sustained. Our revenue came in 15% up from last year; and 35% up from 2010. The CN trans-Pacific volume outpaced the North American West Coast run rate average again, and Rupert is just a phenomenal product in the marketplace with very strong support from service-sensitive venue owner. On the East Coast our trans-Atlantic business was flat.</p>
          <p>Domestic revenue was also just as robust as the overseas revenue. We had a 14% increase over last year and 30% increase over 2010. The domestic story is quite simple. It's driven by new product, new geographic coverage, and new services. On the operating side of Intermodal our train length was up 2% and even more relevant, our revenue <mark type="ph" /> FAU (12:15) per train was up 4.5%. But all-in-all, what is truly driving our growth is our people. We have one of the best teams in the industry.</p>
          <p>Now if we could move onto the outlook, and I will start with the page on Intermodal. For CN, the second half outlook is positive. The overall fall peak will be higher than last year, but will only be somewhat higher. On the West Coast the CN trans-Pacific supply chain should outperform the market again. On the East Coast, we have weaker European fundamental and the growth will be less.</p>
          <p>On the bulk, I'm now looking at the page on bulk on the outlook, I would like to start with giving you an update on our coal export initiative. When we saw the Convent terminal in 2011, our strategy was to have it expanded into a major coal export play. We were targeting 8 million ton of export within a few years. We are well ahead. In 2012, we're on pace to do about 7 million tons, which would be about $50 million of incremental revenue over 2011. On potash, we now have a solid long-term partnership with Canpotex, which is in place as of July 1. Asian demand for Canadian met coal and for Canadian oil sand pet coke remain in place. In the U.S. electricity production from natural gas is now in the range of 32%of the total production, which is same &#x2013; almost same as with coal. In my opinion, the hot summer will not reverse the fundamental trend. Cheap natural gas is the new normal. Therefore, the thriving coal producer of the future will be those with very low production costs per BTU and those with a solid export solution already in place.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Midwest heat is burning the corn crop, and versus last year, our corn will be worse; however, the bean might be better. I took down my second half internal forecast to be more in line with last year's revenue on U.S. grain. The Canadian crop looks good, and we do have a higher carry-over from last year, which is what we're moving in July and August. Our fleet is pre-inspected, pre-deployed and ready for record. With the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly coming to an end, the October to December fall peak, we believe, might be more pronounced.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the outlook for the Manufacturing sector; first in an update on our frac sand initiatives. As an example, we are close to investing $35 million in Wisconsin to re-open a 40 mile subdivision and service a new frac sand plant to be opened by year-end. More detail coming later is in the weeks to come. Regarding our Crude-by-Rail initiative, you will remember that you have seen our press release in conjunction with Southern Pacific putting a new supply chain in place for markets underserved by the pipeline industry. The bottom line is better netback per barrel is why producers use rail, and this year we are tracking to get $140 million above last year in Crude-by-Rail by year end.</p>
          <p>Paper is in its usual secular decline; iron ore and sulfur will decline but eventually will cycle back up. The automotive revenue will be strong but strong from an RTM point of view, while the carload will be near flat. Lumber and panel will be strong driven by U.S. shipment, and we also still have five to seven panel mills idle in CN; this is about 15,000 carloads &#x2013; old cars, if you wish &#x2013; waiting for the future development in the U.S. housing start.</p>
          <p>I also want to make a general statement on our volume outlook. Iron ore and domestic coal carload will drop, but long haul export coal, long haul Crude-by-rail, and long haul Intermodal will overcompensate in RTM volume growth. To understand CN's true volume growth in the second half, you will need to pay more attention to our weekly revenue ton miles.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, another solid quarter; phenomenal strike performance, positive volume outlook ahead, and more proof points that our strategic agenda is working. Now I'd like to take it over to Luc.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks very much, J.J., and good morning to everyone. Now turning to Page 14 of the presentation, let me walk you through the key financial highlights of our quarterly performance. Revenues were up 13% to $2.5 billion, and that's 10% on a constant currency basis. A moderate growth in the economy and volume gains during one of our competitors' strike constituted a favorable set of conditions in the quarter compared to last year. J.J. and Keith and their teams combined efforts to help us achieve solid volume increases in practically all commodity sectors, and once again, several categories performed better than base market conditions.</p>
          <p>Operating income was $985 million, that's up 13% versus last year, driven by strong revenue growth handled at low incremental cost. In fact, our operating ratio for the quarter was 61.3% and that's in line with what we have seen last year.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter we had an unfavorable one-time tax adjustment of $28 million or $0.06 of EPS. This was needed to adjust our deferred income taxes as a result of the enactment of higher future provincial corporate income tax rates, but this was also partly offset by a small tax recovery resulting from the recapitalization of a foreign investment.</p>
          <p>So our net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $631 million, up 17%. And the reported diluted EPS was $1.44, up 22%. Excluding the one-time tax adjustment, the adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter stood at $1.50; that's a 19% increase over 2011, and that's up 17% on a constant currency basis. The impact of the foreign currency was actually $13 million favorable on net income, or $0.03 of EPS in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Even when excluding the favorable foreign exchange, the Fuel Act benefit which was actually about $0.04 per share in the quarter and the CP strike, our adjusted diluted EPS would be up about 10% versus 2011, which actually is remarkable given the pension headwind that we have been facing this year and given a very modest economic backdrop.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the operating expenses on the next page. As Keith pointed out, we came through with another solid quarter in terms of operational productivity and customer service, yet this performance did not come at the expense of overall cost management. Our operating expenses were $1.558 billion, up 12% versus last year or 10% on a constant currency basis. At this point I'll refer to the variances in constant currency.</p>
          <p>Labor and fringe benefit costs were $504 million, that's up 15% higher than last year. The overall wage cost was actually up 6%, and this was the result of wage cost inflation of about 3% and a 2.5% higher head count in the quarter versus last year. Our average head count was just over 23,745 employees, so up 2.5% while at the same time we were growing our GTMs by up to 8%.</p>
          <p>So the head count dynamics continue to be driven by advanced hiring ahead of attrition to allow for training, along with our assessment of future volume growth. Meanwhile, fringe benefit costs, including pension, accounted for 8 percentage points of the increase, mostly due to the amortization of the accumulated actual pension losses as expected. This also included a higher stock-based compensation expense, which was 1 percentage point unfavorable during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our purchased services and material were $305 million, up 12%. This was mostly a factor of higher volumes leading to more repairs and maintenance, and higher contracted services relating to non-freight volume increases. The fuel expense stood at $379 million, an increase of 3%. Higher volume represented 8 percentage points of the increase in the quarter, but this was partly offset by lower price and improved fuel efficiency. Actually, the fuel efficiency was favorable 1.5%, which is very good given the much higher Intermodal volume that we carried during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Casualty and other costs were $81 million, up $19 million versus last year as we incurred higher expenses relating to environmental issues, and we also recorded a higher personal injury claims cost resulting from an actuarial study that we did &#x2013; that we have done in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to free cash flow, in the first six months of the year, we generated over $700 million of free cash. This compares to $823 last year. The difference comes principally from higher net income and lower tax payments offset by higher working capital, which mostly resulted from the voluntary pension contribution of $450 million which we made in the first half of the year this year versus last year it was actually done in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong and our debt ratios are well within our internal guidelines. We also bought back 4.5 million shares in the quarter, and we now stand at about 75% of our stock back program for the year, which is supposed to end at the end of October for 17 million shares.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me speak to our 2012 outlook. We continue to see modest improvements in the North American economy. While we do not assume at this point a significant change to prevailing conditions, there is a risk that things could slow down somewhat in the second half of the year in North America. Obviously we're also keeping an interested watch on China as it attempts to re-energize the pace of its economic growth. All in all, we're still looking at mid single-digit carload growth in 2012 and pricing above inflation, but we do have more difficult comparatives in the second half of this year as we grew revenues by 9% and 12% in the last two quarters of 2011.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, we're now revising upward our guidance. On the basis of our strong performance in the first half of the year, and assuming continued positive economic conditions in the second half of 2012. Our annual 2012 guidance, therefore, now has us aiming to deliver double-digit diluted EPS growth of up to 15% over the 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.84, and this, despite the pension headwind of $100 million that we are facing in 2012. This implies high single digit EPS growth in the second half of the year. But keep in mind that we will be lapping strong EPS growth in 2011 of 16% in the third quarter and 20% in the fourth quarter. We're also calling for free cash flow to be in the order of $1 billion. This takes into consideration our capital investment program of approximately $1.8 billion. It also considers the potential additional voluntary expansion contribution in the order of $250 million, which could appear in the latter part of 2012, and this on top of the $450 million that we have done earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Given that we're on the topic, allow me to say a few more words on the pension area. As you know, interest rates continue to decline and market returns have been both subdued and volatile. In fact, on the basis of current conditions, we're forcing other pension headwinds for 2013 of the same magnitude that we experienced in 2012, so in the range of $100 million. This would bring our pension expense roughly in line with our cash contributions for current service costs, which is approximately $145 million. In any event, in closing, we're very pleased with our second quarter results for 2012. It is also lining up to be a good year, and we maintain our focus on delivering superior returns no matter what economic conditions we have.</p>
          <p>On that note, I'll turn it back over to you, Claude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc and the team. As you can see, this team is clearly ready to seize on the opportunity, and we've shown that in the second quarter. We did achieve record volume in terms of the throughput during the second quarter, the best performance this railroad has ever seen. In fact, if I look at the first six months of this year, each and every one of those months on an RTM basis have been above our previous peak in the history of CN. We've also had record operating and service metrics, and this is what drove the excellent financial results that we have just explained to you.</p>
          <p>The confidence we have, based on this first half result, is what's allowed us to have a revised outlook which is upwards from previous guidance. We are confident, if the economy holds, that we can get close to that 15% EPS growth on a year-over-year basis and deliver that $1 billion of free cash flow, even though we will have to most likely contribute another $250 million for our pension contribution. So all-in-all, clearly our strategic agenda is gaining momentum. We are delivering shareholder value. Our agenda to help our customers win in their end markets with industry-leading service and supply-chain performance is what drives this performance. And we see solid shareholder value for many years to come.</p>
          <p>With that, Anne, I will turn it over to you for questions.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning. I guess my question's just a little bit in terms of the risks. We've seen the economic environment, sort of, unravel a little bit here. Just wondering, your volumes have been pretty solid, obviously. Looking to the next six months, which areas of your book do you think carry the most risks? Thank you.</p>

          <p>J.J. can comment further, but I would tell you, if I look at our volume performance and I extend into the beginning of the third quarter when I made these comments, we are seeing constructive growth pretty much across the entire book of business. Now that doesn't mean our customers are not mindful of the prevailing winds and focus on what could happen with the uncertainty that's out there. But certainly we haven't seen our channel checked. We haven't seen evidence yet of any slowdown except for the noneconomic sectors that J.J. alluded to, the grain crop, the difficult season in the U.S. for instance for corn, et cetera. The rest of our book of business is actually quite constructive.</p>

          <p>That's right. Thank you, Turan. This is J.J. The &#x2013; on the Intermodal side we will grow both domestic and overseas. It may not be the most fantastic peak, but as we do usually at CN, we're going to be helping ourselves and ride whatever peak comes at us and do better than the average of the industry. On the grain, it's kind of good news, bad news. Canadian is the good news and U.S. is bad news. So we'll take the two together. And on the merchandise and bulk side, as I went through the review, I think you've seen some areas where we have legs and some other areas where there's some weakness. All-in-all, whether it's Intermodal, Bulk, or Merchandise, all of them should be growing in RTM and revenue, obviously.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Good morning. You know I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit about will there be any change in, sort of, your marketing strategy or your operating strategy now that you, kind of, have a very clear idea of what the competition is likely to do since you work so closely with him. Does it create opportunities to collaborate more with them or does it create opportunities to sell against their reputation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Bill, as I've said before, we have one franchise to manage, and we've got our hands full doing that, and it's going well for us. The team has good chemistry, we have good momentum. We have a game plan that's pretty clear. We have a network reach and span that takes us across North America, and we are focused on delivering value to our customer day in and day out. So we are obviously mindful of the changes at CP. We think it's constructive for the industry. I'm convinced Hunter will focus on service, and I know he's mindful of the value of the services we provide with all of our hard work, and we will just wish him and the rest of the CP team good luck and focus on our own agenda.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning and congratulations for the good quarter. Could you maybe give an update on the opportunities in Northern Quebec with the plan, more color about the milestone and also in terms of timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Benoit. That's a good question. We focus on our second quarter results and we deliver value day in and day out, but we also have to have a pipeline of longer term opportunities, and this is clearly one of those with the Northern Quebec/Labrador iron ore growth. We've been at it working very hard with the miners that are looking to develop mines in that territory for almost a year now. I think we have a compelling offer that we have put forward with our partner, Caisse de depot, and we do have a few mines that have signed up with us, but we do need several of them to join us if we are going to be able to make it an economic undertaking; that is, pay for the &#x2013;  share in the pay for the feasibility study and, ultimately, share in the financing and the development of what would be a very significant undertaking.</p>
          <p>I'm talking here, if it was the southern leg of that railroad, we are talking in excess of $3 billion in investments. If it went all the way north of Schefferville we're talking in the range of $6 billion. So obviously large investments, and we need the support of the majority of the mining customer in that territory.</p>
          <p>At this point in time, despite the compelling offer that we've put in place, it would seem that some think they still have alternatives that would be much cheaper than what we believe the cost of this infrastructure will be. Some may be a little bit &#x2013; and I hesitate to say it that way but that's what it is &#x2013; free riding on the side thinking that maybe CN will get moving even if they don't sign up, so that they could share in the small cost of the feasibility study. And so what we've done recently is effectively put a deadline out there. We will give it another week or two for people to sign up. If they do, we would move forward, file an application, do the feasibility study, and continue to update you. If they don't, we will wish them good luck and move on to other opportunities.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So my first question, I guess, is on sustainability. You've posted what is clearly a very strong volume year here. Part of it great railroading, great service, part of it some of the problems that CP is having. I think your guidance this year is in line with where everyone is expecting. The real question becomes the sustainability of some of those volumes, particularly on the Intermodal side, given CP's efforts to recoup their lost market share. My question is whether you can &#x2013; is there strategic assets that you have, and I want to point toward Prince Rupert in particular, that you can use to leverage or maintain market share gains because of that non-replicable service that you can offer going up to Prince Rupert. And is there, and I'm &#x2013;  is that the right way to look at it, and can you expand Prince Rupert further, and do you have plans to do so if that is indeed the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, Walter, that the Prince Rupert is certainly a key competitive advantage for CN. There's no question about that, and we are making good use of it. The terminal as of late has been running at an annualized run rate of more than 600,000 TEUs per year. And there is the sub-due peak that J.J. is thinking about for the fall, we might get awfully close to that capacity at least on an annualized basis in Q4. Rupert is investing. They are going to get another crane in the fourth quarter, and we continue to see growth opportunity in that territory.</p>
          <p>But I would say that our agenda, though, and our success in outpacing base market condition is much broader than just Rupert. We are growing our Vancouver gateway very nicely; in fact, if you look at it at the moment, our Vancouver franchise &#x2013; our Vancouver relationship or corridor is just as large as Prince Rupert even for the U.S. in terms of U.S. gateway traffic. We are growing beyond Intermodal and gaining &#x2013; outpacing base market conditions in merchandise, we're doing so in bulk. And it's not against CP, it's against &#x2013; it's our customers that are winning in the marketplace, and it's against all railroads, and it's against trucks. It's a broad-based strategy. It's anchored on a solid game plan, and I think it's highly sustainable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you, J.J., you've got a lot of positive things to talk about. I think you had a brief comment on capacity and &#x2013; that could &#x2013; if we can see some volumes on the housing side and some idle panel mills. Can you give us a further sense of, I guess, what you're seeing in terms of lumber or associated volume increase related to an initial move up in the U.S. housing market? And then, if there is some further momentum, how would you frame the opportunity, let's say, next year for what you could see on lumber and panels and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Tom, and good morning. We do have still idle capacity on our line, even for lumber. We obviously have a lot of capacity on our line for panel, which I would broadly estimate depending on how many would come back if there was a demand of 15,000 carloads annualized. Another aspect also is that there could be some shift of lumber from Asia back to the United States. We did see in the second quarter reduction in our carload to Vancouver going to China, and some of that lumber going to United States because of better netback to the producer. So when you add all these things, I mean, definitely our volume in the U.S. is better because of the demand, definitely it's better because it's better netback to China at this point.</p>
          <p>So you have length of haul, you have idle capacity, and that idle capacity is even more prevalent in panel, because panel had a bigger drop if you were scheduling during the housing recession. So the housing starts for us has been good the last two years. It has driven our volume in the U.S., especially lumber, on a consistent basis. We did some model for both panel and lumber as to what point we would be so-called sold out with the capacity that we have in our rail car fleet, as well as sold out in terms of when our customers' existing capacity would be sold out. And one does not need to get to 1.5 million housing starts to reach these &#x2013; to get this capacity out to the marketplace, but we'll see how the market evolves.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if &#x2013; so, if we think about CN, you guys have been leading the industry by far on margins for years without much Bulk business. It feels like Bulk is really kicking in with long haul export coal, now the potash starting to ramp up and crude oil, and the Wheat Board is going away, too. So once we get through these pension headwinds, should we think about a, kind of, a step function in terms of potential margin improvement going out the next few years? Or are we not thinking about the potential implications of more long haul bulk correctly? How do you think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Scott, let me make a few comments and then maybe J.J. will want to add to it, but essentially, again, we're showing some very good numbers in terms of operating ratio, and we have been, this year, able to absorb the pension headwind. I did mention that, unfortunately, we're seeing a similar headwind showing up for next year, so we have our work cut out to continue to try to keep the operating ratio within the low to mid-60%s, but again we'll come up &#x2013; we'll come up with the goods.</p>
          <p>There's no question that the franchise has been very good and very strong and the shift to longer haul has helped us considerably. So I think it bodes well for us to stay within that, sort of, window of low to mid-60%s and, hopefully, at some stage we can see interest rates coming up a little bit, and we can have a little bit more air to breathe in terms of the pension pressure. But I still believe that that's going to be around for the next couple of years and we have to deal with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we finally had the &#x2013; what we call Bulk may not necessarily be unit trade. A lot of the grain that we move is actually moving in merchandise. And we also track our revenue in terms of train service. And our train service on pure unit train, that was RTM up 10%, but the RTM also for the carload service, for example, moving product cars also up 10%. So when we say Bulk, often we mean that from a commercial point of view. From Keith's point of view it went &#x2013; to him unit train is &#x2013; there's a lot of Bulk, so-called Bulk that we don't move in unit trains. So we're not necessarily moving, not necessarily doing a big shift here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes sense. How about the Wheat Board going away? Are there positive margin implications there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Wheat Board will be an important player in the marketplace. We understand there might be as much as a 30% what they used to be, and they'll be one without asset. So it will change the marketplace, I'm sure. Time will tell more clearly. One of the things that we think will happen is that the &#x2013; when the market really heats up and people want to sell product, the peak will probably be more prevalent, because the Wheat Board was really a pool-type system where the farmer was selling to the Wheat Board and getting an average price over the 10 months. Now most of the companies on the Grain side don't do that, they do cash sales, they don't do pool sales. So people want to move into &#x2013; when the market wants to move, it might move to a higher peak, and when the market is slow, the market might be a little slower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although I would say that the capacity can peak, and it's not a railroad issue, it's a supply chain issue when you look at the ports and all the pieces coming together, there's a limit to what the supply chain can peak at. But I agree with J.J. that we should see more, if anything, potential for efficiency over time. But the fundamental structure of the Grain business is not changing because of the decision to move away from the CWB's monopoly.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're at record workloads, which is pretty amazing. And the mix has shifted, which I think raises the question of capacity to some extent. And I realize that that's a bit of a nebulous concept when you talk about a railroad, but if we set aside the B.C. North, is there anywhere else on the network where you foresee needing to put growth capital sometime in the next few years, based on what you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Cheryl (sic) [Cherilyn], there's some locations that certainly we've got a plan to put some strategic investment into. Another key corridor of growth, that growth that's moving over the B.C. North territory, concentrated in large part because of the coal that originates B.C. North and terminates, so to speak, export at Prince Rupert. But if you take the other business, the Intermodal business, you take the Potash business, a key corridor for us is the Winnipeg to Evanston corridor. So we're taking, and we've got a plan to invest there.</p>
          <p>Actually I was out last week in the territory and rode a train from Saskatoon to Edmonton where we're bringing on a lot of that Canpotex business, where we're making a plan to put some strategic investment. As well in the south, on the south end of the railway, we've got significant growth with frac sands, the crude oil pipeline that's going to be going down to Geismar.</p>
          <p>So we're looking at that in conjunction with the car and coal growth to put some strategic investment, Illinois South on the south end of the railway. So we'll see some sidings, we'll see a little bit of improvement in our Harrison Yard facility for servicing trains, and then down on the Baton Rouge side in that industrial complex where it's effectively a long switching leave, we'll add some additional capacity to handle this growth with crude oil, frac sand as well as the coal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cherilyn. Just to add up to that, that's one of the key assets of CN. You know we have targeted investments to make &#x2013; to keep our network in sync with the growth, but we have a lot of available capacity on a line basis. Our structural growth opportunity is significant across our entire network.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe just a quick follow-up to that. As you think about some of the opportunities to add incremental capacity, should we be thinking about CapEx any differently than we have? It sounds like they're going to be fairly targeted kind of investments, but I guess I just wanted to get a sense if you guys are kind of back at or at record volumes, how you think about CapEx. Does it change at all as we go forward over the next couple of years assuming continued growth in the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think &#x2013; I mean, our view on CapEx was quite well described by Claude. We always try to anticipate where the business and where the puck is going to be heading, and then to be prepared to handle the growth in a seamless and low-cost fashion. So clearly we're looking at the capacity issues, we're looking at where business is going to be growing for us, and I wouldn't, at this point, foresee any decline in terms of our capital expenditure program. First and foremost, we remain focused on the fluidity and the safety of our network.</p>
          <p>So that's the base and that takes, usually, care of about over $1 billion, and the balance is really to try to, again, to prepare the network to handle the business and the growth and to look for these opportunities where we can continue to take this franchise to the next level. So we've been &#x2013; we'll be around the 18% to 19% of revenue in terms of CapEx. I mean, that's kind of where I think things should be heading for us, and I wouldn't expect anything significantly different otherwise.</p>

          <p>Good morning. So a lot has been discussed but a question on the Intermodal side. We're seeing fairly big amount of investments going into the Intermodal network in the U.S. by your partner carriers there. I was wondering whether there were, sort of, meaningful collateral benefits for CN Rail in terms of marketing some of the services you have on the international side from Canada into the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fadi. It's J.J. Yeah, there might be. Definitely we like what we see, for example, in what &#x2013; some of the things that CSX did where they provide a good service connection from Chicago to go east, and some of their yards that they have and the market they reach makes it attractive to come from the West Coast. We also look what the KCS is doing and whether or not there is a better market to be connected between Mexico and Michigan and eastern Canada that CN can capitalize. So definitely some of these businesses might be network businesses beyond one railroad, and I mentioned two here, and for us to be able to access markets that otherwise, obviously, we can't access on our own self. So there is some potential and these are being worked on.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The other thing, maybe, you can help us understand the magnitude of the crude-by-rail pie looking out maybe two or three years out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be quite a significant pie for CN. Everything we do today, by the way, is all in merchandise service. We are very good at merchandise service, including that crude-by-rail is on merchandise train. It has been our fast growing revenue segment this year. We'll see how next year is. The crude producer light rail, especially for the thick, viscous bitumen from Alberta, because it does not require condensate, which is expensive. And it gets them to market where they have access to the Brent prices as opposed to the WTI prices. There's a huge gap between Brent and the WTI, so it's not so much a question of transportation costs, it's the transportation costs when you back out the condensate, and when you get to a market which is a Brent market as opposed to a WTI market.</p>
          <p>So when you look at it from the point of view of the junior and mid-size crude producers, even more so those who are in Alberta &#x2013; Alberta crude as opposed to Bakken crude &#x2013; they are very focused on improving their netbacks, so there is real potential there.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add to this, Fadi, that we went from a concept a few years ago to aggressive trials by a number of customers over the last year or two to a real business now. As J.J. said, we see our crude business exceeding 30,000 carloads this year; that's more than 50,000 barrels per day so it's already a small pipeline if you think about it this way. And of course, we see a lot of potential growth into next year, just the carryover of that run rate leaving 2012. What's happening is really a game of netback, and we believe we are &#x2013; we can bring bottom line value to these producers long term. It's not just about matching a gap or an issue with pipelines to come, it's about supply chain, it's about diversity, and it's about real dollars at the bottom lines of these producers.</p>

          <p>That's right. We can execute very quickly. We have the rail line, we have the capacity, we have all the permits; we can get product anywhere on our rail lines connecting all the railroads. The pipeline industry is challenged with execution, finally. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, good morning. Can you talk about, on the strike volumes, did most of that, kind of, migrate back to its original source? Did you keep any of that? And I guess, following up on that with the Canpotex contract that kicks off, any update on the Prince Rupert access link?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me comment and J.J. can add the color. The, you know, we were pleased to be able to help in the circumstances. The railroads are difficult, are important supply chain, and we are a backbone to the economy. So when one railroad is facing a labor disruption, the fact that the other railroad is able to step up and provide service in those circumstances, is a good thing. I'm very pleased with the way J.J. and Keith and their team came together to be able to do just that, because it takes a lot of planning and a lot of execution focus, and it does show the resiliency of our business model. We were able to deflect up for that two week period. Now much of that business, except perhaps a few customers, much of that business is now back over to their natural carrier, but it was a great opportunity for us to showcase our service, and we see it as a lead-in to a deeper relationship in the future.</p>
          <p>A good example is Canpotex. We were able show them during the strike, again, and I believe that their owners, whether it was Agrium, Mosaic, or PTF, are all happy we were there to step in and protect their results in Q2. I believe Canpotex had a record export program in Q2 and, and for sure, we were there to help them. We are carrying that through with our normal contract at the moment, and we are discussions with them about Rupert, and hope they will make a decision between now and year end. Everything is lined up. We are working on the road rail utility corridor. They are seeing it first hand, the value of a diverse supply chain with two carriers, and I think we will extend that to a two corridor strategy in dialogue with them. But it's their decision, and they will make it on their own time line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful, Claude. If I could just follow up on grain yields, they're up about 3.5% at CN and over in double digits at CP. Would there be anything, I guess, J.J., that we could read into that? Is there any &#x2013; is it a mix difference, or anything contractually that you can think of that causes a difference like that?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well our revenue per car load, all I would read into that is the mix, length of haul, and I did adjust my pricing according to revenue cap in the second quarter not to be in excess of the cap, so I took some pricing down to come in line with the regulation by August 1, and then August 1, we start a new year again. So all there is in there is mix, timing issues on how we manage the revenue cap, could be length of haul. In July our carloads actually caught up from last year because we do &#x2013; are still moving last year's crop. Same thing in August.</p>
          <p>So all in, we're very satisfied with our Canadian Grain and looking good for the coming season. The coming season should be good for most, because the Canadian Grain, so far anyway, crops look good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Was hoping you could provide a little more detail on the U.S. drought and some of the hot weather that you're seeing there. So specifically thinking about the impact on ethanol, the movement of ethanol grain, and I guess there is going to be some &#x2013; we're reading a bit about corn coming up from Brazil. Are you seeing any examples of that? And then the barge traffic on the Mississippi, with the lower water levels, is there positive impact there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if we start with the barge traffic, the barge traffic, I mean, affecting it is not &#x2013; it's always been by region because there has been &#x2013; remember, there was a lot of rain in Minnesota. In fact I think Keith was challenged with some flooding that we had there on our north network. So some areas had drought, some areas had a lot of rain, and all of that eventually finding its way to the Mississippi River. So even though the Mississippi River, at this point, might be somewhat challenged on the level of the water, it has not affected the &#x2013; I would say, the railway or the rail volume, not so far anyway.</p>
          <p>Corn looks &#x2013; it doesn't look too good. The SDA numbers &#x2013; USDA numbers will probably come down in terms of the acres per &#x2013; yield per acres when the revised numbers come out. So the official numbers are probably higher than what they really are, but I think the market understands that, is dismissing that, and that's why the price of corn is up. And as far as corn coming from Brazil, I don't know if that's going to be the case or not.</p>
          <p>Regarding ethanol, definitely I think the carloads from ethanol for most railroads in the second quarter were down. Here it's, maybe, known as a factor of the gasoline consumption, right, the overall gas consumption in the U.S. is not as strong as it used to be years back. So you have lower consumption of gasoline ethanol as a result. And the subsidized amount of ethanol that has to be in the pool, is in the pool. Over and above that you've got to buy corn, quite expensive, and make ethanol, and that's probably not a very profitable business right now. So as long as you were in the regular amount of the pool, it works out, but the total consumption is weak from that point of view. So the ethanol industry might be facing different time issues than they have had in years past. I don't know if that helps?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Luc, if we can discuss your assertions here on labor costs for the second half of the year. Productivity was really good in the quarter, but I'm assuming some of that came on the back of the CP traffic for a while. Was there any extra overtime that you were running in the quarter? And, as well, can you also talk about stock comp? I know year-on-year you said the variance was minimal, but was it significant in the quarter itself? So how do we think about these things looking forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the stock based compensation. The impact in the quarter was actually very small. It was a negative $4 million. So it's not significant and it accounted for about 1% of the change &#x2013; unfavorable change in the labor variance.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of productivity, we did not have a significant amount of overtime in the quarter. We had a little bit but not very much. And, again, as we look to the back end of the year, I mean, I would expect our numbers to continue to show some good productivity. It really depends on the business that comes our way, and we have demonstrated the ability to absorb that business with minimal increase in staffing.</p>
          <p>So we keep going at a little bit faster pace in terms of lining up our resources to make sure that we have time for training of the folks. It takes about six months to train a conductor. So and we continue to see attrition running at about 500 people or so per quarter. So those things are what is driving the changes in terms of headcounts. But productivity is going to continue to be part of the equation for the back half of the year, there's no question about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Quick question just on end market exposure in coal. I was interested in your commentary on how small the domestic component has become as part of the mix. Can you just refresh us in terms of your export coal business since that had been faring so well? What percentage of it is met versus thermal, roughly? And in terms of end market exposure, I know you've alluded to the fact that Asia is the primary driver, but, maybe, just the top one or two countries, that'd be a help trying to formulate an output for export coal in the second half as prospects for China appear to be dimming somewhat</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you would take  &#x2013; thank you, Matthew, J.J. You would take our coal revenue and then 1.5% &#x2013; roughly 1.5% of our total of revenue at CN is met coal &#x2013; thermal coal in the U.S. You would take that out, and after that what you would take out is some petroleum coke revenue, which by and large is all export, so it's &#x2013; all of our export coming from the Gulf is the thermal coal, and our exports from the Canadian West Coast is mostly met coal and some thermal coal and some eth coke. The destinations for the met coal are historically Japan, Korea, and more and more China. And only the thermal coal, it's &#x2013; when you go to the Asian side, obviously, it's by and large China, and then some of the thermal coal from the U.S. Gulf also goes to Europe. So that's, kind of, the breakdown. I don't have the exact breakdown between thermal and eth coke and met, but take out the 1.5% of our book of business which is U.S. domestic. The remaining is product which is export, either met coal, thermal coal or petroleum coal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That gets me what I was looking for. And just a follow up would be then, what is it that gives you comfort that long haul business, the export business that's been growing so nicely for you should continue just again with storm clouds &#x2013; maybe just perceptually gathering a little bit more noticeably in China. Is it customer conversations? Is it stockpile levels? What is it that you look at on a concrete basis to get comfortable that that's a good business still in the second half, a nicely growing business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Troy. On the met coal, obviously, it is all, on the American basis all longer haul than our domestic terminal coal in the U.S. Domestic terminal coal in the U.S. on average is less than 200 miles, so it's not difficult to beat that on the length of haul. So the mix is always improving. So the met coal, the sign there would be looking at a price of met coal in the world market. The Teck released their results this morning. I think they were saying that their pricing set for the third quarter is in the range of the premium, up to $2.25 a ton, on an average $198 a ton. At those prices the Canadians and met coal producers should be making money and be competitive.</p>
          <p>On the thermal side we really arrived on the back of the strong production costs on a BTU basis of the Illinois mine that we serve. It is tough to compete in world market from the U.S. to sell thermal coal, so you've got to have a real low cost, and that's what Cline Energy has, which is a prime source of export coal for CN, and they do have laid down very nice export capacity and doing a great job running Convent. So on thermal, what gives me comfort is our producer at low cost, and on met coal what gives me comfort is the selling price of met coal on world market seems, even though it's weaker, still seems to be relatively good enough for the Canadian met coal producer to make money and run a decent business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Just &#x2013; you've alluded to it, but I just &#x2013; your strategic investments that seem to be paying off, the sidings, the <mark type="ph" /> J Keytones (1:02:17). We're excited about the J and the opportunity there. Can you scale the opportunity? I think one of the things coming out of the J, they said the U.S. velocity could increase. Obviously, does this eliminate some of the pinch points, et cetera for the long haul RTM? Like how do you scale that up? Where could it be? And how does that open up areas like Rupert and other areas that you might see potential pinch points on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right about Keith being excited about the J. So I'll let him take that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me say this, train speed, we talked about this southern region growth is up in Chicago. Train speed &#x2013; we talked about industry train speed is down. But in this growth we've actually improved train speed in Chicago, which is a key connection, the busiest connection with all of our carriers. In and around through that corridor train speed solid double-digit improvements in spite of all of this growth, which is a very, very significant component to our ability to convert our markets and to provide that reliable service that connects to Prince Rupert. So by extension, Prince Rupert, Vancouver, Chicago, if you look at that triangle, everything we're doing in Chicago provides a reliable service base to leverage for growth and expansion at those key ports in western Canada. So as we move forward, not only connection piece, this other piece as far as switching cars, providing consistent service, we do a lot of our switching in Chicago in Markham Yard, which is the old IC, used to be a dual hop. It's not a very efficient place to switch cars.</p>
          <p>As we get this yard online, September/October of this year, we're going to shift that switching into Kirk Yard and effectively garner and convert, much to Luc's happiness, there's some operational safety savings, safety improvements, as well as operating efficiencies. So it's strategically &#x2013; I don't want to say its genius. I don't want to say its luck. It took a lot of time and a lot of investment, energy, and a lot of credibility to make that transaction happen, but I'll tell you it's a once in a lifetime transaction for an operating guy that &#x2013; I thank Claude and the people that made it happen. Day in and day out, every day we run that place more consistently, more reliably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one add-on, just quickly. Beyond Kirk Yard, is there anything else that remains to be done around the J that you need &#x2013; that we should anticipate? And when might it be completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There's some tweaking, and we've got it there on the chart. We've tried to put a time line on it. There's a few more connections that will provide some additional efficiencies for us. You'll see that fourth quarter 2013, that's probably the longest out at Munger. Right now we've got trains that operate through the city, that have to operate through the city efficiently, because we don't have a connection there to efficiently take a right, for the lack of a better term, and go south down to Madison. So as we get that northwest leg of the wire &#x2013; southwest leg of the line installed in 2013, we'll take some additional train starts out of the city and put them south of Munger running down to Madison and up in &#x2013; over to Gary where we're going to switch box cars over south on our network. So that's going to help.</p>
          <p>The additional stuff up at Gleeson, we're going to have a double track up there that's going to add some additional capacity, pick up some train speed improvements there as well as velocity on our cars and locomotives. And then, finally, the connection down at Joliet. We've got Joliet subdivision, which runs into the city of Chicago. It's heavily used by Amtrak. It's heavily used by Metra, and now it's being used as well by UP coming out of their Global 4 terminal. We're going to have to take that Glen Yard access, right now we had to go to the city again to get to Markham, which in the future will be Kirk, we're going to put a connection in that allows us to come out of Kirk at Gary, stay out of the city, go down to Joliet, and take a right and go up into Glen. So that's going to take additional savings, synergies, car velocity, locomotive improvements and costs that we're paying to the hardware, to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:06:10) for trackage access fees as another step of improvement in that corridor.</p>

          <p>Yes. Broad question, I'm wondering how much outlook visibility you really have going forward? We are looking at a downturn, how far out can you see? Is it months? Is it quarters? It is weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really depends on the market, but generally speaking, and I speak from experience, that things can turn fairly quickly on you, if people are concerned and they sought to deplete inventories. But we do have visibility for a few months out. We do constant the channel checks with our customers, and we are privileged to have a huge database of information in terms of what's actually going on in the economy. So we're well positioned to see the turns coming, and we would react accordingly. But the visibility is in few months as opposed to weeks. But we certainly don't have much more than a few months.</p>

          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. And just can you tell us where we are on the Canadian rail review and if there's any risk there?</p>

          <p>You know what? We have an industry leading service, and we've been working at it hard here for the last several years. And I think it's fair to say, if you go out on the property whether it's in grain country or whether it's across the territory in the forest product sector, et cetera, the customers are recognizing the significant improvement, and we're continuing to add to it. We just launched recently <mark type="ph" /> a key deal (1:08:03) a new service notification, the process for first mile/last mile, which is something our customer base has been asking us, and so we're doing what we have to do on the ground. The government has received the reports from Mr. Dinning. Mr. Dinning, I think, was very wise and smart man. I think he said it the way it is. Things are good, but some customers continue to want the legislation, and we will have to convince the government that this is not good for innovation, this is not good for the country, and if we can't do that, we will have to convince them to make sure that whatever legislation they put forward is balanced and will be good for all stakeholders, not just the shipper associations.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Anne, and thank you all for this call, for attending on this call. Let me just repeat that I believe our agenda of operational and service excellence is delivering value. We are clearly having success in outpacing base market conditions on the top line. We are accommodating that business at low incremental cost. We're rolling with the punches, including the big ones like pension that are difficult to control other than from an accounting standpoint facing it, and it's all coming together, driving value for our customers and our shareholders. So we are pleased with how things are going and are looking forward to report again on a solid third quarter next time we're together.</p>
