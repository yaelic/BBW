          <p>Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Vale's performance for the first quarter 2012 shows a big decrease in our profitability and cash flow. For sure, the first quarter is the weakness operational and financial performance in the year, but especially 2012, this year was, we had strong rainfall season with a big effect in our revenues and costs and combining with the reduction of iron ore price and pellet price hurt our profitability.</p>
          <p>The rainy season is past. We believe that now we can go ahead with our iron ore shipments to increase as we did in March and March was very interest if you compare with the first and the second month of the year, we shipped more material in March than the first two months of the year, and we are very confident of delivering our volumes in accordance with our plans.</p>
          <p>We believe that the global markets for minerals and metals will continue very tight and we are well prepared to continue looking for opportunities and value creation for our shareholders. A look in our portfolio of assets, we note that now we have new projects we had like in Moatize, Oman, On&#xE7;a Puma, Tres Valles, many projects with value creation. What we have to announce is that we did the first shipment in New Caledonia project &#x2013; in our New Caledonia project, which is very good. We did it regardless of the problems that we had in the past.</p>
          <p>Now we are working with seven columns and we believe that until the end of August, we will be able to work with the whole plant, which means 21 columns. Salobo, our copper project in the north of Brazil with a capacity of 100,000 tons of copper in concentrate is doing well and we expect &#x2013; we are forecasting to have the ramp up in the next coming weeks and expansion of Salobo toward the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>We have already signed a lease on that contract for the continuation of our potash mining at Taquari-Vassouras in the Northeast of Brazil and looking for the Carnalita project with a capacity of 1.2 million metric tons per year. It is very important step in our strategy for potash.</p>
          <p>I believe that we continue &#x2013; very positive about the emerging economies mainly China. As you will know the first quarter of the year we note some improvement and in the first two weeks of April, the numbers that we had seen are still very good.</p>
          <p>But the most important, it's a year for you and you are here for questions and answers. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen; we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Felipe Hirai from Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. I have two questions. So, the first one is related to the execution of your CapEx in 2012, so you saw that you spent close to &#x2013; a little bit higher than $3 billion in the first quarter. So, do you expect to see a significant acceleration of this CapEx throughout the year so that you can still keep the budget those $21 billion?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to the grades that we saw in your 20-F maybe declined a little bit from last year, so if you could just comment what could be the <mark type="ph" /> commercial (07:56) impact in cost and what you expect to see in terms of grades over the following years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Its Galib speaking. About our CapEx progress, it's going very well. We had some problems with rainfall in the beginning of this year, but despite everything we are doing &#x2013; we have a good performance in our project here in Brazil, I'm talking about the all the iron ore projects including the logistics capacity, the offshore port in San Luis and all the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:38) for iron ore we expect to start our commissioning in second half of this year.</p>
          <p>And the offshore port will be ready in December of this year, adding something around 50 million tons of capacity in our logistics for exportation and in Southeast, this onshore &#x2013; the mining project &#x2013; the iron ore mining project is going very well. And as Mr. Murilo said about the corporate project Salobo, we are just starting the &#x2013; the start-up and the ramp up will be finish at the end of this month starting the production, normal production next month.</p>
          <p>About Mozambique project, we already started the construction. We have many companies already placing on that country working very well even in Malawi. We have a big company starting the railway construction. And also in Malaysia, we have our distribution center, it's progressing very well. So we don't have any problem. Up to now what we expect at the end of this year, have all the projects in good performance. And we expect to deliver everything according to our plan. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may add. This is Tito speaking. Actually, when you compare with execution, the CapEx in the first quarter of 2012 with the first quarter of 2011, actually we had a performance of 40% above on what was performed last year, which means that based on the approach that we assumed last year, actually we've been much better in terms of performance.</p>
          <p>And an additional information is based on what we've seen so far, we may have to go little bit above what has been planned so far for the execution of a CapEx in 2012. We are not &#x2013; we cannot give the assurance now about that, but clearly, it seems that we will be able to perform what was originally planned.</p>
          <p>In terms of the question on the grade, I'm assuming that you are mentioning the difference that we've seen in 20F in between what we had in 2010 and 2011. Because we had some additional reserves in our 20F, clearly there was a slight reduction in the grades. But in the long run, we are not foreseeing any possibility at all to see a drop, a major drop in the quality of our production. Actually if everything goes as we expect, I mean with the new project in the Caraj&#xE1;s area, we will see actually a improvement in the quality of the production and the reserves that will be explored. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Carlos de Alba from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. First one is related to the volumes of iron ore. It was mentioned in the press release that the accumulation of inventories was part of the explanation for the lower shipments in Q1 versus Q1 of last year, which was also affected by rain.</p>
          <p>Can you comment or can you measure the amount of tonnage that went into inventory, that going forward might be available for sale so that we can fine tune our expectations? And the second aspect is still in iron ore, is related to prices. Part one of the this question is related to the Vale's premium that was very strong in the quarter despite the fact that the premium on finds or the amount of dollars per each percentage of iron ore content in iron ore finds declined. This seems to be a little bit of discrepancy, so any comment there will be appreciated.</p>
          <p>And also on prices, the part B of this question is, why &#x2013; you didn't mention humidity in the iron ore, in Caraj&#xE1;s and the southern system as an impact for the lower realized prices. I mean I believe that it rained more this year &#x2013; last year, and last year that was one of the factors explained for the weak prices in Q1, but we didn't see that comment in this press release. And also I went back and looked at the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:40) prices and it seems that we had also on spike in Q1 of last year, similar to what we saw in the first quarter of 2012, and yet last quarter, last year, sorry, it was not used as an explanation for the weaker realized prices, so if you can help me understand a little bit better all of these factors, I would appreciate it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a lot of questions. Let's start with the first one. We are changing our business model, okay. Vale was used to selling iron ore on an FOB basis, so all the ore was sold from the port. Now we are moving to have our distribution centers. We have a ship, so we are changing a little bit. So this quarter we have around 2 million tons of ore outside our ports, so already in their way to the market, okay. And probably this number will increased as time goes back. But we don't expect to increase our total volume of inventories.</p>
          <p>Our idea is to move in part of the inventories we have in our inbound systems from mining to the port and move them at once to dollar distribution centers and to our ships that we will be sailing to Asia. So, we are kind of postponing sales and we are selling more close to the market, because as you know, we are far from the market and this brings some penalties for us when you sell directly for Brazil. We expect to get better price realization as we move our inventories closer to the customers. So we are in this process of moving it.</p>
          <p>But I wouldn't consider it as impacting our sales, because any kind of inventories that we can have may be operational inventories, it will be part of our sales, but for the time being, we don't have it clearly how much inventories will be needed. Today, we have around 2 million tons and if you compare against last quarter, it increased by 1 million ton, okay. But actually our idea is not to increase the total inventories of the company, only moving from inbound to outbound.</p>
          <p>Another question you raised was about price. We have manufacturers impacting our average price including, the change in the price system. We have some carryover effect. I think fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year was transition period. We have a main adjustment that we have to make in order to accommodate to the new situation.</p>
          <p>We are not at the point &#x2013; that impact was bulk because only customers that buy FOB, we give them a freight discount based on CNS price less rate to get the FOB price because they have their own ship. And we are giving this ship &#x2013; this rate to rebate based on long-term contracts. And the long-term contracts are adjusted by whatever the bunker oil is the price.</p>
          <p>So, every time the bunker moves, the freight that we discount from CNS price, it is bigger. Another impact a little bit of moisture because the reference price is dry. But the average price of CNR report is wet. So you have to adjust this prices and this quarter was a little bit higher the moisture around the 0.5% increase in the moisture. So that has to be adjusted also, so it's a bunch of effects that have been impacting the average price.</p>
          <p>And other point is that we are selling more ore based on tender. It is not a big quantity but as time goes by it tends to increase. And tender are the markets' price, we are not talking about plats or any reference price. It is the price you get from the tender so and all the points are included. If CNS is so that these tenders based on CNS is based on the quality of the ore. So this VIU price is not a factor, individually it is in the price ore added.</p>
          <p>So this is a part of our sales based on it also. So, it's very difficult to give all the explanation about the price. If you look at the reference price today you would get something around $118 based on a few factors back. The reference price of this first quarter down to FOB price you get some equivalent $118 taking out the moisture, taking out the moisture, taking out all the impacts on quality. But we also have part of the price that is sold at market price, so we have some carryover effect that impacts also this quarter.</p>
          <p>So it's a bunch a of issues and what I believe is that from our own <mark type="ph" /> opposition (19:47) we are going to have a much stable reference and also getting out of the rainy season, moisture will decrease and even the ore quality will increase a little bit. So, those are the points that affected the pricing in this first half.</p>
          <p>As a far as pellet premium, pellet is suffering one side because the lump or premium was reduced a lot and pellets sometimes compete with lump. So, this was impact negatively. On the other hand, we have big volumes <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:31) pellets sell into a different market which competes more with scrap where we are able to get a better price. Pellets is produced okay, so you get even for &#x2013; in case of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:48) pellets you have around 2% or 3% better iron ore content.</p>
          <p>So then part of the premium is in reality higher iron ore content. But on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:04) I would give you an average of pellets premium around $30 per ton. We intended to have a more stable premium policy as far as pellets is concerned in order to have a more stable sales because we are used to move the pellets price according to the market and that could impact the volumes. So, from &#x2013; our own ideas is to keep the pellets premium more stable and only charge above $30 the iron ore content that could be in the pellets. So, that's the situation as far as pellets are concerned.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, there is stronger competition for lump and lump is now selling almost at the same price as sinter, so it's a big change going on the market.</p>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Alex Hacking from Citibank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning everybody. Thank you for taking the question. My question relates to Vale's cash flow and capital structure. You mentioned in an earlier response that you are committed to spend the full $21 billion on CapEx this year, in fact even it could be higher, and you have $6 billion of dividends to pay.</p>
          <p>If we look at the first quarter, Vale generated only $3 billion of operating cash flow, obviously the operating cash flow is going to improve in future quarters, but it still seems like there is going to be a mismatch here in the amount of cash coming in and out. So, I guess I have a couple of questions. Firstly, how much extra net-debt does Vale expect to add this year, to pay for the projects? And then secondly, what amount of leverage is Vale comfortable with at this point in annual cycle? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. In terms of cash flow, based on the budget we have for the 2012, usually what we've got is when we make the announcement of the minimum dividends will be paying, till that we follow a position where we assume that the full CapEx will be executed in a very conservative basis how much we will be generating.</p>
          <p>As was said before, the first quarter was very unusual, let's say, but according to the numbers we have to date it should not be affecting the performance of the full cash flow. In terms of the debt level to that we are planning to have, I cannot provide you the final number, but I can tell you we do very strict rules about the way we want to see the ratios and our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So we want to keep at least the same the levels we have &#x2013; the rating levels we have today and actually we're looking for actually to improve them a little bit. So what I can tell you is, we are in a very comfortable position to say that the leverage should not be much higher than what we saw last year. And based on what we have forecast for pharmacy, we feel comfortable that not only &#x2013; if there is an exit, execution of the CapEx, it should be well covered by the cash flow that have been generated and the leverage that will be raised along the year.</p>
          <p>In terms of level of leverage usually what we do is, we do know &#x2013; we pay attention to two main ratios. First is, our capacity to pay the debt in accordance with EBITDA generation, EBITDA and also the level of debt in terms of &#x2013; the debt services with the cash generation. We've been running around one-by-one in this level. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Two questions, first one of the things that struck me in your P&amp;L was the low effective tax rate. I'm just wondering, if that's something that we should expect to continue the effective tax rate at such low levels or if we see those increasing throughout the year?</p>
          <p>The second question was related to the Rio Colorado project in Argentina and given the issues that YPF is having &#x2013; are you taking another look at that project, have there been any changes or potential changes coming given the environment in Argentina? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. In terms of tax rate, effective tax rate I should tell you we've have had along the years effective tax rate around 20%. If you ask me today, do we expect to see this going up, probably will be. Why is that? Because clearly we see a &#x2013; from everywhere, where we are operating today, a position from the tax authorities in action trying to collect more taxes from mining companies.</p>
          <p>So, I could assume that in the mid long run we will see that effective tax rate in most of the mining companies going up. Can I forecast that, no. I don't foresee anything today. We know that it's going to be higher than that, but we don't have a number that we should be working with. In the short term, what I'd say is, we've been very conservative in assuming that all the numbers we are collecting, providing in accordance with the rules where we are operating. Unless you want to add something...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the port Rio Colorado in Argentina, for sure, we are very concerned about the political situation and their whole environment in Argentina and we are doing a big analysis about the situation outside of the project and considering the economics as well, the inflation, their exchange rate, the profitability of the project and the merit of the project as itself. I believe that we will do this analysis in April and the next two weeks of May. We are assessing all the items of the projects to present to the board. It's very early to say what could be in the hands or our recommendation, but for sure, you are very concerned.</p>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Rodrigo Barros from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to make the questions. My two questions are first in terms of the reserves, we saw that Vale's reserves saw the decrease in their &#x2013; I don't know contents from 58.9% to 57.4%. So, I wondered if you could open what is the assay content in all the types of products that sell? I mean the Southern System, southeastern system, Caraj&#xE1;s and pellets to help us for cash in case maybe this is down, let's say 1% actually less than last year; I just wanted to double check this?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding iron ore prices. With what calculation a year where we compare iron ore and gold to spread prices. And in our calculations, this is very close to the historic levels. I wondered if you do the same calculation and in case you do, you get the same conclusion. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the iron ore reserve is concerned, we have a stable situation as far as reserve is concerned. But as we produce more and as long as we don't open new mines, we have some deteriorations in the ore itself. So, every year we are going down around the 0.5% in iron ore content based on the present mine that we are operating. We expect when we open new mines in the North system to increase our average content and its part of our whole logistic strategy.</p>
          <p>We are preparing ourselves to blend more, Caraj&#xE1;s ore with Southern System ore, Southern System ore is becoming less and less in iron ore content, but logistically speaking, we don't have conditions to blend both today. So our logistic strategy is based on increasing this possibility of blending more from Caraj&#xE1;s with Southern System. This is base of our strategy looking long term to keep our average quality by producing more and more ore in the North and blending with the existing capacity we have in the South.</p>
          <p>We don't believe in long term. Vale will decrease its average product. Much of the country we believe that as soon as we start to operate in the North system with South range project, we're going to increase on average but at this point in time, we are facing I think one of the toughest periods in our history as far as iron ore content is concerned because we are operating mainly in mines that were opened some of them 20 years ago, 30 years ago. So, the new mines, we'll increase it and the possibility to blend, we'll increase our average content. So, we are not concerned about the iron ore content quality looking forward.</p>
          <p>Also the quantity of our resources also, we are not concerned because what we do, we drill according to our needs. So, you don't drill all the time and if you have 30, 40 years reserves, you don't continue drilling. So if you needed to drill we're going to get more. So, it's our policy to have something like to 20, 30 years of present production as total reserves.</p>
          <p>The point of price I think it's creating a lot of questions and I understand because as I explained before, we made a lot of changes during this period, okay. We had a very stable system until third quarter of 2011 and suddenly we had to change because of the market conditions and we are not &#x2013; we don't have yet a stable situation as far as price is concerned. We are used to having only one price system and probably now we have more than 10, all of them based on market price is, all of them based in the reference pricing from the market, but using different average, some customers monthly, other customers quarterly, other customers buy daily price.</p>
          <p>We have tenders that the price is established by the market, by offers. So there is a lot of different systems now in price and this makes very difficult to establish exactly what any kind of what was the impact of moisture, what was the impact of iron ore content, what was the impact of silica, lumina and other components of the iron ore price? So, we really believe that in the second quarter of this year, we are going to have a more stable situation and reference we will be &#x2013; I would say much more close to what you see in the market.</p>
          <p>If you look back and use the same criteria and you exclude a lot of those effects that I told, our price would have been something around $118 against $109 and that to really have, but as I told you before, you have a lot of impacts of adjustments, carryover effects that created this distortion. I think from the second quarter on, we are going to have a more clear picture about it.</p>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Marcos Assump&#xE7;&#xE3;o from Itau BBA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi good morning everyone. My first question is also regarding prices to explore a little bit with Martins, you mentioned in the previous conference call that some volumes are sold on the price of the day, which is actually different than the platts referenced. I'd like to understand, what percentage of your volumes are sold under this mechanism and what level of price are you selling these volumes?</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding, if Murilo has an update on the discussions regarding the new mining hold in Brazil, mainly on mining royalties and special participation, and if you believe that this proposal will be taken to the Congress this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as price is concerned, we are selling today around 10% to 15% of our sales on tenders, okay. As you know, the platts reference is the 62, iron ore, it is not our quality. So this reference is mainly used for Australian ore, not for Brazilian ore. So, the tender we make is a specific price for our ore. We offer our 65% ex-silica, ex-lumina and we get the final price. That's what market offers to us.</p>
          <p>So sometimes this price is higher than the reference when you factor all the parts of the price system being &#x2013; based on 62, plus VIU and all of the stuff. But sometimes you are not able to see how the market is paying for this company. It's really markets price. And we are selling the standards based on ships that we're at <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:46) the ships closer for the customers, probably the same &#x2013; at the same moment that Australians are selling, so we don't have this count based on time, and it's a completely different system that probably in the future will create a new index. Because these tenders will be captured for the market and will be part of some index that probably will be created.</p>
          <p>You know that today there will be two platforms being developed, one by China another in Singapore and those platforms will also make a better price reference in the future. So we are as I told you before in our transition period and we have not clearly yet seen any kind of stable situation to give you a better information about this. I think that, as I already told in the second quarter, we're going to have a much better point in time to give you a more clear picture about what's going on, but for sure there is a lot of things going on in this moment.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question I think that you are considering to see the new mining law going to the Congress in the next 60 days. For sure, it's not easy to see the whole process completed this year because we have the election process in Brazil and for sure some of the people work in the Congress will move to the cities in order to help the process. Regarding <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:44) or the special participation we don't have any forecast or any news. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Leonardo Correa from Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon to everyone. And I have a couple of questions which have still not been addressed in both of the calls. The first one is related to the potential tax liability regarding ICMS charges in Minas Gerais. I mean this appeared in your recent 20-F and if I'm not mistaken, it relates to pellet feed transfers from Minas Gerais to other regions.</p>
          <p>So, I just wanted to understand this issue a bit more if you can clarify exactly what is being contested here and potentially the magnitude of what is at stake, that's my first question. The second one is for Tito Martins regarding the nickel market. I mean I just wanted to get your view of the potential implications on the bans of laterite exports from Indonesia and how this can impact the nickel pig iron market in China? Those are the two questions. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Leonardo. First question tax liability ICMS, in Minas state, this is the issue that has been discussed with the tax authority Minas for almost a decade already. It's not new for us that the basic for the discussion is that the transfer of the pellet feeds we performed from Minas to the Espirito Santo state. Usually what they want to see us to do is to calculate the ICMS based on the price of their iron ore. Since we are transferring the pellet feeds to dollar operations in the Espirito Santo state the transfer is based on the cost of the iron ore.</p>
          <p>They have tried before; they try to fight us before. It has been a challenge by us along the land, some years ago and they are doing this again. Clearly, it's a &#x2013; we have seen this in other places, some states, some countries are &#x2013; they've been very eager to increase incomes from mining operations and we do not consider it a big challenge for us at all because we have faced this before. In terms of the Vale, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (42:02), its R$1 billion, R$1.2 billion we are charging those right now.</p>
          <p>Nickel banned in Indonesia. I should say that we are very confident that, that ban itself can help us a lot, why is that? We produce nickel mats from Indonesia which is considered a intermediate product. Why the Indonesian authorities are actually creating this ban because they want to see some verticalization to production in Indonesia in all kind of minerals.</p>
          <p>So, what happened is if they actually make, enforce this ban, the volumes that will be exported &#x2013; the ore volumes that will be exported from Indonesia to China in order to have &#x2013; for the Chinese to produce more nickel than the iron, should drop a lot. The big question is if they will be actually able to enforce it because of the number of islands Indonesia has, Indonesia is a country with 20,000 islands, and it's a huge country, very difficult to control.</p>
          <p>So, you do have a lot of illegal trading happening everywhere and illegal mining due to those this illegal trading, but the ban itself is positive for the benefit of the market, I mean for those actually who pay taxes and have to produce legally. So, if it's enforceable we should see in the next few years actually a drop in the nickel pig iron ore production and on the other hand, we should see benefits for the nickel producers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add to one element, in terms of the ban, we forecasted the ban in mid of 2014, and regarding our tax, 25% of tax is to start in the beginning of May. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi just two questions. First a follow-up on the CapEx, you mentioned this one and the other one is &#x2013; you may you expect to perform 100% and may even go above the budget. My question is what would be the driver there? Is it that you are increasing the scope of the CapEx or is this related to any cost inflation on the CapEx?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on the supply side of the industry, we've been discussing specifically on Vale for quite a while, how challenging it is and has been to increase capacity and also the issue of impoverishment of reserves. Could you comment on these two aspects for being this as a whole, what are you seeing? Are we seeing more &#x2013; June is becoming a reality or just an overall picture on the supply side, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, its Galib speaking. About the CapEx performance implementation, we are working in &#x2013; let's say in a better organization. We are planning according to our reserves we have here in Brazil and many other countries. And that's the reason we believe that we are performing much better than we performed last year. And of course, we have good companies supporting our strategy, long-term agreement we have <mark type="audio gap" /> (46:15).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, please hold. Ladies and gentlemen, again, please hold. We are waiting for the reconnection of the moderator. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we had an interruption, Galib its back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just concluding about our CapEx, we hope that we can perform according to our plan and about the budget, of course, we are following what was scheduled for this year and perhaps we can add more and more budget according to more project that we are just starting to implement. I don't see that any big problem for having more and more budget because it's going in the better situation than we had last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rodolfo, just to clarify your question. We may see some change in scope, but it relates to the addition of &#x2013; additional investments, relates to the project that we're planning before. This is one thing. And we may see some small amount related to inflation. Most of it will be additions to the project that have been planned. Well, I mean, the performance is really being well. They're performing well. So we may see a &#x2013; the plan being enhanced, set up for what was planned before because of the performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. For sure. What you are doing right now is to work just with projects that we have in hand, the permits, the environment permits and all the authorizations. And we're very confident about this efficiency of the company, the efficient of our suppliers. As Galib has said, our long-term agreements is giving us much more flexibility in our discussion with contractors and you are very confident that this process is <mark type="ph" /> flying (49:18) well. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question about the quality of our ore. Actually we don't have any problems in the resources we have. What we are facing today is because we are depleting the existing mines so &#x2013; and as you go forward, the quality decreases but as we are starting opening up new mines, the quality will come back to the same level.</p>
          <p>If you look our resources and you'll see our reserves, you see this <mark type="ph" /> 49% to 50% (50:08) those are itabirites. You don't sell itabirites in the way they are, you needed to concentrate them and after concentration their quality goes to 65%, 67% in some cases even higher. So you add additional cost when you concentrate, $3, $4 per ton additionally, but the quality is comparable with former Vale quality. So for us today, the big issue is to open up new mines and we'll start to producing from those reserves, the same quality of ore we always had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Please the next two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:58).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon, thank you for taking my follow-up and my question is related to domestic iron ore market in Brazil. I mean you guys purchased some material from third parties mainly at the South and Southeastern this season. I just wanted to hear what are your views on how this should behave over the next year; I mean we have a lot of miners talking about potential increase purchases from third parties over the next year. So, I just wanted to see how Vale should behave over the next two or three years, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on our fertilizers. I mean you just recently renewed the leasing in Taquari-Vassouras, I just wanted to get a more broad comment I mean on what are the main growth alternatives here in this business unit from a long-term perspective? And I mean what should we expect as the main steps, the main landmarks over the next years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as far as the &#x2013; I don't know that we buy domestically. Our long-term plan is not to buy iron ore because we believe as new logistic solutions are offered to the market, these people will prefer, sell this ore directly. So, we are not considering this source of ore in the long term. Our long-term plan is based on our own capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Eduardo de Salles Bartolomeo, speaking about fertilizers. The main &#x2013; as we mentioned in the beginning, we are very happy to sign an agreement with Petrobras this week that allowed us to implement the project of Carnalita. So, the three main milestones that we would separate phosphate from potash, but from potash, I would say <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:39) &#x2013; as we already talked during the meeting, Carnalita and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:50), so those are the three main projects that we can see &#x2013; foresee in the future, of course bring our production from 600,000 to 7 million tons, so it is bullish.</p>
          <p>And we do believe that because as already mentioned here, Brazil is a huge consumer of fertilizers and our participation here in Brazil only 10%, so those three projects are solid. They are strong. They are cost wise very well positioned, so we believe that they are coming online with the date that we forecast for the three, mainly Carnalita and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:29). For phosphate the growth is more limited due to the Brazilian conditions and the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:36) is the next, how I can say, milestone that we're going to implement as soon as we get the approval from the Board.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Ivano Westin from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the question. I have two questions related to increase in volumes of iron ore, first one, first is Simandou Zogota, you stated, you expect <mark type="ph" /> nominal capacity of 50 million (54:08), I would like to ask when you expect to achieve that amount and what are your plans after that? And the second question refers to <mark type="ph" /> Apollo (54:19) which used to be one of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:21) project and if you expect to develop it? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the <mark type="ph" /> Apollo (54:37) project we continue our discussion with the government of Minas Gerais, is a challenging project, the project is nearby Belo Horizonte. We knows &#x2013; that the government, we are very concerned about the fact of the environment and as Vale is. And &#x2013; but we needed to reach a consensus, so what we are trying to do is to reach on a consensus regarding this project.</p>
          <p>It's a bit expensive, because we must interfere in some logistic issues as well. But we are not in a point to present to the Board. I consider that you take some time, the best forecast that we can have in our hand is for the second half of the year to have the &#x2013; all the discussions with the government of Minas Gerais finalized.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Simandou, I think that is very important to point out that we &#x2013; now we have a new mining law in Minas. We know that the government they had committed in order to analyze all the permits all the concessions and open discussions with each company. We know as well that we have election, new election to the congress in July.</p>
          <p>And I believe that the President Alpha Conde discussed companies just in the end of this process. Then it will be very premature in our side to comment about the budget, about the speed of the project, about the volumes. I think that we must consider it because as you know, the royalty issue as they have already provided with the linkage with fuel it will be a big burden for the &#x2013; then it's what we have in.</p>
          <p>Okay we have arrived at finalize our session. Also like to say thank you very much for your attention and to repeat that we continue very confident about the economy mainly in emerging economies. And we think that we have &#x2013; and we are doing our best in order to have our projects doing well with the implementation in accordance with our agenda and looking to bring more transparency for all the investors. Thank you very much.</p>
