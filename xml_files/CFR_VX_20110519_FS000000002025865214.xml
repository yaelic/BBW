        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I will do the introduction and highlights and then we'll hand over to Richard and Gary, and then I will summarize at the end.</p>
          <p>I think you will see sales increase by 33% to &#x20AC;892 million, 24% constant exchange rates. Excluding the impact of NET-A-PORTER, sales increased by 19% at constant rates.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by 63% to &#x20AC;1,355 billion. The operating margin increased by 370 basis points to 19.7% of sales, excluding the impact of NET-A-PORTER, which we'll discuss again later on in more detail. The operating margin would have been just under 21% of sales.</p>
          <p>Net cash improved &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; maybe you have to do it. Net cash position improved by &#x20AC;707 million to &#x20AC;2,589 billion. The increase included a record level of cash flow from operations of &#x20AC;1.696 billion just under &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>All right, if we go to sales and profit by segment, you will see that trading conditions were more favorable than the comparative period, which also included the destocking impact on wholesale sales, together positive exchange rates contributed and acquisitions contributed to 14 percentage points on the sales growth.</p>
          <p>The operating margins of the jewelry and watchmaker segments were 31% and 21% respectively, at least three percentage points above last year.</p>
          <p>Sales are broadly in line with forecast and additional profit stemmed from the higher reported sales improvements in the gross margin percentage and continued cost control.</p>
          <p>Want to go to the sales analysis. At constant exchange rates and excluding acquisitions, group sales was 19%. Where are we now? I thought so &#x2013; sorry, in my section I changed some things last night in my section they forgot to put the tabs in. I am back three pages, which you will see at the end. The rest they write for me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So now, let's come to the analysis of sales for this fiscal year, first Europe that contributes to 38% of sales. Sales in Western Europe, plus 21% at constant rates, sales to local clientele progressing in France, Germany and Switzerland, thanks to timely imitative such as the relaunch of the Trinity and Love collections at Cartier.</p>
          <p>Non-locals to continue to account for more than 50% of sales in Europe. Middle-East and Russia are back to growth, albeit at a slower rate, respectively plus 10% and plus 5%. Excluding high jewelery sales, the underlying trend in both markets is stronger. The inflation in commodity prices bode well for the future for these two markets.</p>
          <p>Now Asia-Pacific, with 30% of Group sales, it's close to being our largest region. In terms of retail sales Hong Kong &#x2013; the City of Hong Kong has become number one <mark type="ph" /> rate of Paris (0:05:09). Growth tracked that of other region when discounting the positive impact of NET-A-PORTER acquisition, year-on-year up 36% reflecting, an excellent performance across the region and successful opening of 55 stores, including internalization of franchise stores in Mainland China. Given the economic momentum and demographic base of the region, we expect an increase from Asia-Pacific to Group sales and to profit in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the Americas region, 4% of Group sales, in excess of America 11%. Plus 30% to be compared to minus 20% last year, so comparatives are flattering. Strong retail up 25% excluding NET-A-PORTER plus 51% including NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>Wholesale did very well, up 15% given the substantial reduction of the network. As a result, division's distribution strategy will be pursued.</p>
          <p>The very high end sales are particularly well reflecting a positive feel-good factor among our clients. We are confident that we have the ability to generate new wealth longer term increase purchases from South American, visitor should be a further contributor to the growth for that region.</p>
          <p>Now Japan, our third largest single market after Hong Kong and the USA, contributing 11% of sales, more when accounting for Japanese tourists who are traveling against with the strong yen. Sales up by 1% in yen plus 18% in euro, benefiting from the strong yen.</p>
          <p>Again, market share in shrinking pie by launching assorted products such as the Cartier rejuvenated Trinity Bijoux or the Charms Mini watches. Recent dramatic events are making it too difficult to access, but prospects likely to be brighter than most anticipated. March sales which are included in our results dropped by 21% in yen. In April, sales rose by 3% in yen.</p>
          <p>I would like to add that, Richemont management and staff are very supportive and full of admiration for our Japanese colleagues and the Japanese people and the way they are coping with this dramatic events.</p>
          <p>Finally, sales to our directly operated stores, operated stores and NET-A-PORTER i.e. retail sales, which represents 50% of Group sales. They grew by 35% or 24% without NET-A-PORTER, showing excellent momentum, benefiting from impactful store openings and from superior growth in Asia Pacific and with watches.</p>
          <p>The wholesale performance at plus 15%, reflects a continuously strong replenishment from watch retailers, however limited by shortages, despite smaller distribution network, underlining an improvement in productivity for this network.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the performance per segment now, and let's start with the jewelery maisons, record sales and profits for both Cartier and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, leading to a record profitability for the segment.</p>
          <p>Cartier growth was again broad based in terms of geography and product line. The performance was particularly remarkable in retail. Beyond this is excellent performance Cartier has proven its ability to increase its leadership and amid extreme volatility thanks to a very reactive organization.</p>
          <p>Likewise, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels recorded a double-digit growth in France in all product lines and regions. Operating contribution for the jewelery segment increased by 43% to &#x20AC;1.62 billion giving a record contribution margin of 31%.</p>
          <p>Now our specialist watchmakers, they all enjoyed very strong growth rates in sales except from &#x2013; for Baume &amp; Mercier due to the announced ongoing restructuring. The negative impact of the stronger Swiss francs, higher precious materials prices and product returns, and the cost &#x2013; returns on the cost of sales were partially absorbed by price increases and higher production levels. As a result, operating contribution arose to &#x20AC;379 million and the contribution margin to 21%.</p>
          <p>All specialist watchmakers saw an improvement in the results to reach an all-time high, with a special mention for the exceptional performance of Piaget and excellent management of transition year at Baume &amp; Mercier, where relaunch sounds promising.</p>
          <p>We are benefiting from a Korean portfolio focused on the premium segments and the watch industry which has been growing the fastest and with little cannibalization among Masons</p>
          <p>Montblanc maison, all regions and channel enjoyed a double-digit growth rate in sales. Watches, leather goods and writing instruments showed very good growth in sales. As a consequence and thanks to a better utilization of manufacturing capacity and a more efficient retail network, the operating contribution rose by 38%. The contribution margin further progressed to reach 16% of sales.</p>
          <p>Other &#x2013; finally the other business area, this segment comprises the fashion and accessories, maison, NET-A-PORTER, and the facilities involved in the manufacturing of watch components to third-party and to our maisons.</p>
          <p>The fashion and accessories business generated &#x20AC;29 million profit against a &#x20AC;8 million profit last year. Alfred Dunhill, Lancel, Chlo&#xE9;, Azz&#xE9;dine Ala&#xEF;a and Shanghai Tang were all profitable.</p>
          <p>In manufacturing, losses were reduced from &#x20AC;44 million to &#x20AC;35 million, thanks to improving order flows albeit still down, and improved productivity gains.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, this segment also includes inter group subsidiaries which compensate for the incremental cost of components linked to integration. I'll deal with NET-A-PORTER in the next slide.</p>
          <p>NET-A-PORTER enjoyed a superior growth in sales of 108% of &#x20AC;281 million in March 2011. I remember that NET-A-PORTER compared to other businesses has a specific business model, is distributing third-parties' products over Internet. It enjoys retailer gross margin maximum 50%.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, it had lower AP ratio, mid to high-single digits. The business is running ahead of plan with a positive EBITDA generation and already significantly cash positive. We believe there is a significant potential ahead with further geographic expansion at NET-A-PORTER and OUTNET.COM and the launch of MR PORTER.</p>
          <p>Organizational highlights. We are constantly working on improving the efficiency of our business mode. First, we are upgrading our backbone system and processes to adapt to a bigger and more volatile world. Optimization of supply chain will increase our competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>In Asia-Pacific, in particular, in China, we're really investing in people, infrastructure to meet the challenges ahead of us. We'll have close to 2500 employees by the end of March 2012 against 1700 now in China.</p>
          <p>Ongoing development of SAP, which is a distribution platform for the jewelery maisons and Specialist Watchmakers, to be completed in Europe, end of 2013. In production, Cartier is fully integrated and we are continuing the rollout with the Specialist Watchmakers starting with IWC this year.</p>
          <p>New retail system at fashion and accessories maisons headquarters is now operational and regional rollout is underway.</p>
          <p>Second, we maintain regional focus on growth markets where we see supplier growth, in Asia Pacific, where we open 55 internal stores. In the Middle-East, we also opened stores notably in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar. Finally, we opened few flagship stores discriminately in main location of established markets for specialist watchmakers like for example, Piaget in London and IWC in Paris.</p>
          <p>Third, we exercised retail control of the distribution to enhance the shopping experience and grow productivity. Opening more mono-brand stores either fully owned franchise in new markets where there is no historical watch wholesale network and where cost of stores are lower. It makes sense to favor the opening of internal stores. These stores also act as an effective communication tool.</p>
          <p>However, we shall continue to work with franchise partners and multi-brand retailers even in new markets. We will nevertheless continue with our strategy of having fewer partners and more partnership. For instance, Baume &amp; Mercier has half the number of doors in services. It plans to maintain this number constant while opening new relationships in growth markets.</p>
          <p>Fourth, support such growth with further investments in production, in terms of increased integration levels, increased efficiency and increased capacity. For the next three years we are continuing our integration plan and still subsidizing the incremental cost of integration linked to volume. By so doing, we are enabling our maison to adapt to improve our productivity and develop more upscale in-house movements</p>
          <p>And over to you, Gary for the figures.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Good morning to everyone in the hall and also watching on the web. First, we'll start with gross profit. Gross profit rose by 38% to &#x20AC;4.4 billion. This represents 63.7% of sales, a 210 basis point improvement on the previous year. Excluding NET-A-PORTER, which as Richard said enjoys only a retail margin. Overall, margins increased to 64.3% of sales.</p>
          <p>This improvement reflects pricing power of our maisons, higher production levels and capacity utilization, the outperformance of retail versus wholesale channel. And this performance is in spite of a strengthening Swiss franc, particularly in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And let's not forget as well, we did restructure Baume &amp; Mercier in the second half and this had impacts both on the sales and margin line and provisioning of inventories. Nearly all of the maisons, increased their gross margins, particular increases were noted in Jaeger-LeCoultre, Alfred Dunhill and Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the operating expenses. Operating expenses grew by 29% or 13% at constant currency, excluding NET-A-PORTER which was well below the sales growth. Our overall ratio has been reduced to 44% of sales from 46%.</p>
          <p>If I can draw your attention to the bridge in the upper right-hand corner of the slide, what's the bridge from year-on-year? We had a weaker euro that impacted 9% on the expenses. At the half year it was 8%.</p>
          <p>The integration of NET-A-PORTER added 7% to the expense base. It was 7% in the first half. We increased our communication spend that added 6% on the total expense base. I will remind you at the half year it was 3% and we communicated a significant increase in the second half which came true.</p>
          <p>All other costs are the S&amp;D and admin, which rose by 7%. In the first half of the year those costs rose by 8% on the expense base. S&amp;D costs 54% of the total OpEx rose by 30%. These increases obviously relate to new stores. We opened up 59 new stores for the year, mostly in the Asia-Pacific region. Our underlying growth of selling and distribution cost was 14% for the year.</p>
          <p>Communication costs, as I mentioned were up 38%. We're back to a more normalized level of 10% of sales versus 8% in the previous year. Administration costs were up 20%, but on an underlying basis, excluding NET-A-PORTER and excluding constant currencies they rose by 3%.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the operating profit overview snapshot of the P&amp;L. As Richard and Johann said, sales rose by 33% or 19% at constant currencies and excluding NET-A-PORTER. We had much improved gross margin, 63.7% or 64.3% without NET-A-PORTER. We have contained underling growth in expenses and this will lead to an operating profit rising by 63% to &#x20AC;1.355 billion and the leverage there is almost two to one.</p>
          <p>Our overall operating margin was 19.7%, however if we exclude the impact of NET-A-PORTER, our operating margin arrived at 20.9%, which equaled our record margins that we achieved in 2008.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the items below the operating line. Net finance costs amounted to &#x20AC;181 million. &#x20AC;150 million of this relates to the mark-to-market losses on our cash balances which we discussed at the half year. As a reminder, this has no effect on the equity position of the Group after consolidation. We recorded a one-time accounting gain of &#x20AC;101 million after our acquisition of NET-A-PORTER, because we had to revalue our initial 33% stake that happened in the first half.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate came in at 16.7%. If you remember, last year, we did enjoy significant benefits on deferred tax assets that we had to record related to our stock option plan. That was about 220 basis points, if you exclude that, the normalized rate is about the same. We do continue to expect the tax rate to be around 18% in the medium-term. As a result, net profit for the year rose 80% to &#x20AC;1.079, passing the &#x20AC;1 billion mark for the first time. This represented 15.7% of sales.</p>
          <p>Let's now focus on the cash flow. We enjoyed &#x20AC;232 million improvements for the year. Obviously a result of the higher operating profits and a quite limited swing in the working capital usage, despite the rebound in sales. The main elements of the working capital movements were increases in inventory. Our raw materials and work-in-process year-on-year rose by 44% and our finished goods rose by 13%.</p>
          <p>We have enjoyed a faster inventory rotation this year, 16.5 months versus 18.7 a year ago. Accounts receivables continue to be managed well and collected timely and this I think is more a function of the desirability of our products in the wholesale channel and the turn that they enjoy. And we had some timing issues of the year-end in terms of trade payments and accruals as well and that had a positive impact.</p>
          <p>We did manage to grow and we did manage to manage our inventories around the constrains that we had. We do expect an increase in the coming year in terms of finished goods inventories, because the current levels we believe are lower than we would like.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look at our fixed asset investments. Gross fixed assets were up 89% to 4.1% of sales. We increased investments in our retail network, our manufacturing facilities. And we expanded our distribution platforms for NET-A-PORTER.</p>
          <p>At &#x20AC;285 million gross spend this is still above our depreciation level of &#x20AC;213 million for the year. For the next year, we anticipate fixed asset investments to approximate 6% to 7% of sales and we expect 7% to 8% of sales in fiscal '13.</p>
          <p>Let's go through some details of the fixed asset spend. By category, nearly half of our investments relate to our retail and point of sale networks. The most notable projects for the year, the Singapore Marina Bay Sands project, where we have eight boutiques, eight brands; Piaget Bond Street in London and Panerai in Paris on Rue de la Paix.</p>
          <p>Cartier renovated its flagship in Hong Kong, the Prince's building and also opened up locations in Shanghai, Hong Kong Plaza and Macau the Wynn project. Close to 30% of our spend were in our manufacturing capabilities. Most of this spend relates to tools. We didn't really have any spend on space this year. And the remaining 23% includes the new distribution platforms as we suggested associated with NET-A-PORTER and ERP systems.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the final operational element, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the year amounted to &#x20AC;915 million approximately &#x20AC;1.1 billion if you exclude the acquisition of NET-A-PORTER. This obviously reflects the higher operating results, reasonable retention of working capital and higher tax payments.</p>
          <p>Let's take a quick look at the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a solid balance sheet. Equity rose to 72% of the total from 70 last year. After a dividend payment this year of a &#x20AC;141 million and our investment in NET-A-PORTER, our net cash and investments position rose from &#x20AC;1.9 billion to &#x20AC;2.6 billion at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>I would like to now turn it over to Mr. Johann Rupert for our summary. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's see now that I have the right document. Right. I actually wanted just to slide up, but I redid it and I sent them the slides, so they must have been reformatted. Now what you've seen up till now is really the last year, but I like to just step back to what the underlying goals and strategy will entail for the future. And the results that we've seen up till now has been as a result of us concentrating on a few basic principles.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we'd like to grow the value of our company, your &#x2013; our &#x2013; the shareholder in a sustainable way. Now that will be valued by the markets, because of the sustainable flow of dividends. We've said in the past that we like to keep it growing at about 15% over a medium to long-term. Don't hold me to that, we'll probably, as in the past have a higher payout ratio in bad times and a lower payout ratio in good times. Obviously, this depends upon the growth in free cash flow. We do not tie ourselves to payout ratios.</p>
          <p>Next please. Now obviously, we're not going to have any sales of our products that don't appeal to clients on a worldwide basis. We've been fortunate in going to what we call growth markets today at an early stage. The key to desirability is &#x2013; really lies in integrity of the brand of the maison and the esteem.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we started verticalizing our watch production. I'd say in the late 90s and it accelerated with the acquisition of LMH. So today, we have some 21 factories, employing nearly 7,000 people in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Clients are too intelligent. They don't want to buy a Ferrari made in a Fiat factory. That was our like motive, and why we accentuated verticalization, and I would say before the great number of our competitors. And obviously, you need awareness as well. It's no good if you have a hidden gem and nobody knows about it. So, we have to spend on communication. And you'll see that in bad times we'll tend to spend more as a percentage of sales because we intend to keep our share of voice.</p>
          <p>Then our products must also be relevant. You can have the best probable in the world, if it's not relevant to the consumer, they won't buy it. And the brand needs vitality. So we need creativity. We need younger people and this goes right through to the HR policies throughout the different maisons.</p>
          <p>So we try to bode brand equity, desirability, which leads to pricing power, because you know what's happened to the Swiss franc and to the euro versus the dollar for instance where a great number of our clients love in dollar related currencies. And unless you've got pricing power, you're also not going to be able to sell. So it's a matrix. We think we understand the matrix, then that's the Holy Grail. Next please.</p>
          <p>Why did I tell you all of that because Gary has already referred to CapEx, obviously expenditure on boutiques. We intend to further expand networks in growth areas and to consistently and continuously keep the quality of our boutiques at the premium &#x2013; super premium level.</p>
          <p>We will further spend on our industrial capacity and on our research and development. We are again in a fortunate position that we cannot supply the demand and that's across-the-board and we will not be tempted to pick low hanging fruit. We will make sure that we will have the necessary people with the necessary skills in the necessary manufacturing sites, in order not to produce products that we're not proud off. I've already discussed the boutiques, Gary has referred to it.</p>
          <p>And our overall preference folks, is to build goodwill rather than brand equity rather than to buy it. We've also been offered a lot of the companies that have been sold, in fact, prior to other people having bought it or bought them. But the call that we've got to make is do we pay somebody else billions of euro of which billions of euro is represented in goodwill or we take &#x2013; do we take a &#x20AC;1 billion for instance and expand the boutiques of Cartier, Van Cleef and Piaget. And we made the call that we will serve our shareholders better by doing the latter. Next one please.</p>
          <p>Now you've seen that by network this is April, we've done well, at constant currencies it's 35% up. Retail was up 45%, wholesale 27%. Japan was single-digit and Asia Pacific and Europe up double-digit. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Now the conclusion. We've got a unique portfolio of high quality maisons. We've got leadership in prestige jewelery and watches. I never thought when we started here in 1988 that we would be called an emerging market play. I mean not in my wildest dreams did I ever think that we'd making watches. I don't think we'll say making jewelry, I would say creating jewelry. And that an American fund manager would tell me you are a key emerging market player. And what are you talking about the emerging market play. So don't you actually understand what I mean. But we are in effect, as I think it was Coco Chanel that said money is money is money, it's only the pockets that change. So we are very fortunate that the work that's been done by our predecessors, by our current colleagues, I would say by the people in the room, they enter the maisons.</p>
          <p>It's led to a banner for mass sales, plane with five engines. So if the one engine starts stuttering because of economic problems, let's say the United States, Europe &#x2013; parts of Europe. Then luckily we have Asian engines and they came to balance themselves because the most of our maisons have universal appeal, which is this broad exposure to local clientele from traditional established markets and the clientele from the growth markets.</p>
          <p>We have a strong balance sheet as said, firstly you can discount us ever using equity for acquisition. Equity is always the most expensive way to pay. And our cash, we feel is better deployed in supporting maisons that we know and that we see growing faster in target areas than the companies that's available for sale.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. We are ready to take some questions now.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning. Jon Cox, with Kepler Capital Markets. A couple of questions for you. The first question, just on the profitability of the watch division in the second half of the year appeared to halve. I wonder if you could just give us some more detail on that. Even adding back your one-off restructuring your one-off restructuring still looks pretty disappointing compared to what you have in the first half of the year?</p>
          <p>Second question for you, just on the net cash power you have the dividend seemed to relatively light given the big net cash power you had, just wondering, obviously you've talked about an expansion of CapEx, but even that won't get rid of that huge cash power you have. But you are clearly ruling out any big M&amp;A. I'm just wondering, if you thought about maybe a buyback to return cash to shareholders or a special dividend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I lost a second, but Jon, you're English speaking. I thought I had explained and I've known you for so many years. I've thought I've explained it again and again and again and again that a payout ratio is different in good years to bad years. And I'm not sure we are out of the woods yet. In fact, I'm not talking about threshold, I'm talking about the world economy.</p>
          <p>If you look at the debt restructuring in Europe and you look at the debt ceilings in the United States, it's as if we are dancing on clouds. You see the VIX is universal optimism. And I have said that to the shareholders years ago we will try to grow by 15% per year and we will carry on to doing that. And in fact it's really because of the lack of regulatory supervision and because of active shareholders prodded on like market commentators.</p>
          <p>That part of the problem that we're in, exists today. When I started banks and automobile companies were allowed to have hidden reserves. So in fact here guess what's happened, the banks created hidden reserves and so did the automobile companies been involved I was in the Board, in the Advisory Board of automobile companies that puts away billions of, let's say that used to be Deutsche Marks in the lean year. Guess what happened, various accounting standards changed there to bring it on to the balance sheet. Active shareholders said, you got lazy balance sheet, give us the cash. The management found it, they gave the cash, the famous line, give it back to you when you need it, and of course we all know that's a total fallacy.</p>
          <p>So the companies gave back ridiculously low interest rates prevailed and there were opiate in the air about leverage and everybody assumed leverage, the banks, the shadow banks. Guess what happened, the taxpayers we bailed them out and that payback has to come sometime. So the debt is not disappeared. It's just morphed into a social obligation.</p>
          <p>So, I'm afraid, to some extent profits got privatized and losses got socialized. That bill will have to be paid some time, either &#x2013; and in the end, I'm afraid, the saver will suffer, whether it be through inflation or default.</p>
          <p>And if you look at share buybacks, and at the prices where the companies bought their shares back, they inevitably bought the shares back very close to the top of the market because that's when they had a lot of cash and, boy do they regretted when two years later all hell breaks loose. We've had this policy since we went public and I think it stood our shareholders in good state. And to describe that it &#x2013; to describe the 29%, nearly 30% increase in dividends as how will you put it poor or &#x2013; sorry I missed your word &#x2013; slight.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jon. How you are doing? The factors that we try to highlight in the first half, basically I think came true. We had a slight reduction relating to foreign exchange on the Group. We were positive in the first half and we were negative in the second half. That's one factor.</p>
          <p>I would say in the watch division, generally the margin usually in the best of days is lower in the second half normally. We said we were going to spend more in communication. We spent about 8% group-wide in the first half and we spent 12 in the second half. And we tried to communicate the Baume &amp; Mercier situation. What did I say at the half year? B&amp;M was profitable in the first half, and we said we were going to invest. So, that the losses for Roger Dubuis and B&amp;M together would be equal last year that implies a significant profit reduction in the second half and that's...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if I would say, Jon the &#x2013; I think the Baume &amp; Mercier management team led by Alain Zimmermann they did a great job of this. They got the products ready. We reduced the doors by over 50%. We took back all the products from the doors that we were going forward with and we destroyed it. So starting April 1st, it's an extremely clean situation and we are pretty positive about it. I think it's &#x2013; that one is going to be a quick turnaround.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think it's a good question, Jon because unless you understand that we deliberately decided to clean that we took the stock back. It was really a turnaround situation. I'm personally very excited, but what I see and especially by the response of the dealers and the people who came to the SIHH. But it would look funny if you didn't understand.</p>

          <p>Rey Wium, Renaissance Capital. Just two questions. The first one, first just revolves around the Americas, obviously you've seen some quite strong growth out of that market of 30%. I am just curious to your views about the sustainability of that given that the American economy is not out of the woods, yet?</p>
          <p>And the second question just regarding Montblanc, your margins were about 16% now and if I look at the product profile, you have leather in there, watches. My gut feel is that &#x2013; I just want to know, is it possible for the margins to get closer to the likes of your jewelery maisons over the longer term?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, remember that operating basis is flattering, we had a bigger drop last year in America, but that's very true that especially for the higher-end brand the recovery has been quite strong, the feel-good factor is there completely and is back and we are experiencing very good sales. I am not an expert in predicting how the economy is going and what we are seeing, but I may confirm in April time confirmed in April that business is back and the clients are already buying. Remember that during the crisis, we didn't try to push to sell in. We cleaned our distribution, so we have a very clean situation, of course, probably in Baume &amp; Mercier, but for the other brand as well. We continue to reduce the network to have really first seeking to the shopping experience for the client to really be well treated. I guess you saw the interview on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:28) regarding the American distribution. That's very clear that we tried to do our best to sell our products in the good condition. And that leads to another side benefit which is increase of productivity of the network, less loss, less cost and much, much nicer distribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, Richard, I might add, the dealers that &#x2013; the doors that remain open, obviously do better, which leads to cleaner inventory in their positions. So it's all-in-all a same thing to do. As for America or Europe, I have absolutely no idea. But there is a remarkable correlation between some of our maisons and various stock exchanges and a negative correlation to the VIX.</p>
          <p>People feel good. The fear factor is down and there are nice spend, it's been the case since time immemorial. And I guess my big fear is stagflation. You guys are too young to remember the 70s, but stagflation is a horrible thing. And so all-in-all I'm more pessimistic than I should be, considering the results. But that's for Europe and for United States, particularly, mainly Anglo-Saxon exuberance. And then of course, the sailors in Northern Europe having to pay for the people with a higher quality of life in Southern Europe. How long that is containable, I'm not sure. It's &#x2013; you live in Hamburg, you pay high taxes and you work your backside off and you look on television you see this wonderful lifestyles next to the Mediterranean, I'm not sure. So I couldn't give you a view on the states I wouldn't' short the United States and I would certainly not short their ingenuity and capacity to work themselves out of situations. But as we've seen, we're very fortunate in that the sales are now more balanced. As for Montblanc, it currently stands at &#x2013; sales mix is totally different and I think Gary and Richard can expand on that.</p>

They're both a very good watch business. In the year 2000-2001 I nearly had a heart attack when Jan du Plessis, we had a perfect strong &#x2013; strong yen, weak euro, the millennium fervor and he made a statement, and he thinks we can maintain 20%, I said, we won't here, but I said</p>
          <p>Jan, please if you guys ought to &#x2013; as he sat down, I said are you out of your mind, Are we going to keep on having operate &#x2013; you remember the conversation. So I don't know, we will try and help them with from the head office, but you've got to remember that in Hamburg they run autonomously. It will depend upon their product mix and it will depend upon the geographic footprint to a very large extent. Have you got, Gary anything?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. I have three questions. The first one on your April current trading you've had a strong sales acceleration especially against the high comparative. I was wondering the reason behind it, if there was any one-off effects high jewels sales for instance. And in the release you seem to suggest that you expect these trends to continue in coming months. So I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the outlook in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on fashion and leather you've achieved a big turn around there a big swing in profits, I was wondering what's changed fundamentally at those businesses, and from a strategic point of view would you be tempted to use some of your high cash pile to maybe strengthen your presence in fashion and leather or you're pretty happy with the current brand portfolio.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on vertical integration, do you thing Swatch Group's intention to stop delivering movement to third parties are realistic threats. And if so, how quickly could you get more independent in terms of movement production. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you guys really are starting to ask very good questions. When we started here with Sophie about 10 years ago &#x2013; they asked about 50 questions each question was how much you're going to sell next year? Do you remember the original questions? I think first, the first question &#x2013; yes, with only three weeks into &#x2013; into my &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; now, I know but we're only three weeks into May. So I can't talk and extrapolate April for too far, but no we did not have a huge high jewelery sales somewhere. It's across the board.</p>
          <p>And you're correct it was against strong comparables already. So we don't know where the trend is going to continue, but we have no reason to think it's not going to continue &#x2013; it depends upon what the markets do. I am talking the feel good markets, not &#x2013; we have no reason, not to extrapolate it. On the other hand, we can't extrapolate it because we can't predict what the general market conditions will be. But no there were no one-off sales big-ticket items, is that fair?</p>

So, we'll be tempted. I wouldn't call it tempted. I would say, yes as a strategic move with the right people in place and with the right strategy we will deploy more capital there.</p>

          <p>Organic growth or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:25)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No organic growth. It's difficult &#x2013; I'm not going to bore you with the stages of acquisition, which is euphoria and then disillusionment. And the next thing is looking for somebody to blame for buying the place. But it's not that easy when companies or the companies you want to buy, you can't buy, let me put it to you like that.</p>
          <p>The last question is actually very good question, and I'm glad you asked it. I wouldn't say it's a threat by the Swatch Group. They've been put in a invidious position and the problem with law makers is that they &#x2013; and we all like that, it's the law of unintended consequences. When we do things and we think about things, they are sometimes quite often unintended consequences. So here we have a situation where, yes, the Swatch Group did end up in let's say oligopolistic maybe even monopolistic positions. But that's because they bailed out the Swiss watch industry.</p>
          <p>If it hadn't been for Mr. Hayek senior, I don't think the Swiss mechanical watch making industry would have been in the position that it is today. And I absolutely agree with the late Mr. Hayek and with Nick's irritation as being used as a supermarket by people. I have said earlier on, we've got 21 factories with close on 7,000 people. Our watches bought from obviously the gold and steel, Lange &amp; S&#xF6;hne, being the exception our watches are 100% Swiss, 100% Swiss casing movement.</p>
          <p>Now you get people, and here I am not talking about the great creativity of some of the truly small entrepreneurial people. We need them, brilliant young watchmakers who set up on there. But I am talking about people who come go to Mr. Hayek, have no capital investment. He has to sell movements to them and then they appear as "Swiss Made" with very little Swiss componentry in it. I would have been highly irritated if I had been in &#x2013; and my real problem &#x2013; and this is the real problem. I am not sure whether people have worked out what's going to happen to the costs if we all have to duplicate everything.</p>
          <p>Could you imagine if BMW, Mercedes, the Volkswagen Porsche Group, Jaguar, Peugeot, the wider Fiat Group, if they all had to make their own spark plugs or their own tires, the whole motor car manufacturing business is an assembly business. If you go to BMW or Porsche or Volkswagen or Mercedes-Benz, you go to their factory only about 40% of what you see is actually the company. The other 60% OEMs that have actually moved there. So you make a core part yourself and the rest, you don't go and buy Michelin or Continental or Pirelli. And the watch industry is also an assembly business.</p>
          <p>We all are going to have to make our own hairsprings. We're all going to have to make certain components and, you know, what it's going to price some people out, we're fortunate. We have invested over very many years. We can do it. It will cost us more, but we can do it. The problem is it's going to put Swiss watch making with the strong Swiss franc already at a position where some people are going to say, hang on, we can't sell in dollar zones with these prices. And like what happened in the States, you're going to have some people moving.</p>
          <p>And we've got a watch and <mark type="ph" /> and please here (1:05:46) I'm 100% Swiss. That all the capital we've invested and the jobs we've created here will not be at risk because if people actually moving and creating enough brand equity at a lower cost base, geographic zone.</p>
          <p>You may not even know it. But all C-Class Mercedes-Benz are made in South Africa. The BMW 3 Series they get higher JD Power, you know, JD Power in the United States, ratings because the consumers are buying Mercedes-Benz. They are buying BMW. They are not necessarily buying made in Germany.</p>
          <p>And we've got a watch because I've to look five, 10 years forward that the pressure that has been brought to bear on Mr. Hayek to supply everyone. Firstly, I think it's unfair that people come here with little capital investment and he's got to supply it. I would have &#x2013; if I have been in his position which we try &#x2013; I always try put myself, I would have been upset.</p>
          <p>But secondly, if we all force to do it, it could have cost implications for the Swiss watch industry. If you look at we and I'm not going to mention names, but we do dials for some of the most prominent independent, you wouldn't know it, components. Are they going to have to put up their dial, everybody is going to have to make watches &#x2013; intricate and these are small manufacturers, are they all going to be replicated. It's the law of unintended consequences and I think we will have to revisit this sometime if we wish to keep jobs in Switzerland and keep the Swiss watchmaking industry competitive.</p>
          <p>I'm sorry I went on for longer than, but I really think it is a danger that we should look at now because &#x2013; and I am not blaming the law makers, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:23) the best intensions. The problem is the law of unintended consequences. Is that satisfactory? Okay, sorry.</p>

          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank. Again on your outstanding April sales what do you think was really behind it, was it really an acceleration of the markets or would you say that we have really increased even more your market shares? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly regarding your selling and distribution costs which were up 30% last year, probably a little bit higher than expected at least by the analysts, what would you say would be a good guesstimate for the current financial year, bearing in mind your shop openings plans for the current year?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, you were mentioning the operating leverage which was for the whole Group almost 2, coming from sales through to the EBIT growth, but for Cartier it was roughly 1.5 would you say we should also assume this for the future? Cartier was &#x2013; it is below the Group average or was there anything special about it? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trees don't go up to the sky when you are cruising at more than 30% it's obvious that the operating leverage is less. To come back to April, once again, started very good year &#x2013; very good start to the year, you see April sales driven by retail, okay means that's very good. Of course, it's emphasized and improved by, for example the Baume &amp; Mercier situation because the situation where Baume &amp; Mercier has launched its new products so we are positive of course the impact of Baume &amp; Mercier is that enough to explain that, but okay, it's one of the explanation. Also that we are closing our year end in the end of March, we try to contain our guys &#x2013; to limit &#x2013; not to limit the sales in March, but they play some KPI sometimes and they keep some goods for April.</p>

No, but it's unfair. I said &#x2013; do you think I don't know what you're doing holding back and pushing it across the line, please don't deliver.</p>

          <p>The comparables now in April, it's now getting &#x2013; we actually compared ourselves to 2008, internally, we look at the high point and that's what we look at. I think that's a fairer assessment internally than to compare &#x2013; because we've got to look at three, five year trends, ten year trends.</p>
          <p>And so I wouldn't focus too much and I know you've got tough jobs, I know you've got to try and predict our profits. But you should tell your clients and the market that you can't, because we have no idea.</p>
          <p>And promise you, if I had an idea, I would be in the market. I'd be playing the VIX and I'd be playing the various indices, because it's all dependent upon the general economy.</p>
          <p>We can outperform, but in the end, but here it's not only that, I'll give you an idea. Two or three years ago, when we saw that things were going to get bad, we discussed with our colleagues, not to go for bling-bling, but to go for more discreet watches.</p>
          <p>It's still big to &#x2013; you didn't have, yes &#x2013; but that's one. But to go for more discreet that would be white gold, platinum, flat watches.</p>
          <p>So when the crisis hit, we were ready. And you could see a move towards more discretion, from a feel good factor to a feel guilty factor.</p>
          <p>So you can actually, by making the right decisions in time, do better than the general economy, but not &#x2013; that's our job, that's what you get paid for. But I wouldn't bet on it all the time.</p>
          <p>So it's very, very hard to extrapolate. I'm trying to say, what I said to Jon, which is we have no reason to believe. And when I said dollar &#x2013; we have no reason to believe that it cannot continue on the other &#x2013; on the other hand I cannot say to you, it will either.</p>

          <p>On the expense side, we opened up 59 stores. Even though we opened up 59 stores our underlying sales growth was 14% for the year, on sales growth of 19 constant currency. As I said it at half year, a good ratio to use is whatever you think your sales growth is going to be. I would project the same type of sales growth on the S&amp;D.</p>
          <p>We are investing in stores next year. Last year, we said we would increase by about 5%. We ended up at 7%. As always there is timing, some things come quicker than you would expect, some things go a little slower than you would expect. But we will open up probably the store count will be higher next year, square footage wise probably about 7%.</p>

          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Szilvia Bor Goldman Sachs, three questions from me please. Firstly, could you give us some color on what level of price increases did you manage to boot through in the second half of the year? And whether these price increases were implemented across the whole price architecture?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you mentioned that you are going to spend a significant proportion of CapEx on manufacturing capacity. Could you help us understand what level of capacity increase you expect from these investments in terms of volumes? And thirdly, if you could run us through your store opening plans for the next financial year in terms of geographies that will be great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hit the roof twice in the last week, when they discussed pricing these. I come from an environment, where three people decided when there'd be a price increase <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:17:56) Because the moment people know there is a price increase trade loading takes place and they buy in like crazy, which basically means you're giving the profit away.</p>
          <p>I'm surprised that in the luxury goods industry price increases are widely discussed at various levels, oh, and such and such a date we do a price increase. Now of course, the person, who is in-charge of that sales region whispers it to somebody else you better buy now, because we're going to have a price increase next month.</p>
          <p>And the retailer tells the client, you better buy now because we have a price increase next month. So I basically put people talking about price increases into the freezer. I guess what you're doing is you're giving profits away. We do have pricing power, and if the currencies stay as they are, yes we will have to take a price increase. When? I can't tell you. It may be sooner than they broadcasted to the market, it may be a bit later, we don't know. But I have said to them they got to stop that. We do have the pricing power. The second question was...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The breakdown of the CapEx for the industry?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>So they mainly focus on watches and jewelry because we're still facing and coping with high demand in jewelry especially Bijoux for jewelry and medium jewelry. In CapEx, you've got R&amp;D. So there is a development cost that we have to capitalize. We've got toolings machine and we got also of course an increase of space.</p>
          <p>I would say this fiscal it will be more focused on R&amp;D, machinery to improve as fast as possible the productivity and the capacity while increased space will take some more time and the biggest part will happen next year. Even though this year, for example, we are more or less doubling the capacity of space for our Group, manufacturing of cases <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:27) but we have as a plan for the next year to increase the space as well.</p>

          <p>You know the whole thing can be skewed by the negotiation or renegotiation of one very large tempo. It falls in that year, it's the price to pay. Sorry, another question.</p>

          <p>Yes. Matthias Eifert from MainFirst. I would like to know how much sales you now are generating in Greater China including also Macau and then to the best of your knowledge how much of total sales is now dependent on the Chinese consumer? And then I would like to know from Mr. Rupert his opinion about where do we stand now with the Chinese clientele? Are we just starting to scratch the surface or are we in the middle stage or is it already very developed in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer not to &#x2013; how can I put it. I can if I want to find out exactly who has bought what and where. But it's a little bit like an old style Swiss Bank. We don't know who buys, provided that all the figures &#x2013; all the money laundering rules are observed which we're very tight on. It's not for Richard, Gary or me to know who buys. Quite frankly, we don't know whether the guy buys for himself, for his wife, for his mistress, for his daughter, for his uncle, not his uncle, but and as such you'll notice that the majority of jewelry companies and other send invoices to offices, not to homes.</p>
          <p>And yes, we have a general observation that Chinese, ethnic Chinese have increased dramatically as potential &#x2013; as total clients. But it was interesting seeing Nick Hayek's interview on WatchTime, where he spoke about the American market and he said, what is the American market? Watches sold in America to Americans, if that's the case, it's not that big, his words or South Americans or travelers from Asia onto the West Coast, East Coast. So in the sense, we can observe that in total the Chinese have become very important to us and to the whole of the luxury world. Whether they buy in China, which to me, I would include obviously Hong Kong, Singapore, Macau, Taiwan, ethnic Chinese, yes very, very important. I think Hong Kong is today our second largest city &#x2013; first retail city. It's overtaken Paris.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I add that you often use to say and we can do everything, but by demographic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can fight everything and that's why we will see Chinese being more important than the Japanese because of the demography. So in the end, we are going to have to look at India. If you look at the demographics of India, it is better, than, dare I say, China. Talking after we have retired, but we've got to start thinking now you would have retired.</p>
          <p>But, we've got to think about it now because in 15-20 years time they could have an aging problem. Has China come to its end? I would not say so, it's a very bold person. Have we plateaued? Every day I hear of second and third tier cities that have got the demographics and spending power to open a boutique that I've never heard of in my life.</p>
          <p>I've got to Google the place, find it. When people work hard, firstly, they're smart then they study and then they work hard, they generally tend to take a bigger share of the economic pile than people that do science &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; a political science and sit and debate about the meaning of life for thirty years.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the aging societies will find that places like Vietnam, we've barely scratched the surface of and the parts of South East Asia where we not represented, where we and all of our opponents have not yet touched the surface.</p>
          <p>Few years ago, when I was rather despondent I met with two people one is probably the leader in media worldwide and the other one is the founder of the modern Singapore in separate occasions and they said you've got to remember two things.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the increases in productivity from the "Former Soviet Union" people that have been liberated in the last 15 to 20 years. We forget that it is already 20 years ago from the fall of the Wall. I mean it really &#x2013; if you extrapolate 20 years forward, it's pretty sad, I am 81 but it felt like yesterday when I saw the Wall.</p>
          <p>If you look at the vast economic changes that's going to carry on to produce higher productivity.</p>
          <p>And secondly, whether you call it ChIndia or whether you call it the BRIC countries, their improvements and productivity plus in a number of the countries stole the growth in the population. I would say that we can comfortably rely on more clients in &#x2013; to use the word emerging market is pejorative, it's wrong. In countries that are beginning to get the fruits of their studies in labor. People that have studied and then are working that are getting wealthier.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, we have within their aspirational world and their task is to stay there. I mean, I am going to step on toes now, but I said it to my son, see my task really is to make sure when I grew up, I couldn't afford a Ferrari or car to me an Alfa Romeo, in the late 60s was the dream, a Giulia Super. A BMW, you couldn't pick a girl up &#x2013; I mean look at you, if you drive a BMW, and yet in 40 years time BMW is aspirational and Alfa's gone a long way back. They use the same steel. They use the same glass, leather, plastic, composites, which one this was when I was involved in Mercedes Benz and Chrysler.</p>
          <p>If you take, who are you willing &#x2013; what are you willing to pay more for? If you use the same steel and leather and that's why we're talking about the brand equity and the previous question from the lady there about pricing power.</p>
          <p>And if you want to get fired in this group, I'm not talking about ethics then you start picking low hanging fruit and you start selling things that are easy to sell which in 10 years time will wreck the brand. Maurizio Gucci was never given enough credit for cleaning Gucci up, but he did with the help of Dawn Mello before Tom Ford and others got there, because Gucci had lost its &#x2013; Gucci had lost by picking low ending fruit, they tightened it up, they cleaned it up, they made it aspirational.</p>
          <p>So when I listen to poor Gary and poor Richard, who have the difficult task, done great unbelievable job, but who have the difficult task of trying to explain margins to you. It's not the echo. The echo starts with the product committee, where we have executives that have retired us the current executives and the future executives.</p>
          <p>The previous people there when some youngster comes up with an idea, can say, look by the way, it was tried in 1993, go and have a look at that file, you will see what happened. And the youngsters can say to the current management, you're not going to do that, because you're going to make a hell of a have a lot of money, two years before your retirement. And I am stuck with the thing that I can't sell.</p>
          <p>So there is bright corner one hand for picking low-hanging fruit, but that's really where the future growth is determined. It's where all the products, all the communication and it's maison by maison. There is no commingling, but that's where we try to create the products with integrity that we can sell in the emerging or should I say in the new &#x2013; the new successes of the world.</p>
          <p>And the fascinating thing is that this is no longer geographic. This is psychographic. If you have a highly successful 28 year old lady, whether she is in Shanghai or Saint Francisco or New York or Paris or London, you take top of the mind awareness. It's not geographically confined. It's transversal, today it physiographic.</p>
          <p>If you look at NET-A-PORTER and by different things all over the world. So, if you are in a sweet spot where you've managed to remain through to your D&amp;A and where you are aspirational, you should be able to withstand regional mishaps in terms of the economy. I'd like to be more precise in my answer, but I am afraid that's the reality. Are there anymore questions? Yes, Jon, come on now Jon give me a break, man, I've had a long week, okay.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have a couple of questions, on the &#x2013; so the watch, Baume &amp; Mercier was a H2 event I know as we move forward into April, we should expect the margins to come back to where they were in H1 last year, that's my first question? And then, just coming back actually to the jewelry, I know you mentioned the leverage &#x2013; but again H2 the jewelry margin was off 5 points. I know there is communication et cetera. But there also seems a bit of a decline in H2 and I am wondering what you think will happen as we go forward. Because I am starting to put everything together with the &#x2013; you're talking about increasing your selling and distribution expenses in line with sales. You could see maybe a little bit of gross margin improvement this year. I am just trying to sort of build a picture where we should be thinking about the margin for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jon did I win my bet or not? I said to my son, there are three or four guys and I have to &#x2013; I hate to admit those who are very smart will ask these bloody probing questions and then we've got a shadow box and things and duck and dive and we don't know, and it's the honest truth. And please don't think we're incompetent by saying that. But you should not look at a quarter &#x2013; if three or four big players decide that their wives &#x2013; second and third and fourth wives are not buying high jewelry this month. I was with somebody recently, who proudly told me that he buys $50 million worth of Cartier every year. So, I don't know. It's not for me to know.</p>
          <p>Now, if he buys &#x2013; if he decides to buy that or not, I mean they &#x2013; so you have high ticket items that jump across lines that can tend on a short-term basis, short-term basis to distort the number.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously the huge charge for B&amp;M will not reoccur in the first half. And we are confident that that's on the right track, so I think we are hopefully finished with all of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I asked George Kern, let's be blunt. I asked George Kern and I said what would you do if you had to make the calls, so he came up with three ideas. And the only input I had was there is friend of mine at home that South Africans are now Big Scot Burger. Always when we sit and, we've taken some crayfish out and we drink a glass of wine, they say folks, life is about moments. And that's the only contribution I made to the campaign life is about moment. It's hit the sweet spot.</p>
          <p>The products we saw last Friday are going to hit the sweet spots. How long it's going to take? Three-years, I don't know. But I am happy that it's hit the sweet spot. But don't say this year, the points are going move by 2 basis points, I don't know. I genuinely don't know. But we did clean it up, so there is a technical buyback and again I made the call, we don't buyback it's going to land up in the gray market. So I said take the stuff back and destroy that had an impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me &#x2013; because they have to understand why. No, no, no I am serious because otherwise it's part of brand equity, because if you go and you find watches that retailers can't sell on the gray market. Because we produce the wrong stuff, it's not the retailers' fault or the consumers' fault. We produced the wrong stuff and then when it didn't sell, we did deals together to enter the trade.</p>
          <p>We now have far greater visibility because we've got a number of search tools. I'm not going to go into the details but believe me Dr. Mostert and his team. We actually are in the back end of servers of some of the bigger search engine companies in the world. So we actually find the gray marketers and contraband diary and the fights. So we can see whether there is proper sell-through or not, you can pick it up as much as it hurts me. There is something worse than being copied and being fight. It's not being copied than not being fight. That means there is a market for it. So it's a disaster when you walk in, you see this launch this product is fight. But there is something worse nobody wants to fight it because it's so bad. So we took a bunch of this old stock, we cleaned the market up. And I said to Gary, just we could have sold it on a &#x2013; in a website somewhere I suppose, but in the end you are basically not doing your consumers a service that actually are buying the product. So, I guess the good news that Gary can say we took the charge, we cleaned the market, is that...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>That's accurate. And then Jon, I think, okay sales you've heard us talk about sales. Currencies are an issue at the moment. I mean if you have a view on that I think you have to take a view.</p>
