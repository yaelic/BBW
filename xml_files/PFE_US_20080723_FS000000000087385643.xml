        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter 2008 performance.  I am here with Jeff Kindler, Chairman and CEO; Frank D'Amelio, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our senior management team.  The financial charts that will be presented on this call can be viewed on our home page at www.pfizer.com in the Investor Presentations tab by clicking on the link Quarterly Corporate Performance &#x2013; Second Quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>We know this is a busy day for many of you and our conference call will last an hour and we will end at noon.  As we would like to hear from as many of you as we can in this time, we ask that you limit your questions to just one question please.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I would like to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.</p>
          <p>Also the discussions during this conference call will include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated July 23, 2008.  These reports are available on our website at www.pfizer.com in the "Investors &#x2013; SEC Filings" section.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Jeff Kindler.  Jeff?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chuck and hello everyone.  I'd like to welcome Chuck to Pfizer along with Amy Schulman, our new General Counsel who is here this morning and who joined us just last month.  It's great to have you both onboard.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with our second quarter financial performance, especially at this time of great uncertainty in the world economy and capital markets and significant challenges in our industry.  Pfizer continues to be on track to deliver the revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance that we set out for 2008.  Our Pharmaceutical and Animal Health businesses grew at a healthy rate this quarter and our cost reduction efforts remained solidly on track with our second quarter adjusted total costs decreasing by 475 million compared to the year-ago quarter, excluding foreign exchange.  In short, we are doing what we said we would do.</p>
          <p>As you know, the U.S. pharmaceutical market continues to be challenged &#x2013; challenging given the regulatory environment, generic competition, payer pressures and an uncertain political environment.  But despite this and despite the loss of U.S. exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar which collectively decreased revenues by approximately $500 million during the quarter, our U.S. revenues in the quarter nevertheless declined by only 2% versus the previous year.  Without these LOE [Loss of Exclusivity] products, our U.S. Pharmaceutical business actually increased by 10%.</p>
          <p>In this tough U.S. marketplace, we have six products outperforming the branded competition, Chantix, Aricept, Lyrica, Spiriva, Rebif and Sutent as well as four more mature inline products successfully defending their positions against newer agents, Viagra, Xalatan, Lipitor, and Geodon.</p>
          <p>Bottom line, there is certainly more work to be done but we are more than holding our own against the competition in a particularly challenging U.S. environment.  Meanwhile outside the United States, we have one of the strongest global footprints and broadest portfolios in the industry, now accounting for more than half of our total revenues.  Revenues from international markets grew a solid 5% this quarter compared to last year even before the benefit of foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Our primary growth strategy around the world is to refocus and optimize our patent-protected portfolio of both marketed medicines and compounds in development.  In that connection, the agreement we made with Ranbaxy this quarter brings substantial certainty that a generic version of Lipitor won't be introduced in the U.S. for another nearly three and a half years.  While the lipid-lowering market is one of the world's most challenging, Lipitor is holding its own as we continue to fight for market share and to press the essential message that Lipitor has no generic or branded equivalent.</p>
          <p>Pfizer is far more than Lipitor of course and our year-to-date results show positive trends for a number of key medicines in our patent-protected portfolio.  Lyrica is up 50% year-to-date with growth driven by strong efficacy in managing nerve pain associated with diabetes and shingles as well as in managing fibromyalgia which increasingly is being understood as a serious and debilitating disease.  Revenues for our cancer agent, Sutent, were up 62% year-to-date.  Currently Sutent's international growth is outpacing its growth in the U.S. where it has been available longer.  That said, we are pursuing additional indications for Sutent and conducting Phase III trials for patients with breast, colorectal, and lung cancer among others.  Sutent represents our commitment to emerge quickly as a leader in fighting cancer.</p>
          <p>To advance that goal, we created this quarter a dedicated global Oncology Business Unit within our Pharmaceutical segment led by Garry Nicholson, formerly the Head of Lilly's U.S. Oncology Business Unit.  This unit will serve as the single point of accountability for Pfizer's worldwide oncology business, in keeping with our commitment to reorganize into more focused and agile business units.</p>
          <p>And of course, we'd all prefer to prevent cancer and heart disease than to have to treat them.  And that's why smoking cessation is so important.  Smoking is expected to be the largest preventable cause of death in this century with some estimates that the toll may be one billion people.  There are few things that provide greater health benefits than quitting smoking.  And our innovative smoking cessation aid, Chantix, is an effective option for those who want to quit.  In fact, we get letters day-after-day from patients who had given up all hope of quitting smoking until they used Chantix.  Its global sales grew 3% this quarter compared with the same period a year-ago.  Strong international growth was largely offset by a 35% decline in U.S. revenues which was due mainly to labeling changes and to external reports about adverse events.</p>
          <p>Let me be clear.  We believe that Chantix labeling appropriately reflects the medication's risks and benefits and we will continue to encourage doctors and patients to have a robust dialogue about the dangers of smoking and appropriate treatment options.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we're seeing strong performance among other important brands.  So far this year, Geodon is up 20%, Viagra is up 13%, Xalatan is up 12%, and Celebrex is also up 12%.  In addition, we continue to look for new opportunities for our inline medicines.  We recently launched Champix in Japan where we also earned approval for Sutent for certain types of cancer and submitted Lyrica for nerve pain after shingles.  And in Europe last month, we launched the product we licensed from Schwarz Pharma called Toviaz (fesoterodine) to treat overactive bladder.</p>
          <p>Efforts like these extend the lifecycles of our inline medicines complementing our R&amp;D work on new compounds.  In that connection, we also continue to make steady progress advancing one of the most robust pipelines in the industry.  In our R&amp;D labs, we are looking to significantly increase our return on invested capital by making smart and focused decisions, including, where appropriate, exiting certain areas of activity.</p>
          <p>And we are seeing progress in productivity.  Since our last pipeline update in March, we have begun Phase III development of five new molecular entities and product line extensions.  We now have 20 Phase III projects underway.  A noteworthy example is CP-751871, a biologic discovered by Pfizer and proposed for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.  We advanced apixaban, our development project with Bristol-Myers Squibb into a Phase III study for treatment of venous thromboembolism.</p>
          <p>In addition to line extensions to maximize the value of Geodon and Celebrex, we also added Thelin, a once-daily oral treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is already approved in Europe, Canada and Australia.  It was acquired through our purchase of Encysive.  In addition, we expect seven Phase III oncology studies in 2008 with two already open and enrolling, reflecting Pfizer's commitment to oncology which currently accounts for 22% of our R&amp;D budget.</p>
          <p>One of the milestones this quarter was the license agreement with AVANT for CDX-110, a Phase II oncology vaccine candidate for the treatment of brain cancer.  We continue to move ahead on our goal of 15 to 20 Phase III starts this year or next with the objective of having 24 to 28 compounds in Phase III by the end of next year.  We are on track to meet this.</p>
          <p>An important research initiative this quarter was the establishment of the Pfizer Regenerative Medicine unit, which will provide us with new targets, new tools and ultimately new therapies across a number of disease areas including Alzheimer's disease, cancer and other debilitating disorders.</p>
          <p>Now just as our R&amp;D work is shaping Pfizer's future, changes in our business strategy are shaping the future as well.  The fast growth of Pfizer's business outside the United States points to significant potential in emerging markets where we have set a goal of outpacing market growth which is expected to be 11% per year between now and 2012, the year after Lipitor loses exclusivity.  In addition by then, we aim to be the number one pharmaceutical company by revenues in six of our seven top priority emerging markets, namely Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, South Korea and Turkey.</p>
          <p>The competitive advantages of our broad portfolio of established products and our strong global footprint lie at the heart of our strategy to grow in emerging markets, many of which have more than half of their total sales being driven by established products compared to about 12% in the United States.  To understand the potential of these markets for Pfizer, consider the fact that $80 billion in new revenues from increased use of established products is expected between now and 2012 and we currently have about a 4% share.  There is an enormous opportunity here for us to take a greater share of this growth over the next three to five years.</p>
          <p>Steady execution of all of this commercial R&amp;D and strategic work demonstrates that Pfizer is continuing to change and change fast, a new culture of innovation and continuous improvement is shaping a new, leaner and smarter Pfizer.  Throughout the company we have new smaller, more accountable business units which have been given much more freedom to innovate.  Over the past two years while building an outstanding management team, we've challenged colleagues to think differently, to work differently, and to examine our business in new ways and from all angles, but especially from that of the customer.  We've shaped a new corporate culture that is cost conscious where employees are encouraged to think and act like entrepreneurs.  These efforts are supported by our financial strength, a competitive advantage that allows us to balance our strategic needs while meeting our financial commitments.</p>
          <p>We've also kept our commitment to greater candor and transparency.  Just this past quarter we stood alone in reforming the way we would finance continuing medical education in the United States to remove any appearance of conflict of interest.  We began to build a strong new presence in biotherapeutics, made progress in rebuilding our pipeline, particularly in the late stages, streamlined our manufacturing, attracted a new generation of leaders to Pfizer, and created the path forward for our future.</p>
          <p>The hard work is far from over and it will be never truly be over.  But in this quarter's results we see some reflection of our hard work and one more important step in doing what we said we would do, build a Pfizer that can and will succeed.</p>
          <p>And now for the financial details, please welcome Frank D'Amelio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jeff.  Good morning everyone.  The charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast and will help facilitate the discussion of our second quarter 2008 results.</p>
          <p>Now let me get to our financials.  Today, we reported revenues for the second quarter 2008 of 12.1 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year which reflects the positive impact of foreign exchange which increased revenues by approximately 800 million or 7% and our performance of many key products, which more than offset the negative impact of revenue declines resulting from the loss of exclusivity in 2008 for Zyrtec whose revenues decreased 377 million and Camptosar whose revenues decreased 104 million.</p>
          <p>Reported net income increased year-over-year by 119% to 2.8 billion in the second quarter and reported diluted EPS of $0.41 increased 128%.  These increases were primarily driven by lower restructuring charges related to our cost reduction initiatives as well as savings resulting from these initiatives, the positive impact of foreign exchange and favorable income tax adjustments related to the sale of Esperion and favorable tax settlements which were partially offset by increased in-process R&amp;D expenses associated with the acquisitions of Serenex and Encysive Pharmaceuticals which closed during the quarter and the impact from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for certain products.</p>
          <p>We generated adjusted income of 3.7 billion in the second quarter; an increase of 26% year-over-year and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.55, an increase of 31% driven by the savings resulting from our cost reduction initiatives, the positive impact of foreign exchange, the non-recurrence of the one-time '07 payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in connection with our collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban and tax settlements which more than offset the impact from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for certain products.  Both reported and adjusted diluted EPS in the second quarter were favorably impacted by the full year benefit of our 10 billion share repurchase in 2007.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter of 2008, we repurchased approximately $500 million or 26.4 million shares of our common stock.  I'd also like to point out that our debt level at the end of the second quarter decreased sequentially by approximately 400 million, notwithstanding our dividend payment, share repurchases, and the funding of our operations.  We had several significant items included in our reported results this quarter.  More detailed disclosures will be provided in our Form 10-Q filing with the SEC.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we incurred 562 million in restructuring charges compared with $1 billion in the prior year quarter.  This significant decrease was driven by greater restructuring charges associated with employee-related costs in the year-ago quarter.  We also incurred 405 million of implementation costs compared with 317 million in the prior year quarter, primarily related to sites we exited or are in the process of exiting.  These implementation amounts are reported in cost of sales, R&amp;D, SI&amp;A expenses, and other income deductions and are detailed more fully in the supplemental information accompanying the release.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to provide more details regarding our second quarter adjusted income components.  Adjusted revenues were 12.1 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year.  Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 16.9% versus 17% in the prior year quarter notwithstanding less favorable geographic mix and the impact of foreign exchange.  Excluding foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 16.1%.</p>
          <p>Adjusted SI&amp;A expenses were 3.7 billion, a decrease of 1% year-over-year reflecting a decrease in marketing expenses which more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange.  Adjusted R&amp;D expenses were 1.9 billion, a decrease of 8% year-over-year due primarily to realized savings resulting from our cost reduction initiatives and the non-recurrence of the one-time payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb in '07 associated with our collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate on adjusted income for the quarter was 20% versus 22.2% in the year-ago quarter due to favorable tax settlements.  Our EPS growth is outpacing our revenue growth which clearly reflects positive leverage.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to provide a mid-year update on our adjusted results.  Revenues increased 2% to 24 billion in the first half of 2008 compared with the prior year period driven by the solid performance of many key products.  First half revenues reflect the favorable impact of foreign exchange which increased revenues by approximately 1.4 billion or 6% which was offset by the negative impact of the loss of U.S. exclusivity of Norvasc in 2007 and Camptosar and Zyrtec in 2008 which collectively decreased revenues by 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue for the first half was 16.1% compared with 15.4% in the prior year period, primarily due to less favorable geographic mix and the negative impact of foreign exchange.  Excluding foreign exchange, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the first half of the year was 15.3%.</p>
          <p>Adjusted SI&amp;A expenses increased 1% in the first half compared with the prior year period and adjusted R&amp;D expenses decreased 4%.  We posted adjusted income of 7.8 billion in the first half of 2008, an increase of 1% compared to prior year period and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.15, an increase of 5%, reflecting the benefit of savings associated with our cost reduction initiatives, the positive impact of foreign exchange, the non-recurrence of the one-time '07 payment to Bristol-Myers Squibb, favorable income tax adjustments, and our share repurchases in 2007, which were offset by the impact from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for certain products.</p>
          <p>As I previously mentioned, this quarter foreign exchange increased revenues by approximately 800 million or 7%.  We continued to achieve cost reductions this quarter and our ongoing cost reduction initiatives continue to have a positive impact on our results.  That said foreign exchange continued to have an unfavorable impact on our cost and expenses this quarter.  Overall, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted adjusted total cost by approximately $440 million or 6% this quarter compared with the prior year quarter.  Excluding foreign exchange, our adjusted total cost decreased operationally by approximately $475 million or 6% year-over-year.  The net effect of foreign exchange on our adjusted diluted EPS during the second quarter as compared with the year-ago quarter was a positive impact of $0.04.  This positive impact was not incremental to our EPS guidance since the guidance we provided in January of '08 and reiterated during the second quarter was given at current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress against our objective to reduce absolute adjusted total cost by at least 1.5 to $2 billion at the end of '08 compared with '06 on a constant currency basis.  To date we have achieved a cumulative operational cost reduction of 1.2 billion.  We expect to achieve much of the remaining reduction in the fourth quarter which will favorably impact that quarter's adjusted diluted EPS.</p>
          <p>I want to point out that we expect to achieve this reduction even after absorbing inflation, which adds approximately $1 billion to adjusted total cost annually and reinvesting in our business.  While our cost reduction initiatives will continue to reduce absolute cost for the balance of 2008, the timing of the realization of these reductions is also a function of spending patterns in both '06 and '08.  The spending level in the fourth quarter of '06 was higher than usual due to establishing research collaborations with third parties and sales and marketing investments in international markets.  By comparison, quarterly spending patterns in '08 have been and are expected to be more consistent with historical norms.  Because of the different spending levels between '06 and '08, much of the remainder of our absolute cost reduction target will be achieved in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Our cost reduction initiatives continue to span essentially all divisions, functions, markets, and sites across Pfizer.  Broad categories of activity include manufacturing and research site exits, outsourcing and targeted workforce reductions such as our ongoing previously announced European field force reduction.</p>
          <p>We reduced our global network of manufacturing plants from 78 four years ago to 54 currently.  By the end of '09, we expect to further reduce this global network to 44.  As part of this effort, we recently announced our decision to cease operations at our Terre Haute facility by the middle of '09.  We also recently announced the spin-off of our R&amp;D laboratory in Nagoya, Japan.  We're continuing to exit the three remaining R&amp;D sites of the six that have been identified for closure.</p>
          <p>Also, we have a wide array of outsourcing opportunities in various stages of implementation.  Manufacturing, logistics, finance, facilities, legal and IT are among the functions contributing to financial and operational benefits of this strategy.  Finally, we're continuing to match our workforce level with the current market.  Over the past 18 months, our workforce level has decreased by 13,500 to 84,500 as of June 29th of '08 from 98,000 at the end of 2006.  And as a result of recent actions this month, our current level is approximately 84,100.</p>
          <p>All key inline and new product revenues increased in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period.  Lipitor revenues increased 9% year-over-year to approximately $3 billion, including the positive impact of foreign exchange which increased revenues by approximately 170 million or 6%.  Year-over-year, Lipitor revenues in the U.S. increased 1% and revenues from international markets increased 18%.</p>
          <p>Lyrica continued to deliver strong performance with revenues of 614 million, an increase of 52% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Sutent, our treatment for advanced kidney cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors posted revenues of 211 million, an increase of 45% compared with the year-ago quarter.  I want to point out that while Sutent revenues in the U.S. declined 2% year-over-year during the second quarter, first half U.S. revenues increased 10% versus the prior year period.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year, Chantix revenues increased 3% to 207 million.  As Jeff stated, Chantix results reflect the negative impact resulting from updates to the U.S. label to include additional safety information as well as from certain external events.  As a result, U.S. revenues decreased 35% year-over-year to $109 million.  That said, Chantix continued to perform well outside the U.S.  Chantix revenues from international markets grew 197% year-over-year to 98 million.  As we expected, revenues from products that recently lost U.S. exclusivity declined year-over-year with Norvasc declining 2% to 627 million, Camptosar declining 43% to 137 million and Zyrtec declining 98% to $8 million.</p>
          <p>Today, we are reaffirming full year 2008 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance.  As a result of the significant unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on adjusted cost of sales in the first half of '08, we are tightening our guidance on the lower end of the range.  We currently expect adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be between 15 and 15.5% compared with our previous expectation of 14.5 to 15.5%.  We continue to be on track to achieve the reduction in absolute adjusted total costs of at least 1.5 to $2 billion at the end of '08 compared with '06 on a constant currency basis.  As I previously stated, we have achieved 1.2 billion of the targeted reduction to-date.  We expect the balance of this reduction to gain momentum throughout second half of the year with much of the remaining savings to be realized in the fourth quarter which will favorably impact that quarter's adjusted diluted EPS.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are updating our guidance on our 2008 effective tax rate.  We now expect the effective tax rate on adjusted income for the year to be between 21.5 to 22% versus our previous expectation of 22 to 22.5%.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize the key takeaways, we are reaffirming our '08 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance.  We continue to see steady growth in several key products including Lyrica, Geodon, Viagra, Celebrex and Sutent.  As we expected, this quarter's results were negatively impacted with the decline in revenues from the loss of U.S. exclusivity of Zyrtec and Camptosar.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to execute and make progress on our cost reduction initiatives, on track to achieve our adjusted total cost reduction target.  To-date, we have achieved 1.2 billion in adjusted total cost reductions.  We expect to realize the majority of the remaining cost reductions in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are pleased with the solid results that we delivered in the second quarter, including the benefit of our cost reduction initiatives.  Our EPS growth this quarter outpaced our revenue growth demonstrating the benefit of these initiatives to our bottom line.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn it back over to Chuck.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question.  Largely financial related questions, free cash flow Frank, in first quarter and second quarter, can you just share what the free cash flow was?</p>
          <p>Second part has to do with price and volume, what that contributed to growth?</p>
          <p>And then the third question just has to do with sequential borrowings, they went up by about 3 billion to 9 billion.  Can you just share with us a look or provide a little color on the use of those funds?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure John.  So operating cash flow in Q1 was 3.3 billion and Q2 will be part of the Q that we file in a few weeks.</p>
          <p>In terms of price, volume, and foreign exchange for Q2 price was down 2%, volume was up 4%, and then foreign exchange we got benefit of 7% which is the 800 million that I alluded to in my comments.</p>
          <p>And then on the third item, which was borrowing, let me just run the numbers, at the beginning of the year we had about 13 billion in debt.  At the end of last quarter we had about 17 billion.  At the end of this past quarter, we had about 16.5 and I am rounding that's about 400 million down quarter-over-quarter and that 400 million decrease was while we purchased $500 million of our stock.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much.  There is obviously a significant market opportunity for the JAK 3 for rheumatoid arthritis but there has been some investor noise about its toxicity profile.  I was hoping that you could walk us through the JAK 3 side effects and tell us what to focus on at ACR in October?</p>
          <p>And then separately if you could just discuss Sutent's U.S. trends in more detail?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Okay.  Martin, do you want to take the first part of that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly happy to.  Thank you for the question.  As you correctly say, JAK 3 continues very well in Phase II.  We will report out at the ACR Meeting later this year and obviously we'll report out on both efficacy and side effects.  Given the mechanism as we've discussed before, we know the side effects to look for in the clinical trials.  We are monitoring those very carefully.  Given those as we published in the Phase IIa data that we published some time ago, we are really very pleased with the side effect profile of the compound and that continues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, on the Sutent second quarter, so second quarter down 2%, first semester up 10.  I'd like to point out the U.S., I suppose your question was directed at the U.S. and our share is 56% in RCC and 88 in second line for GIST.  So we are not satisfied with the 56% share in the U.S., and we need to advance our share there by focusing on Sutent's efficacy and keeping patients on therapy at the appropriate dose throughout all treatment cycles.  One of the key programs when you use on that or data, is the two-year survival data recently presented at the 2008 ASCO, where our survival data represented the longest median overall survival to date of any agent in first line settings.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and then just overall, Sutent sales globally for the quarter were up 45% year-over-year.  And then outside the U.S., internationally, they were up 80% year-over-year.  So that's a product that is doing well in the U.S. and continues to do very well outside of the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Frank.  And next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  The next question is from Roopesh Patel from UBS.  Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  My question is on U.S. Lipitor sales.  I was wondering if you could help us reconcile the 20% sequential decline in U.S. Lipitor sales versus the first quarter with the 3% drop in prescriptions that have been reported over the same period.  My understanding was that inventory levels were normal when exiting the first quarter, there have been no price increases over the course of the second quarter.  So if you could just help us there?</p>
          <p>And then separately, what impact do you expect the recent reporting of Vytorin's SEAS trial to have on the cholesterol market growth and on Lipitor?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Roopesh.  I'll let Ian take both of those questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we normally have fluctuations between first and second quarter, difficult to reconcile those.  So just look at the first semester for Lipitor, where sales growth was down 11%, pricing was basically flat between price increase and rebates and the net of market growth and share was down about 16 and the differential between that and the 11 is driven partly by increased number of units bought per TRX and partly via normalization of the inventory level at the end of '08.</p>
          <p>Vis-&#xE0;-vis the Vytorin trial, I think it's too early to tell the impact on market growth and certainly what we are focusing on is Lipitor's positioning at getting to goal, the efficacy across the dosage range, our safety and our landmark trials.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning in the spirit of greater, cleaner transparency, which I applaud, Jeff, can you tell us the split of targets for absolute adjusted total cost savings in terms of U.S. versus non-U.S.?  You gave us a target of 1.5 to 2 billion by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And I was wondering also you mentioned &#x2013; you used the phrase, at least in the press release, and I'd love to know what the magnitude of upside might be to that in your optimistication of the share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I am sorry I didn't completely understand the second question, Catherine.  The upside of cost you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, the target 1.5 to 2 billion. In the press release it says at least 1.5 to 2 billion can be achieved, so I am wondering what the magnitude of upside might be for those targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll let Frank take both of those questions, Catherine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Catherine, let me do it this way.  In the release, we said we've achieved 1.2 billion to date.  If you look at the rhythm in terms of what we've done there, it was 600 million in '07, 170 million in Q1 and then 465 million in Q2, we haven't provided details on that relative to U.S/non-U.S. but know that those savings and the target of 1.5 to 2 are global in nature.  They reflect actions that are being taken both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., kind of point one.</p>
          <p>In terms of the second question, with the at least language, we are at 1.2 and our job is to do as much as we can relative to the range.  So understand, when we get to 1.5 we are not going to stop.  We are going to deliver as much as we can to get as high into the range as we possibly can.  In terms of what's available above and beyond the range, my answer is we're at 1.2.  We will get every dollar we possibly can and we'll get that by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  The next question is from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.  Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Tim.  Hello Tim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi.  Can you talk about Pfizer's potential interest to get into the generics business beyond what you currently do with Greenstone?  Glaxo today announced that they will sell branded generics in emerging markets and Sanofi is trying to buy Zentiva.  And there was talk that you guys were looking at Ranbaxy fairly recently.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on Lyrica, sales have been pretty flat in the U.S. for the last three quarters and recently new prescriptions looked like they are actually trending down and I am wondering if you can address what might be going on in the U.S. market specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tim, I'll take the first one and let Ian take the second one.  As you know, the established product strategy is a very important one and important enough that we established, pardon the pun, a business unit specifically focused on that and led by Dave Simmons who has tremendous experience in those parts of the world where established products continue to retain brand equity and we can drive sales based on physician and patient preferences.  And Norvasc this quarter actually is not a bad example of that and we're still experiencing good sales even on a product like that that's lost exclusivity in a lot of markets.</p>
          <p>The established opportunity, if you put aside products that are just going off-patent and flipping from the patent protected to the established marketplace and just look at organic growth, just volume increases, it's a $80 billion opportunity by the time Lipitor goes off-patent.  We currently have a 4% share of that.  We believe that we have a unique set of competitive advantages to increase that share and to exploit that market.  And those include the breadth of our therapeutic portfolio and product portfolio which is very important in those markets and our geographic presence.  We've been in these markets a very, very long time and we have established relationships with key opinion leaders and the like and we really think there are very, very few companies that are going to be able to compete the way we compete in those markets.  And those markets are more than just China, Tim, there's emerging markets in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia.  But if you just look at Asia and I am talking about more than China, that is an opportunity that goes from 47 billion to 80 billion by 2012 and our current share is 4%.  We have a goal of increasing that share by the time Lipitor goes off-patent.  And just to take China as an example, we said in our March 5th meeting that we are going to increase our field force presence from 110 cities to 126 by the end of the year.  We've already achieved that goal.  So now we have raised the bar and we are going to be in 137 cities by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So this is a tremendous opportunity for us and to answer your specific question, we've been clear that all of our strategies are going to be supplemented by appropriate business development and we'll look at opportunities for enhancing our ability to compete and win in the established markets and the emerging markets.  We really think this is a big winner for us and a big opportunity and we're already seeing early signs of success in the way that we focused on it.</p>
          <p>The second question was about Lyrica progress, so I'll turn that over to Ian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Tim, I just want to go back on the data.  We did, in fact, grow in the quarter 52% with Lyrica.  If I look at the script trends, I can't really validate the data you gave.  I see sequential growth in TRX's quarter-on-quarter.  That being said, I acknowledge they are slower than they were post the fibromyalgia launch, their growth.  So the game plan for us really is to further grow leadership by being a treatment of choice in DPN and PHN.  And there is very low diagnosis and treatment rates in those two conditions and we do have a good market share already in about 30% in those conditions and are the treatment of choice.  And in fibromyalgia, we continue to develop that market.  There's about 6 million patients that suffer from fibromyalgia.  Only 22% are diagnosed and that requires market development, so optimistic about the performance going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, just a couple quick questions.  First, on Lyrica, just what are your expectations on any potential label change for the drug given the recent FDA panel on the epilepsy class in general?</p>
          <p>On Chantix, I've just got &#x2013; I was happy to see the international sales kind of hanging in there as much as they had given what's happened in the U.S.  Can you talk a little bit about the feedback you are getting on the drug ex-U.S?  Are you expecting a delayed reaction to some of the safety concerns or just generally speaking of these markets less sensitive to that type of news than we see in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And then maybe just finally, just generally speaking, we've seen across the industry a number of therapeutic categories in the U.S. with weaker than expected volume growth this year, just with higher co-pays and a weak economy, just interested in your thoughts in general, are we seeing more economic sensitivity to the prescription pharma market in the U.S. than maybe historically?  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, Lyrica, we are pleased with the recommendation from the Advisory Committee of the FDA and we'll await the final decision from the FDA but it was a pretty strong positive vote from the Advisory Committee, vis-&#xE0;-vis not putting a black box on.  Secondly, I think your discussion was Chantix vis-&#xE0;-vis...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>International, you've got to realize that there are two factors going in international.  Number one the label changes have not been anyway near as dramatic as in the U.S. with the EMEA taking a different view than perhaps the FDA took.  A rollout that is slower internationally as the market penetration is not as fast when you launch internationally.  So you'll see a sort of more consistent growth pattern internationally.  So I think those are the two differentiations, the international vis-&#xE0;-vis the U.S on Chantix.  And then the third one was...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was the affect of the U.S. economy given co-pays and...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're seeing &#x2013; you're seeing a slow up in the U.S market growth rate.  I think the IMF came out with a report on that and undoubtedly is affected by the way managed care has shifted higher co-pays.  It is I think a factor.  A report came out from Kaiser which indicates that scripts are not being filled or pills are being split due to the economic pressures that are being caused by these co-pays.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One think I'd just add to that Chris is that one of the trends that's starting to emerge which is a very positive one is that employers, large companies, that are concerned about healthcare cost and the long-term health of their employees are beginning to see the value of reducing and even in some cases eliminating co-pays in order to improve adherence to medicines and actually increase the adoption of medicines.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  A couple strategic questions Jeff directed to you and then one for Martin.  I believe late last year or earlier this year you had added Bill Ringo to Strategy and/or BD [Business Development] and I am curious if Strategy and BD has actually changed its direction and if you can share with us if in fact it has, if you can share with us maybe directionally where that may be heading?</p>
          <p>And second, you ticked off a number of or a list of &#x2013; I am going to say completed items that you and your management team have done over the past couple of years.  In particular, the issues around cost reduction, the issues of trying to force more into Phase III, et cetera.  I am curious where you may be turning your focus or your attention today or perhaps over the next six to 12 months and that is to say is that an increasing opportunity internationally, is that the direction?</p>
          <p>And then for Martin, well, there has been reference to obviously JAK 3 kinase inhibitor, there's been a reference to apixaban.  Some excitement on those couple of products but if in fact Pfizer is to have 24 to 28 Phase III products by the end of 2009, could you actually name two or three others that again you tend to be most excited about in the portfolio?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Tony.  Actually, the two questions you posed to me I think are quite related.  We did bring in Bill Ringo.  He has now been here I think a couple of months at most and he is already making a big difference because he has vast experience in our industry, not just at Lilly but at Biotech and Venture Capital and he is incredibly well respected and well known figure in the bio-pharmaceutical industry in general.  And he is bringing a sharper focus on execution of the strategies.</p>
          <p>And the broader point about strategies that you raised, we've laid out, I think quite clearly, our growth strategies and we've also said that all of them are going to be augmented and as appropriate supplemented by business development.  And what we are focused on now is execution.  I think we've seen evidence in this quarter that we're beginning to really see some results from a sharp focus on the execution of our strategies.  By the foundational changes that we made over the last couple years in terms of leadership and structure and the rest of it I think has set a strong foundation that we're now beginning to capitalize on.  And as you know, those strategies range from advancing the pipeline which you mentioned.  We've talked about international and established and emerging markets.  We've talked about getting more out of our inline portfolio.  And all of these things will continue to be supplemented by business development and Bill is off to a great start, assessing the opportunities and helping us move forward and he is a great addition to our team beyond that position that he holds, but also by virtue of his real terrific experience and knowledge of our industry.</p>
          <p>And I'll turn it over to Martin for the other question that Tony asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Tony.  Clearly, you mentioned the JAK 3 inhibitor and apixaban, which we're very exited about.  I would name another couple I will be presenting data on shortly that we have equal excitement about.  The IGF-1R antibody for non-small cell lung carcinoma just went into Phase III.  We're ahead in this game of this particular mechanism and antibody and we're very pleased with the results we're seeing.</p>
          <p>Another one that we published recently and will give further publications on later in the year is tanezumab which is the NGF antibody that was discovered by Rinat &#x2013; part of the Rinat acquisition in pain.  And we described our results at EULAR around six weeks ago and again we'll be showing more results and be looking to push that into Phase III in a very short timeframe.  There are some other NC Phase II that we're pleased about, the sulopenem antibacterial, and clearly we continue to work on the DPP IV mechanism.</p>
          <p>Just one other area I'd mention though and that goes to product enhancements, which you will remember I spoke about as our golden asset.  If I think about our oncology pipeline alone, I think about the work that we're doing in Sutent, we're already in Phase III with breast, lung and colorectal and will be following up very shortly into Phase III with the passive cellular carcinoma and hormone refractory prostate cancer.  And these results continue unabated.  With axitinib we have Phase II studies in renal cell carcinoma and others.  So, really just to wrap up Tony, we have a very exciting Phase II/Phase III pipeline emerging.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>How are you?  I had a question about emerging markets but I think you've gone through a lot of that but maybe also just following along with that, Jeff, it seems as though there has been a lot of work necessary to be done in the organization to restructure the organization, to change the culture, to bring in people.  And is it fair to look at this in sort of a step function approach over a continuum looking out towards the Lipitor patent expiration?</p>
          <p>And some of the things that you've talked about having accomplished, it seems as though a lot of those things are well in motion.  You've brought in your new team.  Would it be appropriate given that that we would be &#x2013; we should be looking for the next step to be a lot more business development driven to bolt-on to the kinds of changes that have already been put in place but maybe improve the foundation from which you're working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me try to answer it this way, Barbara.  I think as you point out, we have made a lot of progress in establishing a very strong foundation for success.  I am extremely pleased with how much progress we've made in that regard in a very short period of time.  That work is never over but to your point, we are in a very good position now in terms of our leadership team, our culture, out organization.  We'll always be continuing to improve all that but we're moving forward and we're executing.  We outlined our five growth strategies, we've outlined our cost approach and we are all about executing against those strategies and as I said before, where appropriate, supplementing them with business development.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Thanks for taking the question.  Question is actually on tanezumab, the OA product that you showed data on at EULAR and for the Alzheimer's compound.  Regarding tanezumab, I think it was an IV dosing and it was every eight weeks, is that what you anticipate going forward with in Phase III or is there a subcu [subcutaneous] dose in the works?</p>
          <p>And then regarding the Alzheimer's program and the ICAD data coming up, you have Phase II data being presented for your RAGE antagonist and some Phase I data for the anti-amyloid monoclonal.  How rapidly can you move these forward and can you just talk to general enthusiasm about those programs?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for the question.  Martin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, happy to do that, Bert.  Certainly the eight-week dosing was very successful in the data that we looked at and we will be pushing that into Phase III.  We will obviously be looking at other formulations that help physicians and patients also.  So that's very much on the card.  Clearly, it was very important to get the positive proof-of-concept with this mechanism and also the good data that we showed.  That opens up several possibilities for this antibody now, not only in OA actually but we're also extending our studies in terms of looking at other pain indications.  And as you can probably tell, I am particularly excited about this one.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Alzheimer's approaches, again we have built up a quite a nice portfolio albeit early. You mentioned two in particular, the amyloid antibody and the RAGE program and again we are very excited about both of those.  They are early though and this is a tough area to work in.  We are certainly &#x2013; I will push these through.  You mentioned specifically how we can push them through fast.  As I think every one knows, we brought Briggs Morrison in at the back end of last year to run our Clinical Development Group and he has just had a laser focus on accelerating all our late stage programs and has had actually terrific success so far.  And certainly, the Alzheimer's approaches are very much in his mind.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just have a couple more to follow-up.  First on Lipitor, I know a lot of different questions came up but I think this is the first quarter that Lipitor international sales have exceeded the U.S. sales and I am interested just if there's any more color about what the mix is of those revenues between the more protected versus the less protected markets?  And just how we should think about relative size of those pieces growing versus whether there might be some patent risk over the coming years there?</p>
          <p>Secondly, as we watch the Chantix prescriptions end up with pressure having to do, of course primarily with the questions that have come out around safety, but is there also something happening here where the number of patients that can be penetrated and take the drug, I think at one point when it was at its peak, something like 4 or 5% of smokers were on it.  So, what is the portion of the market that actually is willing to quit because once you have taken it for whether it might be three or six months, you would tend to lose the successful patients.  Of course, it's a good thing for public health but it does impact scripts.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, alliance revenues, very strong line item and if you can give any &#x2013; but has a lot of pieces in it, could you give any particular granularity around some of the pieces, that are doing particularly well or areas that need a little extra focus?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start.  I think Frank's going to give you some numbers on the Lipitor piece and then Ian will give some commentary on that and Ian will address your Chantix questions and then to the alliance revenue, I think both Frank and Ian will have some thoughts to say.  So, go ahead Frank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the Lipitor revenues, Jim let me just run the numbers and what I'll do is make the point you made, but I'll do it with numbers and convert it to percentages.  So for the quarter, Lipitor revenues were about 3 billion, 2.976 billion.  They were up 9% from the prior year quarter, 2,719.  Now to your point, of that 3 billion, 1.4 billion was in the U.S. and I am rounding, 1.6 billion was outside the U.S., which resulted in a percentage of mix 47% in the U.S., 53% outside the U.S. which is the basis of the question.  Ian, just wanted to frame the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, we're seeing operational growth outside of the U.S. and I don't have the exact numbers.  But I mean we see growth in Asia, we see it in Latin America, and we're seeing it in Europe.  And especially in Europe, it's with further past genericization, the Simva entry.  And we're focusing on the high risk patients, the high doses and we are driving operational growth which is what our strategy is both in the U.S. and globally.  So it's good to see that working internationally.</p>
          <p>Vis-&#xE0;-vis, Chantix, it is number one cause of preventable death and this medicine is highly efficacious.  And just looking at the U.S., specifically, I am taking these numbers from memory, I think we identified 54 million smokers who were in the pool to quit, of which there was a segment which we'd call immature, not yet ready to quit and about 24 million that were either motivated or could be motivated to quit.  And we've treated, I think, globally something like 5 million.  So clearly there is a huge reservoir of patients that need to quit and there are social pressures and educational pressures making aware of the need to quit.  And, so I am not deeply concerned about exhausting the supply of available patients as yet.  The real key is motivating them to get to see a physician.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good.  Frank is going to comment on alliance revenues</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and then Jim on alliance revenues, look I'll just run the numbers again and then I will answer the question.  So, for the quarter alliance revenues were up about 44%, 563 versus about 393 Q2 '08/Q2 '07.  Year-to-date, it's roughly about 32, 33%, call it 1.050 billion over 790 year-over-year.  And if you look at what's driving some of the positives there, Spiriva and Aricept are really two of the products that are driving what's going on relative to the rhythm of the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Ian, do you want to highlight any of the particular alliance products or I guess Frank covered it.  Okay, we have time for one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  The next question is from Seamus Fernandez with Leerink Swann.  Please proceed with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  So, just a couple of quick questions both for actually Martin Mackay.  Martin, can you just give us an update on the timing of the UPLIFT study for Spiriva and when you expect that to report out?</p>
          <p>And then separately, on the anti-NGF antibody, were the Phase II studies here prospectively designed specifically for the pain signal that you saw and if not how do you plan to address this before you move into Phase III?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Spiriva UPLIFT, the data will be shown at the EHF in October later this year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the NGF antibody, yes, it was prospectively designed for the pain we saw.  Obviously we had Phase I data and Phase II data to look at in that respect and that will continue in terms of the Phase III studies.  And as I mentioned earlier, we are also now looking at other pain indications for this antibody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Martin and thank you everyone for taking time out of what I know is a busy day for all of you.  Thanks very much and have a good day.</p>
