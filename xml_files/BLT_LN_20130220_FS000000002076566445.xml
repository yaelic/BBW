      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am now handing you over to the host of today's call, BHP Billiton's Chief Executive Officer, Marius Kloppers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Welcome to our teleconference that follows the release of our December 2012 interim results. My apologies that at the half year, the time zones just make it very difficult for us to cover both time zones at the same time.</p>
          <p>I'm speaking to you from Sydney, and Graham Kerr, our CFO, is in London, and I would also like to welcome Andrew MacKenzie who is here with me in Sydney, and I'd like to again congratulate him on his election. I will talk a little bit about Andrew's election in due course, but would, in the first instance, like to just recap and summarize the presentation that I made this morning.</p>
          <p>We believe that we've had strong results in what has been a more challenging environment overall for the industry. We are delivering on commitments that we've made. We've had strong and predictable results, and in particular, we want to reaffirm our previous production guidance. We would like to profile as the ones that noticed the changing environment first, and we'd like to present today $1.9 billion of controllable cash cost savings, which is the start of a cost reduction program underpinned by having started earlier than our peer group. Our major projects remain on schedule and budget. We've continued to simplify an already simple portfolio and we have a positive outlook for the business.</p>
          <p>With regards to financial performance, the first half of our financial year was characterized by slowing growth and at some times, anxiety over where China was heading. Prices were volatile and currencies, our producer currencies were strong. The offsets that we were able to achieve in terms of cost savings were not enough to outweigh the negative impact of the reduced price and increased producer currencies.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we've had strong results. Underlying EBITDA declined by 29% to $13.2 billion, underlying EBIT by 38% to $9.8 billion, and attributable profit by 58% to $4.2 billion. And that number is inclusive of exceptional items totaling $1.4 billion. And we have a good run on getting good prices in our portfolio simplification with $4.3 billion of divestments either announced or completed at prices above what the market ascribes to the assets that were being marketing.</p>
          <p>Like our production guidance, our capital and exploration expenditure of $12.2 billion in the half was exactly on plan. Our full year guidance is again unchanged at $22 billion.</p>
          <p>Our 20 projects are all on schedule and budget. There is no change in the guidance that the majority of them will come on production before the end of our 2015 financial year. And gearing remains within the parameters of our single A &#x2013; strong single A rating. And we've declared an interim dividend of $0.57 per share, extending the unbroken track record of our progressive dividend.</p>
          <p>So the overall message on the half is that we had price that was not supported, currencies that were not supported. Nevertheless, we were able to affect some offsets by cost savings and volume increases, and we've performed well on those things that we can control: safety, volume and costs.</p>
          <p>Let me just then say a few words on succession and once again congratulate Andrew. Obviously, we feel proud of the long-term approach we take to leadership development and succession. It's a very, very important job. In that context, my preparation and the team for eventual succession started five and a half years ago. I recruited Andrew virtually on day one, took a little bit a persuasion. And in that period <mark type="ph" /> that has past, (04:52) we've made some portfolio changes to the various team members in order to stretch and develop them fully. We've brought on some supernumerary members a year or so &#x2013; a little over a year ago in order to, again, take the next step in succession. And today, we've completed that process.</p>
          <p>I met Andrew in a joint venture context. I gave him a call following a very positive interaction on that joint venture issue that we were trying to solve. I gave him a call almost as soon as I became CEO. He trusted me enough to say yes, and then went on to go set our 12 month <mark type="indiscernible" /> (05:43). So there's a really deep relationship here.</p>
          <p>Andrew has run the non-ferrous business with aplomb and has got distinguishment in that he has got such deep experience in both the oil and gas and minerals experience. So, I will invite Andrew to make a few comments towards the end of this discussion. But I think that it's appropriate that at this point in time we move to questions. If you could as always state your name and then address the questions to me in the first instance, I will pass some of them to Graham as appropriate.</p>
          <p>So, operator, can I have the first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question today comes from the line of Jason Fairclough from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jason, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. And first, I did want to congratulate Andrew on his appointment, and Marius, best of luck to you in your future endeavors. Two quick questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two quick ones from me. First on Jansen, it doesn't get much mention today in the release, save for the fact that construction of the shafts is underway and the project still does remain subject to board approval. I guess I'm left wondering, how much money can you spend on a project that isn't board-approved?</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be for Andrew. I guess given that -- your background at BP, could you give some thoughts on BHP strategy for oil and gas and whether at the margin you might think about tweaking that? And specifically I'm thinking about the mix in capital allocation here between offshore and then onshore U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jason, we're not going to give Andrew any strategic questions today. There is ample opportunity for that, but the purpose of this call is to cover the results. Andy will make a few comments at the end, and obviously, we will be doing the rounds just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:48).</p>
          <p>On Jansen, the reason that's relatively underemphasized is that there is no imminent approval. We are going to go through full year results before that project is slated to be approved. I can confirm that technically the process is &#x2013; project is tracking very well. And there is no update on the approvals and the preapprovals that we've given previously. We are tracking within the envelope of the approvals that we've made before.</p>
          <p>So apologies for not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...being able to turn this into a Q&amp;A session for Andrew specifically today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. All right. Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question today comes from the line of Kieran Daly of Macquarie. Kieran, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yes, good morning and I just reiterate those congratulations all around as well. And my &#x2013; it's quite clear from the presentation that copper is obviously a very much preferred commodity of BHP's in the medium to long term. Now, you obviously Escondida is a key part of that strategy in the short to medium term with getting back up to 1.3 million tons. And if Olympic Dam doesn't get the approval, and it's obviously a long lead time project in any case, it looks like you've got a bit of a gap in your portfolio in terms of copper growth in that medium to long term, in the absence of Olympic Dam. How do you think about that? Would you agree with that comment? What are you guys doing perhaps to fill that apparent gap in the portfolio?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is &#x2013; you talked a lot about, in the presentation, about copper, iron ore, aluminium and so on, and it's quite clear aluminium and nickel are obviously non-core. But two commodities that sort of drop to the bottom of the list, are manganese and thermal coal. And I just wonder if you could just remind us of your strategic thinking about those two commodities in terms of your portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kieran. In terms of copper, I'd probably first comment that we've still got a project that is being ramped up because we are full in as much as we can at this stage execute. And that's obviously the Spence Hypogene project. And we forget that that is a very material project that is waiting there and obviously then the Escondida projects.</p>
          <p>And then, what is now I think, <mark type="ph" /> from memory, (10:31) the world's third largest copper mine, which is Antamina, the expansion sequence there is continuing. So, I think we shouldn't underestimate the potential of the core ore bodies that they've still got ahead of them for incremental expansions. However, Andrew's exploration program that he has running now obviously will continue to run in a different sense, has been almost wholly focused on copper and will continue to be focused on copper.</p>
          <p>In terms of manganese and thermal coal, manganese is a joint venture with Anglo American, so obviously there are a different set of foundry conditions on the two assets, Australia, South Africa that we run there. Not something we have announced any imminent plans.</p>
          <p>On thermal coal, I think on balance, we see that a little bit the same as the iron ore business where at some point in time, the thermal coal markets plateau and decline. And therefore, the marching orders for the thermal coal people is to maximize the value of their current asset set, notably by investments in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:48) energy coal.</p>
          <p>I think on balance, we should see over time, some of the smaller coal mines or coal properties within the portfolio continue the rationalization path that we've been on for basically the last 10 years. And you've seen that most recently with the Navajo mine sale that we're contemplating in &#x2013; or busy executing in New Mexico. And you should see, Kieran, I think on balance, thermal coal over time, continue to play a smaller role in the overall product mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just going back to manganese, Marius, in terms of the commodity itself, how do see that commodity in terms of the supply/demand fundamentals going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kieran, not as brief on most recent things, but generally, we view that as a business with slightly lower barriers to entry than some of our other businesses, but a business in which we own the definitive profit generating asset in GEMCO. And that really is, in our mind, going to continue to be the mainstay of the earnings. And we probably feel that the Australian asset &#x2013; sorry, the South African assets will continue to be constrained through power and rail allocations, so not a lot of growth envisaged in particular in that part of the portfolio, nor, however, have we got any rationalization plans at this stage that have been announced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much, Marius.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And today's next question comes from the line of Sam Catalano of Nomura. Sam, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening, Marius. Two questions. You've mentioned, I guess BHP a year ago as at the forefront of the change in focus with regards to pushing capital efficiency, cost cutting and these sorts of measures. At some point -- it's obviously been reflected in many of your peers over the last 12 months also. So at some point in the future, acquisitions or accelerating some of that capital becomes potentially benefits to a first mover in that sort of environment as well. What signs would BHP look for to potentially slightly alter in terms of the approach towards that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sam, I think for now, our guidance is unchanged to what we had when I last discussed with you, that on balance, we see CapEx trending downwards next year. We would like to &#x2013; not that we're uncomfortable with our gearing level, but on balance, we would like to pay down our capital to a certain extent &#x2013; I mean, pay down debt to a certain extent.</p>
          <p>And I think that as you engage with Andrew going forward, I think that you will hear him say that he has got an even sharper focus on the assets in the portfolio. So all in all, we probably feel that we've got plenty to chew on. We're probably at capacity in terms of what we can execute, both in terms of workload and balance sheet and we probably feel that the 10% growth rate, which we will have over the next &#x2013; this year and next, is higher than the trend growth which we'd previously indicated as somewhere in the order of 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marius.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question today comes from the line of Menno Sanderse from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Menno at Morgan Stanley, just a quick question on met coal. You had a weak first half in terms of earnings despite the ramp-up in volumes. Is the company taking additional cost measures in the next six to 12 months to try and rectify that? And secondly, are you seeing any change in <mark type="ph" /> vibes (15:53) from the Australian government with respect to <mark type="ph" /> expectation (15:56) which you mentioned earlier today as being one of the culprits of the poor results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think let's first talk about the structural costs that we've added to grow <mark type="ph" /> to the royalty cost (16:06). I think we've had, from memory, between carbon taxes and greater royalties and some others tweaks and adjustments in what we pay government tariff, on the order of $18 of cost increase &#x2013; structural cost increase per ton given our product mix. Those costs are just an additional <mark type="ph" /> end cost (16:27).</p>
          <p>If we look at the freight &#x2013; sorry, the start-up related costs and the volume constrained-related costs, we are seeing the progress there being very rapid in reversing those trends. And then I would point you to one line in the full transcript, which is posted on our Web site, which specifically notes that we expect in the second half progress in the met coal business. And there is also a comment from me that says we have every expectation that this business is going to be a good business at today's prices, given what we're seeing.</p>
          <p>I should also note that the position we were in for the first half is exactly to the guidance that we gave before. There is no surprise in the result that we declared today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Menno.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Rob Clifford of Deutsche Bank. Rob, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good evening, gents. I've got two questions, firstly, just on CapEx of $12 billion, operating costs closed at $6 billion, so it's pretty difficult for your operations to live within their means this period. What timeframe are you expecting to be able to make those two meet, so the operations live within their means?</p>
          <p>And the second, just on Navajo Coal, I know it's reasonably small but the potential transfer of that, the thinking behind that, is that to do with indigenization or is it a comment on your view on U.S. coal or is there some deal to be done around your partnership with Resolution in there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Navajo Coal basically is a business where given the trajectory that the U.S. coal business is on already delivers the majority of the value by way of royalty to the Navajo nation. And what we're actually doing here is we're selling the residual that we have in the mine and putting all of the economic rent in one set of hands, for which it's a very worthwhile exercise to do.</p>
          <p>It's probably a little subscale in terms of an operation to run for us for the Navajo, which make up 85% of the workforce, from memory. This is clearly a different issue. But it is &#x2013; the value there is related to the future of coal generation, the future of renewal of coal generation permits and the future of the growth in coal generation in the U.S. that are all constrained.</p>
          <p>It's got nothing to do with any other aspect of the business, but the fact that it's dropped below <mark type="ph" /> scale (19:15) level and that there is a logical internalizer of the residual value that we still hold there.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, no change from what we said last time. Obviously, with the speed with which prices have come on &#x2013; come off, and the fact that the average project lasts for three or four years, if you've got a very dramatic price change such as we've seen, you're not going to shut down project &#x2013; good projects in execution to get to a live-within-your-means situation in any given year.</p>
          <p>However, I have every expectation that as we go forward over the next year or two, we are going to, all else being equal, target a budgeting cycle this year, which we normally do, a detailed two-year budget, which has as a base case, getting to a breakeven or slightly reducing of the debt levels on the balance sheet in that plan. And that's more or less the broad planning parameters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. And best of luck to you both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And today's next question comes from Amos Fletcher of Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I just had two questions, firstly on the cash flow side. I noticed you had a $1.2 billion build in working capital despite commodity prices generally falling during the period. And also your cash tax bill of $4.3 billion was materially higher than the P&amp;L charge. I was wondering if you could explain the reasons behind that?</p>
          <p>And my second question is just are you prepared to put a number on a cost cutting target over the next year or two? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me answer the second part first. We said that we would like to keep our costs, firstly, flat in U.S.-denominated cash cost per copper unit. We have achieved that excluding restructuring costs, which we have transparently outlined today. Our unit, U.S. dollar cash cost was down about 2.5%. Obviously we would like to go further and again, as you guys engage with Andrew, I'm sure that you're going to hear how he is going to continue to engage on that target &#x2013; sorry, on that endeavor.</p>
          <p>Our approach here is traceable savings. So, we want to give you a methodology to trace it off a given base, which is what we tried to do today and we'd like to focus on delivered results as opposed to putting a big target out there. Our approach is also, in the third instance, to exclude costs that are largely not in our control from that target, for example, royalties and energy, even though those effects this past were favorable for us and would have pushed the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion or $2.3 billion, from memory, because essentially we don't control them.</p>
          <p>So, we are laser-focused on getting the controllable costs down. And obviously what you've seen here is that we've kept business development costs, exploration costs, consistent with the fact that we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:03) portfolio. You've seen the comment that we have already removed, in crude terms, bums on seats, 20% of all of the overhead that we carried 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>So, we push on. Obviously, now comes the next phase of the cost savings, which is to have the reduced personnel application that we've got following those reductions flow through a full half of costs. Obviously, we were cutting gearing in the half so on a run rate basis we're there, but we'll see the first impact of that in the next half. And then continue to do two more things: one, attack the fixed cost base; and two, dilute the fixed cost base as we ramp up the production of the businesses.</p>
          <p>In terms of the taxable, your tax payments on a cash basis always lag your receipts. So in a falling market what you're doing is you're paying tax of the higher revenues of the previous six months, roughly speaking. So, on the detailed drill in into the working capital, made &#x2013; which are once-off in nature, perhaps I can ask Graham to just quickly give us a rundown and a drawdown on that. Graham if you may?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly can, Marius. Probably when we talk about the tax &#x2013; we'll come back to the working capital &#x2013; two aspects on the tax, there is certainly the aspect in terms of the timing of the payment, and the payment related to when we're making more profit in the corresponding period. But, I think the second thing to note in this period, we obviously had a number of exceptions that we spoke about that basically are coming from the tax expense number and have lowered the tax expense number on the P&amp;L. So that drives the primary difference between tax paid and what we're actually showing on the P&amp;L for the period.</p>
          <p>The second question that was around working capital, really it reflects $1 billion in terms of time of inventory, and also creditors. And to be honest, that's just really timing that we expect to unwind over the next period. So nothing structurally different.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Graham, if I may just add, what Mike Henry is targeting is <mark type="ph" /> a fall (25:49) on the revenue side of the business, a reduction in the days of credit extended and a reduction in the physical inventories. And tracking his progress, we believe it's to plan. Please understand, though, that given the large lumpy nature of our CapEx programs, the amount of working capital that you've got tied up at any snapshot in time, varies quite a bit. But if I look at the underlying overdues, receivables, and so on in the company, I think what you're looking at it is a once-off effect here and we're going to give that &#x2013; we're going to apply every power that we have to get that cash back.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very well, Marius. Thank you very much. Parts of my questions have already been answered but maybe just to sort of follow on, is the cost &#x2013; two parts. The cost savings, is the just under $2 billion annualized cost savings, is that your ultimate target or is there a higher one that can be achievable? And the second part is, given that the met coal industry is suffering from the current prices, if prices stay at these levels for the next couple of years, what do you see as the main response there by the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me pass the first part of that question to Graham and let me ask -- then answer, when he's completed that I'll talk a little bit about met coal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marius. Peter, I mean, to answer your question on costs, I mean what we're really focused on as part of this results presentation is being very clear on focusing on actual results, and being very clear on focusing on transparency. And as you rightly point out, for the period we had a $944 million saving in what we call controllable cash cost savings. On an annualized basis, that is $1.9 billion. That's predominantly made up of operating efficiencies, reduction in overheads and we're also reducing our exploration and business development costs &#x2013; sorry, exploration and business development costs.</p>
          <p>As Marius alluded to in his speech last night, I mean the focus this year has almost been on &#x2013; been the, basically on normalizing our costs, it's -- now the focus going forward is basically how do we reduce that cost going further. So, while we're not certainly committed to targets in terms of publicly, you should expect us to continue to move in that space and drive down our costs. But what we're being very clear about as part of this results presentation is telling you what we've done today rather than focusing on aspirational targets.</p>
          <p>But the trend going forward is to basically bend the trend and continue the rage on costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the met coal question, I think, perhaps two comments, demand is very dependent on met coal imports in China. And that will be a large determinant of the overall supply/demand balance. Second part is perhaps in terms of our cost structures, we were not as impacted as much as some of the other Australian producers by the recent trends. And so, we feel that we're in reasonably good shape there. And I think that just if I can reiterate our own push here in our met coal business is just very, very hard on costs and we should see some considerable impact there over the next six months.</p>
          <p>As to the broader industry, probably I think that the Australian industry, particularly those players with weaker quality of coking coal, we believe is going to continue to remain under pressure, as is the broader Australian energy coal industry, unless the exchange rate moves here, which doesn't seem that likely at the moment. Thank you, Peter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, Marius. Good morning, Andrew and congratulations for the new role and congratulations, Marius for your tenure during these volatile years. Three questions, if I may. First one was related to a couple of market comments around disposals, potentially the Gregory complex and also the Pinto Valley in copper, if you could maybe comment there.</p>
          <p>Second one, which is more of an accounting one, would you say at this point there is still a risk of a further write-down in your shale assets depending on the methodology you're using?</p>
          <p>And lastly, I was wondering in your fairly cautious view on the iron ore outlook, where does India picture in the near term? I think you had more positive comments on that lately. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, no updates on Gregory and Pinto Valley. Obviously, we've made some filings which have been picked up by the media and interpreted. We're looking for value in those assets. If we get value, we will act. If we don't get value, we don't, in line with the approach on the other assets.</p>
          <p>On gas, obviously, we believe that we've done our homework. We've just reappraised those assets and now, I should point that the price of gas when we did the &#x2013; the impairment was considerably lower than the price now, so obviously, any like-for-like comparison now would give actually a unbalanced or higher value than the value that we calculated at the time that the impairments were made.</p>
          <p>Now, on iron ore, I think without wanting to speculate on price, we probably have on the order of about half GDP growth rate in China flowing through pig iron demand. That equates to, let's call it, 4% also of steel growth this year, maybe 3-1/2% in China, on the order of 60 million tons or so of incremental iron ore needed, probably 100 million tons or so being delivered.</p>
          <p>If the plans, which are reasonably advanced, go through, those tons are predominantly backend loaded, so I think I can understand why the market is saying that the iron ore price will be firm upfront and weaker at the back end of the year. And we probably don't question the way that the market is backwardating that price at the moment. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I have three quick questions as well if I may. Just in terms of the succession planning, Marius, you seem too young to retire. But just looking back over the last few years, what do you see as your greatest achievement, what do you regret most and what advice would you give to Andrew? And then secondly, just on the expiration of spending cuts, is that going to impact gross longer term or do you just believe that some of these geologists have got overzealous with spending over the last few years and it just needs to be reined in and it will not impact growth? And just on the cost cutting as well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We perhaps just got to stop there. I'm going to lose track of all of the questions. So, let me just try and answer that. Yes, I'm leaving because clearly Andrew has given me all of the advice that he had to impart. I think that Andrew has been a part of every decision that's been made here. I have really no parting quotes of wisdom here. We've had five years to equalize the databases between the two of us on our thoughts.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; what has changed, I think that we've got a more productive relationship between buyers and sellers in the iron ore business, at the same time as giving sellers, which have the information asymmetry here, a more clear class for their product. That's a pretty profound change, which again, I wouldn't take credit for, the marketers did that. But it did happen in the last five years.</p>
          <p>We comprehensively outperformed our peer group. Again, I don't think that it's ascribable to me nor is it in full ascribable to the team or teams. A lot of it goes back to the people that left us the legacy. But we did have a not perfect decision making, but clearly better decision making than our peers, if we look at the total shareholder return in particular.</p>
          <p>For me, lastly, I cannot have any conversation about performance without talking about safety. 20% reduction in greenhouse gas, almost a 40% reduction in injury rates and certainly from a decade or so ago, about a 75% reduction in fatalities. Those things don't come without better accountability, better sustainability &#x2013; sorry, better standardization of process and better planning and execution. Again, I suspect that you're going to hear Andrew say a lot about that going forward.</p>
          <p>Next point on exploration. Most of our exploration spend on the minerals side is actually brownfield exploration. These are the types of drilling that we do around the existing ore bodies in order to bring minerals that are in inventory into a readily exploitable form. Clearly, we've slowed down the rate of CapEx growth, therefore you can slow down as a knock-on effect, the rate at which you mature the tenement. That is the main impact on the exploration spend and actually on &#x2013; and we've had on the greenfield side one or two programs finish up, such as potash in Ethiopia. But the main game, which is the main copper programs, are actually completely untouched in this exercise. And copper is the one product that really, from an exploration focus, we need to continue to add to the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we should think about them as being sustainable and not impacting the growth longer term?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just a question on your U.S. onshore. <mark type="ph" /> As you said (37:31) the past couple of periods, the OpEx has risen quite markedly, so is that likely to sustain or can we expect some improvement there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, our target, starting at our two-year plan was really to take a very large resource that we bought, continue to invest in the most remunerative piece of that, which is the oil side, gradually expand the size of the business to where it can carry its own depreciation, that's kind of the immediate target for this year, get to an EBIT place where it carries all of its costs and then the next year strongly move into an EBIT positive territory.</p>
          <p>We are on track and perhaps lost in the fog of figures is that there was quite a considerable inventory of drilled and completed wells. It's close to 100 at the period end which was waiting on infrastructure. So true to form, while Marc probably wouldn't like us to count the chickens before they're hatched, we're probably slightly ahead of targets in drilling and about on target for infrastructure, which means that we've put a little bit more drilling into inventory in that business which will manifest as increased production going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. It's James Gurry here from Credit Suisse. Thanks, guys. Just on the CapEx, the charts are indicating a pretty rapid drop-off over the next couple of years, especially when you look forward to 2015. So depending on commodity prices, there is scope to approve projects after this financial year. Can you just tell me how you're going to prioritize the potential projects including the <mark type="ph" /> low capital intense id (39:35) iron ore, the Spence Hypogene and of course the Jansen potash project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I've heard some of our peers talk about a top-down process in order to do this job on capital allocation and on cost reduction. Yes, our approach is 180-degrees different from that. For us, everything flows through great systems that create great transparency and data and flows bottom up.</p>
          <p>We're in the middle of what I would call a stack and rank exercise in our capital and basically &#x2013; it's not a single number exercise, so it's not only return, it is also risk, technical risk, geographical risk, product market risk, <mark type="ph" /> envelope of spread and so on, (40:31) but ultimately we get to a situation where bottom up stack and rank exercise gets done. We then overlay what we believe our balance sheet capacity is and our cash generation capacity is, and we <mark type="ph" /> cut the bubble (40:48) at the place where the two intersect.</p>
          <p>I think last year, I said that the projects that had the highest return, that just didn't make it in was Cannington and probably Spence Hypogene on the copper side. I think Jimmy Wilson in iron ore has got every endeavor to &#x2013; or every desire to present an iron ore project that will kick those projects out of the sequence.</p>
          <p>So, once &#x2013; until those numbers come in for the various projects and until we've done that stack and rank exercise, I can't tell you exactly what will be in and out, but I think Andrew will look forward to at our full year results, which is just after we've completed that assessment, to give you chapter and verse on what's in and what's out.</p>
          <p>But you put your finger on the projects that are going to be working very hard to get in the sequence on the brownfield side, Cannington, Spence Hypogene and the Inner Harbour projects.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I would like to ask two questions, if I may. First is an accounting kind of question, which is on your royalty-related taxation. Net of the $150 million one-time effect, it seems it's down about 10% year-on-year, even though your EBIT from the petroleum business is down like 20%. So, I'm just wondering if there is anything else which kept the stats artificially high in the current period apart from the $150 million that you have already announced.</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you please...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just answer that question first or not answer it by passing it to Graham. It's just, it's very, very difficult for us to answer multiple questions. Please, guys, if you could please just ask one question at a time, we'll try and endeavor as many as possible. So Graham, the accounting question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just hear the question again? It broke up a little bit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. So, if I look at your royalties and look at tax, ignoring the $150 million revaluation effect, it's down 10% year-on-year, while your EBIT from petroleum, which is one of the key drivers of this tax, is down 20%. So, I'm just wondering if there is anything else which has moved dramatically to change this royalty-related tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I think we're careful that when we're talking about the taxes, the royalty-related tax is predominantly related to the Australian taxes and they're related to the petroleum industry to a lesser extent, but also the minerals tax. On the petroleum side, we're talking about the PRRT which applies to our Australian assets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, sure. It's an unrelated one, it's on the U.S. shale effort, basically is it possible to give a separate cost guidance for your cost of production for liquids as well as gas? And the reason why I ask it is that it appears that as the proportion of liquids in your production mix has increased, it seems that your costs have also gone up and that's why you had an EBIT loss in this six month period and also in the second half of last fiscal, so any hints that you could provide there will be helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the question. It was just a quick one on the iron ore division, particularly West Australian cost performance. Looks like unit cost certainly, at the level that we can assess them, were up kind of 3% to 4% half-on-half, which compares relatively unfavorably with some of the peers operating out there. Could you maybe talk about particular &#x2013; any particular challenges you faced during the period, what was driving that and how you expect, in particular, the iron ore division unit cost profile to trend over the remainder of the fiscal year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We did have about close to $200 million of extra costs embedded in the iron ore cost this half which is associated with expansions. I think that basically if you take that out, then calculate the unit cost, because it's really starting up a new mine which is not yet in production, we believe that the iron ore business is well on track to get the same sort of 20% reduction in overhead that we've indicated for all of the businesses. And overall, we believe that the iron ore business will follow the same cost reduction trajectory as the other Australian businesses. So, we do believe that there is more to come there. But this half is distorted by the fact that we've had a lot of <mark type="ph" /> new kit (46:45) including a new mine being started up.</p>

          <p>Just a question. I guess reading between the lines in terms of your market outlook you seem to be getting perhaps a little bit more bearish towards China, saying that demand is moderating particularly on <mark type="ph" /> early cycle (47:15) commodities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm just wondering is that a sort of a change for you? And also, potentially, you're saying you're seeing a pickup in Europe and the U.S. I'm just wondering whether you can give us some magnitude of that? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Heath, we've not made any adjustments in ultimate steel intensity nor have we made any adjustments in the steel intensity per unit of GDP. We still believe it's sort of at that half level. So if the growth rate of China is 8%, the steel growth rate will be 4%; if it's 7%, it's 3.5% and so on. That's more or less what's in the model for the moment. So far, I think that our internal forecast for steel production this year, I think it was within 0.1% of where the actual ended up for the year when I asked Mike Henry. So we were very, very close.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to give the next couple of facts with a health warning that we never make forecasts. I think if you ask our marketers what will happen, they will probably say that the Chinese market will on balance be slightly undersupplied in the first half and slightly oversupplied in the second half. No major insights there because that is effectively what the iron ore price says as well. However, what you should read between the line on the China comments is perhaps one thing that is quite pointed. We have some investors where every time China goes through a bit of a blip, believes that it will fall off a cliff. And our belief is that the government then steps in with monetary and infrastructure policy to step it up to its target level of growth.</p>
          <p>In the same way, as soon as it goes much over its target level of growth, the government steps in and removes those steps, whereas some of our investors whenever it goes down they extrapolate downwards, and whenever it goes up they extrapolate upwards. They've been extrapolating upwards more at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now having said that, we do believe, and our internal forecasts are for quite strong steel production figures over the next months as they catch up after the winter break. And so please, please don't take my comments in that &#x2013; we believe that steel production will move on quite strongly over the next months from the levels that we've seen to-date.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Marius, and just perhaps a second question, just back on your balance sheet. Obviously, you drew down about $7 billion of debt in the half and all things being equal, with some reversal of capital gains and taxes you described before, you're still going to draw down debt probably at the same sort of level in the second half. So, are we right in assuming that debt levels are probably going to go up by $4 billion to $5 billion in the second half?</p>
          <p>And then just in terms of your portfolio rationalization and asset sales in that, I mean, is that something you are looking to sort of increase in the second half of the year or during 2013 as a whole to effectively bridge that gap and are you willing to put a number on that sort of portfolio divestment that you could ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Heath. Let me make few comments about cash flow. We clearly had the working capital impact that Graham has already discussed, which we hope will reverse and we have every intention to reverse that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, some of the cash money from the divestitures have not slowed. We've recognized, in some cases one half of the accounting leg, but not the other half. For example, Browse would be one and the &#x2013; EKATI is another one. We've recognized, in EKATI for example, the impairment but the cash hasn't flowed.</p>
          <p>So in the next half, the cash flow &#x2013; the cash inflow from the assets that we've sold should be quite strong. We should reverse the working capital. And if you look at the guidance we have also got about $2 billion more CapEx guidance in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. All of these things will play in, but again, James has got a few additional points to make on that which will enable you to model the second half a little bit better. Suffice it to say we don't believe that the level of drawdown is at the level that you've just indicated. So I don't know if that helps.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We probably need to conclude the questioning. I know that Andrew was &#x2013; we're running out of time here, we have some media session and I know that Andrew was keen to make some comments. So Andrew, if I can perhaps hand over to you. Let me just pass the microphone across.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, guys. I'm not going to come back. I'm going to say goodbye now. Thank you very much for dialing in this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Marius. It's Andrew here. Look, just a few comments, I mean, clearly we'll spend a lot more time together in the coming next months and years. I mean, I'm obviously extremely honored to be knocked by the board to be the next Chief Executive Officer of BHP Billiton. BHP Billiton is, of course, one of the world's great companies, so the appointment humbles me deeply.</p>
          <p>And I have the pleasure and the privilege of working with Marius and his team and the board and obviously, with Jac Nasser, for about five years since Marius persuaded me to join the company. During that time I've worked with many thousands of very talented BHP Billiton employees. And since Marius persuaded me to join the company, he's worked tirelessly to prepare me for the possibility that I might, one day, take it over from him.</p>
          <p>A lot of you have commented and Marius has said something about his track records. I mean I would say unequivocally, he's done what every good CEO should do, actually splendidly. He's left the company in better shape than how he found it. And towards the end of that time, he, working with I and other members of the team, have started to develop a real momentum of things for which I have a real passion. And that partly comes from my previous background in industries like chemicals, where we don't enjoy quite the things &#x2013; there are upswings in margin that you see in the commodity business. And I'm looking forward to applying some of those skills as we go forward with a much sharper focus on everything that we've been talking to you about in terms of cost, productivity and capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>We already, I think, deliver some of the lowest cost per delivered ton, and some of the highest capital returns of the industry. It's my belief that with that kind of focus, particularly onto our great ore bodies, we can extend Marius's tremendous track record of delivering sector-leading returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>BHP Billiton is a very important company in the world of resources. It's the world's largest mining company, we have the license to operate some of the world's best ore bodies and some considerable oil and gas fields. As such, we have a critical role to play going forward in securing the supply that the world needs of key commodities to both grow in terms of wealth and population. And it's my commitment to continue the success that Marius has had in leading the team to develop those ore bodies sustainably through the application of leading-edge management techniques and, where appropriate, technology in order that the world actually harmoniously and peacefully secures the supply it does need to grow in that way.</p>
          <p>Just about the handover itself, it has been a &#x2013; well, I am biased of course, but a very effective succession process. But, one of the things that I really like about that is that Marius isn't going anywhere fast. He has committed to work with me on the handover process and to remain in his seat for the better part of the next three months to really allow me take stock. Now, I know a lot of you and many of you have worked with me and we've spoken about, I mean clearly, helped me form a lot of the ideas that I'm going to bring to the fore as we determine the future direction for our company.</p>
          <p>I think it's very important to say that there's a number of things that will not change. Our strategy has been tremendous for us and for our owners. And Marius spoke in his opening remarks about his commitment &#x2013; his undying commitment to improve the health and safety of our employees. That will be mine, too.</p>
          <p>I think clearly, the times are changing and there are things that I need to take stock of. I need to learn, to deliberate and just listen. Now, many of you have already helped me with my ideas and they're quite well formed, so you can expect me in the coming months just to test and reform them in a way that allows me to act with greater certainty.</p>
          <p>I mean, I think the only thing I would say in finishing is that we are one of the world's great companies. I would like us to remain that way and to be appreciated as such and quite frankly, there's no other job I would rather do. So, I'm looking forward to a rich dialogue with you in the coming weeks, months and years and thank you for listening to us. Good morning, or evening.</p>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
