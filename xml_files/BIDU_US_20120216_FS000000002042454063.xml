      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's call. In the final quarter of 2011, we delivered strong financial results driven by our relentless execution and ability to capitalize on exceptional market opportunities. Overall, 2011 was an extraordinary year for Baidu with strong financials and encouraging progress.</p>
          <p>Today, I'd like to take you through some of the achievements for the quarter and the year and discuss our strategy going into 2012. I'll begin by looking at some of the advances we've made on the user front in Q4. We made great strides in our mobile strategy over the quarter. The mobile Internet is growing at an astonishing pace in China and Baidu has kept abreast of that growth.</p>
          <p>We devoted significant resources to enhancing user experience for our products and optimizing them for mobile. I'm pleased to say that all of our mobile products are growing very well and we expect to see strong growth momentum carrying into 2012.</p>
          <p>Search queries from mobile devices already represent more than 15% of our total search query volume. Smartphone shipments in China surpassed the growth in the U.S. last quarter and Baidu has positioned itself to capture this opportunity. Baidu is already the default search engine on 80% of branded Android handsets sold in China. In addition, we developed a mobile phone platform called Baidu Yi to integrate our services including web search, music, maps and LBS to ensure that users get the premium Internet experience right on their mobile devices. Currently, we have a partnership with Dell and we are looking forward to working with more vendors and to introducing Yi to many more users this year.</p>
          <p>Building on our success in the desktop maps market where we have an 85% market share, we're moving ahead full throttle with mobile maps too. The number of daily users using Baidu maps on mobile devices grew by more than 10 times in 2011. In Q4, we introduced a range of new services including internal maps of shopping mall, airports and other large facilities as well as satellite maps of major Chinese cities in addition to 3D map services we were already offering.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we continued to deepen our partnerships with leading content providers and to more tightly indicate Baidu products like Symbian to offer Baidu map users richer and more useful content.</p>
          <p>Right throughout 2011, we made important progress on the user front. As a key part of our effort to increase user engagement in September, we introduced Baidu's new personalized homepage feature. Using faster search behavior and intelligent recommendation technology, the new homepage allow users to access much of the data, content, services, and apps they most want with just one click. Our landing page strategy helps to ensure that users enjoy an optimal experience even after they leave the Baidu site. We made great progress here by partnering with a large number of leading sites in important verticals like online video, travel, music, automotive, real estate and finance.</p>
          <p>In the booming travel space, we signed a landmark deal to acquire a majority stake in the leading travel search provider, Qunar. Qunar continues to grow well and we have integrated its comprehensive travel database into our product lines.</p>
          <p>In music, we launched the Baidu Ting music social network and signed a major agreement with the leading global record labels to enable Baidu users to discover and share millions of licensed Chinese and international songs on our platform.</p>
          <p>In the online video, our iQiyi joint venture has been growing solidly and now ranks amongst the top three in China by time spent. In Q4, iQiyi's unique monthly users reached 198 million. And of course, we continue to make strides on box computing, the innovative paradigm that represents our mission for the future of search. I'm pleased to tell that over 70% of our search queries now returns dynamic interactive results. Every day, users click 20 million times on results returned through the open application platform. With tens of thousands of third party developers already participating, we are confident that the Baidu search box will increasingly become Chinese user's primary point of entry on to the Internet.</p>
          <p>This commitment to providing the best possible user experience has helped us to build on Baidu's leading market position, and we continue to gain market share. China's Internet population is now at about 513 million, and it continues to grow. We expect to capture the overwhelming majority of new user growth, and to increase engagement with both existing and new users.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Baidu will continue to push forward on the product front with continuous improvements to vertical search products, to our mass services, as well as to our popular social products. Also look for new initiatives in the mobile Internet space and for new client-side software offerings. We also continue to explore long-term international opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at our progress in improving customer experience and enhancing monetization. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid revenue growth of 83% year-on-year. We saw increased spending by customers in traditional industries, such as automotive and cosmetics.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, our penetration in brand advertising deepened. Customers, who typically advertise offline, continued to increase their spending with us. These customers include some of the biggest brand advertisers like P&amp;G and many luxury brands like Louis Vuitton. The fact that they are turning to Baidu for brand building marketing is a demonstration of the effectiveness of our platform.</p>
          <p>E-commerce remained an important revenue driver for us, but we did see some cooling off in the more heated segments such as classified websites and group buying. We believe that it's healthy in the long-term for these sectors to stabilize marketing spending at more sustainable levels.</p>
          <p>We recorded ARPU growth of 62% year-on-year while our customer base grew 13% year-on-year. This demonstrates the success of our efforts to raise not just the quantity of customers, but also the quality of customer spending. In particular, our large customers allocated a bigger percentage of their marketing budget to Baidu and this was an important driver of growth in revenue and ARPU in Q4.</p>
          <p>2011 was another remarkable year for top line growth. We benefited from growth in the e-commerce industry and succeeded in gaining more traction with traditional customers. We made an important improvement to our online marketing platform and monetization algorithm to improve customer ROI. We also pushed out new targeting options like advanced phrase match and a series of customer friendly campaign management programs that proved popular with customers. As a result, we successfully accelerated revenue growth in 2011 over the previous year. Revenue increased by 83% for the year, up from 78% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Even with such strong growth, our long-term market opportunity in China is still enormous. In 2012, we will remain focused on exploiting this opportunity through better understanding of customer needs and stronger customer targeting. To do this, we are forming market research teams to help drive more penetration into promising sectors like food and beverage, cosmetics, automotive and in services. We are also recruiting specialists in traditional marketing, who will work with our larger customers to develop new formats and services for online marketing that will help them drive results.</p>
          <p>We are also looking at how to better serve our SME customers. This includes enhancing the Phoenix Nest interface and making improvements to our CRM systems and customer service offerings. In addition, we are now working closely with government agencies on a nationwide project aimed at educating SME owners about how the Internet can help their business.</p>
          <p>As our social products continue to strive, we think it's increasingly important to consider how Baidu can better help our customers harness the power of the social Web. Given that most of our social products such as Post Bar, Baidu Knows, Baidu Encyclopedia are organized both around people and topics, we can more naturally offer advertisers that highly desired combination of rich, relevance, social context, and engagement on our platform.</p>
          <p>Our social products have a much larger user base than peers' offerings. In 2012, we will continue to explore better monetization mechanisms for social media. 2011 was an amazing year, but there's a lot more to come in 2012. The addressable market for Baidu is enormous and with our clear strategy and the pipeline full of exciting initiatives, we have only scratched the surface of our success in China.</p>
          <p>With that I'll now turn the call over to Jennifer for a discussion of financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. I'm pleased that we're capping off our remarkable and productive year for Baidu with a strong set of results for the fourth quarter. That outstanding pace of top line growth enabled us to enjoy great margins as we sustained a very aggressive pace of investment in talent, infrastructure and marketing.</p>
          <p>Head count for the year increased by 5,200, bringing total staff to more than 16,000 at year end. CapEx was RMB1.8 billion in 2011 and we funded strong marketing efforts towards SEM market development and building ecosystems for the Baidu Open Data and Open Application platforms.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we aim to continue a robust pace of investment to build a solid foundation for long term growth while maintaining our disciplined approach to spending. We have a very clear vision of how we intend to grow our business. This entails continued investment in R&amp;D talent and infrastructure. To support this expansion in talent, we will add new office space. This includes the recently announced Baidu international building in Shenzhen, in Southern China, which we expect to be completed in 2015. We will also add more network infrastructure such as datacenters and servers.</p>
          <p>As part of our landing page strategy in 2011, we invested in key vertical areas such as online video and online travel. In 2012, we will continue to support the growth of these invested entities while also focusing on key strategic initiatives to finance as appropriate. We're confident about the long term opportunity in China's Internet industry and we will invest to develop and capture future growth of our business.</p>
          <p>With that let me run through some of the key financial indicators for the fourth quarter and the full year. All amounts mentioned are in RMB unless otherwise noted. For the fourth quarter, total revenue was RMB4.5 billion representing a 83% increase year-over-year. Total revenues for the full year 2011 were RMB14.5 billion, a increase of approximately 83% from 2010. During the fourth quarter, Baidu had approximately 311,000 active online marketing customers, a 13% increase from the corresponding period in 2010 and a 2% increase from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Revenue per online marketing customer for the fourth quarter was approximately RMB14,400, a 62% increase from the corresponding period in 2010, and a increase of 5% from the previous quarter. For the full year 2011, active online marketing customers increased by 18% and revenue per online marketing customer increased by 55% over the full year 2010 figures.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q4 was RMB354 million or 7.9% of total revenues as compared to 8.1% in the corresponding period in 2010, and 8% in the third quarter of 2011. Full year 2011 TAC as a percent of revenue was 8%, down from 9.6% for 2010, which primarily reflects the continued impact of our traffic optimization efforts from previous years. As we noted before, we expect TAC as a percent of revenue to gradually increase over the long-term given that we need to manage our partnership networks dynamically and we will also offer incentives, especially a higher payout ratio for new and important products such as contextual ads.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth cost and depreciation cost as a percent of revenues in Q4 were 4.3% and 4.8% respectively compared to 4% and 4% in the corresponding period in 2010. In 2011, bandwidth and depreciation cost, as a percent of revenue, increased to 4.3% and 4.5% respectively, compared to 3.9% and 4.2%. The increase was mainly due to a increase in network infrastructure capacity. We expect to recognize more bandwidth and depreciation cost in 2012, in line with the company's sustained investment in network infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Selling, general and administrative expenses in Q4 were RMB522 million, a increase of 67% year-on-year. Total SG&amp;A expenses for 2011 were RMB1.7 billion, a 55% increase from 2010, mainly due to increased personnel cost and marketing expenses.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses in Q4 were RMB414 million, a increase of 78% over the corresponding period in 2010, primarily due to increased head count. Total R&amp;D expenses for 2011 were RMB1.3 billion, a 86% increase from 2010 reflecting our continued emphasis on investing in topnotch R&amp;D talent.</p>
          <p>Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB47 million in the fourth quarter from RMB28 million in the corresponding period in 2010. SBC for 2011 increased 62% over the 2010 level.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for Q4 was RMB2.3 billion, a increase of 80% over Q4 2010. Operating profit for the full-year 2011 increased to 91% from 2010.</p>
          <p>Loss from equity method accounting was RMB8 million in Q4 2011 and RMB171 million in 2011 versus RMB7 million in Q4 of 2010 and RMB9 million in the whole year of 2010. The year-on-year increase was mainly due to Baidu's cash investment in ITE.</p>
          <p>Total head count as of December 31, 2011 was about 16,100, a increase of 5,200 over the end of 2010. Of this total head count, around 1,100 is attributable to Qunar with the remaining primarily attributable to head count increases in R&amp;D and sales. In the fourth quarter, head count increased roughly 1,400. In 2012, we will continue to increase head count with more emphasis on R&amp;D expansion.</p>
          <p>Income tax expenses was RMB404 million for the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 16.5% compared to 12.1% in Q4 of 2010. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 15.2% compared to 13.2% in 2010. The increase was mainly due to expiration of preferential tax treatment for some of Baidu's PRC subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>Also, we have recognized a higher effective tax rate for the full-year 2011, because we're in the process of applying for the high and new technology tax enterprise status for one of our entities. Until we received the status, we have accrued the income tax at a higher non-preferential tax rate. We expect, we will be granted the HNTE status and to reverse this over accrual in 2012 when we receive the status. For 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be around mid teens.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to Baidu for Q4 was RMB2.1 billion, a 77% increase from the corresponding period in 2010. Basic and diluted earnings, attributable to Baidu per ADS, for the fourth quarter of 2011 amounted to RMB5.88 and RMB5.87 respectively. Net income, attributable to Baidu, for the full year increased by 88%.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable to Baidu excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure for Q4 was RMB2.1 billion, a 77% increase year-over-year. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS, excluding share based compensation expenses, both non-GAAP measures were RMB6.02 and RMB6.01 respectively.</p>
          <p>As of December 31, 2011, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB14.2 billion. Net operating cash inflow and capital expenditure for the fourth quarter of 2011 were RMB3.4 billion and RMB502 million respectively. Full-year net operating cash inflow and operating expenditures were RMB8.2 billion and RMB1.8 billion respectively. In 2012, we plan to aggressively expand our network infrastructure and also its capacity.</p>
          <p>Now, let me provide you with our top line guidance for the first quarter 2012. We currently expect total revenues for the first quarter of 2012 to be between RMB4.195 billion and RMB4.33 billion, which would represent a 72.2% to 77.7% year-on-year increase. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflect Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, and Victor. Thank you very much for taking my question. So can you talk about 2012 revenue growth outlook, specifically how do you expect the larger and smaller advertisers react to the current macro environment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, thank you for your question. As we provided in the Q1 guidance, we are projecting a revenue growth, at this point, on a year-over-year basis for the quarter between 72% to close to 78%. We provide you this Q1 outlook based on our best understanding and insight into our business. And that's the consistent approach we provide in terms of revenue guidance.</p>
          <p>We do not offer the full-year outlook. However, I think the two things I want to emphasize is, on one hand the Internet and search engine marketing market has tremendous opportunities. At this point, we're very focused on the matters that we have control over and the efforts that we put in is based on the initiatives that we have put forward, and the things that we have control over. So this, I mean, I would say, we do not read too much into the macro environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of large customers contribution to our revenue growth; that will continue to be a very strong driver. This has been the case for the past few years. And as we have outlined in our script, the business that we are growing in the large accounts has been building very solid base, more and more traditional players are allocating more of their ad budgets with us and brand players are spending to put emphasis into our platforms. So we'll continue to see, there is a lot of growth momentum within the large clients business.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My question is on the cost side, looks like that bandwidth and depreciation up a bit in terms of percentage of revenue in Q4. I wonder if it is just a normal volatility or shall we be expecting more of the &#x2013; at least in the medium-term that the spending would be higher compared with the revenue growth. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think over the past couple of quarters that, Dick, you would have noted we used to have least cost component as a percent of revenue at a decreasing rate, but that momentum has changed. This is reflective of our continued investment in the infrastructure as we put on more servers, we handle more products, there is more traffic that we offer that will service our users; the bandwidth and depreciation cost naturally goes up. And you should continue to expect this trend going forward. This is not one-time special activities going on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Robin, Jennifer, and Victor. Thanks for taking my questions. My question is relating to your mobile strategy. So, can you &#x2013; I think, Robin, you mentioned substantially on some of the mobile initiative. And then can you share with us the current revenue contribution or maybe how much do you expect mobile to contribute in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Over the past conference call, I've repeatedly said that we do think mobile would become a very important channel to distribute our products. And that has increasingly become true over the past quarter. And we think during the coming year, mobile will represent an ever larger percentage of our total traffic.</p>
          <p>In the past, we basically did not spend any resources on monetizing the mobile traffic. But starting from this year, we will do something to figure out how to better serve our customers the mobile platform. That being said, I think probably over the next three to five years, our resource and our emphasis on mobile will continue to be on the user front instead of the monetization mechanisms. Right now, mobile represent a very small percentage of our total revenue.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jin Wang from Nomura. I'll ask questions on behalf of Jin Yoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, my question is about the Hao123. So given your guidance for the Q1 tariff, have you seen any potential slow down in Hao123 and how much impact have you seen from group buying and e-commerce to Hao123? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. Hao123 has been around for a number of years and it is a integral part of our services, both to the users as well as to our customers. We do not have the Q1 guidance specifically to address the Hao123 contribution. But Hao123, as I mentioned, has been around for a number of years and it does generate some level of monetization for us, but not materially large. It remains to be a integral part of our service to the users and we continue to deepen the product offerings to add additional features and also to help users navigate popular verticals et cetera at group buying, lottery, and many other verticals.</p>
          <p>We did say that in Q4 we see some cooling off in vertical areas like group buying or classified ads and naturally these players also do a little bit of business on the Hao123 side. But however, as I said, Hao123 is not materially huge component of our overall revenue picture and it doesn't make sense for us to single that out for Q1 forecast.</p>

          <p>I think there &#x2013; not being any material change in the user activity, in either the queries &#x2013; the nature of the queries or the click-through rates. Chinese Internet users continue to rely on Baidu as their main information source. So whatever they are looking for, they type in the related keyword into our search box. We haven't seen anything different from that. Of course, we continue to fine tune our monetization mechanism including the pick in price, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (34:32) and where do you show the promotional messages and how they are displayed that will be an ongoing effort. But over the past quarter and I think probably for the next quarter too there shouldn't be any material change.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question is more about the brand zone. Could you give us the proportion of advertisers which have at brand zone and then how much the revenue contribution from brand zone. Is that a material part of your business? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brand zone is a very popular feature among our product offerings and many customers do select to conduct our business using this product. I think, growing very fast is one of the core product that we offer as an overall package to our &#x2013; to the overall customer base. We do not, I think, Eddie, just in terms of whole scheme of things, I think you understand we haven't really broken out the large client group business and this is only one product for that group of business. It is one of the main features that we offer to the customers but it has been growing very, very nicely but we don't single out the revenue contribution just for one product.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For the brand zone product, it's primarily designed for the large customers for brand building purposes. We have seen very good results from that that's why during that prepared remarks I said that the large customers who traditionally advertise offline allocating more and more budget on Baidu brand zone that gives keep them a lot of flexibility to promote their brands. It got a lot of ways to display the promotional messages and we even allow certain interactivities on our search results with this brand zone. So we are very bullish on the future of this product.</p>

          <p>Thank you for taking my question. Good morning Robin, Jennifer and Victor. So, I have a broader question, possibly for Robin. Traditionally, I think that people agree certainly in the center of the Internet industry. However, contrary some people said the competitive landscape will change in the future, possibly driven by ASM, Open Platform and sometimes there is a mobile Internet it also different from the PC Internet. So, this side of the Internet industry might be divided into different ecosystems, which are built around several leading players. And the trend is, the most different ecosystem, they may not open to each other and just made the whole Internet ecosystem less connected as before.</p>
          <p>So my question is, how the management view the general trend of the China Internet industry? Do you agree whether the multi &#x2013; agree with the idea of multi-ecosystem? And if so, where and how the potential change of the competitive landscape will factor search procedure amount the Internet industry and what kind of strategy or initiative Baidu may take to cope with the changes? So that's my question, and I will stop here. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We firmly believe that search ASM will be the sender of this Internet ecosystem for information purposes. Of course, the market &#x2013; the Internet market, keep changing and keep evolving. There are all kinds of innovations, new products, and new user behaviors. But what we are saying is that in other areas for example e-commerce, there are a lot of user activities going on and user behavior have changed a lot.</p>
          <p>Also on the SNS side, user activity keep increasing and a lot of people are used to communicate through social network services, but those are things that are different in nature from information. So, I think for Baidu, we continue to be the most comprehensive place for people to get that information and for other type of activities be it e-commerce or social communication I think have their ways of making money and they may choose to be close to system and they may choose to be open to us. But, because we continue to have the most comprehensive information, I think most of the users will rely on Baidu as their primary information source.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if you could discuss in more detail how much of your balance in server cost growth is related to traffic growth from your core search versus non-search products and also how much impact does the rapid growth in mobile Internet or mobile search traffic have? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both our core search, web search business in terms of traffic as well as our non-search products in terms of traffic has grown very, very healthily and very nicely. The servers that we put on not only will handle traffic, it also handles a lot of the backend technology.</p>
          <p>Things like our Open Data platform, Open Application platform, the computing capabilities to constantly improve on search results to generate high quality search results to the users, dynamic search results, and also servers used for our monetization efforts. So it's &#x2013; you do see bandwidth cost and deprecation cost increase, this is overall handles not only the backend technology, but also the traffic that we are very happy to see that is growing very nicely.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to aggressively invest in infrastructure to support these core &#x2013; our core business as well to support future initiatives such as mobile. So we'll continue the pace of the investment on the server and infrastructure side. And in that you will continue to see the bandwidth cost and depreciation add up going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the social media monetization, like I have mentioned, many of our social offerings organized both are on people and topics. When customers want to advertise social media, I think we have an angle of topics that can group people together with similar interests. So we can better target and have more impressions for our customers.</p>
          <p>That's why I think we have an advantage over those other SME, whose main purpose is to communicate with each other instead of seeking information. The social offering of ours has been growing very nicely, faster than the Web search traffic. And we are actively exploring all kinds of monetization opportunities on these products, but it's still at the early stage. We will report back to the progress when there is anything worth mentioning.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just a question on Qiyi. Jennifer, I think you said that in the fourth quarter you have another RMB23 million equity loss pickup from Qiyi, but it didn't happen this quarter and you also mentioned that there might be some strategy change on Qiyi. So my question is whether &#x2013; is there any change to your strategy there and why there's no equity loss for this quarter? Should we expect that to happen in the next quarter? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Thank you, Ming. As the &#x2013; the background that you're all familiar with Baidu and our partners have joint control over iQiyi and the investment that we have under for this entity is recorded under equity accounting method. We have in the past supported the business in kind and so there has been minimum financial impact to-date. In Q3, we made a cash contribution to Qiyi and the cash investment was put against our share of iQiyi's cumulative results.</p>
          <p>In Q4, as planned, we made another cash contribution to Qiyi of RMB22 million, but we did not need to repeat the one-time pickup to reflect the cumulative nature of Qiyi's financial performance. This cash investment &#x2013; the new cash investment now we did in Q4 on a going forward basis will pick up along the way our share of the results on an ongoing basis up to that cash contribution amount.</p>
          <p>For Qiyi, our investment strategy doesn't change. Qiyi is important initiative for us and we will continue to support Qiyi very strongly. We will regularly review what is the optimal strategy for us to support it and on a going forward basis.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have a question on the percentage of traffic and the revenue outlook for vertical search. What I mean by vertical search is things like map, travel, video, and online shopping, I think plus image and music search in the past.</p>
          <p>Right now it's about around 15% of the search queries, and the revenue much less. How does Baidu see those vertical searches growing in traffic share and the revenue share terms going forward? It means some of that if it's not, just say, some of the important ones that you think is going to grow in the future. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, the main progress for our vertical search product offerings was really to make our users more dependent on Baidu for any type of information needs. So over the past years, searches like video search, image search, and maps have helped us to maintain and gain market share or traffic share on web search. We did not put into a lot of resources to monetize the vertical search traffic.</p>
          <p>Image search represent probably the largest portion of vertical search queries, but it's not that easy to find &#x2013; get way to monetize this part of traffic. Well, map is a little bit different. It's central to the location-based services that allow people have high hopes on. As more and more people access Internet services through mobile devices, we believe there could be good monetization opportunities map related LBS services.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, guys. A couple of questions; first on the SG&amp;A that was up decently on a sequential basis whereas last year it was relatively flat sequential. Was there anything there and is there any sense for the click volume for the year? I think you usually disclose that in the 10-K and if you can give us advance preview of that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address your first question first. Didn't quite hear your second question. The marketing dollars increased sequentially. Yes, we do have not necessarily a flat pattern quarter-over-quarter. This past Q4, there are a number of marketing activities going on that contributed to the sequential increase. We celebrated our 10th year anniversary of Baidu's commercial products and that was a bigger marketing event this year compared to probably prior quarters.</p>
          <p>There are also, as you can see, head count increases related somewhat to marketing and that contributed to the sequential increase as well. As I mentioned in my script, marketing is a very important component of our overall expense structure. Not only we have a lot of market opportunities, which as a search engine market leader that we need to develop the market opportunities particularly on the SME side. On the user front, we are trying to build a healthier very positive ecosystem with our Open Application and Open Data platform and that in itself will also drive our marketing spending going forward. So quarter-over-quarter there's always different events that we're trying to drive our strategic focus.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking up my questions. I think after the Google fourth quarter result on the street, a lot of clients have been quite interested to see how the search engine to improve monetization on the mobile service front, as the matter of like the form factor has some kind of limitation. So when Baidu tries to think about monetization in mobile search traffic in this year, would you have the same sort of platform for both the PC and mobile search front in order to have two different kind of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:25) or would you think about other approaches in order to improve the revenue per search queries on the mobile side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly, we just have started to work on the monetization of mobile traffic. It's very early for us to have any conviction on what the best way to monetize mobile traffic is, but right now the monetization system on mobile is the same as it is on PC-based Internet. So there shouldn't be any change for the near future. It's just the way we display promotional messages on mobile interface could be a little bit different, we may display phone numbers and users can click on the phone number and then make phone calls. We may display less promotional message than PC interface, but we are working to optimize these kind of offerings. Because it represents a very small percentage of our revenue &#x2013; total revenue right now, we will not be able to get into more details at this time, but going forward when we develop more product features for mobile monetization, we will give you more color on that.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Victor, and thank you very much for taking my call. I have a question about your vision for the box computing platform and your broader web apps initiatives. Clearly, the more immersive environment that you said that 70% of clicks resulting on your search page, but it delivers contextually relevant search results and information, but it also move you into entertainment and other services around that apps platform. Do you envisage an opportunity incrementally for monetization for Baidu beyond the paid search results into an economic share with an incremental share of apps that may monetize or charge users going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at the end of day, we make the same &#x2013; we get the same budget from the same group of customers. It could be marketing budget, it could be revenue sharing or commission. Right now most of our box computing results, not commercial results, but some of them do have commercial value and we work with a number of partners to provide both high quality information and get better revenue contributions to our platform.</p>
          <p>They can benefit from the traffic and user we deliver. They can chose &#x2013; well, we can chose to be paid by marketing budget or from revenue sharing, but at this time because we think at the end of the day, it's the same budget, we'd like to stick with the same mechanism which is marketing budget instead of revenue sharing. But I agree with you, a lot of the entertainment-oriented applications could benefit from our box computing infrastructure very well.</p>

          <p>We have a long standing of having the largest Union network in the country, and we and our partners together offer the kind of services that complement each other. Throughout the past two years, I think you have seen on the search side, there has been improvement in terms of traffic quality and our TAC has been managed very well in that regard. However, this environment is dynamic.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in the script, we will manage our partnership network dynamically and that could have implications to the TAC expenses going forward. We are also pushing new products and services through the Union network, products like contextual ads, like home media, and we hope that with our joint efforts, we offer better services to our advertisers and at the same time everybody has a win-win situation. So in all, I think this is important component of the overall ecosystem as well as our business, and we will manage the business dynamically.</p>

We would like to partner with a lot of media properties and other distribution channels to display contextual ads and other form of display ads. So that's why, the nature of the TAC will change a little bit going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my questions. I just wonder if you can give more color on your search traffic growth in 2012. And I think there are probably three different factors impacting this. One, I think you mentioned that when you launched the personalized homepage last September, you said it potentially may cannibalize the traditional search traffic. So, so far have you seen any cannibalization effects on your traditional search traffic?</p>
          <p>And also I think the number two factor here is that given that your market share by the search queries already exceed 80% and you are sitting on a high base of the search traffic so will your search traffic growth decelerate dramatically in 2012? The number three factor will be, I think, given the emerging different standalone vertical search engines in the market, are you seeing your search traffic being effected by those search engines? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our search traffic has been growing very predictably over the past few years, and we think 2012 will be no exception. The new personalized homepage offered a lot of stickiness to the heavy users of Baidu, but it's not a huge percentage of our total user base yet. So that's why, we haven't seen material cannibalization of the search traffic because of that.</p>
          <p>What we're saying is that, like I mentioned before, mobile search traffic has been growing very, very fast and this &#x2013; again, I don't think the overall effect is cannibalization, it's actually increased the chance for Internet users to use search more. So, if you combine PC search and mobile search together, I think net-net, we are benefiting from users contributing more search traffic to Baidu. We don't believe any vertical search would have major impact on us, because consumers would like to depend on one single entry point for information.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

So far very few of them opted out of that. So what we have seen is that those are very loyal users of Baidu served by the personalized homepage, but the rest still get the traditional homepage. We are still investing very heavily in the personalization technology, so that the layout of the content offerings on the personalized homepage will be more accurate and sticky to our users.</p>
