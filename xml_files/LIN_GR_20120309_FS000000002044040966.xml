          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. This is Dominik Heger from Investor Relations. Thank you for joining the call for our full year results 2011. The call will be hosted by Professor Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle, CEO of the Linde Group; and Georg Denoke, Member of the Executive Board and CFO. Also available for your questions will be Dr. Aldo Belloni, Member of the Executive Board.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Professor Dr. Reitzle for his presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, from my side, also a warm welcome to our full-year results conference call. 2011 has been again a very successful year for the Linde Group. The operational results have achieved new record levels. We strengthened our resilient company profile and further enhanced our strategic setup. To summarize it we have delivered profitable growth, which is also our ambition going forward.</p>
          <p>I would like now to take you through the following agenda points as marked on page three of the presentation. I will kick off with the highlights of 2011, then I will move over to the strategic focus where I will start with a short update on the impact of our HPO initiatives before finally outlining the main growth trends for the Linde Group. I will present &#x2013; after presenting our outlook, I will then hand over to Georg Denoke for the specific financial topics.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to page four, slide four. With an increase of 7.1%, our Group sales exceeded the record level of 2010. Even more important to mention that the operating profit grew at an even faster pace by 9.7%. The Group operating margin has further improved by 60 basis points to 23.3%, and the Gases operating margin increased by 50 points to 27.5%. The earnings per share adjusted by the allocation of the purchase price of POC increased by 11.9% to now &#x20AC;7.71 and reached again a new record level. Also, the adjusted ROCE grew by 50 basis points to 13%, which is a step towards our midterm target of 14%.</p>
          <p>Throughout the year, we have been able to further reduce our net debt by &#x20AC;403 million to now &#x20AC;5.094 billion. Later, Georg will give you more details on the financial performance in 2011. In the wake of the sovereign debt crisis, the crisis in the Eurozone and the financial markets, the momentum of the economic recovery slowed during the year. Most of the impetus in the global economy came, as you may expect, from the growth markets. We saw a solid contribution from the mature markets and further increased share from growth markets. The latter has also contributed to further strengthen our resilient company profile.</p>
          <p>The positive development of the already-outlined key performance indicators for Linde have been strongly supported by our successful HPO initiatives. Let me start with a more detailed breakdown of our performance with Group sales on page five. The Gases division continued the growth track with sales increase of 8.5% to now &#x20AC;11.1 billion. We have seen growth in all our operating segments, and as you might have expected with the strongest growth rates in the Asia Pacific segment.</p>
          <p>With regard to product areas, we saw the highest growth rates in Tonnage and Bulk. Again, sales in the engineering division have been slightly above the level of the previous year with an increase of 2.8% to now &#x20AC;2.5 billion. The order intake is well-balanced between growth and mature markets while the order backlog remains on a solid level.</p>
          <p>As you will see on slide six, our profitability in this division was exceptional. As promised, we were not only able to increase the operating profit but also to bring the Group margin to a new level of 23.3%.</p>
          <p>Looking more detailed at the operating profit development, you see that the positive development of the Group's operating margin was driven by a strong performance in both divisions. The operating profit in Gases exceeded the previous record level and moved up to 9.9%, which means &#x20AC;3 billion. The margin increase continued in 2011 with additional 50 basis points, the margin reached the level of 27.5%.</p>
          <p>The operating profit of the Engineering division grew by 12.2% to &#x20AC;304 million due to successful project execution, the outstanding operating margin of 12% as you may know and be aware, well ahead of our midterm target range of 8%.</p>
          <p>Now, I will move on to some key numbers of our Gases and Engineering results, beginning with the product area split of the Gases division on page seven. The improvement in the general economic conditions led to a strong rise in demand in the global Gases business in the first half of 2011 and normal growth rates in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>To give you a clear picture of the underlying growth, we show on this slide the comparable sales growth. Please be reminded that comparable growth is adjusted as always at Linde for the impacts of natural gas price, currency fluctuations as well as of consolidation to show you the underlying growth rates.</p>
          <p>In the product area Healthcare, we saw steady growth, achieving a comparable sales increase of 5%. In January 2012, we acquired the Continental-European Homecare business of Air Products,  which will further strengthen our Healthcare portfolio. The mega-trend healthcare remains intact. Later I will come back to this topic.</p>
          <p>With 8.5% growth in our take-or-pay contracts, we had another strong year in Tonnage. The increase was to a large extent due to start-ups of new plants mainly in the first half of 2011. Throughout the reporting period, we showed our competitiveness in growth markets by winning a numerous new onsite contracts in Asia and in particular in China.</p>
          <p>In the Merchant business, Linde benefited primarily from raising customer demand in the manufacturing sector. Demand from infrastructure projects and also from its favorable geographical setup. The growth in the Bulk business was further supported by our new merchant LNG business. In the cylinder area, we saw a positive impact in the first half of 2011 from the recovery of the last crisis.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a picture of the performance of our Engineering division now on page 8. The market environment in the international large-scale engineering business continued to improve in the course of 2011. The order intake increased by 3.5% to &#x20AC;2.2 billion and is well balanced across all regions and also across the different plant types. With the development of unconventional gases, we have seen a new trend for our engineering business, to which I will come back later. The order backlog stayed with &#x20AC;3.6 billion at a strong level and is also well balanced across the different plant types.</p>
          <p>As mentioned in the beginning, the operating profit margin of 12% was at an exceptional high level, which is due to the positive effect from the successful execution of individual projects signed pre-crisis in 2008. We expect this trend to continue partly also this year and, therefore, give the guidance of an operating margin of at least 10% for the year 2012.</p>
          <p>I'm turning now to slide nine with a short summary of the progress of our HPO initiatives. Please let me introduce this slide with a quick reminder on what high-performance organization stands for. HPO is a holistic program covering the full value chain of our business across all regions. Within this program, we have defined standardized best practices, processes, which we have and will further roll out across all our businesses to further increase efficiencies. HPO will bring us closer to be not only a good but an excellent company. You might recall that we accelerated this program in 2009 due to the exceptional economic environment and achieved &#x20AC;300 million gross cost savings.</p>
          <p>In each of the last two years, we added another &#x20AC;160 million of gross cost savings. This brings us up to accumulated gross cost savings of now &#x20AC;620 million as of the end of 2011. Our target range for the four-year program is, as you may be aware, &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million of accumulated gross cost savings by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>It is needless to say that you can expect us to deliver also a solid contribution of gross cost savings within this year. Another important aspect of profitable growth are the strategic growth opportunities, which we call mega-trends. And for this, please turn to slide 10.</p>
          <p>We are focusing on three global mega-trends. The first is the mega-trend growth markets. The second is the area of energy and environment, while the third is healthcare. I will dive a bit deeper into the mega-trend growth markets now on slide 11.</p>
          <p>I'd like to start with a look at the market potential. Here, we show the size of the markets in which we are active in 2011 and our assumption of the size of the same markets in 2020. The high underlying growth in the growth markets and in particular in Asia is obvious. The calculated growth rates are based on the current political and economic environment which we see today. Furthermore, the structural growth is expected to be based on above-average GDP growth, a trend to further outsource, and the increase of the Gases intensity driven by applications.</p>
          <p>In a local market structure like in the Gases industry, the current market position is of relevance in order to benefit from this respective growth potential to &#x2013; of that market. Therefore, it is important to understand that Linde has a number one position in four out of five growth markets.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you will see that we have continuously increased our contributions from those markets in the last years. I'm now on slide 12. In the last five years, we have been able to increase our share of total Gases revenues from growth markets in the Gases division to 35% on a consolidated basis. By including joint ventures, we arrive even at 36%. With this setup, we are undoubtedly leading. This is, of course, the result of our investment decisions in the recent years. Out of the total Gases investments of &#x20AC;6.3 billion over the last five years, roughly half has been spent in those growth countries.</p>
          <p>I would like you to take away that in 2011, even 54% of our investments went into the growth markets. Later on, Georg will outline that on a project investment basis, the percentage is even higher. In a nutshell, we have further leveraged our leading market position through a significant CapEx spend and we'll continue to do so.</p>
          <p>You will find our progress in the Asian market as an example on the next slide, which is slide 13. You can see that in the reporting year, we had double-digit growth rates in our Asian markets. Revenues in Greater China grew by 22% and in South and East Asia by 13%. The map shows that these revenues derive, to a large extent, from markets where we have a leading position. The local market position is key to the implementation of the integrated business model, which includes on-site and merchant business.</p>
          <p>In the integrated model, we can further leverage our investments and our best positions to capture the future growth opportunities in a very competitive environment. The projects listed here show you a very strong track record in 2011. In China alone, we have been able to sign on-site contracts with an investment volume of almost &#x20AC;0.5 billion. We have not only moved inland to China with our customers but also have for example a decaptivation against strong local and international competition.</p>
          <p>This leading gases setup is also a result of our long-term customer relations in these countries resulting from the activities of our engineering division. Our complementary Engineering and Gases setup also offers attractive synergies in the energy and environmental mega-trend, as you will see on the next slide, slide 14.</p>
          <p>The technologies' applications, process know-how and corresponding patents developed in our engineering division from the basis of success in the &#x2013; formed the basis of success in the energy and environment mega-trend. This includes a broad range of technologies and applications such as floating LNG and has enhanced oil or gas recovery, CO2 capture and engine. In addition, the long-term customer relations of our &#x2013; of the engineering division grant access to a broad customer range in the energy and environment sector.</p>
          <p>With engineering services and production of equipment also in India and China, Linde is able to offer highly energy-efficient plants at very competitive prices for internal use as well as for external sales to those customers who are not interested in a gas-supplies team.</p>
          <p>This setup enables Linde to provide large-scale plans with proven technology for mega projects and offers, at the same time, a long-term operations track record in running such mega plants in an outsourced model.</p>
          <p>I emphasize this point for two reasons. Firstly, Linde is unique with its experience and know-how. Secondly, the projects in the field of energy and environment tend to be mega projects. An example is our joint venture with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi, which went on stream in 2011 and has a joint CapEx volume of $800 million. This example outlines the pre-conditions to be successful in this mega-trend.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide 15. Let me introduce you to this slide with the analogy of the movement of the tectonic plates. It is a slow movement that creates tension in some areas at low-paced tension, and then suddenly releases this tension and thereby, transforms the landscape.</p>
          <p>It is similar in the energy area. The increasing demand creates tension and very slowly changes the energy mix. A sudden change can happen like in the case of Germany, where you have seen a strong reaction to the nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima, Japan, which has suddenly already altered the landscape in Germany with the exit from nuclear power generation.</p>
          <p>Despite the example in Germany, this movement will be very slow with fossil resources remaining the dominant energy source and therefore, increasing CO2 emissions. Of course, the contribution from renewable sources will increase, but as already indicated, only slowly. It is obvious that in the near future, the main growth drivers in this mega-trend will be the more efficient extraction and use of fossil resources and at the same time, the reduction of CO2 emissions.</p>
          <p>With our technologies in the area of enhanced oil and gas recovery, LNG gasification processes such as of coal or biomass and CO2 capture and handling, we are, we think, very well positioned in this mega-trend, irrespective of how the landscape will transform. The shale Gases business in the U.S., which you see on &#x2013; in the next slide, slide 16, is an example for new markets that have evolved.</p>
          <p>Since the beginning of 2010, our engineering division has collected orders amounting to now more than &#x20AC;400 million in the area of cleaning and purifying shale gases after the extraction. This is a field of activity that has not been there in 2009. The shale gas trend in the U.S. might lead to the development of new chemical clusters based on the availability of energy and the coal-rich feedstock. This would trigger the need for new industrial gases supply at a large scale.</p>
          <p>With our engineering division, we have early access to the relevant potential, industrial gases customers along the value chain. This starts with the gas producer and ends with chemical companies. The latter would require in the first step an olefin plant for the development of a chemical cluster in a second step, industrial gases supply schemes.</p>
          <p>I now move on to the mega-trend healthcare on slide 17. The healthcare mega-trend has always provided continuous sales growth, also in the last crisis as Georg will show later. The healthcare business contributes to the resilient profile of Linde, which is one of the reasons to grow this segment within our portfolio.</p>
          <p>The market environment is characterized by a structural, growing end market due to an increasing and aging population as well as increasing wealth in the growth markets. The demographic change, regulation, and the need for budget reductions in the healthcare systems influence the development of this market.</p>
          <p>The value-add that can be created is therefore a key to success. Market drivers are new, innovative pharmaceutical gases and services, high-quality care for patients as well as the creation of reliable and cost-effective services also through economies of scale.</p>
          <p>As already shown, for the classic industrial gases market, you can see here the size of the relevant market in 2011 and our assumption for the same healthcare market in the year 2020. It is obvious that this mega-trend has its positive business impact rather in mature markets but will also gain momentum over time in the growth markets. I think it is obvious that the supply of medical gases is not only &#x2013; is not, sorry, not enough to be successful in the long run. Being an integrated service provider is the basis for profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 displays the journey towards an integrated service provider. The journey started with today's base business, Hospital Care, which is the supplier of medical gases and corresponding services to hospitals. The development of gas therapies such as oxygen or HELiOS therapies further enhanced the portfolio. Intermediate care addresses patients that do not need to stay in a hospital but also cannot be treated at home. We offer with our so-called REMEO centers care to those chronic patients with mechanical ventilation needs.</p>
          <p>With intermediate care, we can provide services to patients beyond the supply of medical gases in hospitals. At the same time, it results in cost ease to healthcare budgets since the treatment in a REMEO center is less expensive than in the intensive care bed at a hospital. Even less cost-intensive is the treatment of patients at home, what we call homecare. Therefore, we believe homecare will be, to a degree, the solution to the pressure in the healthcare budgets.</p>
          <p>With our product and service offerings in homecare, we can further accompany the patient and to take care of their respective needs, such as home oxygen therapies, but we also offer other therapies such as for sleep apnea. The development of new therapies and applications will drive the market, and as a consequence, the leading players continue their journey to be more and more an integrated service provider. With the acquisition in January 2012 of the Continental European Homecare business of their products, which is of course, subject to approval by the antitrust authorities, we have further strengthened our number two position in the respiratory homecare market.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide 19. In 2011, by far the majority of our homecare business was in mature markets. The main activity areas are home oxygen therapies, sleep therapy and ventilation services. You can clearly see that already, today, the offerings are way beyond the pure supply of oxygen. Across these pillars, we can realize synergies resulting, for example, from sales and marketing or logistics, to mention only some of the potentials. We feel well positioned in this mega-trend and intend to further grow our healthcare business. We have just recently proven our commitment and therewith, our positioning in this mega-trend, with the already-mentioned acquisition.</p>
          <p>With the overview on the mega-trends, the corresponding growth potentials, the achievements and the positioning of the Linde Group, I hope you gained an impression of our growth potential. What we can be sure of is that with our extensive and diversified range of technologies, the synergies between our Gases and Engineering operations, we are well, very well, I think, equipped to capture the upcoming growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let me finish with our outlook on page 20. In 2012, we will see light and shadow. The pace of economic growth is expected to continue to show significant variations in different regions of the world. Leading economic research institutes are forecasting an economic slowdown in 2012, with smaller increases of GDP and industrial production compared to the reporting year.</p>
          <p>Based on the current economic predictions and prevailing exchange rates, our objective is to continue to achieve increases in group sales and operating profit. I have outlined in the beginning that we reconfirm the target range of &#x20AC;650 million to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings of our HPO initiatives in the years 2009 to 2012 and you have seen that we are already close to the lower end of the range after only three years. We expect for the financial year 2012 in our Gases business a slower growth rate than in 2011. However, we stay committed to our target to grow at a faster pace than the market and to further increase our productivity. The growth will be driven by continuous ramp-ups out of our very healthy project pipeline, as you will see later in more detail.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we assume growth in the Bulk and cylinder business to be in-line with the macroeconomic trends and ongoing steady growth in healthcare. In the engineering division, we expect a relatively stable environment for the relevant market. With a high order backlog of &#x20AC;3.6 billion, we have a good basis for a solid business performance in 2012 and therefore expect to achieve the same level of sales as in 2011. We anticipate that we will achieve in the engineering division in 2012 an operating margin and I think I mentioned it already of at least 10%. However in the medium-term, the target of the operating margin remains at 8%.</p>
          <p>To summarize my key observations are for another record year, there are strong, intact mega-trends offering structural growth potential in our core businesses, and we have the right setup regarding local market shares, technologies and customer contracts. We have again improved our already solid financial structure and profitability and are ready to embrace the opportunities of described mega-trends, which we have shown first with the recent acquisition.</p>
          <p>We are fully committed to further strengthen our profile on our continued path towards a high-performance culture. With the high uncertainty and high volatility we all have seen in the reporting period, we think that our midterm guidance becomes even more important for you, and we'll reconfirm again our midterm targets.</p>
          <p>In 2014, we want to achieve on a group level an operating profit of at least &#x20AC;4 billion. We intend to further grow the adjusted return on capital employed to 14% or higher. For the Gases division, the average CapEx sales ratio shall be 13% plus.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, our ambition is to outperform the market with our revenue increase, further strengthen our profile as a resilient company and at the same time, remain fully focused on our journey to become a high-performance organization. To put it in a nutshell, deliver profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your interest. I now hand over to Georg Denoke for more details on financials. And we'll both &#x2013; we both will be available for your questions thereafter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you and good afternoon from my side as well. With my presentation, I will focus firstly on the operational performance, secondly on the project pipeline and CapEx, and my last agenda point will cover the financial performance.</p>
          <p>I'll start with the development of the key financial indicators of the group on page 22. All of them have reached a new record level in the reporting period. The adjusted EPS increased by 12% to &#x20AC;7.71. The return on capital employed showed a very strong improvement in 2010 and could be further increased by 50 basis points to 13%. And the performance of the operating cash flow has been stable in 2011 and came to &#x20AC;2.426 billion mainly because of higher tax payments and the lower level of advanced payments in Linde Engineering. We have seen not the same extent of growth as in operating profit.</p>
          <p>This is also in confirmation of our synergies between gas and engineering because we have seen higher internal order intake, reflecting the success in our Tonnage business in combination with engineering.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the comparable growth in the product areas in the Gases division in quarter four of 2011 on the next slide. The economic recovery continued in the first half 2011 and came down to normal growth rates for the industry in the second half.</p>
          <p>Our development in the fourth quarter was above the market average. Here, our geographic footprint was positively impacting the development. With a 35% share of sales in the emerging and the growth markets, and the favorable footprint in Continental Europe, with strong performing countries like Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, just to mention a few, we are well positioned here. All of our products areas showed solid growth in the fiscal year 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look on the quarterly development of each product area on page 24. With comparable growth in the healthcare product area of about 5% in the first half-year and 5.1% in the last quarter of 2011, we were in-line with our expectations of around 5% for the full fiscal year 2011.</p>
          <p>Overall, we have won more than 200 tenders in 2011, out of which more than 70 tender wins have been in the fourth quarter of the reporting season. As expected, over the year, we have achieved strong growth in the Tonnage product area. As expected, the first half-year of 2011 was stronger than the second half and showed double-digit comparable growth rates. This was due to a higher number of start-ups in the first two quarters of the year whereas in 2010, we have seen the most start-ups in the second half of the year, which also led to a strong base effect in Q3 and Q4 of 2011.</p>
          <p>Further, the second half of 2011 was characterized by regular maintenance shutdowns of our customers. Please be reminded that joint ventures do not have the top line visibility here and are therefore not included in these figures. For example, the enhanced gas recoveries in Abu Dhabi is not included. If we would include Elixier, this is the name of the joint venture, the top line growth would be 7.1% instead of 5.1% in quarter four.</p>
          <p>In the Bulk business, we have seen strong comparable growth in the first two quarters, a very high growth of 11.4% in the third quarter and in strong growth in the last quarter despite a strong base effect.</p>
          <p>Our LNG terminal, the Merchant LNG business in Sweden, which went on stream in quarter three, played a supportive role in the second half of the year. Q4 was negatively impacted in comparison by a lower demand of liquid CO2 typically &#x2013; which is typically lower in the winter season. Overall, the demand decreased in Q4 due to lower activity also in Northern Europe.</p>
          <p>In the cylinder business, which is the late cycle business, we had an acceleration of the recovery in the first half of 2011. After the recovery came down as expected to more normal levels, we showed a 6.4% comparable growth in the third quarter and now a 4.9% comparable growth in quarter four. Overall, we are completely in line with our guidance of around 7% for the full year 2011.</p>
          <p>On the next two slides, we go a little bit deeper into the development of our operating segments, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Americas. The industrial gas market 2011 was characterized by significant growth. The increase of demand varied, however, greatly by region and by industry sector. North America and Europe continue to be the largest markets, but Asia is catching up. Within our numbers, we have seen the highest growth rates in Asia. Across all segments, we have seen a strong price volume development of 7.4%. In 2011, 35% of sales in the Gases division were generated in emerging markets. Therefore, today, our regional split between growth and mature markets is quite balanced comparable to the size of this market.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at EMEA. As mentioned, in Continental Europe, we have a very favorable footprint. Within EMEA, Linde achieved sales growth of 6.4% to &#x20AC;5.672 billion. On a comparable basis, the growth in sales was 5.7%. As expected, the positive growth trend in EMEA slowed down slightly in the second half of 2011. In this economic environment, we were able to achieve growth in all market segments and increased volumes in all product areas. The growth was mainly driven by cylinders and Bulk in Continental Europe. In the Tonnage business, Linde also benefited from the production startups of new plants supplying the steel industry. Examples of these are the air separation plants in Bremen in Germany and Scunthorpe in the UK, which will supply industrial Gases to major customers of Linde <mark type="ph" /> light copper steel (39:08).</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Asia Pacific, Linde achieved significant growth in sales in light of the dynamic economic trends in Asia, especially in China. Mainly the Tonnage business contributed to the overall growth. We benefited from leading positions in this market. Sales in this business segment rose by 14.3% to &#x20AC;3.076 billion. On a comparative basis, the increase in sales was 9.2%. As already mentioned by Dr. Wolfgang Reitzler, we had numerous project wins in Asia, and therefore expect further significant contributions from new Tonnage schemes in the future.</p>
          <p>Greater China benefited from the very good economic situation and achieved the fastest rate of business expansion within this operating segment and showed double-digit growth in all product areas. The start-up of several new plants contributed to the development of the business.</p>
          <p>Moving to Americas, here, sales in 2011 rose by 4.6% to &#x20AC;2.384 billion. On a comparable basis, the increase in sales was 9.1%. In North America, the improvement in the general economic situation also resulted in higher demand for industrial gases. Linde was able to achieve growth in all product areas. In the onsite business, average utilization of existing production capacity was higher than in 2010.</p>
          <p>We also benefited from start-ups of new plants. We brought on stream for example a plant for the steel company, AK Steel in Butler, Pennsylvania. In South America, the economy has continued to grow. Linde achieved also double-digit growth rates during 2011. All product areas saw positive business trends with the strongest performance coming from the healthcare segment. The profitability of our operating segments is highlighted on the next page, page 26.</p>
          <p>In 2011, to put it in a nutshell, we increased the operating margins in all segments and the overall EBITDA contributions of growth markets came to 32% in the reporting period of the total OP. Let's have a look at EMEA. The operating profit increased at a faster rate than sales by 8% to &#x20AC;1.634 billion. The operating margin came at the same time to 28.8%, 40 basis points above the prior year figure of 28.4%. This positive development was primarily the result of our HPO initiatives and successful price management.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Asia Pac, the operating profit rose by 15.6% to &#x20AC;872 million. The operating margin in this segment was 28.3%. The margin was negatively influenced by the pass-through of increased natural gas and upfront investment for the expansion and employment of new staff in the rapidly expanding Asian markets, in particular, in China. Despite these effects, we were able as promised to increase the margin by 30 basis points and reached a higher level compared to 2010. Also here, HPO was an important driver for the positive margin development.</p>
          <p>In China, the demand for liquefied and cylinder gases in industrial zones is continuously growing. On the one hand, we have benefited from our strong growth in Tonnage and on the other hand, we could participate in the steadily growing merchant market due to our integrated business model, which allows us to further leverage our on-site plans.</p>
          <p>In the Americas segment as well, operating profit increased by 7.2% to &#x20AC;535 million. As a result, the operating margin was 22.4%, which reflects an increase by 50 basis points. Considering the use of cash, please have a look on the Gases CapEx split by operating segment on page 27.</p>
          <p>In the year 2011, we invested in the gasses division &#x20AC;1.4 billion, which is an increase of 8.5% versus 2010. Asia Pacific saw the highest increase with a 19.3% rise in allocated capital spending. This reflects our strong pipeline in the Asian growth markets, especially in China. The investments in the operating segment of Americas increased by 3.2%, whereas EMEA stayed on a high level with an increase of 1.8%. The overall share of CapEx allocated to growth markets increased significantly from 46% in 2010 to 54% in 2011. This means that the majority of CapEx went into the growth markets as already outlined by Wolfgang. This brings me now to the project pipeline in the Gases division on page 28.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you can see the total project amount of projects above &#x20AC;10 million, which went or will go on stream in the respective years. In the financial year 2011, &#x20AC;800 million worth of investments went on stream. As you know, roughly half of this was our joint venture with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi.</p>
          <p>During the reporting period, Linde was able to complete its 11th air separation plant for ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe in Duisburg, Germany. The amount invested was around &#x20AC;75 million. On the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:33) side in Hungary, we added capacity to the production of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The industrial gases produced there are used to supply the chemical company <mark type="ph" /> Bozart Chem (46:46). Investment around &#x2013; the investment was around &#x20AC;100 million. In Romania, we brought a new air separation plant on stream at the Galati site of our customer ArcelorMittal.</p>
          <p>The plant, which involves investments of &#x20AC;100 million, has a production capacity of around 2,100 tons of oxygen per day as well as smaller amounts of nitrogen and argon. We will extend the liquefied gases network in the Romanian market.</p>
          <p>We also started the production of a new hydrogen plant in N&#xFC;nchritz, Germany where we supply Wacker Chemie. Like all other major production plants in Europe, this plant is remotely controlled and operated out of Linde's European remote operating center in Leuna, Germany. Due to a very promising opportunities pipeline, we were able to sign projects which increased the figures for 2012 and 2013. The figure 2012 is now on a level of around &#x20AC;750 million. And this year, only joint ventures are included of around &#x20AC;64 million, which is an increase overall &#x20AC;50 million and the amount for 2013 also now is on a level of &#x20AC;650 million, which shows additional &#x20AC;150 million.</p>
          <p>As an exception, we want to give you an early insight of the year 2014. Never before we have had that early such a strong pipeline in the second year after. For 2014, we have already projects in the pipeline of around &#x20AC;550 million. Thus, the year 2014 has already exceeded the level of 2009 and we expect the pipeline to further grow.</p>
          <p>The total investment amount of our project pipeline for the years 2009 to 2014 is now above &#x20AC;4 billion, of which around 70% are allocated to growth markets. We still see a high amount of project opportunities in the market with the large portion in growth markets. The amount of project opportunities on a 12-month covered basis increased and is list around &#x20AC;4.3 billion on a very high level. It is worth mentioning that the project opportunities portfolio has a higher number of projects than the growth markets but also includes a major project in the area of the mega-trend energy environment.</p>
          <p>The CapEx sales ratio in the Gases division is shown on the slide, which is page 29. For the year 2011, we gave you the guidance, spending 13% of our Gases sales for CapEx. We see today that we were exactly on this level. For the fiscal year 2012, we expect a significant high CapEx figure, which is above 13% and around &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Large-scale projects, especially in the promising energy environment mega-trend may result also in the years to come in capital expenditure and the Gases division exceeding the average figure of 13%. Therefore, our capital expenditure guidance remains at 13% plus in the Gases division.</p>
          <p>As you can see on page 30, based on further deleveraging and the increase of the operating profit, the net debt to EBITDA ratio came down from 1.9 to 1.6 times. This provides us with the flexibility to realize additional opportunities resulting from the mega-trends in the future. We expect this figure to increase in 2012 given our higher CapEx figure and our proposed bolt-on acquisition of Air Products Continental European Homecare business. The net debt to EBITDA ratio would slightly increase, including the pro forma figures of that acquisition. This still leaves us enough headroom. I also want to remind you that in October 2011, both rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, confirmed their ratings which are A- and A3, both with stable outlook.</p>
          <p>Coming now to the net debt bridge on slide 31, in the reporting period, we were able to reduce our net debt by &#x20AC;403 million. &#x20AC;1.65 billion of the investment cash flow were allocated to securities serving a liquidity reserve. The remaining CapEx of &#x20AC;1.25 billion and the &#x20AC;757 million outflow for interest and dividend payments were overcompensated by the operating cash flow leading to a net debt position of around &#x20AC;5.1 billion by the end of the year 2011.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you'll find our debt maturity profile. Our conservative approach regarding refinancing and our solid financial profile are reflected in the balance mix of financing instruments and long-dated maturity profile. We made successful use of the capital markets over the course of the year and improved Linde's financial debt profile by refinancing existing debt early. To further optimize our maturity profile, we issued in June a &#x20AC;600 million 10-year bond with a spread of 60 basis points above mid swap and a coupon of 3.875% to refinance the &#x20AC;360 million partial buyback of bonds maturing in 2012 and 2013. An additional &#x20AC;750 million seven-year bond with a spread of 87 basis points above mid swap and then coupon of 3.125% was issued in December.</p>
          <p>From a total perspective, we have now more than 90% of our debt in the capital markets. These two transactions enabled us to secure long-term funds at attractive levels and to extend the profile of our financial debt. More than 80% of our outstanding financial debt had a maturity of more than one year and 50% of more than five years. The short-term financial debt of &#x20AC;1.3 billion is covered by more than twice by cash and securities of &#x20AC;2.7 billion and on top by our &#x20AC;2.5 billion fully undrawn syndicated credit facility, which expires in 2050.</p>
          <p>This leaves us with a liquidity reserve of close to &#x20AC;4 billion. As a result of the successful deleveraging and the interest rate management, the group's financial result has improved in the years 2008 to 2010, and we could keep it stable during the reporting period.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, I will give you a bit more insight on the performance of our pension plans. The important drivers for the development of the net obligation of our pensions has been the net effect of contributions and payments of &#x20AC;200 million and actuarial losses of &#x20AC;335 million, mainly caused by lower interest rates. The impact of the latter has been compensated to a large degree by the performance of our pension plans, which resulted in an increase of the fair value of plan assets by &#x20AC;153 million.</p>
          <p>The positive development of the pension assets is the result of a very successful asset management. For more background, you can see the performance on the right-hand side of the slide of our major plans in UK and Germany. Both plans had a double-digit performance in 2011 and were well ahead of the expected performance. The last column shows that this is not a singular effect in the reporting period. The performance on, a three-year basis, was also double-digit.</p>
          <p>Important drivers for this development were the continued reduction of the equity share to 20% in 2011 and an early shift from bonds to government bonds, which are AAA rated also today and further diversification of asset classes, especially towards the emerging market debt.</p>
          <p>I move on to page 34. In the year 2011, the financial result amounted to &#x20AC;291 million, 2010 and 2011 financial results include positive one-time effects of around &#x20AC;30 million, which will not occur in 2012. In addition, we expect an increase of our net debt position due to the mentioned acquisitions of the homecare business of AP. Therefore, we anticipate a negative financial result of around &#x20AC;330 million from today's perspective.</p>
          <p>Due to the significant improvement in earnings, the tax expense rose by &#x20AC;40 million to &#x20AC;375 million. This corresponds then to an income tax rate of 23.2%. This decrease in the tax rate is mainly due to a change of the tax rate regarding deferred taxes for the purchase price allocation amortization. For this year, we expect the group's tax rate to be around 24%.</p>
          <p>We then proposed to our shareholders in the Annual General Meeting on May 4 to increase the dividend for the fiscal year 2011 to &#x20AC;2.50 per share. With an increase of 13.6%, this proposal is slightly higher than our dividend policy would propose. As you know, our dividend policy says that the dividend should roughly reflect the development of the operating profit.</p>
          <p>I will close my presentation with a short summary on page 36. The year 2011 was a very strong year for Linde. Group sales and profit achieved new record levels. Operating profit grew at a faster pace than sales and led to an improvement of our Group operating margin as well as of our gas operating margin. We further reduced net debt and had a very solid balance sheet. Hence, proving in the past, Linde has a very resilient business model and a competitive setup, which is the basis for sustainable profitable growth. We could even optimize Linde's resilience due to a higher contribution to growth markets, the increase in the Tonnage business and the development of the healthcare business.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we focus on our three mega-trends. Already today, we have a strong position in growth markets and benefit from the business synergies between our Gases and Engineering portfolio, which are even more important in the energy environment mega-trend, as mentioned by Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle.</p>
          <p>Based on a sustainable cash flow generation, a long-term financing and a very strong project pipeline, we are able to invest in 2012 above 13% CapEx/sales ratio. Beyond 2012, our guidance for the Gases division is a CapEx sales ratio of 13%-plus. That means we are well prepared for the realization of growth potentials resulting from the mega-trends in the future.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, our HPO program was significantly supported, improving our efficiency in the three years of its existence. We are very well on track with the implementation of all our different projects and we are confident to reach our targeted gross cost savings for the four years program at the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we reconfirm our mid-term guidance of at least &#x20AC;4 billion operating profit and 14% adjusted ROCE or higher in the year 2014.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. We will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, please. Sarah?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Evgenia Molotova. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Sorry, do you hear me? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hear you now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Sorry, something with my line. I have three questions if I may. One is on cash flow because &#x2013; first of all, congratulations on great results. And second for the questions on the cash flow. Your return on capital employed improved by another 50 basis points, however, your cash flow stayed flat, if you could comment on that, it would be great.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on growth in income in your JVs. As far as I understand that growth, not as fast as the top line growth because you have some ramp-up cost in China, et cetera. So when do you think you will be able to realize the full potential from your JVs?</p>
          <p>And the third one is on HPO program because obviously your target of 14% return on capital employed implies further improvement in profitability, and HPO is supposed to be finished by 2012. So do you see some other cost-cutting programs after HPO is done? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Evgenia, may I answer the question related to HPO?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. As the performance period &#x2013; the official performance period of the HPO runs out at the end of this year 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; well, you can assume that within the target we set for 2014 with &#x20AC;4 billion EBITDA, we just assume that we could keep and can keep the momentum out of the HPO program and will further go on with the &#x2013; more or less the same productivity targets for our company. So we want to keep the momentum. We have achieved with the HPO a significant impact within our whole organization. 50,000 people around the world, when you ask them, even a driver or filler in Vietnam or whatever, they have an idea what HPO is. It's a process improvement and standardization program being rolled out. And we will keep the momentum, and you can assume that also in the years to come, after the official timeline of the HPO program is over, we will keep the momentum and further go for productivity improvements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take your cash flow question again. As I mentioned in the presentation, it's mainly because of two reasons: higher tax payments and a lower level of advanced payments in Linde Engineering, which is not unnormal for a quarterly impact, as you know, depending on the order intake level of the different quarters. But it's also really, I think, important to understand it's related to what we love, which is future growth in the Tonnage business. And I think we were asking, when we compare that with the development after the BOC acquisition, we were always asking for &#x2013; and stronger Tonnage growth in the years to come. And now we have higher internal sales between Gas and Engineering, this will be visible in the future cash flow contribution of these Tonnage schemes coming on stream.</p>
          <p>On the joint venture activity question I think you have to understand that the net income contribution is &#x2013; there is also against the financing scheme of the different joint ventures of the years. So, of course, when for example Abu Dhabi would be in their later lifecycle, then of course you would see a very different contribution from the early years of the startup. The ambition is, of course, here, to further grow that business because we have seen, really, business opportunities through the joint venture model, which we would not get if we wouldn't have it from the perspective of customer relationship with customers like ADNOC or Financave in their respective markets. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. And can I &#x2013; if I may, just one last question to Mr. Reitzle, your comment on Bloomberg that you expect some large projects in 2012 and it's subject to financing, if you could somehow develop what projects and in what areas do you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean &#x2013; maybe &#x2013; I don't know what was reported on Bloomberg. I only can tell you that we already at the Autumn Press Conference mentioned that out of the clean energy efforts over the last several years, we now see some interest being potential projects in certain areas in the world and this will be so-called mega projects. And today we answered the question in our press conference here in Munich in the following way that one of these projects where &#x2013; when the project will be realized, we are in, and that will be our first big mega project. And &#x2013; but it &#x2013; this project itself, the initiators, they still have to finally arrive at a financing scheme. So it is in these days for a very big project still a certain challenge to get the financing. So it's not the financing on our side. So it's the financing on our customer side. And should they succeed with the financing, then we can report one big project win. It's already clear that when the project will be realized, it will be Linde together with another big German engineering company realizing the project. So it all depends on the financing on the customer side, not on our side. I don't know what was reported in Bloomberg but it &#x2013; maybe &#x2013; they picked it up in an irritating way.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Redenius. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Jeremy Redenius from Sanford Bernstein. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three questions. The first one is with the decreasing cost of natural gas in the U.S. do you expect to see much of a cost benefit in your business for the next couple years there? And if so what proportion of that would you expect to actually be able to retain as opposed to passing on your customers contractually?</p>
          <p>And second, the &#x2013; can you please split the &#x2013; the full year gas sales growth, the comparable growth in the pricing and volume impacts, and talk about the pricing trends you see in the different regions? And then thirdly, I see your &#x2013; I see cost inflation in the SG&amp;A and R&amp;D lines is about 10% &#x2013; to me about 10%. Could you describe what's driving an increase? Are you seeing a significant wage inflation in Germany? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for your questions. The first question will be answered by Dr. Aldo Belloni.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, your question regarding the cost decrease in the United States and the impact on our business, well, first off, just monetarily, there is no impact because normally the natural gas portion of our &#x2013; of Tonnage business is a pass-through element. However, we have noticed that due to this cost decrease, there is a big incentive for our off-site customers to increase production. And we have seen that already this is taking place, so it's a volume and revenue effect, not margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I take the second question regarding the volume price development in the different regions. As you have heard about in the previous conference calls of the quarters of 2011, we were probably slightly more confident than others regarding pricing. And I think once a year, we can really talk about the price effects very clearly.</p>
          <p>For the yearly basis in the Gases business, we have seen roughly 60% in volume out of the gross and roughly 40% in pricing. And overall, we have seen a very strong fourth quarter from a pricing perspective where the higher contributor came out of pricing compared to volume.</p>
          <p>When we look into the different regions, we have seen a development where we had positive price effects in all regions, I think that's very important. And of course, we have seen in the fast-growing markets, the emerging markets, we have seen a higher volume contribution than price contributions.</p>
          <p>And then the other question, cost inflation, R&amp;D, admin and so on. Very shortly, first of all, you can assume that we have a very, very close look, we are famous, I think for that, to be very lean and efficient when it comes to overhead cost and central cost. For example, here in Munich world headquarters, we have only 250 people, I think. You can compare our overhead structure with other comparable companies, you will see that we are very lean. So you can always assume that when there is an increase like here now, what you're addressing, that it is in this case, for example, ramping up our applications technology, which is part of our overall strategy becoming more customer-oriented, and not only selling molecules but other applications, so we are hiring several people, and also we are ramping up our so-called Clean Energy team. But the main driver for this is finally and very simply, it's IT, because as you may be aware, all the newly defined standardized processes out of HPO will be finally mirrored in a one Linde template approach, it's an SAP template.</p>
          <p>Today, I think we mentioned that already a few times, we have many, many different IT systems used &#x2013; being in use around the world. That comes also from the acquisitions because each company we acquire has a certain own IT environment and now when the processes are standardized in HPO, then the next wave will be that all &#x2013; step by step, all the IT systems will migrate into one template. And that really will then be a breakthrough for the company and we will reach then by this, a new level of competitiveness and lean overhead structure. But in order to roll it out, we have to accept certain cost for this year, next year, for the next, let's say, three years, we will ramp up that, and that should, over time, lead to further &#x2013; better basis for cost improvements. So it's well-spent money really.</p>

          <p>Okay. Understood. Why just &#x2013; sorry, if I could ask one clarification on the U.S. gas. I was actually asking also about in the indirect effect, if cheaper gas leads to cheaper utilities, are you able to preserve some of that value in your part of the value chain?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert, thank you. Norbert, hello. Before you ask your questions, I think we would like to answer the last question. Of course, the effect of the pass-through of natural gas costs for our hydrogen schemes overall and in the U.S. market. As you know, we have, of course, some business in the U.S. related to hydrogen, if we will participate from that one, that's without question, the case. So Norbert, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Yes. Thanks. Question from my side, three questions. The first question is regarding the margin in the fourth quarter of Gases was really &#x2013; yeah, outstanding, I believe, with 28.2% also quite better than the last quarters before. First question on that is, was there some one-off or is that the sustainable margin going forward into 2012 and is really the effect of HPO, so especially if we compare fourth quarter with the other quarter from a margin side?</p>
          <p>Second question's also regarding this mega project. I believe, honestly, if I compare this with the CapEx guidance of &#x20AC;1.8 billion, that that is &#x2013; if there is a major project coming, not included yet, or this is the case and perhaps still you can elaborate a little bit in which technology and which region perhaps this project could be?</p>
          <p>And the third question, perhaps, regarding also future projects. We once discussed on the Dow Saudi Arabia Sadara project, so now six months going forward, is there already something you can tell us, some project where you are in final decisions or &#x2013; and &#x2013; on that? And perhaps, last one, you mentioned that there was some maintenance shutdown from clients in the last quarter. Is that a sizeable number or should we neglect it? So can you elaborate a little bit on that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Norbert, for that question. First of all, on the margin in quarter four for the Gases business. I can guess I already mentioned we have seen really a very strong price contribution in the fourth quarter in the Gases business. And as you know, even though we have an extremely resilient business model, there are some seasonality over the year. And the average gas margin of the year 2011 were 27.5%. So we don't expect really to now see the flight level of quarter four as a full year flight level for the quarters to come, that would be too much. Because as you remember, the discussions in the quarters related to pricing, we always had a question what about pricing the others were communicating, I think, more difficult pricing effects.</p>
          <p>So we have seen really an price momentum, which was very positive. But we wouldn't recommend now for your models to use this as a full-flight level of the year. The aspirational target of HPO, I think, is unchanged, to increase the margin, but as Dr. Reitzle said, we also see some further pre-investments when we talk about IT harmonization to have a better HPO footprint of the future and of the growth markets in 2012 too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we then talk about the projects, I think we do not &#x2013; or we cannot mix up the things. So when we talk about mega projects, we also talk about projects which are a combination of our strength in the Gases business on the one hand, for example, for operational management and also for our engineering business. So in combination, what we heard, some of that is related to Linde Engineering, it would have an significant order intake for our Linde Engineering business. And from an CapEx guidance perspective, the &#x20AC;1.8 billion CapEx level in 2012 would include some of what you mentioned from the perspective of what we have seen in the market that we were discussing over the last quarter, I think, but not all. Because if we would win these projects, the effect of CapEx in this year is one part but it's not the most significant part, right? This is in the later years. So we also see a slight level, if we win some of these, that we continue to have an higher cap expense for growth in the future.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Pete Mackey. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. It's Peter Mackey here from Morgan Stanley. I've got three questions &#x2013; four questions actually. Firstly on the cylinder business, now you've talked about cylinder being late cycle. I wonder, given the sort of contraction of activity that we saw &#x2013; which appears to have been temporary in nature in the fourth quarter in these broader market, whether we should expect to see a reflection of that at some point over the next couple of quarters, whether you actually think that the cylinder business or the current level of growth is sustainable for the time being?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the healthcare business, I wonder if you could talk about the profitability of the Air Products business that you bought in broad terms, and perhaps address some of the issues that your peers have been talking about &#x2013; and notably Air Products, about the outlook for the healthcare business, because they're obviously rather more cautious in their sort of view of healthcare opportunities. And within the context of the healthcare business, you talked about having a over 200 tender wins in 2011. Can you give out some sort of context on what sort of total are we talking about and what the net effect between wins and losses might have been, please?</p>
          <p>And then if I could just ask on the dividend policy, as you mentioned, you grew it more than your EBITDA in &#x2013; for 2011. Given that you're expecting slower growth rates in 2012 than in 2011, what message should we take away from that decision &#x2013; that dividend decision? Should we expect another above EBITDA growth rate, a dividend in 2012? What's the thought process behind that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with your question four, dividend policy, I think we mentioned that a few times and we stick to that also for the future, which means that more or less, not accurately and exactly translated, but with all the dividend, the dividend policy is in line always with our profitability. And you can expect that the Linde history shows that a dividend can only be flat or go up, never go down. That's something we even could keep as a philosophy in 2009 and that is the principle of our company. And actually, the yield, as you know, is always around 2%. I think looking at the share price for the total shareholder return, we focus more on developing further our share price but we want to move the dividends always more or less in line with our financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I continue with some of the other questions. On the cylinder side, I think what you have seen as in development and what we guided for 2011 and 5% growth &#x2013; around 5% growth in the cylinder business, is something, which is, under normal circumstances, possible for 2012, too. You know the volatility in the markets, some people are more negative, some are more positive, so that can change. But overall, I think we have seen an very strong development of the cylinder business in 2011 and that's a flight level 4% to 5% which, I think, is possible also for 2012.</p>
          <p>I think I understand your interest of the profitability for the homecare acquisition of AP's business. I think we mentioned that, it's &#x2013; the guidance does not say sales multiple guidance, I think I would not recommend that one. The guidance really is &#x2013; of course, the profitability of that business, the only thing which we guide at that moment in time, it's an above-average margin of the Gases business and it's also above average of the Gases margin of quarter four 2011, if you allow me that one.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective, I think the strategic question related to the homecare business for us, really the homecare business, is a future platform of growth and it's also about scale. And we see that we can achieve, with this acquisition, the scalability in our European homecare business and we see definitely also synergies in this business. And it's a difference if you can track 10 customers on one route or five. So from that perspective, I think it was fully in line with our strategy and we also see that, as a basis for the future, if you want to be in that business, you have to be sizeable in that business because future platform questions, opportunities to link patients from hospitals into homecare also through our renewal center setup, the nursing home strategy in Europe is fully consistent.</p>
          <p>So on the tenders, I think it would be too much, honestly, to go here in details. I think this is nothing new. 2011 is nothing new. I think, of course, we won more tenders than we lost in 2011. We had some weaker years in 2010, for example, when we have the start of 2010, here we also learned some lessons there, so overall, I think we do not want to go here into too much detail. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. It's sort of related, I think, to the mega-trends. The new plant in Arkansas, you're sticking with, which I presume is a standalone plant focused on the merchant oxygen and nitrogen. I'm just wondering is that reflecting that confidence that you see ahead or do you have a lot of that plant already ramped up or will ramp up extremely quickly looking forward?</p>
          <p>And then just a follow up on the CapEx, against my number anyway, the CapEx was slightly light last year. And obviously, looking at next or this year will be slightly higher. I'm just wondering if there was any delays towards the end of the year that just flipped over into this year from last year,  like a little more? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The investment decision for the merchant plant, you are right, is the merchant plant in the Arkansas and the decision was duly based on the capacity utilization of the current platform, though the plant has a quite fast ramp-up in terms of loading.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Nadeshda Demidova from Equinet. I have two questions. Would you please provide us a little bit of help for the expected distribution of startups in the Tonnage scheme over the year? And is it half in H1 2012 and half in H2, that's evenly distributed over the year or is the distribution more back-end loaded? How should we see that? And the second question, how do you see your target over &#x20AC;4 billion EBITDA by 2014 from today's point of view? Is this target absolutely realistic with these variables or is it rather challenging but achievable? And what are the financial drivers behind this target?</p>
          <p>I'm just trying to understand how we are going to get there? How should we see the sales and the profitability development in this context especially in Gases division? If we, for example, assume that the industrial gases should grow at 6% per annum in the midterm. And is your target driven by the above the market growth by, let's say, 80% per annum? And in this case, you will need a sustainable EBITDA margin of clearly above 28% for your gas business, which is still an increase versus your very good 2011 level. In this increase, should we &#x2013; I guess, the combination of the persisting HPO effect and, of course, effect of more favorable portfolio mix due to the mentioned mega project, in other words, I would like to know whether the EBITDA margin of more than 28% might be sustainable for Gases business despite significantly increased basis in the midterm? Or if this scenario is not a realistic case, should we then assume more aggressive sales growth due to your great exposure to the rapidly growing markets rather than increase in profitability? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I definitely understand your model now.</p>

          <p>Good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I can help you a little bit but I cannot help you with all. First of all, I think 2012, when we talk about contributions from a project pipeline perspective in Tonnage it's more second half, definitely, than first half. I think this is fair to say. And as you have seen in the presentation, I think the very strong message is it continues already into 2014. And I would say, 2013 is, let's say, more balanced than 2012, and 2014 is definitely more first half-related because of the timing effect of project we have signed already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a perspective of the targets. I think the targets are challenging but achievable, as you said. So you gave the right answer. I think &#x2013; and it is related to the volatility of the markets. I mean there are a lot of impacts not only currency related but we see today that 2013 can have an, again, better growth rate than 2012, but of course this is uncertain. I think what we have to say that the bolt-on acquisition of the AP business also made the target more achievable than without an acquisition. I think this is also true.</p>
          <p>And of course, HPO, or as Dr. Reitzle said our follow-up is not a change in a way or our follow-up is in continuation of all our structural initiatives. And you have to understand that this is related to Linde's historical acquisitional footprint because we have acquired a couple of companies and now we go into the global standard for a local business model, and therefore we plan, of course, further contributions and we will talk about that in the future and not today. So thank you for your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. A few questions if I may. First of all, with regards to the Engineering business, you've guided for a flat year-over-year sales in Engineering for 2012. If I look at the order backlog, it has been &#x2013; it is lower than it was last year but also the years before, part of that is obviously ADNOC. But if I understand correctly that the order backlog is kind of a guidance for the top line development of the two following years, is there &#x2013; are there additional contracts that you expect that give you the confidence for sales going forward? And also, if we see the current order backlog what would that mean for maybe the sales in 2013 in that business?</p>
          <p>Second question, the shale gas opportunities obviously there's a trend or an idea that people expect, the asset base of petrochemical operations in North America to increase due to the access to cheap raw material price. Would you see your market position, which is not the leading market position opposed to other regions to be a competitive disadvantage for taking part in that growth or do you think this is a completely new game?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, a bit of a housekeeping issue, tax rate has been lower than last year, could you give us maybe an update on the tax rate guidance going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start with the Engineering question. Of course, you are correct that the backlog has decreased. We are working off the ADNOC project, as you correctly pointed out. On the other side, we are very confident that this year, there will be quite a few petrochemical tender decisions, and we want to get our fair share and I think they are very sort of well-filled pipeline of projects.</p>
          <p>Shale gas in U.S., of course, the ease and availability in North America is spurring the activity on new crackers or an expansion of existing crackers. We have been just awarded a very large cracking furnace at the petrochemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas. We are, as you say, we are not the established &#x2013; most established EPC contractor in the United States, but you have probably seen that we have resuscitated our collaboration with Bechtel, and this is our strategy to join Bechtel in chasing projects, and we have already been asked by numerous petrochemical players to develop proposals. They are, of course, evaluating the sustainability of this pit-stop advantage, and we hope that one or the other will go ahead, and the combination of Linde and Bechtel in this field, it's putting us at the same eye-level as our competitors, and you know that we have been the leading ethylene contractor in the last five years, if you will include our successes in the Gulf.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Maybe a bit of a follow-up towards the North American question, as you mentioned Port Arthur. Is there a &#x2013; maybe you're in a good position with Bechtel for the engineering contract, but in the subsequent maybe gas providing contracts for the network of the new asset, can you be competitive in an area where you are not, so far, not the leading provider yet?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of clarification questions, follow-ups, really, from questions that have been previously asked. In terms of the further efficiencies that you're targeting, that you're aiming for, are we to assume that the majority of those are going to be operating efficiencies? Or are you now sort of operating margin-wise where you'd expect to be in the Gases business and incremental efficiencies come through on, I suppose, the capital efficiency perspective in order to achieve your additional 100 basis point improvement and return on capital? So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the balance between operating and capital efficiency looking forward to 2014?</p>
          <p>And then within that &#x20AC;4 billion, your EBITDA target, is it &#x2013; are we to assume again that the Engineering business is generating the medium term 8% margin within that outlook? And finally, just very quickly, I wonder if you could just give us a steer on where you think the Group sort of corporate overhead cost will run over the next year or two? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, thank you for more details. I mean further efficiencies, it is as you said, I think it is, from an overall perspective, still a way to go, from a perspective of efficiency &#x2013; operating efficiencies. I mean we were talking about the IT harmonization that is not a one-year program. That's a multi-year program and it's against the country setup, which is not small. So from that perspective, the harmonization of processes this takes time and you cannot start in a greenfield approach, right? You have to move with your existing businesses. That's important. Against that development also, we expect, and that was your last question, an slightly higher level in corporate costs for the years to come because it's also related to some pre-investments for this efficiency and it's rather an level which is, let's say, around &#x20AC;180 million for the year.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective &#x2013; but it will pay off, as Dr. Reitzle said, I think you have take that to get the next wave of efficiencies from an operational perspective. And only to tell you from all of the investments we do, of course, it's also against a new level for operating efficiencies because we can substitute something, which is not according to the global standard, when we talk about the filling plant, for example. And if we invest, then we do have more efficiencies in the systems. So from that perspective, that's one part.</p>
          <p>The second part related to capital efficiency, of course, that's for us very important and that goes in two directions. One is that we are more competitive on the investment perspective because of further standardization in combination with Linde Engineering. As you know and we talked about that, we have opened up hubs in the emerging markets, two in China, two in India, and this is a basis for the strong project wins you have seen and which were communicated again today. So from that perspective, that's important.</p>
          <p>And from a pure financial capital efficiency, it's important to understand, of course, that the balance of Linde, and I think this something which investors sometimes don't fully understand. Of course, we do have the BOC acquisition in our balance sheet and this means we have goodwill in our balance sheet and we have some intangibles in our balance sheet. And all investments we do, they will help us to further increase our return on capital employed over the long run. You don't see that in our cash perspective, of course, because with all the great disposals and all the efficiency we got from synergies, we have came down with net debt much faster, probably 2.5 years, 3 years faster than you could assume from an starting point in 2006 when we communicated BOC. I think that's important to understand.</p>
          <p>And in the engineering margin, of course, we gave the guidance, long term, 8%, is the world-class leading margin. The ambition is always to outperform that. So it's up to you how you assume that we can outperform that market at that moment in time. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have just two. First on the portfolio of opportunities, I wondered if you could talk more specifically about the trends you're seeing. Are you seeing a change in project sizes or different industries involved? You mentioned that there's a lot in the emerging markets but some competitors have talked about more projects also emerging in the developed markets, so I wondered if you could talk a bit more about this topic? And then secondly, I wondered if you could provide detail on how much of your CapEx was for maintenance purposes, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think these are now detailed questions. I think we can confirm that we also see those in the opportunity pipeline. We definitely see further activities in the Asian markets and not only China, of course. And we also see, in the mature markets, opportunities especially related to some of the energy environmental mega trends. I think that's important to understand. And the other part is, of course, you have also here some expansion or renewals from the perspective of cost competitiveness of our customers and then they also are prepared to take decisions to invest in the mature countries. I think both is visible, it's not exclusive. The one or the other. From a maintenance CapEx perspective, it's always, as we said, when we talk about the guidance of 13%, then roughly one-sixth of the 13% is maintenance and repair, the above 13% level is normally all for growth. That's the rough guidance we can give to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Yes I had a couple of other questions if I can, please. Firstly, the mega project that you mentioned that is sort of, let's say, your customer is awaiting financing, maybe I should infer quite simply, but is it a plant sale into a captive project or it an industrial gas supply contract that you be &#x2013; looking at there?</p>
          <p>And secondly, and I do apologize perhaps drawing some of these comparisons, but if I look at your HPO program, you're essentially taking out roughly 1.5% of sales in terms of cost each year, which is exactly the same level of efficiency improvements as <mark type="ph" /> Eller Keed (01:44:31) has been targeting with its ALMA project. But actually, they've been achieving roughly 50% more than that over the last couple of years. And given the slightly more disparate nature through &#x2013; of your assets having been built up through acquisition, I'm just &#x2013; I sort of rather assume that you would probably have more opportunities for using best practice and cost-cutting opportunities and so on. I wonder if you could just sort of review your &#x2013; the HPO project and your expectations from that in that context, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the end, bottom line counts here, and whatever gross number you apply, how much can you bring bottom line is the fair question. I think you should not underestimate the synergy we carved out of the business when we talk about the acquisition. But on the other hand, of course, when we do new investments, as I said earlier, there is a capital efficiency included as well as operating efficiency. So from that perspective, I think it would be too much detail now to compare different percent levels. In the end, we are communicating in the HPO program until 2012 and gross cost saving, I think that's important. You'll see the progression from a marginal perspective, so some of that is really coming bottom line as we confirm that, and then let's talk about all the future opportunities when we really communicate with you the follow-up of the same agenda of harmonization. And the first question I hand over to Aldo.</p>

          <p>Hi, Peter. Well, <mark type="ph" /> Diorca (1:46:19) has already alluded to the hybrid nature of this mega project. It is predominantly is a plant sales project, but there is a piece of gas investment and also a piece of operating and maintenance, which will generate sales over the life cycle of the project, okay. But predominantly, in terms of sales generation in the next three to four years, is a plant sales here.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is <mark type="ph" /> Jack Rack at Macquarie Chemicals (01:47:01). Two questions if I may. One question regarding slide 25 and 26 that you have shown, the share of sales and operating profits generated in the different clusters, major markets and growth markets. Can you elaborate a bit how this share developed in the last years and is there any target in coming years? Or is there also a structural reason behind this share why mature markets are showing a higher profitability? And the second question, if I may, in your Annual Report, you also mentioned that the tax loss carry forwards increased by roughly &#x20AC;30 million due to some losses in Saudi Arabia and in Brazil, can you please elaborate a little bit on this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question on the split of growth markets and emerging market and mature markets, I think it's a result of &#x2013; of course, our starting point is it was growing over the years. I think we started this something like 20%, 26% or so common revenue share when we came together with BOC, so that's a very strong growth. Is there a target behind that? Answer there is, really, of course, because of growth in population and structure of the market and higher gas density per inhabitant, that's driving the growth in the emerging market based on our very strong market share positions.</p>
          <p>That's one part but &#x2013; and now the but is important &#x2013; when we talk about other opportunities, when we talk about energy projects, this is not excluded in emerging markets and we have a very nice slide in the presentation about the growth opportunities in the market on page 11 of the presentation. I think this gives you the guidance. So it would be clear that we take all opportunities wherever they arise and with this trend of a faster growth in the emerging market, then, of course, you will see an continuation of growth in proportion to mature markets but no target.</p>
          <p>The second question, I think, is related to operational issues in these markets from an perspective of tax loss carry forward and I think we have to come back to you on that issue, I don't have that available for you, it's rather too small. I wouldn't make an issue out of that.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I just have a one quick question. I was quite supposed to see sequential growth in operating profit in Asia in the fourth quarter, given the weakness we've seen in the Chinese steel industry, I know that Asia is bit more than China but I would assume that Chinese steel actually is quite an important segment for you. Could you just elaborate, please, what you're seeing in that segment at the moment and what you're seeing in the fourth quarter? And what was really behind that growth and operating profit? Was it mostly the pricing impact you elaborated on or what actually drove that sequential profit? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for your question. I think it is, as you said, it was related to some pricing issues in that market. I think on the first quarter, it would be now really too early to dig down into the first quarter development. In the middle of the first quarter, of course, the first &#x2013; you know the development overall, it was Chinese New Year in the first two months, all of that is included and would be now not wise to talk about that at that moment in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you could just comment on the impact from the steel industry on your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think there is nothing special to report on, honestly. I think we have seen what we expected and I cannot comment on that because we have not the quarter one call at this moment in time, I think, and here is nothing special to mention at that point in time. I think we have, as you know, we have built our strategy in China on the big players at that moment in time and we were not moving into the, let's say, third-tier &#x2013; second-tier business. We have moved in recently but this is not coming on stream at that moment in time. So I think we are rather with the consolidators than which the ones who will be consolidated.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. <mark type="ph" /> Ann Weaver from BHS Bank (01:51:59). A quick kind of housekeeping question on the D&amp;A in Gases in Q4. It's risen compared to the run rate in the preceding quarters, and I think there is an impairment of &#x20AC;26 million in the full year in the D&amp;A charge. We have seen the &#x20AC;50 million for FX in Q2, so what is the rest about in Q4, presumably in Q4? Thanks.</p>
