          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ConocoPhillips Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Jen and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the presentation over to Mr. Gary Russell, General Manager of Investor Relations.  Please proceed, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jen, and welcome to everyone to our conference call this morning for the fourth quarter of 2007.  Joining me this morning is Jim Mulva, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Carrig, our Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>The presentation that we're going to be going through this morning has been prepared to help you understand more fully the financial and operating results of the company during the fourth quarter of 2007.  You can find this presentation and access it on our website at conocophillips.com.</p>
          <p>On page 2, you're familiar with our Safe Harbor Statement.  It essentially says that during our presentation today and in answering your questions that you might have, that we will be including forward-looking statements based on what we expect currently and actual results may differ materially from those expectations.  You can find a list of items that might cause material differences in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn this call over to Jim Mulva.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Gary, thank you and I appreciate all those who are participating in our conference call. I'm really on page 3, which is fourth quarter highlights.  You can see in the fourth quarter our net income was $4.4 billion.  Our operations, in the quarter we generated 6.9 billion of cash.  We reduced our debt-to-cap ratio to 19% and we purchased $2.5 billion of our common stock.</p>
          <p>On our upstream business, we produced 2.26 million BOE a day and that includes an estimated 426,000 BOE per day from our &#x2013; we call investment segment.  On the downstream we improved our crude processing capacity utilization by 1% from the previous quarter to 95%.</p>
          <p>Now I'm moving on to page number 4, total company net income, where we compare the fourth quarter to the prior quarter.  You can see in the fourth quarter net income of 4.4 billion. That's $2.71 per share and that's about 700 million more than the prior quarter. Then we start on the left side of the chart.  You can see that we had lower gains this quarter from our asset rationalization program, which reduced our fourth quarter net income $211 million when you compare it to the third quarter.  Then moving over toward the right, prices, margins and other market impacts improved fourth quarter income about 1.4 billion, while higher volumes in E&amp;P were more than offset by lower volumes in LUKOIL and Chemicals, thereby reducing fourth quarter net income $57 million when compared to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now we had higher production taxes in Alaska, result of the recent legislation, and that also reduced fourth quarter net income $234 million. And then there were a number of other items that in aggregate reduced fourth quarter net income 243 million on a sequential basis. I'm going to talk about all these variances in more detail in the subsequent slides.</p>
          <p>So I'm going to move on now to page number five, total company cash flow. So again we start on the left and you can see we generated 6.9 billion of cash from operations in the fourth quarter. That's about a billion more than the third quarter, and that's along with our beginning cash balance provided about 8.3 billion in available funds that was for use in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So during the quarter we spent you can see just about 4.3 billion on our capital program, we paid 652 million in dividends, reduced our debt by 189 million, and we repurchased &#x2013; or purchased 2.5 billion of our shares. We had 515 million in proceeds from asset sales and 243 million in other sources, that gets you up near that 758 million green bar toward the right side. That left us with a cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter 1.4 billion, just a little bit more than what we had at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to go on to page six, total company cash flow, where we look at what were all the funds that were available in 2007 on the left hand side and then what did we do with all those funds. Again, this is &#x2013; summarizes for the full year 2007. If you look at the pie chart on the left you can see that during the year we generated about 24.6 billion in cash from operations, and we had 3.6 billion from asset sales and other sources, bringing us to total available funds cash, 28.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Then you look on the right side, pie chart on the right, you can see that we spent 12.9 billion on our capital investment program. Now that's slightly lower than our announced program of 13.5 billion. We paid out 2.7 billion in dividends and purchased 7 billion of our stock. Of that 7 billion purchased of our stock, about 5 billion was in the third and the fourth quarter, and we reduced our debt by $5.4 billion.  So you can see essentially on the pie chart to the right, a little bit less than half of our funds were directed toward our capital program, a little bit more than half was debt reduction, share repurchase and dividends.</p>
          <p>Now for 2008 we do not plan for debt reduction.  Our funds are really going towards our capital program, our dividends and share repurchase.  We have 10 billion remaining in our previously-announced share repurchase program, and we expect first quarter repurchases &#x2013; purchases to be between 2 and $3 billion.</p>
          <p>I'm going to move on to slide number 7, we look at the capitalization structure of the company.  On the left hand side of the slide you can see we ended 2007 with 90 billion of equity, 21.7 billion of debt.  We brought our debt-to-capital ratio down to 19%, which is slightly below the bottom of our target range at 20 to 25%.</p>
          <p>I'm going to move on to the operating segments of the company, first E&amp;P on page 8, and you can see the highlights when we look at the comparison of fourth quarter to the third quarter.  Our realized crude oil and natural gas prices around the world were higher.  Our realized crude oil price was $84.53 a barrel in the fourth quarter. That was $13.19 a barrel higher.  And our realized natural gas price in the fourth quarter was $6.66 per Mcf. And that was $1.10 per Mcf higher.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our previous guidance, E&amp;P's production sales volumes were higher than the previous quarter.  I'll talk more about this on the next slide.  And also as mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter earnings were negatively impacted by the effect of the tax changes in Alaska which increased our production taxes.</p>
          <p>So now I'm moving on to page 9 which looks at our E&amp;P production.  Production in the fourth quarter from our E&amp;P segment was 1.84 million BOE a day, and that was 76,000 BOE a day higher than the third quarter.  As you can see, starting from the left, we saw improved production in the United Kingdom and Alaska due to seasonality and lower planned and unplanned downtime.  We increased production 9,000 BOE a day essentially in the lower 48.  And then when you add 426,000 BOE a day from &#x2013; which is our estimate of the equity share of LUKOIL's production, you can see our total of 2.26 million BOE a day in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Before moving on, I refer back to our conference call in the second quarter.  Remember in the second quarter we recognized the effect of the expropriation of our Venezuelan position and we said at the second quarter that our full year production, including LUKOIL, would be 2.325 million BOE a day, and if you look at what we actually did in all of '07, we did that.  It was 2.324 million BOE a day.</p>
          <p>Now I'm moving on to page 10, E&amp;P net income.  You can see our fourth quarter income of 2.6 billion.  That's about 500 million higher than the third quarter.  So I start with the red bar on the left and you can see that we had lower gains from our asset rationalization program compared to the third quarter and its impact was a reduction of 103 million when you compare the two quarters.  Prices and other market impacts improved income $883 million.</p>
          <p>Overall, our E&amp;P sales and production volumes in the fourth quarter were higher than the third quarter and this improved income $34 million.  However, I'd like you to note that our crude sales volumes in the US were about 40,000 barrels a day lower than the prior quarter due to the timing of shipments in Alaska.  Essentially, we sold more in the third quarter, caught up in the fourth, so essentially if you look at it as an over-lift or under-lift, we're just balanced as we go in from '07 into '08.</p>
          <p>I mentioned earlier Alaska recently passed legislation that retroactively increased production taxes and the impact of this tax legislation reduced fourth quarter income 234 million of which 95 million relates to periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2007.  It also had increased production taxes in the fourth quarter, a result of higher crude oil prices and production volumes, and the majority of this is related to Alaska.  Resulting decrease in net income is included with other items in the red bar on the right which shows a 54 million sequential decrease in net income.</p>
          <p>Also included in the Other category is the impact of the favorable effect of one-time Alaska Quality Bank adjustment that occurred in the third quarter but obviously didn't occur in the fourth quarter, and we also had higher impairments.  These were partially offset by deferred tax adjustments in Canada's reduction of Canadian federal income tax and a release of escrow funds in connection with the extinguishment of Hamaca:  that's a Venezuelan project financing indebtedness and other miscellaneous items.  So all these things were in that $54 million bar.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to move from E&amp;P to Refining and Marketing, so I'm going to slide or page 11. In our downstream business we improved our crude capacity utilization to 95%, so that's up 1% compared to third quarter.  Our realized, I stress realized, worldwide refining margins were higher than the third quarter.  But our US margin at $11.56 a barrel, now that's $0.70 a barrel higher than the third quarter, and our international margin was $6.72 a barrel, and that's $0.67 higher than the third quarter. I'll go over our realized margins in more detail in the next slide.  And then the other last point I'd like to make on this slide is our turnaround and utility costs were also higher in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to move on to the net income of Refining and Marketing on page 12.  The fourth quarter net income was about 1.1 billion, which is approximately 200 million lower than the third quarter. You can see in the first red bar on the left that the fourth quarter did not have the $141 million benefit from tax legislation in Germany.  That was in our third quarter results.  We also had lower gains in our asset rationalization program, and that reduced fourth quarter income 108 million, as compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Our prices, margins and other market impacts improved net income, that's the green bar, $229 million.  We previously indicated that we expected fourth quarter results to benefit from our planned crude and refined product inventory reductions.  We estimate that prior year LIFO layer liquidation impact to be about $260 million, and most of this is associated with the formation of our downstream EnCana joint venture.</p>
          <p>Now as a result of our realized refining margins in the US, they were higher than the previous quarter in spite of lower US market indicators.  The crude differentials, higher clean product yield, and commercial trading and transactions contributed to the improvement.</p>
          <p>Now in the first quarter of 2008, we will likely be building inventories in anticipation of the switchover to summer grade gasoline.  So we would &#x2013; we normally do this &#x2013; so we would expect our refining business to return to a more normalized market capture, which for the US is around 75%. Now given our hydroskimmer refinery at Wilhelmshaven our international market capture is lower than 75%, so on a bundled basis around the world you might look at something like 70%. So, in other words, we don't see the inventory impacts that we experience as a result of the EnCana joint venture and market movements that took place in 2007 to have the same impacts as we go into the first quarter in 2008.</p>
          <p>Overall volumes in Refining and Marketing were higher than the prior quarter and that is consistent with higher refinery utilization. Then you have to look at the regional mix. The net impact resulted in a 36 million reduction in income. We had the higher value West Coast and Gulf Coast &#x2013; we had higher value West Coast and Gulf Coast refining volumes were lower than the previous quarter. But those volumes were more than offset by lower value volumes from our East Coast operations and the Central US and by much lower value volumes from the Wilhelmshaven refinery.</p>
          <p>Then there were other items in the aggregate. You can see that red bar that reduced income by 129 million. These items were higher operating costs, higher turnaround costs, utilities, and higher environmental accruals.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to go from page 12 to page 13. This is where we talk about LUKOIL and the joint ventures and corporate costs. Our estimate of fourth quarter equity earnings from LUKOIL was $649 million. This is 262 million higher than the previous quarter, mainly due to higher estimated realized prices and the absence of an 85 million reduction recorded in third quarter to align our estimate to actual results recorded by LUKOIL. The net effect of alignment was an improvement in the fourth quarter income regarding LUKOIL of $94 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Midstream business, income was 162 million, compares to 104 million in the third quarter.  Chemicals joint venture with Chevron contributed net income of 99 million; now this included a one-time capital loss tax benefit of 65 million, 65 million is included in the 99 million. So income in the third quarter was 110 million.</p>
          <p>Our Emerging Businesses contributed 2 million in the fourth quarter, that is down from &#x2013; a million from 3 million in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Corporate costs were 271 million in the fourth quarter compared to 320 million last quarter. This decrease was the result of lower net interest expense and lower acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the net impact of foreign exchange losses. For guidance going forward I think you should be looking at around $300 million in quarterly corporate costs.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the next page, 14, we look at our E&amp;P metrics first, E&amp;P and then, second, the downstream. By the way, our peer group, when we look at our peer group we look at the largest integrated international oil companies. That's made up of Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell, Total and Chevron. So this chart shows E&amp;P's income and cash per BOE for the years 2003 through 2006 as well as first three quarters and then we have the fourth quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>As you know, the effect of purchase accounting has impacted our earnings per BOE when compared to peers in both '06 and '07, but you can see our cash contribution per BOE remains very competitive. Since we're the first international oil company to report we just don't have comparisons at this point for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to slide 15, we find that the marketing peer group is the same, the largest international, publicly-traded oil companies, and you can see our income per barrel, our cash per barrel continues to be quite competitive with our peer group.</p>
          <p>Then I move on to page 16, we look at return on capital employed. The shaded area shows the same international oil company peer group, and the bar chart reflects that our ROCE with no adjustments for purchase accounting &#x2013; we do make adjustments for the peer group to reflect purchase accounting, and that is shown how the adjustments are made in table 3 attached to this presentation. Our annualized fourth quarter ROCE was 15%. That's 1% higher than the first three quarters annualized.</p>
          <p>And then I go to the last slide, page 17, outlook. Just recently announced, yesterday we acquired 50% interest in the Keystone crude oil pipeline. This pipeline, we have significant transportation requirements on the pipeline, so it's logical for us to have equity ownership. The pipeline will play a critical role in supplying Canadian crude oil to refineries in the US mid-continent.</p>
          <p>We also recently announced the decision to join and support the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership. We think this is a very good program, minimizing the environmental impact, improving energy and material efficiency of our operations.  I think this is going to have a &#x2013; this partnership will do a lot of good things for reducing gas flaring around the world.</p>
          <p>With respect to our production in the first quarter, we expect our E&amp;P first quarter segment production will be 1.8 million BOE a day.  Now remember, the 1.8 million BOE a day excludes the LUKOIL segment, and we expect &#x2013; so it's essentially flat, the same as the fourth quarter.  We expect exploration expenses to be in the range of 250 million to 300 million in the first quarter.  Downstream, we expect worldwide refining crude oil capacity utilization to be in the mid-90% range; turnaround cost in the first quarter to be about 125 million before tax.</p>
          <p>With respect to our share repurchases, we will be repurchasing about between 2 and $3 billion in the first quarter.  Remember, we've got a remaining $10 billion on our program that we have for 2008.  And then we continue to work on our asset rationalization efforts as we go into 2008, and that includes the completion of disposition of our US retail assets, and we are always looking at other assets that we feel may have more value in a tax-efficient way to others.  And then as you know, we look forward to discussing in far more detail our 2008 and subsequent years' capital and operating plans when we meet the investment community in New York on March 12th.</p>
          <p>So that completes the presentation and the comments on the slides.  So Gary and John, I think we're ready now to take questions that anyone has of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Jen, I think we're ready for questions if you'll queue them up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from Daniel Barcelo with Banc of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is actually Dave Gutterman with Herrick Research.  A couple of questions for you guys, especially James, what are your operational improvement initiatives to share for Lean manufacturing, GP and Six Sigma, and how do you see those benefiting your business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, operating excellence is obviously so important, first and foremost for good safety and environmental performance.  And we've been on a program over the last several years, multi-year program, to continue to improve our operating excellence. And we believe good financial results come from good operations and good safety and environmental performance. So it is a multi-year effort, a lot of emphasis on process hazard analysis, continuing to update everything that we do upstream and downstream and pipelines. And so this program is never over but we are always looking for that operational reliability of another 1 or 2%.</p>
          <p>So you will hear if you come to our March 12 financial community presentation a lot of emphasis that we have and continue to place on operational reliability. If you have reasonably high oil prices, and gas prices and crack spreads, you don't realize them if you don't run well. And so by running well we realize that better financial performance &#x2013; but by running well and not taking operations up and down, we know that we have far more safer operations and it really does contribute towards lowering and constraining our cost of operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you, sir. Your next question is from Doug Terreson with Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In E&amp;P and Refining and Marketing, profits were penalized by what you guys called lower net gains from asset rationalization by right around $0.13 per share in relation to the previous period. So for clarification, my question regards the absolute level of gains from asset rationalization during the period, meaning while the sequential earnings benefit was lower, by what amount did it positively affect profits during the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I don't know. John or &#x2013; I don't have that number immediately at hand for myself. Doug, what you are saying is just what are the gains...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The net gains from what we sold in the fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, while they look at that, we also had some impairments because we wrote down some assets. Even though they weren't sold we did write down some things like our position in Ecuador...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>And other places. But I don't know, maybe we might have to come back...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can tell you in E&amp;P they were about 48 million.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Doug, I think if you look at the certain items page you will pick up about 25 million for the US E&amp;P...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And 147 million for international E&amp;P and a few other this and that's, probably total 170 or 180 million.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't &#x2013; gains from asset disposition are pretty modest in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would say, we have always put a lot of emphasis on making sure that when we sell something it is tax-efficient. And I just saw a report here this past day, that if you look at our disposition program that we announced in the latter part of 2006, if we go through 2006 and '07, what we've already sold, it's been very tax-efficient.  I don't want to go on the exact number, but that's what we thought was important.</p>
          <p>And we're not interested in selling something at a high price and then paying half of the proceeds to the tax entity.  So it's been very efficient.  But we continue to look as we go into 2008, what else can we be looking at selling and making sure that it doesn't hurt us in any way in terms of our strategic objectives, but it's also tax-efficient.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And Jim, I also have a strategic question, too.  On Sunrise, a variety of different fields may eventually be included in that project, and liquefaction and regasification options are multiple, too.  And so I wanted to see whether you can provide an update on this project, specifically planned drilling activities in the area in 2008 that you may have? And also whether a most likely development outcome has emerged, if there is such a thing, and if so, what it might be, in your opinion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Sunrise is important to us.  And we feel that as a result of Bayu-Undan, we have a really nice position in Darwin to look at doing Sunrise by taking LNG to Darwin.  Shell is our partner at Sunrise, and they've always had an interest in doing a floating LNG concept.  Our other large partner is Woodside.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we do, we feel that the time has come to advance and develop Sunrise.  I know East Timor feels the same way.  So here recently, the CEOs of Woodside, Shell and myself really have come to a decision that this is the year that we need to be moving out on Sunrise.  In terms of whether it's a Darwin proposal or it's offshore or it's something else, I think this is the year that we've all agreed that we need to advance Sunrise.  So hopefully as we go through the year, this is going to come on our list of a project to be developed.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, the first question is just one of clarification.  In the press release, US crude differentials was also mentioned as one of the reasons why the capture rate was so high as well as a clean product slate.  And in your comments, you mentioned just the inventory factors.  I wondered if you could give us a sense as to how much of that capture was inventory, versus those other items such as...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we said in our comments that $260 million really relates to according to LIFO layer that is associated with the formation of our WRB joint venture with EnCana.  Now, we also had some pretty &#x2013; we had commercial trading results associated with how we build and reduce inventory as we go through the year to support our operations and so that's really where it comes from.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So on the product side, nothing really there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  It's just that the way we've &#x2013; we always build inventories as we go through the year, getting ready for different seasonality, in the summer to the winter. And we do that in a way that fits our operating plans for our downstream operations. And so we don't speculate in any way but we do take positions that support our physical volumes.  And the way we handled that was done really in the right way with the market movements that create a lot of value capture in our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thank you.  And then secondly, there are a lot of assets on the block right now, both upstream and downstream, and obviously you've been in a rationalization mode for a while.  I was wondering if you could talk about the M&amp;A environment as we head into '08, what you're thinking about value and price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we always get this question because as a company, if you look at how we've been formed since 1999, we've done mergers, we've done joint ventures, BD developments, acquisitions.  And here recently we really haven't done that much because we really have created the company that we like.  We don't feel that we have any glaring holes in our portfolio.  But I just don't see that the M&amp;A environment fits into our plans as we look at 2008, 2009.  We have a lot on our plate in terms of our capital program.</p>
          <p>If you look at the M&amp;A environment or substantial asset acquisitions, they just don't seem to work in terms of really what's available, the quality necessarily or the price or whether it's even do-able.  So we are really staying, despite what we've done and how we've created our company, we're really sticking with our knitting of our capital program that we've announced which is 15.3 billion, the cap side of that 14.6 billion.  We're going to be very aggressive in terms of our share repurchase and we like to raise our dividend each year.  So I don't see the M&amp;A markets and sizable acquisitions fitting into our plans over the next several years.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we have a small amount of production, very small, but I think it really &#x2013; I can't remember the exact month, but it really does come on production as we go into 2008.  It's a challenging project because you know it's way up there in the north, Siberia.  So it's challenging technically and it's challenging just because of the harsh climatic conditions.  But we expect, and we can come back to you on this, ramping up our production as we go through 2008.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jim, wondering for the Burlington Resources acquisition is now close to two years, if we do a look back, because I'm sure that you guys did it, any positive or negative surprises from that transaction that you'd learned and that may lead you to do somewhat differently going into the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first of all, the volumes &#x2013; the resource pace and the volumes of production is spot on.  It's not really different from what we expected when we did the transaction.  Synergy capture is higher than we expected. And in terms of the Henry Hub price that we used when we made the acquisition, in the first two years it was less that what we assumed. And as we go through 2008, gas prices we're seeing today are higher.</p>
          <p>So we're essentially, as we go through 2008, to the extent that natural gas prices Henry Hub are north of 6 to $6 or 50 &#x2013; 6 to 6.50 per Mcf, we're essentially capturing back where we were lower on 2006 and 2007.  And so if we continue with the kind of markets we're seeing today, at the end of three years it will essentially are going to be for three years average where we thought we were going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you think that the process when you &#x2013; at the time you're looking at Burlington Resources is the right process and you don't see any changes to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of the assumptions that we...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not assumptions, but the way how you look at, say, transaction or looking at how to evaluate those assets. Or you think that the process is &#x2013; you are reasonably satisfied that other than the macro environment, that nothing is fundamentally changed from what you previously assumed when you getting into the transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, fundamentally we look at &#x2013; yes, inventories in the US are higher than we would have expected as a result of weather, in all weather that's summer or the winter.  But our view towards natural gas markets in North America have not changed and in fact I think we feel more bullish about natural gas markets longer term in North America than we did at the time we announced and did the transaction.</p>
          <p>And the reason for that is less imports coming from Canada, for all the reasons why there'd be less imports from Canada. And we also think that the availability of LNG coming to the US is going to be &#x2013; take longer and less amounts because I think a lot of that LNG is going to be competed away to stronger markets in Europe and Asia. So compared to when we actually did the transaction, we feel just as strong or stronger about natural gas in North America than at the time we did it.</p>
          <p>And there's one other thing about Burlington. Even though the natural gas prices were &#x2013; for '06 and '07 are somewhat less than we expected when we did the transaction, are really catching up in '08, this has a very sizable cash flow. And you can see cash flow from the production and the asset base and you can see it our cash flow for BOE. You may not see it in the net income per barrel because they're using purchase accounting but you do see the impact, already even in the fourth quarter, a little bit better natural gas price and oil price has quite an impact in our cash flow per barrel.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. My question related to your strategy for increasing long term access and exposure to the Middle East, particularly with respect to Qatar and also Abu Dhabi and how we should think about some of your initiatives in that region. You recently signed an MOU with Qatar Petroleum to pursue energy projects outside Qatar. Do you think this could be linked to opportune projects in Qatar? Or are you looking at downstream projects, particularly in the energy value chain? And other than gaining a credible partner, do you expect this partnership will improve your access to further projects in Qatar when the moratorium is lifted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first with respect to Qatar. We've had a really strong relationship and it's been a great investment for us, first on the chemical side and now what we're working on, which is Qatargas 3, our LNG project, which is planning to start up in 2009. Obviously we want to do a good job, but anything we have in Qatar because to the extent that there's more opportunity after they see the developments, the reservoir performance of the North Field, we know it'll be strong competition but we'd like to do more in Qatar.</p>
          <p>There's talk about more in Qatar that both on the chemical side through our joint venture but also we'd like to be doing more on both the oil and the liquid side as well as natural gas. The MOU that we signed and they do sign with other companies, of course, is because of this relationship: what more could we do, to some extent inside the country, but really outside the country both upstream and downstream. Those discussions have really just started so it's premature to say just what that would lead to but we really do like and respect each other, we're looking for more things to do.</p>
          <p>Other countries in the Middle East that we'd like to do more with: obviously we're in competition, we'd like to be doing things, sell our gas with Abu Dhabi and hopefully other things in Abu Dhabi. Kuwait has not really opened up yet but we'd like to see, possibly maybe we can do something in Kuwait. And to the extent that we have petroleum oil and we have security we'd like to be doing things in Iraq. Can't do anything with Iran but to the extent that maybe at some point in time sanctions get lifted and better political relationships, Iran would be a country we'd seriously want to take a look at. So the Middle East has and we expect will be of some strategic importance to our company.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just staying on that &#x2013; thanks, on Iraq, any updates on the West Qurna project with LUKOIL, or is it not on the table at the moment?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>No, I think we'll talk more about this at our March 12, but continue to work with Vagit Alekperov, the CEO of LUKOIL, working both the Russian political side as well as the Iraqi side and the US government side to see &#x2013; we really believe that that contract should be affirmed and we are the right company to technically and commercially to do West Qurna, so we work that pretty hard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, it's Doug from Citi. Couple of questions, if I may. First of all I guess on the upstream, John Carrig, the tax change in Alaska, does that come through on the tax line or does it come in the &#x2013; above the tax line as production taxes, can you just give us some clarification on where we should look for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You should look for that in production taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in the income tax line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. So it's kind of &#x2013; it's obviously not stripped out down in the tax line this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the second question is, just I guess really following on to Eric's  question, in the event that you're successful in winning some of these projects, and obviously there has been a great deal of speculation about Abu Dhabi in particular. Can you just give us some idea of what your anticipated headroom on capital expenditure would be, where does the CapEx line go assuming you get everything you're aiming for, how would you expect your CapEx guidance to move?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you're going to see a great deal of movement in our capital expenditure in 2008. It's going to be more in 2009 and subsequent years.  And we do build in something, and we'll talk more about this on March 12th, but I think the '08 program, if we set $14.6 billion in cash, I mean realistically that could be between 13.5 and 15.5.  And that will enable us to essentially do anything that we have in mind, that we would be tasked with or win or have opportunities to do because a lot of these projects, you don't immediately spend a lot of money.  You spend a lot of time working and sorting through the technical aspects and workings of the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, and I guess my final question is actually relating to LUKOIL.  I think John Lowe had made some comments late last year regarding how that relationship is going in terms of securing international joint ventures and basically the overall partnership.  Could you just give us some update as to how you currently view the effectiveness of that relationship in terms of securing additional opportunities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I meet with Vagit about every six weeks or so and we feel that the relationship between the two companies is very strong.  It's a very strong personal relationship, friendship.  We are looking at what we can do together inside and outside Russia upstream and downstream.  What are the new opportunities?  And you know we'd like to do things quicker than &#x2013; It's always that way.  We're not that patient, but we'd like to do things more quickly, but a lot of these kind of things just take more time. But there is no change whatsoever in the intent of what we're doing and we're very pleased and satisfied with the LUKOIL relationship.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, good morning.  Jim, I had a couple of tactical questions and then one very specific numbers-oriented question.  Jim, can you give us an idea what kind of unleveraged returns you're expecting from your enhanced Keystone investment and also your investment in Rex and to what extent those lines are likely to be FERC-regulated?  Also, secondly, I'm looking for some clarification in terms of your decision not to divest the Whitegate Refinery and exactly what went into that.  Finally, John Carrig, could you give us an idea what's in the international upstream earnings in the quarter for the reversal, if you will, of a portion of the impairment associated with the Hamaca project finance guarantees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first Mark, on the pipelines, Keystone and REX, given our operations we are taking transportation obligations, long-term transportation obligations, we &#x2013; effectively economically, we have signed up and have support for those pipelines. So we look at that and we say, well, what is the equity return, and the equity return on those pipelines is pretty similar for any type of pipeline. They will be leveraged to the point that most pipelines are which is a fair degree of leverage. So effectively we look at it, economically we have signed up for the use and put our credit behind these pipelines, so having an equity ownership is a way to essentially either lower our costs of our transportation or realize some of the benefits that come with equity.</p>
          <p>But in terms of how they're structured and the financial returns is really no different than what you would expect on transportation. It really comes from a point of view that we have essentially, economically, have taken a substantial ownership in this pipeline so why not get the benefit of it through equity ownership. It doesn't amount to that great a impact on our cash capital program, because a great deal of this is going to &#x2013; is supported by all the other shippers and use of leverage.</p>
          <p>In terms of Whitegate the marketplace in terms of refineries has changed pretty dramatically. We looked at that, and as I said when we look at selling assets we want to make sure we get good value and good after-tax proceeds from it, but we really didn't see that that was forthcoming with respect to Whitegate, so we essentially are embarking on a long-term program of retention and how we can improve its performance and its value to our portfolio. In terms of the specific question for John Carrig, John, do you...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. And the final question is from Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions. The first really is on the LUKOIL earning, they are obviously estimates at this time since LUKOIL hasn't reported, but in terms of the taxes on those, on the LUKOIL volumes, do you think there could be much difference into your estimated numbers for those volumes given the fact that they were quite high and benefited very much from the higher crude pricing for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, if what you are referring to is the fact that the tax rates are established two months in arrears, that obviously does have an impact on fourth quarter results; we would expect that to be reflected in LUKOIL's results as well. What we do is we construct a model based upon publicly-available facts that we're aware of that &#x2013; and then we apply that in a disciplined way to try to come up with the results.  And if something is not publicly reported, we don't put that into the estimate.  But certainly, as I said, the tax on exports which is two months in arrears, will have an impact on fourth quarter results.  And of course as a result of higher prices, if that changes to the downside, it'll have a negative impact &#x2013; it'll have an impact on first quarter results as well.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for that.  And the second question is maybe for Jim, is really on Libya.  When you just look back at your volumes over the past year and a half really, they're sort of stabilized around the 47, 48,000 barrels of oil a day level. What can we read into those numbers going forward? While we continuously hear that you're planning on investing more money and you should see more growth, but frankly it doesn't seem like we're seeing that over the last year.  Just wondering if you'd walk through the &#x2013; what we should be thinking about Libya.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with respect to Libya, we could &#x2013; the volumes are pretty close to what we expected in the initial re-entry into Libya.  But we're disappointed the volumes haven't ramped up more quickly.  And the reason for that is not that we can't ramp them up &#x2013; in fact, we think we could do even better than we initially thought when we went into Libya &#x2013; our problem is, is getting the people, the technical resources into Libya, into the country so as to do the work, spend the money to get the volumes up.  So it's not a question of capability &#x2013; it is capability, we can't get the people into the country quickly.  There's a lot of administration, and to sort through the administration if we could and do it more efficiently, we could get the volumes up pretty dramatically.</p>
          <p>Now, the next thing is, the volumes, if you look at the financial income that's associated with Libya, the financial take is quite high in Libya.  It's not just for us, I think it's for all international oil companies.  So one of the things associated is the volumes can go up, but the financial returns strongly favor Libya.  So if you look out, yes, we want to get the volumes up but they don't translate to the same after-tax income per barrel that's associated with the rest of our portfolio.</p>
