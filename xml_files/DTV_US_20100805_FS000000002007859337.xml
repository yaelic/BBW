          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is David, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV Group's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our second quarter 2010 financial results and outlook conference call. With me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Larry Hunter, General Counsel; Pat Doyle, CFO; and Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America. In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Mike, Bruce and Pat for some introductory remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Overall, I thought our second quarter results in both the United States and Latin America were very strong and reflect solid execution of our key three core strategies for creating shareholder value. First, we're generating very solid top-line growth driven by the strength of our brand, as well as an unrivaled suite of compelling products and services.</p>
          <p>In that regard, DIRECTV's consolidated revenue growth of 12% leads the industry and is due in large part to our company's portfolio of businesses all across the Americas, reflecting diverse geographies, demographics and growth profiles.</p>
          <p>Second of course, our traditional focus on operating excellence, which is driving strong margins and cash flow growth. There both of our U.S. and Latin America businesses grew their margins in the second quarter. Our earnings per share increased 50% excluding the impact from the Malone transaction and our year-to-date free cash flow is up 40% to $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>And forward, as we spoke to you on our last call, we're continuing to execute our strategy of aggressively returning capital to shareholders. As you saw in the earnings release we repurchased over $1.7 billion of stock in the second quarter, representing one of the largest quarterly share buy backs in our history.</p>
          <p>Now before turning the call over to Pat and Bruce for a more detailed review of our U.S. and Latin America businesses let me just offer a few observations. First, starting with Latin America, while clearly we expected a strong quarter, I think it's fair to say that net additions of 415,000 exceeded all of our expectations. And to put that number in perspective, it was more than three times the net additions of a year ago and over 60% higher than our previous record set just two quarters ago.</p>
          <p>The FIFA World Cup, coupled with a relatively strong macroeconomic landscape propelled a lot of that growth. But we're also continuing to see very solid momentum across the entire region driven by our industry leading HD and DVR services, as well as popular postpaid and prepaid packages.</p>
          <p>I was also extremely pleased to see that even with that rapid subscriber growth, Bruce and his team were able to significantly increase their operating profit before depreciation and amortization and the margins by over 7 percentage points to almost 31%.</p>
          <p>Now I think we also had very solid results with our U.S. business. Furthermore, we saw some key trends develop in the quarter, particularly in the areas of both subscriber and ARPU growth that I believe position us well for the second half of the year. Our net additions of 100,000 were a touch better than our expectations, but importantly gross adds and churn strengthened throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>We're becoming much more targeted in our marketing strategies, as well as our new promotions, which is enabling us to drive higher gross additions with much greater penetration of both HD and DVR services. Due in part to our free HD offer, which was introduced at the end of the quarter, we reached a record high penetration level of over 70% in the quarter for new subscribers activating with advanced services. So, they're very high quality subscribers.</p>
          <p>We're also very excited about the additional demand that will be generated through our new partnership with CenturyLink, which was official launched just this past Sunday and we're off to a terrific start, already taking orders. I might also add that we have exclusive distribution in 12 out of the 13 states that Frontier operates in and we have an excellent partnership with them as well.</p>
          <p>In addition to growing demand for new subscribers, I think we're also doing a better job of retaining existing subscribers. Our monthly churn rate of 1.51% was equal to prior year's second quarter breaking a five quarter trend of higher year-over-year churn rates. Much like our strategy with gross additions we're taking a much more targeted approach to managing churn to improve segmentation and as a result, we saw a reduction in voluntary churn for the first time in nine quarters. I believe this decline is also due to our improved customer service and box reliability efforts.</p>
          <p>ARPU growth was an equally strong story in the quarter. The favorable trends that we talked about on our last earnings call, particularly regarding premiums, Pay Per View, and advertising continued in the second quarter and in some cases, strengthened even further. Premium movie revenues generated the largest favorability to our expectations and prior year. And we're also seeing very solid results in Pay Per View movies and events. In addition, advertising revenues were very strong as we posted the best second quarter in our history.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the bottom line, I was pleased with the nearly 1 percentage point increase in our DIRECTV U.S. operating profit before depreciation, amortization margin to over 28% representing our highest margin in two years. We're continuing to execute well in areas such as programming, subscriber services, and upgrade and retention marketing.</p>
          <p>Our SAC was a bit higher than we would have liked, however, I must point out that most of that increase is related to business decisions that we consciously made to provide our customers with advanced equipment, which improves both long term customer loyalty, as well as top-line growth.</p>
          <p>For instance, roughly two-thirds of the year-over-year increase in SAC for the quarter was due to the higher penetration of advanced services that I mentioned earlier, as well as additional investment that we announced late last year related to new services, such as our Whole-Home DVR. As a point of reference, we saw our HD penetration rate increase almost 50% after we launched our free HD offer to new consumers.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to make these investments in a financially prudent fashion to ensure that we capture the appropriate returns. It's no coincidence that many of the favorable ARPU and churn trends discussed earlier relate to the increased SAC investment we've made in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Now before turning the call over to Bruce for some remarks about Latin America, let me just wrap up with an update on a couple of other important items, and an overview of our key priorities for the second half of the year. First, we're making terrific progress on our company-wide strategic review. Earlier this week we had a chance to have a very constructive two-day strategic retreat with our board of directors, and we look forward to sharing some of our thoughts with you in the fall at our Investor Day.</p>
          <p>We're also making very good progress on adding new board members. Last month, I was delighted to be able to add Sam DiPiazza to our board. I've known Sam a long time; he brings a wealth of experience and expertise and most recently served as the global CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers International from 2002 to 2009. We're working hard to continue to fill the remaining board seats, and we hope to land a couple more directors before year-end.</p>
          <p>In terms of my top priorities for the second half, I guess I'd go back to the opening comments I made about our core strategies for creating shareholder growth &#x2013; growth in shareholder value. First, we need to continue to reinvigorate growth at the top-line by delivering on our goal of making DIRECTV the best video experience in the world.</p>
          <p>Specifically, in the second half, that includes building on and extending our industry leading position in HD, 3D, and mobile sports. As you may have noticed, last quarter, we launched three dedicated 3D channels and added 30 new HD channels through the extra capacity provided by our new satellite. We've also just launched our popular NFL SUNDAY TICKET promotion with more value and features than ever before and a terrific ad campaign, and I'm very excited about that.</p>
          <p>We are now including all of the services that used to part of our SuperFan package, including games in HD and the Game Mix and Red Zone channels at no extra charge to our customers. And we're also introducing an NFL SUNDAY TICKET To-Go service for about $50 which will provide live streaming video of the games on mobile devices like the iPad or by via a computer through DIRECTV.com.</p>
          <p>Also in the second half we intend to increase penetration of newer services, such as our Whole-Home DVR as well as services requiring an Internet connection to our receivers. And later this year we'll introduce a greatly enhanced DIRECTV cinema service that's designed to not only take share from other movie services, but most importantly to significantly to improve the overall movie experience for all of our DIRECTV customers.</p>
          <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we'll continue refining and improving our segmentation strategies for how we acquire and obtain customers so that we optimize our subscriber growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll continue to have a heightened focus on increasing productivity, operational excellence and driving operating efficiencies. Whether these come in G&amp;A, our call centers, our installation network, or anywhere else across our enterprise, it's critical that we strive for operating excellence to counter out the some of the cost pressures that we've seen in areas such as SAC and overall programming expense.</p>
          <p>And finally, we'll continue to repurchase stock in an aggressive fashion while pursuing our goal that we announced last quarter of obtaining a leverage ratio of 2.5 times total debt to EBITDA by the end of next year. That goal will be facilitated by the recent approval from our board of directors to authorize an additional stock repurchase program of $2 billion.</p>
          <p>In summary, as you can see from our updated guidance, we remain bullish on our growth prospects for both the U.S. and our Latin America businesses. Although the economy and competitive landscapes continue to be challenging, we're building on strong operating momentum. We're just now frankly, starting to capture some of the benefits related to a few of the key initiatives that we implemented earlier this year. But perhaps even more exciting, I think are the many great ideas that are coming out of our strategic reviews that I believe position us well and provide the potential to further boost our growth in both the U.S. and Latin America for many years to come.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Bruce Churchill for some comments about our Latin American businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. As you saw from the release this morning, the World Cup's impact or our business was everything we expected it to be and then some. The 660,000 gross additions and the 415,000 net additions easily broke previous records and our average monthly churn rate of 1.63% was the lowest second quarter rate in three years.</p>
          <p>The results were strong across the entire region, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela where all three countries experienced a roughly four-fold increase in net additions, compared to last year. Argentina's net additions were more than doubled.</p>
          <p>Our prepaid services continued to gain traction cross the region, but the vast majority of our growth came in postpaid. Approximately 80% of total gross adds in the quarter were for postpaid packages, similar to the second quarter of 2009, as well as the first quarter of this year. As a point of reference, prepaid subscribers currently make up approximately 10% of our 5.2 million consolidated subscribers.</p>
          <p>Much of the growth we're seeing in postpaid packages is being driven by the sale of advanced services. About 30% of our gross adds signed up for HD and/or DVR services in the quarter or roughly double the penetration level of a year ago. And from an absolute perspective, the number of gross adds taking advanced products was nearly four times that of the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>HD continued to fuel much of the growth an advanced services as well. Brazil continues to have the greatest HD penetration in the region due to the fact that we offer three times as many HD channels as anyone else in the market. However, we're now seeing very strong HD demand in PanAmericana as well, particularly in Argentina. When you combine HD and standard definition DVR sales together, we're now seeing over 40% of our new subscribers in PanAmericana signing up for one or the other of these advanced products. Our monthly churn rate also greatly benefited from the World Cup as postpaid churn fell 14 basis points from a year ago to 1.45%.</p>
          <p>In addition to the strong subscriber results in the quarter, our financial results were also very solid. The 26% increase in revenues was mostly due to subscriber growth, but we also saw some favorable pricing trends in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, ARPU growth would have been around 6% driven by price increases, higher sales of advanced services, and lower promotional discounting thanks to the World Cup.</p>
          <p>OPBDA was also very solid as it increased 66% over last year's results. The majority of the growth was due to the gross profit on the incremental revenue, as well as lower charges related to the repatriation of cash from Venezuela. These improvements were partially offset by higher subscription acquisition cost related to the record gross additions. Subscriber related CapEx on the new additions increased by over 50 million, compared to the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding Venezuela, as a many of you know, beginning in May, the government implemented a series of regulations that included banning the use of the so called parallel market for converting bolivars to U.S. dollars. This move restricted our ability to repatriate dollars which partially explains the lower foreign currency exchange losses this year, compared to last. However, the amount of cash on hand in Venezuela is quite modest, reflecting the fact that we have been very aggressive in pulling cash out prior to the change in regulation. The currency control situation in Venezuela remains fluid and obviously, one we will continue to monitor. It remains our policy to repatriate as much excess cash as we legally can.</p>
          <p>To wrap up my discussion on the quarter I would like to touch briefly about the results of Sky Mexico which we do not consolidate. Those of you on the call with Televisa last month know that Sky Mexico also benefited significantly from the World Cup, adding 251,000 subscribers in the quarter, compared with only 9,000 a year ago, including these results, our Latin American platforms now exceed 7.6 million subscribers. Revenue and OPBDA growth of 26% and 21%, respectively were also very strong at Sky Mexico.</p>
          <p>In summary then, it was a very strong and balanced quarter. We had good operating results from all three platforms, a good mix of product sales and strong financials across the board.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our full year outlook, with the strong first half behind us, it's now a good time to update our full year guidance. In terms of subscribers, we now expect to add approximately 1 million subscribers this year or roughly the same number as the entire U.S. pay TV industry expects to add this year as well. I expect the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third, given normal seasonality and the fact that the timing of the World Cup no doubt accelerated some sales into the second quarter from the third. And as we've talked about on the last call, we remain very focused on keeping churn under control after such tremendous growth over the last several quarters, particularly in the prepaid segment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to revenue, growth is up nearly 30% year-to-date, but we will be facing tougher comparisons over the remainder of the year. In the first half of this year, the favorable year-on-year comparisons for the Brazilian reais helped mask the negative effect of the devaluation in Venezuela. This will not be the case for the second half of the year. However, combining our strong first half revenues with what is likely to be a slower growing second half yields a full-year revenue growth target of between 15 and 20%, which is substantially higher than our original revenue growth guidance of about 10%.</p>
          <p>OPBDA also faces more difficult comparisons in the second half, but will benefit from the solid revenue growth and lower transaction charges in Venezuela. Therefore, consolidated OPBDA should grow approximately 45% for the year to about $1 billion U.S.</p>
          <p>And finally, many of you are aware that our partner Globo has exercised its rights under our shareholder's agreement to sell 19 of its 26% interest in Sky Brazil to us. We are currently working through the process that was agreed to in 2004 to determine the fair value of Sky Brazil and we expect to close this transaction in the next few months.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn the call over to Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. Much like Latin America, I thought our U.S. business also had an extremely strong quarter highlighted by solid revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. Looking first at the top-line, revenue growth of 9% was solid and was driven mostly by ARPU growth of 5.7% which at 87.90 was a bit higher than our internal target. Premiums, Pay Per View and advertising sales were particularly strong in the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the first time in several years, our year-over-year buy rates increased for premium movie channels although some of this improvement reflects the low buy rates from a year ago, a significant portion of the growth relates to superior execution by our marketing and call center teams.</p>
          <p>In addition to premiums, we also saw solid year-over-year growth in Pay Per View movies, as well as higher Pay Per View event revenue boosted by the Mayweather-Mosley fight in May. Finally, advertising sales were up almost 20% as we posted our best second quarter ever.</p>
          <p>Much like ARPU, net subscriber additions of 100,000 were also a touch better than our internal projections due to solid execution, but also from some of the promotions we have introduced, such as free HD. Our direct sales and retail sales channels have been performing better, which is offsetting the continued decline from our Telco partners. Last year, Telcos reached as high as 25% of gross additions while their contributions now are running 5 to 10 percentage points lower than this rate. As we have discussed on the last earnings call, this decline is related to several factors, including the continued rollout of FiOS and U-Verse, as well as the decline in their land lines which results in fewer incoming calls and sales opportunities at their call centers. Looking forward we certainly expect that our new partnership with CenturyLink will boost sales in the Telco channel.</p>
          <p>For those of you who may not be familiar with CenturyLink, they are currently the fourth largest Telco and upon completing their pending transaction with Qwest they will become the third largest. They currently cover around 5 million homes in 33 states, so this is a very exciting opportunity for us.</p>
          <p>We are also pleased with our monthly churn rate of 1.51% which for the first time in five quarters did not increase on a year-over-year basis. We're now managing churn in a much more segmented and targeted fashion with a particularly sharp eye on those higher value subscribers who have the greatest chance of voluntarily leaving DIRECTV. A good example would include customers rolling off of their two year commitments in U-Verse or FiOS territories.</p>
          <p>One could also argue that we're now much closer to the so called sweet spot of balancing churn with retention spending. You've heard us say several times last year that we may have been spending a bit too much to save subscribers, particularly lower valued subscribers. As a result, over the past year you've seen our retention spending decline modestly, while churn increase modestly. Keep in mind however, that this balance is highly sensitive to the competitive and economic landscape, so it's imperative that we continue to refine our policies accordingly.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the bottom line, we continued to grow both our pre SAC and OPBDA margins in the quarter. Similar to recent quarters we did a good job managing our programming, subscriber services and upgrade and retention costs. However, G&amp;A and SAC costs were higher than sequentially and, compared to last year. The year-over-year and sequential increase in G&amp;A was almost entirely due to one-time items and a slightly higher bad debt rate. The one-time items included higher legal expenses in the current quarter and lower expenses a year ago related to the forfeiture Chase's competition benefits when he left the company.</p>
          <p>In terms of the year-over-year increase in SAC, roughly two-thirds of that increase was driven by the penetration growth in advanced products. We already lead the industry in sales of HD and DVR services, however, we're seeing our advanced penetration increase even further due to some of our new services and promotions. For example, our new Whole-Home DVR service requires customers to lease HD DVR equipment which by the way also requires our newer SWiM Dish both of which are more expensive than standard equipment.</p>
          <p>In addition, our free HD offer has been driving higher HD activation. We are comfortable making these investments this is SAC because many of our new services, including Whole-Home DVR generate incremental revenue streams for us. In many cases, these investments also improve efficiencies or lower cost.</p>
          <p>Our SWiM Dish investment illustrates this point well as it reduces labor cost by simplifying the installation while at the same time, improving the installation experience for the customer. It also reduces future upgrade costs by making it easier to drop ship receivers if a customer chooses to upgrade equipment after activation and it improves diagnostics of the equipment and avoids unnecessary truck rolls in the future. It's also important to point out customers with HD and DVR services continue to have substantially higher ARPU and lower churn than customers with only basic equipment.</p>
          <p>Separately we had a modest increase in capital expenditures in the quarter due to mostly satellite payments for our newest satellite, DIRECTV 14. Adding it all up, DIRECTV U.S. grew cash flow before interest and taxes by 27% in the quarter bringing the year-to-date growth rate to 40%.</p>
          <p>I'd like to wrap up with a few comments about our outlook. You just heard Bruce's update on DIRECTV Latin America's outlook so these comments apply to our U.S. business. Our strong first half results provide us with greater confidence that we will meet or exceed all of DIRECTV U.S.' full-year guidance provided earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>When comparing the second half of the year to the first half, we're looking for better year-over-year comparisons for both gross additions and churn. We continue to expect that the quarterly revenue and OPBDA growth profiles this year will be in many ways the opposite of last year's results. You may recall that last year's revenue and OPBDA growth in the U.S. improved as the year progressed. Obviously, that profile impacts our growth rates this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of consolidated free cash flow at DIRECTV we are currently holding to our free cash growth target. Although we are well ahead of our goal on a year-to-date basis, much like with revenue and OPBDA we will be dealing with tougher comparisons in the second half. Furthermore, we must be mindful of the impact that higher than planned gross additions may have on our near term free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Regarding our strategy for returning capital to shareholders, through yesterday we had repurchased approximately 2.8 billion out of our 3.5 billion authorization. As you saw in the earnings release, our board approved an additional 2 billion increase to that authorization leaving us with about 2.7 billion for future buybacks which should cover us for the next several months. We look forward to tapping into what is currently a relatively strong debt market as we continue on our goal of achieving a two and a half times leverage ratio by the end of next year.</p>
          <p>So at this time, I'm going to turn the call back to Jon so that we can begin our Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Pat. Before moving on to Q&amp;A, investors should note that we have members of the media on this call in listen-only mode. I'd like to remind the media they are not authorized to quote any participants on this call either directly or in substance, other than the representatives of DIRECTV.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. First of all, on the buy back, the comment that you have 2.7 billion over the &#x2013; that you may complete over the next several months, I guess, just to could you confirm that. That sort of suggests you're going to complete that by year-end. If you could confirm that, that would be great. And then, as you look out to other opportunities obviously the Latin American business is doing well. Could you balance the &#x2013; maybe this question for Michael, the benefits of returning cash to shareholders with other international expansion opportunities you see out there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the buy back, I don't think we're setting any target as far as when we would complete that. If you look at the pace that we've been running so far, we've been repurchasing a little bit more than $100 million of stock per week. That's certainly a pace we're comfortable with, but obviously we also will look at the market, look at the share price and as normal be more aggressive when an opportunity presents itself and then scale back at other times. So, again, we don't have a set target, but I think if you kind of look at our past run rate it should be fairly indicative of how you would see us going forward.</p>

          <p>The question on other international opportunities, we've completed a complete kind of scan of really the world and kind of looking at pay TV all across the world. And I would say while we'll opportunistically continue to be open to ideas in emerging markets, our focus is Latin America. I think if there was one takeaway from the work we did, where we looked extensively at markets from China to India to Russia to the Middle East, is that ours is a highly regulated industry. You actually don't have that many regions of the world where you can own 100% of your business, where you actually have quality programming that consumers are willing to pay for, particularly sports, and where you've got enough economies of scale over two languages, Spanish and Portuguese that you can do it, and lastly, that you've got a very, very talented and street smart operating team.</p>
          <p>So I would say we'll continue to opportunistically look outside of Latin America, but I don't see any imminent significant investments that we'd be making at this time. I think our focus is on Latin America, and Bruce has pulled together a very, very exciting strategic plan for that region and frankly, we continue to see strong growth potential primarily because of the low penetration rates that you still see for pay TV in Latin America.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Spencer Wang with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just want to delve into the programming cost growth topic a little bit. DIRECTV's programming cost growth per sub has been pretty moderate, although it did reaccelerate. Is that mostly because of the premium buy rate improvement and Pay Per View improvement? That's question one, and then second was just wondering if you could update us on where DIRECTV is with respect to TV Everywhere in terms of both technical feasibility, as well as negotiations with the cable programmers? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Spencer, on the programming thing, I think you're right, in the quarter the uptick that you might have seen there was &#x2013; would have been driven by premium channels and stuff like that. As we look at programming costs overall, we continue to manage them effectively, but they continue to create pressure overall on the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>I think as I look into the future, I still believe we can manage through things like retrans and other things, but I have to point out that we've got kind of a catch-up accounting on our NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract this year that is kind of creating some profits that &#x2013; with a different contract next year. So, let's put how we deal with the NFL new contract as a separate item. We haven't yet made any decisions on how we're looking at next year in that regard. But certainly that's going to create some significant one-time pressure on programming costs for 2011 that's in my judgment a separate issue from the rest.</p>
          <p>And on the rest I think, it continues to be a challenge I think for the industry as a whole, but we continue to work to manage through it and frankly, would have to pass pricing through to our customers to cover those programming cost increases in the future.</p>
          <p>I think in terms have TV Everywhere, we have got &#x2013; in laying out our strategy with our board we've got a whole group of folks working on DIRECTV ideas. From a programming standpoint we discussed digital rights in every &#x2013; and authentication in every one of our kind of programming contract renewals. It's a first topic for discussion in many ways. We've got our DVR and schedule that's doing very well. Probably our most imminent next opportunity is the NFL SUNDAY TICKET To-Go. For $50 you've got a fantastic experience on an iPad, I can tell you that. I've seen it. I think beyond that, my own view on TV Everywhere when you look at it outside the home, it's going to be a journey. Each of the media companies has a slightly different take on it as to what content they would make available and when. We just want to make sure we're positioned well to provide our DIRECTV customers with a fantastic experience. So, we're working on a number of things that we'll talk about at our Investor Day from a strategy standpoint to kind of bring our content to a mobile device for our consumers next year and in the years ahead. So, it's one of the five priorities that we've got in addition to kind of the connected home experience and some other areas that we'll talk about at the Investor Day.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I guess starting going back to Pat to your comments about the second half of the year, I just wanted to clarify. Were you expecting to see net adds up year-on-year versus the back half of '09 or are you just being more qualified about a more bullish outlook for subscriber growth for the back half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Ben, I guess what I was saying, I mean, obviously last year we had a kind of blowout first quarter and a relatively strong second quarter. My comment was more like we're seeing good momentum on gross adds, seeing that continue into July. The back half of our year was more modest in our net adds. So, my comment is more as we get into the second half of the year I think you'll just see a better year-over-year comparison on gross and net.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And I guess also for Mike, since you've come on, you've had to navigate a number of new promotions from DISH and you've made decisions around free HD and I think also your SUNDAY TICKET SuperFan pricing. Clearly, the numbers first half of this year speak for themselves. Maybe you could just talk about what went into your thought process on those two items and generally how you approach the market from a pricing perspective? And if I could sneak one more in, there's been a lot of questions about DIRECTV acquiring content, or more content exposure. And I know you're on Undercover Boss later this year, but I was wondering if there was anything more to some of the rumors flying around out there, maybe you could just address that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our board was wondering whether I was going to ask for content rights to appear on future television shows. I don't think there's any danger of that. On the first question on pricing, look, ours is a very competitive industry and as I said, I don't think we ought to focus on one individual competitor because frankly, we've seen a ramp up in competitive activity over the last year pretty much across the board with the aggressiveness of the Telcos, as well as with the other satellite companies. So, I can't say whether &#x2013; I wouldn't try to characterize the quarter as more or less of that, I'd just say it continues to be very, very competitive out there. I think consumers are still very price sensitive, or value sensitive I should say. And so our thinking here is we need to continue to be competitive in the services we provide customers.</p>
          <p>Now, we're trying to do it in a very segmented and targeted way so that we tackle these issues and try and figure out how do we continue to earn the loyalty of our existing subscribers most importantly and second, what do we need to do in tailoring our offers to ensure that it's competitive going forward.</p>
          <p>Our focus on Q3 is all around NFL SUNDAY TICKET. We've got a terrific program. Frankly, as we looked on SUNDAY TICKET at the SuperFan thing that we had last year, I just didn't think that given what we ask consumers to pay for, it just didn't seem to me that there was enough value add to not provide HD as a part of that package. So, that was probably more driven by just a kind of a view of what's right for the customer than it was necessarily a competitive consideration. Certainly the free HD was a competitive consideration and we'll continue to look at that. Frankly, we'll monitor the competitive situation by quarter and make our decisions accordingly. But we're prepared to stay competitive and ensure that we continue to gain high quality subs.</p>
          <p>And as you saw, I think one of the most important things was that we're so far able to manage through this in terms of generating good financial performance while at the same time, being very competitive and gaining net additions of 100,000. And by the way, very high quality adds. I mean, we had record numbers of &#x2013; HD DVR was 38% in the quarter, which was above &#x2013; it was 25% a year ago. So, I mean, very, very good trajectory for where we're trying to take our customers.</p>
          <p>In terms of content, look, I've said this before, and I think I probably continue to feel that we'll always be open and opportunistic if we look at tuck under content ideas. We just signed Damages for the 101 Channel. We'll continue to look at sports for opportunities, but I certainly don't see a big content acquisition in our future at this time.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. I think it was like five or six years ago there was a lot of trepidation among investors that DIRECTV didn't have any sort of facilities-based assets to compete in the broadband space, either terrestrial or wireless. I was just wondering as you think about the dynamics &#x2013; competitive dynamics in Latin America and the regulatory differences in Latin America, do you think you'll be able to succeed, as well as you have in the U.S. or are the dynamics sort of different down there that would require a different strategy? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Bruce talk about Latin America, and kind of how we've been thinking about that. Frankly, in the U.S. we've had a significant focus on strengthening our bundles and we've partnered up, I think we've got probably got 90% of the U.S. covered now with bundles that we can provide our customers. But frankly, we're not where we &#x2013; yet where we want to be on that. And we continue to look for opportunities to find other ways to create synthetic bundles with broadband services to our customers. I think in Latin America it's at a different it's a different stage of evolution. Bruce, do you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that's probably the most important thing to remember is that Latin America lags the United States by several years. Having said that, we have been taking a very similar approach to the one that we've taken in the U.S., which is that we do have some bundles with some telcos in certain territories where it's appropriate. And I think in general therefore, we will continue to ride it out the way we have in the United States and see where it goes. Having said that, I would probably say that the opportunity in Latin America is much more wide open. I don't believe that in Latin America, we will face similar competitive pressure from something like a big fiber buildout to the home that you've seen here in the U.S. As challenging as those economics are in the United States, they're even more challenging in Latin America. So, the opportunity is more wide open. It will evolve differently. My guess is it will be more mobile and wirelessly-based as opposed to land line-based. And I think we're well-positioned to play in that arena.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions, first on the comment around gross adds and churn strengthening through the quarter, I'm wondering if you can talk us through that a bit more on what caused the improvement, was it kind of a step function around the free HD offering or more gradual through the quarter? And then second question just on the obviously very strong progress on the buyback, there's lots of talk about companies putting in a special dividend before a potential 2011 tax change. As you guys obviously have plenty of fire power, is that something you would consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the churn and sub, taking churn first, I think we've mentioned that we really implemented, I think, some technology in the January-February timeframe that allowed us to more &#x2013; to better target the customers that were high value, and had the highest propensity to churn, and without getting into the detail, it allows us to treat those customers differently when they call into the call center and it's been very effective as I said, in my notes, it's something that we're continuing to monitor and tweak effectiveness. But we're really gaining a lot of traction on that and it's really &#x2013; the churn has really been more voluntary than anything else.</p>
          <p>On subs, yeah, I think that, we had a lot of good momentum in the quarter. As Mike said, I think when we responded in part on the HD for free we put in some filters, but it resonated really well. And then we launched our Whole-Home DVR early in June and that was well-received. So, we saw a very nice pick-up in people interested in multi-room viewing. And we've seen that trend continue in July. It's being very well received by our by new customers, as well as our current base upgrading to that product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add on that before we get to the second question on the special dividend. Just a reminder, look, I was asked the question earlier about it. We felt the need to respond in a timely fashion to ensure that we continue to be competitive. Having said that, look, as we look at 2011 there are levers we haven't pulled yet, including box prices. And so there are a number of ways to try and create a compelling offer and respond to the competitive environment where we've got other levers that we can pull from a pricing standpoint as long as we've got enough time to plan for it, which we certainly do for February. So, we're taking a pretty comprehensive look at how we think about pricing and packaging for 2011 in line with our strategy that we're developing, and I still feel good about our ability to navigate those waters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I think on the return of capital, I think we're very comfortable with the path we're on now of share repurchase. We still think that there's very good value at looking at where the price of the stock is today. And so we really, we don't have a special dividend on the radar screen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm wondering, regarding, you talked a little bit about SAC and the impact of higher end customers. I notice that most of the increase in SAC was on the expense side, I was wondering if you could break that down how much of that was somewhat smaller gross add base and hence, more advertising the like and how much was actually related to higher cost installations and higher per customer expenses.</p>
          <p>And secondly, if you could talk a little bit about as you roll out DIRECTV Cinema and the like, how you've seen net neutrality figuring into that, and if you've been having discussions with any of the broadband ISPs regarding guaranteed service quality? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. James, on the first one again, I guess, particularly if you look at the increase in SAC year-over-year, probably about two-thirds of that increase is what more in what we could call the hardware side, the advanced product side. But you also have to remember even in that, like we don't capitalize the Dish or the SWiM Dish as well, which is an expensive product, which is used in all of the HD installs, including the multi-room viewing product. So, even though you see some stuff that like I said, may show more on the expense side, a lot of that is still being driven by customers &#x2013; with us investing more in the customers' home in advanced products.</p>
          <p>We see a little bit too of just some mix with the Telcos were generally a lower overall SAC, and as their volume declines and is replaced by retail and other channels, you get a little upward pressure there. But it's, again, the vast majority of that increase is coming from investment in the home, which we mentioned before we're very comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, James, one of the key strategies that we're kind of fleshing out right now is the connected home strategy, i.e., connecting the television set to the Internet. And frankly, we're having terrific success. We've almost got 800,000 of our customers connected. And in the quarter, we had 70,000 connections to the Internet that we added in the quarter, so I mean, that &#x2013; there's no doubt that as we look at our future vision for the home that we want to connect the box to the Internet, and we want the consumer to have an HD DVR, so they can get the full DIRECTV experience.</p>
          <p>The net neutrality debate gets all tied up in what are you really talking about, are you talking about discriminating on specific content, or are you talking about not allowing pricing for heavy users? And frankly, on the latter point, I think if 5% of the users are using 50% of the iPhone bandwidth, you've got to find a way to price appropriately or you won't have, I mean, capital won't invest. I mean, that's kind of 101. On the other hand, I don't know enough about where they'll end up in the decisions they make with the FCC. So, we're clearly not a player in that, but we're certainly eager to partner in providing Internet services to the homes of our customers with compelling and simple broadband bundles, and frankly, I think you'll see us looking to connect more of our homes to the Internet as we work forward on that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Tim Schlock for Marci. Just had two quick questions, the first one can you kind of discuss what you're seeing in the ad environment during Q3, and then the second one is, I noticed that your ARPU has been up roughly 6% in both Q1 and Q2. Do you think that trend can continue for the rest of the year, or do you think there is going to be kind of a pullback in Pay Per View?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Pat take the second one. On the first one, Tim, our ad environment was quite strong. We had high-teens growth in our ad revenues, and we're also doing some things differently. We've got a terrific ad sales team under Bob Riordan. And there are a number of things on the ad sales part that you've got to separate. It's been a good market for ad sales, certainly. But I also would say historically at DIRECTV, we've been a little under penetrated in ad sales and frankly, I still think that's a huge strategic opportunity for us and it's one of the areas of strategy that we're fleshing out is how we capture more of the ad space, particularly local advertising, we think, is a big opportunity, as well as interactive ads as we go forward. On the ARPU, Pat you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the ARPU, I guess, in the first half of the year a couple things to remember, the first quarter was helped by the extra NFL game that we hadn't seen in the past. But yeah, I think that the ARPU in the second half of the year also goes with some of my comments I made earlier. We started to see ARPU improve in the second half of last year, even more like Mike was talking about ad sales. Ad sales was doing very well, but it also started to improve in the second half of the year. So, again, we feel good about our revenue growth in the second half of the year and ARPU, but we probably won't see as strong a growth in the second half, just because of the, kind of the year-over-year comparison.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A couple of questions, one on &#x2013; your cable peers seem to now be kind of openly admitting that their user interface, or user interface for their product is really not so good and that they're actively looking for ways to improve it using what they call simple technology on Android phones and iPhones and iPads. And just curious how you think about that, what you're doing in that space and whether you think they're simply catching up to where you are, or you need to move substantially further as well.</p>
          <p>And then just, Mike you were talking about the SUNDAY TICKET and kind of just your gut reaction of how to price it. I was wondering, you've got this product in Manhattan called SUNDAY TICKET Manhattan for online only. I'm curious, what you think of the pricing of that, I think it's at 350 for this coming season, and whether you're going to try to roll that out more broadly than just New York City? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, on the first question on user interface, it's our whole connected home strategy. You'll be seeing a lot of work coming on our user interface, both later this year when you see the new Cinema interface you'll get a little peek into how we're thinking about user interface. But I can tell you we're not standing still. I don't think you can stand still in our business. The world's constantly changing and you've got to run faster. And I am very excited about some of the work that Romulo Pontual's engineering team is doing in looking at some significant improvements in our user interface next year.</p>
          <p>We're working on ways to increase the speed for changing the channel. We're look at picture-in-picture. We're looking at how you personalize, potentially, the interface to your TV. We're looking at recommendation software. We already have the best smart search, the best search engine out there. I think there's lots more that we can do with our user interface that you'll be seeing over the next 18 to 24 months, I would say, that I'm very excited about. And it's a big priority for us as part of our connected home strategy.</p>
          <p>On the NFL SUNDAY TICKET, we did the Manhattan thing a year ago. It wasn't a huge &#x2013; we didn't get a huge take on it, frankly. I'm not sure whether that was just there's not that much demand for it, or whether we didn't market it as well as we might. We're going to extend it a bit this year and we'll see what we learn this year. I think, certainly, as we look beyond this year, it's kind of late to go in and try and wholesale change things, but as we look beyond this year, we continue to look for ideas for ways to monetize our NFL SUNDAY TICKET rights to help pay for the contract. And there are a number of ideas that it's probably a little premature for me to talk about, because we're really not sure yet, which next idea we might chase as we look at ways to provide that experience to more customers. So, I think for this year we'll take that Manhattan test a little bit further, make it available on a national basis, let's see what kind of a take we get.</p>
          <p>But it's a bit of a slippery slope on the pricing part of it because I mean, if I'm controlling it, we'll have to see. I mean, it's a little bit of one that &#x2013; we've got to see how much of a demand there is. I'm not convinced frankly, from a price elasticity standpoint that if I price at 300 or 350, it would make that much difference in the number of subscribers and to price it much below that, I'd undercut and undermine our existing 2 million customers that take NFL SUNDAY TICKET. So, I would say we're in a learning mode on that. But rest assured, it is an area that we're looking at and trying to figure out what the right next step would be, which I think you'd more likely see anything more aggressive we would do with next season, not this season.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; much, a couple clarifications and a question. You mentioned two and a half times total debt to EBITDA, Michael as your target. Wasn't it U.S. EBITDA last call? I just wanted to make sure that was accurate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right? Okay, so then &#x2013; so there's two questions. What's your understanding of why Globo is choosing to sell their minority interest in Brazil at this point? I mean, it looks like you've got very strong growth down there. It seems like the wrong time to sell. So, what are we missing there? And then, further to Jason's line of questioning on facilities-based competition, you talked about connecting more boxes to the Internet. Historically in the U.S. it seems that you had &#x2013; your customers have been more likely to be DSL customers and cable customers are more likely to be cable high speed data customers. And with cable high speed data taking pretty meaningful market share right now does that create a headwind for you at some point given that history? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two questions. Let me take them both. First on the Globo thing, I think you'd have to ask them why they want to sell. But certainly I think you should be aware that they sold down, in cable before, so I mean, they've sold down all of their distribution equity positions and at least in my discussion with Roberto Marinho when he brought it to me was more about kind of estate planning I think for the family than any judgment about the business. And frankly, they also have a contract with us where they were going to have to exercise somewhere between now and 2014 anyway. So, I mean, it's just kind of a matter of how you game plan when you do that.</p>
          <p>On the second question, we're well aware of that, and as part of our strategy again I think you'll see more of it later this year, but we're looking at that as frankly, more of an opportunity than as a threat or a headwind. I think it is certainly something that we want to make sure that we can provide competitive broadband services with a good price value to all of our customers in a synthetic bundle that is as good an experience as what they might get from someone else. And, frankly, there are any number of ways you can look at finding ways to get higher speed broadband services out there and we're looking at the whole waterfront. And I'd say it's a little early for me to talk more about it than that, but certainly it's an area that we're looking at as part of our strategy and our work there.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, I just wanted to elaborate. On the two and a half times, I think as we've said, our plan was first to get the U.S. business at two and a half times. We are also thinking about how we leverage off of the Latin American business and how we handle that asset and whether we bring it into the credit, so it's not like we're going to stop at two and a half times U.S. We'll look at it on a companywide basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, our focus was let's get the U.S. one done first and meanwhile, it gives us a little time to figure out where we are vis-&#xE0;-vis Latin America, but obviously long term we'll have a target ratio for all of DIRECTV.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much. Mike, just a question following up your comments on local advertising, I recall that you guys talked about rolling out a local advertising services using spot beams in the beginning or early of 2011. Could you give us some sense of what the potential could be for DIRECTV on that and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, look, we've done some benchmarking to compare how much we get from advertising versus our cable competitors, and we're quite a bit below them I would say. So, it's a significant opportunity for us. I think the question will be how quickly we can ramp it. I certainly expect that we'll see some payback next year out of that initiative. But if I look at it over three, four or five years, I think it could be a very, very significant profit opportunity for DIRECTV, and I'd rather leave it at that right now, but it's not 10s of millions of dollars. It's more than that. So, I think we're talking a significant opportunity. But we got a lot of moving parts when you're selling local ads to make sure that it works. But I certainly expect we'll see kind of the first fruits of that initiative next year and as we see how well that's going, we can then go for there. But you can kind of do the benchmarking. We're quite a bit below where cable competitors are in terms of the dollars per sub of advertising revenue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I just wanted to confirm there isn't any incremental CapEx here and that your spot beams cover the vast majority of the homes in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just secondly, on the free HD offer, if you could give a little color, if I missed it I apologize, but on any &#x2013; the impact on June gross adds with that offer. And any impact you expect on ARPU for Q3 because of it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I probably don't want to be specific about June, but directionally, Pat, you might want to just talk about kind of the trends we're seeing? June was very strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, we definitely saw a lift. And I think as Mike mentioned, I mean, you always worry when you have something like that, whether you're just promoting kind of lower quality customers. But what we saw in June is actually the quality of our gross adds improved in the month of June over May. So, we did we did see some lift with that, which has carried into July as well. I mean, the &#x2013; because on ARPU, I mean, any effect would be modest because you're talking about $10 a month. So, we just started in June. So, it's &#x2013; there really isn't any meaningful impact on revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we've also &#x2013; part of the deal was you had to sign up for auto bill pay. So, we've kind of really ensured we get only good credit and higher quality packages on that deal.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, congratulations on your Russian baby giraffe commercial going viral. That may be worth a million customers just in the U.S. this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's one of the top 40 most watched videos in the world I'm told right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You might have to go into Russia after all. Two questions. One, I know you told me, I think, John Rruden told me that your ARPU down in Brazil for your one product is actually higher than Metro Visos for their triple play. So, you've got some pretty affluent people down there. I know in the World Cup you showed 25 3D games in the U.S. I don't think you did it down there, when you look at how affluent you are &#x2013; your customers are in a market like Brazil, are you probably going to take 3D and even network connectivity down to that market a little sooner people think? And the second question is what would be the implications of an NFL lockout next year as far as your contract stipulations go and all that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bruce, you want to talk a little bit, I think we're probably decades at least before we think about some of that stuff in Latin America, given how low the penetration rates on fiber and even broadband down there are just tiny. And 3D, I don't frankly, see in Latin America. But I don't know, Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess it's a question of you said would it come to Brazil sooner the answer may well be yes, but that doesn't mean it's any time soon. As you &#x2013; just remember we only launched HD last year and much of the HD content that we have to date is actually international content because it's content that's being shown in lots of large markets in other places of the world that therefore, they can afford HD. Local HD content is very early days still in Latin America, even in Brazil, so I think we've got a long run ahead of us on HD and other advanced products before we need to worry about 3D. And yes, I will confirm that our ARPU in Brazil on our video product alone is higher than the ARPU that Metro Visos has on its three products. So, whoever told you that was telling you the truth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add, on Latin America in general, there is no question that I think the satellite is structurally advantaged relative to urban areas in the U.S. where you have fiber optics that's been built out and that's partly why I've felt so strongly about the opportunity in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Second, just the market alone you've got a rising middle class in many of those markets down there that's going to generate significant additional customers for us as you see kind of the middle class increasing down there and the upper middle class. We're certainly looking at segmentation down there, recognizing that we need to service the high end with the same kind of HD experience that we offer in the U.S.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we recognize to service kind of let's call it the middle class or lower middle class you need a more affordable offering. And that's part of what's been so successful for us this year, whether it's our Sky Digital light package in Brazil, whether it's our prepaid packages that we've had out there. So, I think we're going to continue to segment. That's not to be confused with we're trying to chase the bottom of the pyramid. I don't think at this point we're focused on that. But it's really how do you make sure that you've got a compelling offer for the middle class and an ability to upgrade them.</p>
          <p>And I also think whether it is broadband or whether it's content, given the strength of our competitive position in Latin America, we're certainly more open I would say to out of the box ideas or investments or acquisitions if they were to come along than probably a more mature market like the U.S. But, I don't necessarily say that therefore, we're going to going do something I just &#x2013; we're more open minded given what I think we've got to leverage down there.</p>
          <p>On the NFL lockout, look, I think it's way premature to talk about that. I think we've been clear that there are provisions in our contract where if there are games that get cancelled, we get something back for that either in a longer contract or whatever. I think probably when we get towards the end of this year and we talk about how we're planning for next year we can talk a little bit more about it at that time. But I'd say it's a bit premature.</p>
