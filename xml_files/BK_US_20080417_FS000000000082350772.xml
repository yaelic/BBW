          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call hosted by the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Please note that this call is being recorded. I will now to call over to Mr. Steve Lackey. Mr. Lackey, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us to review the first quarter financial results for the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks may include statements about future expectations, plans and prospects which are forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our 2007 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, April 17, 2008. We will not update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, assumptions, circumstances or events which of changed after they were made. This morning's press release focuses on the results for the Bank of New York Mellon. We also have a supplemental document, the quarterly earnings summary available on our home page which provides a five quarter pro forma combined view of the total company in our six business sectors. Unless otherwise noted &#x2013; unless otherwise noted, all comparisons to the prior year results reflect this pro forma combined view.</p>
          <p>This morning's call will include prepared comments from Bob Kelly, Chief Executive Officer, and Bruce Van Saun, Chief Financial Officer. In addition there are several members of our executive management team to address your questions about the performance of our businesses during the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Kelly. Bob?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us this morning. Clearly, we're in a pretty challenging economy right now and most of the financial markets are in distress; and given that backdrop, our businesses are performing well in a tough environment. Year-over-year we generated revenue growth of 14%, 750 basis points of operating leverage, and another quarter of double-digit earnings growth.</p>
          <p>We continue to meet our commitments we have made to our clients, shareholders and 40,000 employees. When you think about EPS, excluding our merger and integration charges, EPS was $0.72, an increase of 16% year-over-year, and excluding the impact of merger and integration charges, as well as intangible amortization, which is a non-cash expense of course EPS was $0.78, an increase of 20% over the first quarter of 2007. These results also include the impact of approximately $0.04 of net charges detailed in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>Our Security Services business led the way with continued extraordinarily strong performance. New revenue benefited from significant growth in asset servicing, foreign exchange and clearance services. We enjoyed single-digit growth in corporate trust fees despite a tough fixed-income environment due to our diversification of our global franchise. Wealth management fees were up 9% with good new business volumes and organic growth. Treasury service fee revenue increased 10% on higher global payment and cash management volumes. In asset management, we continued to grow money market funds, with net flows of $23 billion during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Weak equity market conditions impacted our performance fees which were down sequentially and year-over-year, as well as returns on fee capital investments. We continue to grow rapidly outside the U.S.; now, one-third of our revenue is international, compared to 28% this time last year. Credit quality deteriorated marginally but overall remains very strong. Our expenses remain very well controlled, and we are running ahead of our synergy targets.</p>
          <p>We continue to enjoy very strong liquidity and excellent client deposit growth. Our tier 1 capital ratio remains well above our target, but our TCE ratio fell below target this quarter, reflecting our deposit-driven larger balance sheet of $205 billion and the impact of spread widening on our investment securities portfolio. In my opinion, the lower tangible common equity ratio is the only real negative this quarter. However, we have the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity, and we don't expect any material losses in the securities.</p>
          <p>In our release, we've provided you with very transparent and hopefully, very useful disclosures around this. Now, earlier I alluded to the commitments we've made to our shareholders. One was to exit those businesses that don't support our growth in asset management and security servicing, so we can laser focus our capital into those that do. I like to report further progress on that front during the quarter. We entered into an agreement to sell 1st Business Bank in California. We sold our E*TRADE and G-trade businesses to BNY ConvergEx completing the repositioning of our execution businesses. We sold our fixed income sales and trading operation, further reducing our exposure to the credit markets. And on the investment side, we also closed our asset management acquisition in Brazil, making us now the number two non-bank owned provider in the country. You should assume that we will continue to sharpen our focus in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>One of the fundamental commitments we've made to our clients is industry-leading client service around the world in all of our businesses. I'm delighted to advise that this further evidence we are succeeding on that front and most notably in asset servicing. Last quarter we told you about our number one performance in the global custodian survey. This quarter the results of the R&amp;M global survey were released, and we were again ranked number one amongst the world's largest global custodians. So, we're consistently achieving our goal of outperforming our peers.</p>
          <p>Our success on the quality front is also paying off. In asset servicing during the quarter, we won approximately $350 billion in new assets. This represents a 60% success rate on the deals we bid on. In asset servicing our pipeline remains strong, up over the prior quarter and this time last year, and we again exceeded client retention goals, with a rate now well in excess of 99%.</p>
          <p>Another area with new business momentum is Clearing. At Pershing we've seen a big pickup in new deals. During the first quarter, Pershing's pipeline of deals waiting to be converted has actually doubled year-over-year, and we're seeing the benefit of those increased revenues as our clients begin to convert onto our systems.</p>
          <p>In summary then, we can't control the market environment we're in, but we're generating strong revenue growth, good expense control, good operating leverage. We've maintained a strong capital base and excellent liquidity. We've made good progress in raising the bar in service, growing our client base and keeping the integration on track and ahead of plan.</p>
          <p>So, at this point, I'd like to ask Bruce to provide you with more detail on the numbers, and then we're going to open it up for your Q&amp;A. Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. I will walk you through the highlights of the quarter, update you on our merger integration milestones and offer a few thoughts about our outlook for the second quarter. As our earnings show, our business model continues to deliver excellent results through a challenging environment. Strength in our volume and volatility sensitive businesses, such as Asset Servicing and Clearing, more than offset below-trend performance in our asset management business, again demonstrating the diversification and the balance of our business model.</p>
          <p>We also did an effective job in containing expense growth, resulting in significant positive operating leverage year-over-year and sequentially. Consequently, our pre-tax margins versus a year ago improved from 33% to 36%. Our capital ratios came in lower than expected as a result of spread widening on our securities portfolio, as well as the size of our balance sheet. And our credit quality overall remains solid. In short, a good start to the year.</p>
          <p>So, let's get into the numbers. We reported a $0.72 EPS from continuing operations. Included in this result were several balance sheet items that had a negative impact of $0.04 per share; more on that later. Excluding these items, our EPS result was $0.76. Our strong performance was led by continued good top line growth, as operating revenues were up 14% year-over-year. Fees were up 9%, and net interest revenue was up 39%.</p>
          <p>We demonstrated disciplined expense management, as expenses were up only 6.5%year-over-year, resulting in excellent operating leverage of approximately 750 basis points. Revenues generated outside the U.S. now comprise a full third of our total revenues; that's up from 28% in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to Page 5 of the earnings summary, which details fee growth, security servicing fees were up 20% year-over-year, given strong performance in volume driven activities, and were down slightly sequentially, reflecting seasonality in our DR business and in performance fees. Asset servicing had a stellar quarter, with fees up 40%, primarily due to a huge increase in securities lending revenue, as well as increased client activity related to market volatility, continued strong net new business, and the impact of the buyout of the joint venture with ABN Amro, which we completed late in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our assets under custody and administration increased 9% year-over-year to 23.1 trillion. This business continues to over-earn relative to the trend line performance given the current turbulent market environment. Favorable short-term credit spreads and the fed rate cuts have continued to benefit our Sec. lending activity.</p>
          <p>Issuer services fees grew modestly year-over-year. Corporate trust fee revenues were up slightly, reflecting strength in the global business, largely offset by weakness in CDOs and structured products. DRs were flat year-over-year as the slowdown in new issues offset active trading levels. Remember that the first quarter is seasonally the weakest of the year reflecting a lower level of corporate actions like dividend payments. Clearing and execution services fees decreased by 3%; however, this includes the impact of the sale of the B&amp;G trade execution businesses which were sold to BNY ConvergEx. Adjusting for this transaction, clearing and execution fee revenue increased 12% over the prior year, principally due to increased activity resulting from market volatility along the line. As such, the transaction is slightly diluted in '08, about $0.03, until we receive the earn-out. These businesses have historically contributed 50 to 60 million in revenue, and 10 to 15 million in pre-tax income on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Asset and wealth management fees increased by 5%, primarily reflecting strong money market flows and continued growth in business outside the U.S., partially offset by the previously disclosed loss of business at one of the investment motifs, as well as lower equity market values. Our AUM were 1.1 trillion, representing an 8% increase from the first quarter of last year. Net inflows totaled 23 billion. This is comprised of 29 billion in net money market inflows, offset by 6 billion of net long-term flows. The outflows reflect a general market shift from equities to money markets.</p>
          <p>Performance fees were 20 million. This is down 29 million year-over-year and 42 million sequentially. The year-over-year decline represents a lower level of performance fees generated from alternative and other quantitative products. The sequential decline represents a typical seasonal fall off.</p>
          <p>In addition, investment income declined 38 million compared to first quarter '07 and 29 million sequentially, principally reflecting losses associated with fee capital investments and lower levels of private equity gains. The weak equity market conditions and difficult credit markets have negatively impacted both performance fees and investment income, which should eventually rebound as markets recover.</p>
          <p>FX and other trading generated 42% growth year-over-year. We benefit from high levels of currency volatility, as well as higher client volumes and business wins. A partial offset to these positives was the impact of FAS 157 on our derivatives business, given deterioration in counter-party credit ratings. Fees decreased sequentially, primarily reflecting a lower valuation of our credit derivatives portfolio and the aforementioned impact of FAS 157.</p>
          <p>Turning to net interest revenue detailed on Page 7 of the earnings summary, revenue increased 39% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The strong performance compared to the first quarter of 2007 reflects both higher volumes and wider spreads. Interest earning assets on our balance sheet increased 36% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. This growth is driven by client deposits. When markets are active, we take on more frictional cash deposits and we also are viewed favorably by clients in these treacherous markets given our strong credit rating.</p>
          <p>Our yield came in at 2.10%, up two basis points from the year ago quarter and down six basis points from Q4. The sequential decline reflects a lower level of interest-free deposits, as well of the impact of a lower rate environment on these deposits. We expect further modest contraction on the yield as asset re-pricing catches up with liabilities in the next few months. On the expense front, total non-interest expenses grew 6% on an operating basis, excluding M&amp;I costs and the amortization of intangibles. Sequentially, total expenses actually declined by 123 million or 5%. We are pulling through synergies and exhibiting good overall expense discipline.</p>
          <p>On Page 9 of the earnings summary, we've displayed our investment securities portfolios by asset categories and ratings. We've also highlighted both the unrealized losses on these portfolios, as well as the other than temporary impairment write-downs during the quarter. We believe that this degree of granularity provides clean, transparent insights into the status of our portfolio. We have always focused on very safe, short duration, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, largely all AAA. Our core portfolio remains 95% AAA, 99% AAA and AA, but the current marks on these assets reflect highly illiquid market conditions, with few buyers and many forced liquidations. I want to emphasize that we have the ability and the intent to hold these securities until the prices recover or until maturity. We routinely test our investment securities for other than temporary impairment. During the quarter, we did record 74 million of OTTI. This breaks out as follows:</p>
          <p>First, 24 million related to CDOs. Amortized cost less write-downs is now reflected at 40% of par. Second, 22 million related to SIV assets that were previously purchased from asset management portfolios, which are now at 77% of par. And third, 28 million related to securities backed by home-equity lines of credit in the TRFC portfolio based on both the deterioration of specific securities, as well as weakening credit support due to downgrades of certain underlying bond insurers.</p>
          <p>It's hard to predict when the fixed-income markets will fully stabilize and recover, but in our view, we currently don't anticipate meaningful credit losses from our investment portfolios. We extended our capital support agreements on a sec. lending commingled fund to cover Thornburg Mortgage Capital resources paper, increasing our total exposure under these agreements to 85 million from 55 million. We booked an estimated loss of 12 million on these support agreements during the quarter. We will continue to closely monitor asset quality in this and in our other funds.</p>
          <p>The credit quality of our loan portfolio remains solid. The provision for credit losses was 16 million, compared to a credit of 12 million a year ago and a provision of 20 million in the fourth quarter. Charge-offs were less than provision at 13 million. Non-performing assets increased by 24 million to 210 million. The effective tax rate, excluding M&amp;I expense, was 33.3%, compared with 32.3 in the first quarter of '07 and essentially, flat with the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>With our larger balance sheet combined with a sizable increase in our mark on the securities portfolio, we saw our capital ratios dip in the quarter. That said, with a tier 1 ratio of 8.8%, we are still well above our target of 8% and very comfortable with our capital position. But since the adjusted TC ratio is at 4.14%, which is below our target of 5%, we do not plan further repurchases of our stock in the near term. We will, however, remain opportunistic on acquisitions. Remember that we generate about 25 basis points of TCE per quarter, so we should get back to our target reasonably in short order. We clearly have ample liquidity as we built liquid assets during the quarter, which is prudent given the market environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to the merger for a moment on Page 11 of our earnings summary, is an update on our progress against our integration milestones. We're continuing to meet our interim revenue synergy targets towards the run rate goal of 250 to 400 million in revenue by 2011 and will provide a progress report on investor day. On the expense side, we're currently exceeding our cumulative expense synergies target. The aforementioned 118 million in expense synergies annualized us to 472 million, two-thirds of the way to our 700 million target. Stay tuned, we'll also update on investor day. Finally, you'll note the consolidation of banks is on track for completion by early in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>I'm going to conclude my remarks by offering a few observations about the second quarter. There remained significant uncertainty around the market drivers of our performance, which include price models, volumes, volatility and credit spreads. Though if we remain in the turbulent environment of the last three quarters, we would expect to see asset servicing and clearing continue to outperform expectations. If we see a gradual recovery and rebound in equity markets, we would expect to see a bounce back in asset management. We generally see good depository receipts performance seasonally in Q2, and we expect to see that again this year. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to see the net interest margin come in modestly. In addition, we had our annual company-wide merit increase of approximately 3% on April 1.</p>
          <p>We are managing expense growth especially carefully given the revenue uncertainty, and we are continuing to focus on delivering our synergy commitments. And we'll be focused on maintaining a very strong balance sheet in terms of both liquidity and capital. You can be sure that regardless of the environment, we remain focused on executing our strategy and outperforming our peers. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bob.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of the DR business, it seemed like a little bit more of a decline then at least we were expecting. Did you see any extra decline there, and do you think it will bounce back all the way in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was actually slightly up from the first quarter of '07. So, it's exactly what we expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it is more seasonal isn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last three years it's almost been a 2% variance with respect to quarters. So, we do expect, as Bruce mentioned, the banks to come back in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the asset management business, and that's simply a function of the market. Is anything else going on there, ins and outs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, this is Ron O'Hanley. Most of it far and away is the market. We saw very strong close in short duration, money markets as you'd expect, continued strong growth outside the U.S., the offsetting that are some long-term outflows in the U.S. mutual fund market, and then we're suffering the full year impact, if you will, the annualized impact of the team that we lost last year, the Boston Company. Although the new asset loss there is actually stabilized and performance there is actually quite strong. So, we expect that to stabilize, but you're getting the full impact of that. Those would be the major ins and outs right there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it relates, Bruce, the margin, you expect that to come in some. So, is this the end of the benefit of the Fed easing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think when you get to the low rate levels that we have now, you start to get some compression on your interest-bearing deposits. So, I think, the benefit has largely worked its way through. Having said that, we've typically tried to be relatively neutral positioned, and, you know, we may come in a bit but not overly dramatic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, and the merger savings are ahead, why not increase the overall target?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've said that we'll post you on that at the investor day. So, we want to keep some good stuff for then, Mike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions for you. One, you've mentioned again the diversification of the business model, talking to a lot of positives, a lot of negatives; and I know, obviously, the business will continue to grow on a year-over-year basis. But I just want to understand how the positives and negatives balance out here as far as a go forward perspective? Meaning, are we back to an environment where you kind of just hope to keep the growth flat from here or ex the expense synergies, which we know will help going forward, how do you just look at the balance of just core business growth in this environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I would say, Ken, is it's interesting to note how the security servicing business is different than the asset management business in that they are not totally correlated, which we actually find useful. We continue to grow quickly around the world. This is a long-term cycle that we are seeing here, and it's not prior to the economic cycle. It's a secular trend we're seeing. Our business model is that we should continue to pick up business in Europe and Asia as we continue to expand. In fact, we announced last week we are growing so quickly in Asia that until last week we did not have an Asia-Pacific division. We've had so much growth there, we've decided that we've got to invest a little bit more over there to have a more coordinated approach toward Asia. So, we've just announced one of our most senior executives is going over to Hong Kong and we are going to create a new head office for the Asia region there.</p>
          <p>So, we are building for the long-term. There is no question that some of our businesses are under a bit of stress at this point, not surprising given this environment. But we continue to see pretty good revenue growth, and I would hope that we would &#x2013; that you'll see that in coming quarters as well. Bruce, anything you can add to that?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think Bob, you know, Ken, don't lose sight of the fact that if you say that there is some things on both sides of the ledger for the quarter, we still had 16% EPS growth, and on a cash basis it was 20% year-over-year. So, I think, notwithstanding the environment, we're still performing quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I'm not taking that away from money year-over-year. I'm talking about prospectively off of the base that you set now to grow from. If everything offsets each other, some good some bad, then the business could just kind of run in place on a core basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a scenario, Ken, but it's not what we're expecting when we sit around the table and talk about various scenarios about how the rest of this year will play out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. The second question was just on revenue synergies. Any update on how those are coming in with regards to the deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, this is Gerald Hassell. The revenue synergies are tracking well against that 250 to 400 million level that we described to you last year, and we'll give you a further update at the investor day conference. But we feel very positive about those revenue synergies and think we'll achieve them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, just can you give us anecdotes of are there tangible revenue synergies in this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are very similar to the ones we've seen in the past and that is greater use and greater trading capabilities in our sec. lending and foreign exchange areas, money market flows out of areas like Pershing and our corporate trust areas into Dreyfuss, cross-selling of asset management into our asset servicing clients. Those are the three main areas that continue to perform quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll give specific examples at investor day, Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Ken, and I would say we're running a little ahead of where we were hoping for certainly by June of last year. So, we've been pleased with where we are.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Good morning, folks.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we were just on the merger, just one more question. Are you finding more merger synergies then when you got more detailed on the 25400 plan? In addition to that, are you discovering more opportunities throughout the organization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we had it scoped out very well and we had a very detailed plan; and so we've executed along that plan. You do find a few forks in the road and a few opportunities and where we see that we're executing on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then, on the Clearing business, I guess you're winning business from, potentially the Bear Stearns book. How significant should we be thinking about that in future quarters? How long does it take to come into the revenue stream? And is it a very large improvement in the revenue stream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll comment on it. This is Rich Brueckner. We've doubled the pipeline, as Bob mentioned earlier. So, that's, I think, significant. We have probably another double that's not signed and we probably won't get all of that, and it will take about six to nine months to convert most of that in; that's the normal conversion period. Although, I must say, we've accelerated the pace of that in the beginning. We've converted a couple of accounts already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then if you could just talk about SIV exposure, I know in the 10-K you said it was down in the money market funds, I think to 1.7 billion. If you could give us an update on that and when you expect that to roll off; and I think you also said 8.9 billion in the securities lending collateral pools. Do have an idea of when that might run down and, of course, how comfortable you feel about the SIVs that are still in the money products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brian, this is Todd Gibbons. The SIV exposure continues to pay down pretty rapidly, as expected. I think most of the exposure, the significant majority of the exposure, is to names that have bank sponsors and they've indicated support. In the securities funds, it's now down to about 7.3 from that 8.9 billion that you talked about. And the non-bank maturities are paying off. They're very short in nature and they're paying down quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 1.7 billion in the money fund, is that still at 1.7 or is that down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's down somewhat, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know you said July/August was the timeframe when you thought the SIVs and the money market funds would probably be pretty close to zero. Is there a timeframe in the sec lending pool that you could give us on that as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I say, most of that is now bank sponsored. So, it is coming off over the course of the next year. But it's really like having an exposure to a bank at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. Another question on growth, similar to Ken's question. I know this quarter you had 9% pro forma growth in fee income year-over-year. Do you have any visibility on the kind of fee revenue growth you believe you can generate this year in the context of flat equity market, <mark type="inaudible" /> reversions, the trend with ancillary fee income categories like sec lending and foreign exchange? I think that would be really helpful. These are unusual times and unusual results, and it's kind of hard to get a baseline of what organic growth could be this year in that context.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Tom, given the uncertainty out there, that's a little hard one to call. I think we're trying to describe the framework is that asset servicing has really been off the charts, and the comps will get tougher for us at servicing as we go through the year; but asset management, because of the weak equity markets and the impact on performance fees and seed, is quite a bit below the trend. And so kind of how that plays out and the timing of how that plays out will have a lot to do on that ultimate fee growth number. But I would say that on the things that we can control in terms of providing excellent client service, the business pipelines and bringing in that new business, we feel really good about how we're positioned for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. And a follow-up on the government Treasury clearance area. You guys are one of only two banks that provide clearance of government Treasury securities. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on how the current market environment is possibly impacting that part of the business, and if the recent Fed actions, like that new primary dealer credit facility, if those type of actions are a net positive or net negative for that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, it's Gerald. As you know, we're one of the two main clearers with the Fed. All the new Fed actions that have been put in place, they're using our pipes to implement those actions. So, we're seeing some activity as a result of that. In our global collateral management, what we call collateral management capabilities, we're still seeing growth in the tri-party repo market, because that's the safe haven for dealers to finance their inventories and for investors to feel comfortable. So, we're still seeing good growth and good activity out of our broker-dealer services area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gerald. And those fees are in asset servicing, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And one last question for you all. One of the merger milestones targeted to be completed this quarter, I guess, was a complete review of all the business segments at the combined bank. I was just wondering if you can give us any type of preview on kind of the outcome of all those reviews? That's all I have. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I heard what he said. Hey, Tom, I think the list of things that Bob talked about in his remarks is an indication that this process is under way and we're acting on some of these things. So, we've sold the 1st Business Bank in California; we completed the sale on ConvergEx. So, there are activities around the periphery that we're currently dealing with. And so, I think when we get to investor day, we'll give a good view as to how we look at the businesses and what their full potential is, and how we view those in terms of the total franchise. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll give you a real good sense as to where we want to invest, why we want to invest and what are the criteria we look at in terms of everything from revenue growth to globalization to expense and revenue synergies, capital usage. You know, we're in interesting times, and we have businesses that don't fit our model and we've been dealing with them, and we'll continue to. At the same token, we're going to redeploy some capital into those businesses where we very clearly have long-term competitive advantages, and therefore superior shareholder returns. So, we'll keep working on it. And even though the environment is tough, we can get interesting things done at the margin.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Bob.</p>

          <p>Hey, Gerard.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the incentive comp for the asset management business, was the decline mostly due to the market conditions, or did you see some of the decline because of the people that left Boston Company last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Gerard. The decline is formulaic. Most of our incentives are paid as a percentage of pre-tax. There's also some incentives paid as a percentage of performance fees, and since both declined you saw a formulaic decline there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And Bob, you may have mentioned this, and I had to jump off the call for a minute. But in terms of reviewing the business lines, obviously, you announced the sale of the bank on the West Coast very recently. Are you finished going through the process of determining which lines you really want to keep and which ones may be subject to sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The way we think about it, Gerard, and it's not totally black and white, but it's pretty clear the way I kind of think about it, and it's really about capital allocation; and I think of rough categories as being, here's a business where not only do we not want to constrain them in growing capital, but we would actually consider acquisitions, so, acquisition capital as well could be a category for businesses where you don't want to constrain capital at all. But on the other hand, you won't want to do acquisitions in that space; and it could be that could change over time.</p>
          <p>Then there'd be another category of businesses where you just want to maintain capital and not grow it. And finally, there'd be a category where you want to harvest capital, including through selling. And we have finished all the reviews. It's been an enormous amount of work. You're seeing some of the output of that in terms of things that we've sold and we've purchased over the last few quarters. As we complete that, I think we've had a wonderful education process for all the executive team here, as well as for our Board of Directors. We are in the process of summarizing it, quite frankly, and putting together a nice presentation for our Board. We're doing it off-site at the beginning of June, which is something we had scheduled about six months ago as part of the inevitable outcome of this. And we also want to give them highlights of everything that we're going to show the market a couple of weeks later at our investor day, which is June -</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>June 17, per Steve. So, I think the process has worked very nicely. And it has accelerated our ability to understand our businesses, where we make money, and where we can get more revenue and expense synergies, frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would it be fair when we see these results at the investor day that the lines of businesses that are capital intense and don't meet your return hurdles, that over time there would be less exposure to those business lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, that'd be roughly true. Clearly, we're not going to advertise which ones are in the last category. That wouldn't be fair to our businesses or our people. But it'll be pretty clear to you as to what our criteria is and which are the ones that are clearly the ones that we're going to be growing over time, including what geography. And beyond that, we simply can't advertise externally. In fact, we don't advertise it outside of the executive committee which ones we are taking a much harder look at over time.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a quick follow-up. I guess, this would be for Tim Keaney and maybe Bruce. As we talk about the net interest margin outlook going forward, what's your ability to lower foreign office deposit rates? And we've seen in that some competitors coming down pretty sharply. And then how do you feel about custody deposit growth in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, it's Jim. Our growth in funds deposits, as you've seen, has been quite significant year-over-year. A big piece of that, obviously, is with the significant growth that we've enjoyed and realized with the ABN Amro/Mellon joint venture. The competition around rates, I'd say, is reasonably competitive at this point. We would expect that to continue as we look out over the course of the balance of this year. Bruce, I don't know if you have anything further to add on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that we're seeing the good environment and you're seeing the business wins affecting the levels and the rates are pretty stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, like you said, that won't really have a big impact on the net interest margin going forward? It's really more of your asset liability and management that's driving it in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from Ken Usdin with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Thanks for the follow-up opportunity. I think maybe a question for Todd. Todd, just on the credit book, I was wondering if you could just give us an update. The metrics show that the book is holding up so very well with only a slight increase in nonperformers. But I was just wondering if you could touch on any updates in some of the areas that you highlighted in the K as far as any concerns in specific portfolios about the credit deterioration, and also, can you give us an update on exposure levels and how aggressive you've been or plan to be as far as taking down risk incrementally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Ken. We have continued to take down exposures, especially on the weaker credits. We've let them mature off. We're no longer really in that type of business. As you'll see in our queue, where we give more of a breakdown, our financial exposures have come down somewhat in the first quarter. That's pretty easy for us to moderate. There's no question that we are seeing some migration, that this is a tough environment. It's difficult to precisely estimate credit costs. But we would expect them to trend up somewhat from the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you say credit costs, do you mean charge offs, or do you mean the amount of provision?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>By major magnitude or just incremental?</p>

          <p>Okay. And my second just quick question is just, Bruce, on the TCE beam below your target, how important is TCE specifically to either the rating agencies or other parties? Does it become any more of an incremental issue? And have you bedded that with your respective constituencies?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think our primary capital measure is the tier one, and that most closely mirrors our economic capital measures that we use the framework internally. But TCE clearly also is an important measure for the rating agencies; and we've talked to the rating agencies. In the past you may recall, Ken, that when we've done acquisitions, we've brought the TCE ratio down into the ZIP code, and because of the strong capital generation that we have from our businesses, we've been able to restore it relatively quickly. So, we've had those conversations and we have internally a very good comfort level; and I think our external constituents also share that view.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Ken. It's one of the, frankly, joys of this business in our mix of business. It tends to be fairly capital light. So, we can generate the capital.</p>
