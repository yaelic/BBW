          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Volkswagen AG Half Yearly Financial Reports, January to June 2011, Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christine Ritz, Head of Group Investor Relations for Volkswagen AG. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volkswagen conference call on the results for the period January to June 2011 based on the outlook and the financial report we published this morning. Joining me today are Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG responsible for Finance and Controlling; and Christian Klingler, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing. You can follow the webcast and download the chart from our website, www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by email or called in. Following the presentation, we will first take questions from analysts and then at end we will make sure there is time for questions from journalists.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and allow me to add my warm welcome to those of you joining this call today. During the first half of 2011, we have made notable steps towards the goals of our Strategy 2018. We delivered more than 4 million cars for the first time, growing at 14.3%, nearly twice the rate of the global market.</p>
          <p>This drove sales revenue up 25.8% with operating profit more than doubling to &#x20AC;6.1 billion. Profit before tax increased substantially by &#x20AC;5.6 billion to &#x20AC;8.2 billion. There are three main drivers here. Firstly, the underlying operating performance. Secondly, our equity consolidated companies, which include, in particular, our Chinese joint ventures and our participation in the operating business of Porsche, reported excellent figures.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, the valuation of the putative call rights with respect to Porsche Zwischenholding had a substantial impact. Automotive net liquidity, at &#x20AC;19.4 billion remained at a high level.</p>
          <p>On the 9th of May, we announced that we had increased	 our stake in MAN through the 30% threshold of voting rights that triggered a mandatory offer for the remaining shares. This step was the prerequisite for setting aside anti-trust restrictions while maintaining full flexibility for a future tighter combination of our Truck interest.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the result of the tender offer and the objective of achieving substantial synergies is moving closer. We will continue to work expeditiously in close coordination with the relevant authorities towards obtaining the required regulatory approvals globally and remain confident of achieving settlement of the offer within the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>We will come back to the operational point in more detail later on. For now, I would like to hand you over to Mr. Klingler who will provide little more color to our sales performance. Mr. Klingler, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to the conference call from me also. The first chart shows the development of the world car market by quarter in comparison to the same quarter of the previous year. Growth recorded last year was mainly due to recovery of the economic environment on the one hand and government support measures in many markets on the other.</p>
          <p>In some markets, the supportive measures expired last year, which explains the decline in growth rates. Therefore, on the quarter-by-quarter comparison, we see that the global market lost some of its growth momentum in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Despite a high comparison base from a year ago, the global market recorded further positive growth rates in the first half of 2011. However, in order to evaluate the relative development of the global market, comparison to the last normal year of 2007 is appropriate, as the next chart shows.</p>
          <p>The positive influence of the government support measures in many markets led to a significant market rebound in the second half of 2009. As the incentives in many European countries were phased out, the rebound continued on a slower pace through 2010.</p>
          <p>The first three quarters of 2010 were still slightly below the normal year of 2007. However, more favorable economic conditions in the major markets, as well as a strong increase of demand in China and India, contributed to an overall stabilization of the global car market. The strong fourth quarter 2010 was due mainly to further improving conditions in major European markets plus the strong Chinese market in the final quarter as major sales incentives approached the end.</p>
          <p>In early 2011 the markets lost some of the positive momentum as some of the emerging economies increased interest rates in order to prevent the economies from overheating. Some supportive programs, for example France, were phased out. Conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as the situation in Japan, resulted in some negative impacts for the market.</p>
          <p>In addition, the industry struggled with supply shortages due to the disruptions in Japan. As a result, the market growth slowed in the second quarter. For the second half of the year, we expect some relief in the supply chain as the Japanese industry is gradually recovering. Despite higher oil prices, demand growth is still evident in most regions of the world.</p>
          <p>For 2011, our latest forecast suggests the global market will remain well above the pre-crisis level of 2007, up to a maximum of 6% higher than 2010. In the second half of the year, the projected growth rate in the major growth markets are likely to decline. However, we are confident that in the year 2011, the global car market will reach an all-time record level.</p>
          <p>If you go to the next chart, in the first half of 2011, our deliveries to customers have shown double-digit growth again. The Volkswagen Group again outperformed the overall car market in the first two quarters of 2011. We continued to gain global market share in the first half of 2011 supported mainly by the Group performance in China, in Russia, in India as well as in Germany and, of course, in the United States.</p>
          <p>So if we go to the next chart, here you can see the market performance of the regions around the world in direct comparison to the performance of the Volkswagen Group in the first half of 2011. With the exceptions of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as South America, the Volkswagen Group has outperformed the market in all other regions worldwide.</p>
          <p>In Central and Eastern Europe, we increased our market share in many markets, including Russia. The remarkable growth of the Russian market led to a further increase of its relative importance within the region. However, as our market share in Russia is below the Group's regional average, the overall market share in Central and Eastern Europe declined, that's the so-called base effect.</p>
          <p>In South America, our market share declined slightly, the Brazilian market increased in relative terms more than our deliveries. Currently, the competitive situation there is very tough with new players in the market on one hand and some supply shortages due to strikes in Curitiba in the second quarter on the other. In Western Europe, despite the market contraction of 2.1%, the Volkswagen Group recorded a positive result as we achieved an increase in our deliveries of 7.1%. As already mentioned, some of the major markets in the region still suffered declines following the end of support measures in general weak economies. In particular, the Spanish and Italian market contracted heavily by 26.8% and 13.5% respectively.</p>
          <p>Now we will have a look at the performance of the individual brand of the Group. In the first half of 2011, all our volume brands achieved an increase in terms of sales. And, for the Group, total deliveries to customers exceeded last year's level by 14.3%. Volkswagen Passenger Cars deliveries were up by an impressive 11.8% to more than 2.5 million cars, driven by strong demand in China, in India, in the United States and Russia.</p>
          <p>Audi deliveries rose by 17.7% compared to last year, to 653,000 cars. &#x160;koda expanded deliveries up to 455,000 cars mainly due to strong demand in China and Russia. SEAT, as well as Bentley, have also managed to expand deliveries. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and Scania have benefited from the improving economic conditions in some of the major markets, as the development in the Truck segment is closely tied to consumer demand.</p>
          <p>Let us now take a look at a few highlights on some of our new models, which will provide a good base for our sales performance in the coming months.</p>
          <p>The Volkswagen Golf Cabrio is the Golf among the convertibles. Excellent quality, sophistication in design and looks, latest technology and the driving pleasure for convertible together with all around economy and complete everyday practicality. Shown at the Geneva Motor Show the Volkswagen Golf Cab was introduced on the markets last month. The new Volkswagen Beetle Coupe is the lifestyle Volkswagen with one of a kind history and high appeal for young and trendsetting customers. The Beetle combines the emotional heritage with the future of Volkswagen. Introduction on the market is targeted soon this year. The Audi Q3 is the sporty progressive SUV for an active modern and urban lifestyle, developed for new demands. The Audi Q3 had its world premiere in Shanghai in April this year and will hit the road in the fourth quarter 2011. Then the Volkswagen Crafter, with its new engine and the ensuing excellent fuel consumption figures stands for economy, robustness and reliability. It is therefore the ideal vehicle for the toughest jobs and projects. The New Crafter was introduced on the market last month.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Klingler. Now, let's switch back to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch for some more details on the key elements of our financial performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The first six months of 2011, sales revenue increased by 25.8% to &#x20AC;77.8 billion. Higher volume was the main driver of the revenue gained, at 12.6 billion, which also reflects the inclusion of Porsche Holding Salzburg from March 1. Pricing improved by &#x20AC;0.2 billion for the first six months. Mix, including gross product and country mix, contributed &#x20AC;1 billion to our performance. As we commented previously, exchange rates are starting to turn; came in at a net negative 0.1 billion, down from a plus of 0.6 billion as at the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Scania reported a &#x20AC;1.1 billion improvement in revenue over the first half of 2010. Our financial services division also improved up &#x20AC;1.2 billion. Increase in sales was again the major influence in an improvement in the operating results from &#x20AC;2.8 billion to &#x20AC;6.1 billion versus the first half of 2010. Volume, together with price and mix effects came to a total positive of &#x20AC;3.5 billion with Q2 contributing &#x20AC;1.3 billion reflecting a rising basis effect. Key drivers were not only volume and the inclusion of Porsche Holding Salzburg but also a higher mix of cars and a richer equipment content.</p>
          <p>As in the first quarter, currency was a net &#x20AC;0.2 billion headwind mainly due to the U. S. dollar and the British pound.</p>
          <p>Our global sourcing activities in combination with long-term contracts and hedging operations as well as the progressive implementation of our toolkits are offsetting the trend of rising commodity prices. First six months, we were able to reduce our product costs by an impressive &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Mix costs and depreciation increased by &#x20AC;0.8 billion as we continue to ramp up the additions to our production network and invest through higher engineering costs in our future. Scania, including the effects of PPA and slated to rise in revenue to an increase in earnings by a further &#x20AC;0.1 billion, which comes on top of a very good performance in 2010.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'll focus on our financial services division added &#x20AC;0.2 billion. To sum up, our operating result more than doubled to &#x20AC;6.1 billion. Let me now turn to cash flow in the automotive division at &#x20AC;8.4 billion. Operating cash flow was up 16% over the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the investment side, cash invested, increased to &#x20AC;6.5 billion, which includes &#x20AC;3.3 billion for the purchase of the Porsche holding sales productivities, as well as the stake in SGL carbon as we announced in the first quarter. And the increase of our voting rights in MAN to 30.47%, end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Excluding one-offs cash invested increased from &#x20AC;2.6 billion to &#x20AC;3.2 billion. Allow me to note here that the further cash outflow of &#x20AC;3.4 billion for the increase in our stake of 55.9% of the voting rights in MAN is contingent on approval of the entire trust authorities, which is already mentioned. We expect in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Our CapEx ratio at 3.7% was slightly over the 3.5% recorded last year as we continued to invest in our future, in particular into the MQB Toolkit. As the year progresses, we expect the ratio to rise closer to our 6% guidance. Total net cash flow over the first six months for the automotive's division came in positive at &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Net liquidity at &#x20AC;19.4 billion is up &#x20AC;0.8 billion on the year-end 2010 figure even taking account of the investments I mentioned previously, as well as the &#x20AC;1.3 billion dividend paid to our shareholders -- both Volkswagen, as well as the minority shareholders of Scania in the second quarter. This strong financial foundation supports our steps along the Strategy 2018 path and ensures we have adequate liquidity to pursue the bill of an integrated automotive group with Porsche in combination with a strong financial rating.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to the financial performance of our brands. The Volkswagen passenger car brands posted earnings for the first half of just over &#x20AC;2 billion and more than double the prior year period. The brand achieved an impressive 4.5% margin. Audi continues to go from strength to strength doubling the operating result to &#x20AC;2.5 billion and reporting an excellent 11.8% margin for the first six months.</p>
          <p>Skoda also posted an excellent margin for a volume manufacturer at 7.7% earnings, almost doubled at &#x20AC;412 million. In an exceptionally tough southern European market, SEAT is lost. Bentley also improved markedly. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles doubled their results based on solid growth in eastern Europe, especially Russia.</p>
          <p>Scania reported a strong result up 29% at &#x20AC;743 million. The other line in the chart includes the elimination of intercompany sales as well as the purchase price accounting charge with regard to our consolidation of Scania.</p>
          <p>In addition, since March 1st, the results for Porsche Holdings sales were net of PPA charge are included here too. Volkswagen Financial Services reported an improved result of &#x20AC;553 million, up over 50% resulting from a higher number of contracts and an extension of activities. Combining the Automotive and Financial Services divisions is a total operating profit of &#x20AC;6.1 billion for the first six months. This brings me to the financial result, which for the first half came to a positive &#x20AC;2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Here I would like to spend a little time going through the performance of the at times quite volatile and hard to predict key drivers. To begin with just a short reminder that here we include the results from our equity accounted investments, changes in the valuations of derivatives as well as interest related costs. The company's consolidated equity recorded strongly positive results, reflecting the excellent performance. Our Chinese joint ventures, which reported proportional operating profit of &#x20AC;1.2 billion as well as our 49.9% holding in Porsche, additional holding after PPA reported a clearly positive net result for the first half.</p>
          <p>The respective put and call rights with regards to our plant integration with Porsche are valued as with any derivative instrument on a regular basis. At the end of the first quarter 2011 this evaluation stood at a positive 1.4 billion that's &#x20AC;400 million lower than the year-end valuation chiefly as a result of higher discount sector due to rising interest rates.</p>
          <p>Evaluation has now increased to &#x20AC;3.9 billion primarily based on stronger underlying earnings projections for Porsche AG, the likelihood of achieving a decision to merge within the time line of the comprehensive agreement in our estimation remained unchanged at 50%. The net impact from the valuation in the second quarter financial result is therefore a positive 2.5 billion giving a net positive &#x20AC;2.1 billion for the period generated to June 2011.</p>
          <p>Finally, the other financial results also includes a mark-to-market valuation of interest rates exposure in our currency hedging instruments. This effect amounts to approximately &#x20AC;700 million negative on a group-wide basis and is a temporary non-cash effects due to the spot hedge accounting that we applied in our currency hedging. This technical effect will reverse entirely before the expiration of the respective hedging contract.</p>
          <p>Now before concluding today's presentation, allow me to just spend a moment commenting on the status of the moves to form an integrated automotive company of Volkswagen Porsche. The preparations for the planned merger of Volkswagen Porsche are progressing on schedule.</p>
          <p>The required extraordinary general meetings of Volkswagen and Porsche are scheduled for December 2011. The joint merger auditor has also now been appointed by the Stuttgart Regional Court. The legal and tax hurdles have not yet been cleared. These relate in particular to the ongoing proceedings or actions against Porsche SE in Germany and the U. S. due to alleged market manipulation, and to potential changes resulting from a new [foreign language], which is best translated as the taxation of reorganization circular.</p>
          <p>However, a draft of the new rules is now available. On the basis of this draft, we expect to reach a suitable outcome with the relevant tax authorities. Overall, we continue to believe that there is a 50% probability of the General Meeting resolutions required for the merger of Porsche AC with Volkswagen AG being adopted by the deadline of the end of 2011, as stipulated in the Comprehensive Agreement.</p>
          <p>Board of management expects to make a final assessment of this matter during the course of September this year. We're also preparing for the eventuality that a resolution on the measure will not to be adopted this year. One of the issues to be addressed is how to fully integrate Porsche's operating business into the Volkswagen group. In this case, Volkswagen is entitled to acquire a further 50.1% of the shares of Porsche Zwischenholding, and therefore indirectly 100% of the shares of Porsche AG by exercising a call option at defined dates in spring to 2013 at the earliest.</p>
          <p>Board of management will hold talks about the related issues with all parties involved. We remain committed to the goal of creating an integrated automatic group with Porsche irrespective of the approach that is ultimately adopted to achieve this.</p>
          <p>To close my presentation today, I'd like to make a few comments on our outlook which you can read in full in our half year report. Volkswagen groups key competitive advantages at its unique grand portfolio and its continually growing presence in all key regions of the world.</p>
          <p>Modular toolkit system will have an increasingly positive effect on the groups cost structure. Second half of 2011, Volkswagen groups brands will once again introduce a large number of fascinating new models to the market thus further expanding our strong position. We expect that the group's deliveries will exceed the prior-year level, and that sales revenue and operating profit in 2011 will be significantly higher than the previous year. The continuing volatility in interest and exchange rates trends and commodities prices will weaken the positive volume effect. Disciplined cost investment management and the continued optimization of our processes remain core components of our Strategy 2018.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's have the first question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our first question today comes from Daniel Schwartz of Commerce Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is on Volkswagen brand. The margin sequentially slightly decreased towards this first quarter, while all other units improved sequentially. Maybe you could elaborate which was the negative effect that hit Volkswagen brand more than your other brands? And maybe second question, you could clarify in how far lower provisions or change in provisions contributed to earnings or to the stated earnings in the second quarter? And last question on FAW, maybe you could give an update on what your plans are, how far your negotiations are, to increase to 49% and what the potential financial impact of that could be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Daniel, you have three questions for us and I guess Mr. P&#xF6;tsch will be happy to answer those questions. So the first question is related to the Volkswagen brand and if he can give some more details on the performance and on the margin development in the second quarter of the Volkswagen brand, which effects have we seen there? The second question refers to provisions, if we have seen any significant change in provisions or if any change in provisions contributed to our earnings. And the last question refers to our China business, if we have any plans to increase our stake to 49% in our joint venture FAW and if there &#x2013; if we can quantify a possible financial impact? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to the first question on the margin of Volkswagen passenger cars, first of all, let me say, just to make sure that we have the same figures on the table. There is a difference of just one tenth of the margin between the first and the second quarter. And honestly speaking, I think &#x2013; I mean, of course there are a number of reasons, but I don't think that any elementary change of the performance of the Volkswagen passenger car brand.</p>
          <p>I think it's clearly to say that the momentum is positive for the remainder of the year. Of course, we are always well advised to look at the framework conditions and I don't have to say and I do not want to repeat everything, which you can read every day in the newspapers because we all know it, the framework conditions are volatile, difficult to be judged by all the various debt crisis which are in place. But as far as we have influence on the ongoing business, I can say we are fully on track at Volkswagen passenger cars and we're looking at another good performance for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Then this leads me to the second question on provisions. And possibly there is some link to the position in our P&amp;L other operating income, which might have fueled this kind of consideration. So maybe I take a minute to quickly explain the connections there.</p>
          <p>First of all, I think it is important to recognize that, if we get started with the P&amp;L position of the comprehensive income, that this is only to some extent driven by the release of the provisions. There is a significant effect coming by our currency hedging, for example, and if we look at the first half, there is a significant positive effect included in terms of currency effects, which are reflected there. And in a similar way, there are also quite higher earnings included, which do come from commodity futures transactions.</p>
          <p>Of course, there is &#x2013; following the regular terms, that if the fact-based basis falls away, there is also a part which is related to the release of provisions. Now, it is important to note here that the building of new provisions, of course, is regularly done by the various functions in the group, the Volkswagen Group. And I think there is good proof to that if you take your time and look at balance sheet, which tells you the true story, if we look at the positions of other provisions sitting there and you will recognize that there was a significant build-up of provisions in the first six months and also in the second quarter 2011. So to cut a long story short, no support of the operating performance by the release of provisions.</p>
          <p>Third question is a question &#x2013; I cannot answer as being asked, because clearly and we recognize that there were a few rumors flying around that we are in &#x2013; we are seeming to be in negotiations before increasing our stake in our joint venture in China with FAW. Now, let me say very clearly, the core of our undertaking is that we have a very long-standing relationship with both of our Chinese joint ventures. And this is not really related to the amount of shareholding we have there. So we don't see any direct consequences by this question and that's why we will concentrate on building up again on this partnership.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Horst Schneider here from HSBC. I've got three questions, if I may. The first one relates to the operating business and I would like to get an update about the average delivery time now for your fleet, I remember to the last call you have explained again that you have got great order book and for some cars you need to wait even more than half a year. I would like to get a number which maybe can tell us what is the average delivery time for your fleet. And then I would like to get an update also on the production planning for Q3 and Q4. I could imagine in Q2 you were still impacted by Japan. So I would like to know if in  H2 maybe the production volumes could be even higher than in Q1 also having in mind that your ramp up the Chattanooga plant in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And then another question relates to Porsche and here I would like to know again what is the prerequisite for the merger, so have we got to see really a statement from the prosecutor in Germany by September, and if not, would that destroy here the merger? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Horst. You have three questions for us. The first question I guess is an issue for Mr. Klingler, the topic relates or you are referring to our delivery time. If Mr. Klingler can give you an update how are the delivery times at the moment, what is here the average of the fleet or how big &#x2013; how strong is the demand?</p>
          <p>The second one and the third one will be answered by Mr. P&#xF6;tsch. The first one refers to the production &#x2013; our production planning in the third quarter and fourth quarter, if we do expect higher production volumes in the second half maybe also due to the ramp up in Chattanooga. And the last question refers to our planned merger with Porsche, if we do expect a statement or some news from the public prosecutor in Stuttgart by September or how is our judgment there, what's our expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It's a pleasure to answer the first question. First maybe it's important to understand the delivery times are important in the market where we have car to be built and the car to stock. What does it mean, for example, in United States the people are not waiting for the cars, they're buying the cars which are on the stock. So you are referring probably to the delivery times in Europe, in the majority of these countries we do have car to be built to the demand of the customers. We do not have average delivery times for the cars because we do have lot of cars which are pretty fast ready, between 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, but still there are other items on the cars where we had issues which can have a delivery time more than 4 months, 5 months or 6 months. The order book is still strong. We are still on a very good level, order intake is still positive. We are still on a positive level as well. And we are doing everything to reduce our delivery times over the next three to six months.</p>
          <p>In general, I think the company has done a great job in comparison &#x2013; well, connection, sorry to the Japanese issues. We have not lost production in an important demand. We just continue to have a very good demand situation of our customers due to the very good products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. So that means you expect also restocking in the next few months if you say you would like to reduce delivery times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, the &#x2013; we expect that due to the stock situation now we have maybe to discuss differently per region, but in some of the regions, yes, we believe that some stocking would be a positive impact for our customer not to wait too long for the cars, for example, in China or as well in some of our countries in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the second question regarding production in the upcoming quarters, and maybe consistent with the comments of Mr. Klingler, let me first of all say, on the basis of still strong demand and high order backlog, too long delivery times, partial under-stocking, we took a decision for this summer to &#x2013; as far as the most important plants are concerned, to not close down the plants during the summer time completely, but to continue in most of the plants with the production.</p>
          <p>And this is also going to continue on in the third quarter, where already some Saturday shifts have been agreed, for example, in Wolfsburg for the Golf, the Tiguan and the Touran and of course, the same applies also for Audi.</p>
          <p>The other point is that, in the second half, some additional capacity will go on stream and you are &#x2013; already made the point of Chattanooga, that's of course one area of additional capacity also in terms of producing a new car and we also will have some additional capacity in China available. Then &#x2013; so hopefully, we can take a little step in terms of normalizing the situation. But from today's point of view, it remains unlikely that we will reach what we would define as an ideal stock level until the year-end.</p>
          <p>Then to the third question, which &#x2013; importance or how we would see any intended statement by the prosecutor in Stuttgart working on several Porsche issues. Now, first of all, let me say that of course, we do not have any transparency on when and how and with which result the prosecutor might open up his opinion to the public. And in terms of the relevance for the merger process, I think it's important to say that there are a number of issues where we need, compared to the most recent status, progress. And that is why I think it's difficult to say, without talking pretty long on this, whether any single one &#x2013; any single issue could contribute to the fundamental judgment whether a merger could happen 2011 or not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Adam Hull from WestLB. Three questions if I may. The first one is on the VW brand margin. Just to get a feel for the impact of the start-up costs on Chattanooga and when obviously that comes on full stream into next year, just to give us maybe the feel of when &#x2013; which quarter you would expect perhaps the worst negative of that and when you'd expect that &#x2013; that kind of a normalized rate when we look at the VW brand margin.</p>
          <p>And secondly, you talked a little bit about the benefit of FX hedging. Maybe, if you could give us some indication of what the kind of scale of the FX hedging in a quarter at the moment is benefiting relative to the spot FX rates now. And I understand you're saying that you're provisioning for that so it's counter, but if you could give us a bit more detail?</p>
          <p>And then finally on the Chinese business, could you just update a little bit on the recent conditions from your perspective and also could you just tell us what the dividend will be this financial year from the Chinese JV, I think that comes through in Q3 also, that would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Adam. The &#x2013; you have three questions for us. So the first question is again about the margin of the Volkswagen brand and if we can give you some more details of a probable impact of the start-up cost of our plant in Chattanooga? Is that &#x2013; or when will that hit most the Volkswagen brand, with regard to the margin.</p>
          <p>And then the second question was with regard to hedging and scale effects related to FX and then &#x2013; if we can give you us some more details.</p>
          <p>And then you want to have an update on China business. I am sure Mr. Klingler is happy to give to you some details. And the second part of the question was, if we can give you a guidance with regard to the dividend we do expect this year from our Chinese joint ventures. So I would say Mr. Klingler can start with the China business. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you come to China, there is a situation where the market demand over the last two, three years has increased heavily. There have been measures given by the government, which ended partially end of last year. But we still see a market in the passenger car, which isn't going up. On the other side we see that inflation is worrying more and more the government and that the government is continue to surveyed with a lot of sensibility and therefore has some actions &#x2013; has installed some actions to reduce the impact of inflation, like for example interest rate increases or in &#x2013; to a certain extent reduction of possibilities to get some money for the customers.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we have seen measures by Beijing &#x2013; by the town of Beijing, which has reduced the possibility for customers in Beijing to buy a car, it's more complicated. Which has on one hand of course the negative impact on the sales numbers, but it has on the other hand, a very positive impact on the mix, because if you're buying a car, you're buying an expensive one or a more expensive one, so we are on a very good track concerning that and have increased our market share in Beijing additionally to that.</p>
          <p>This &#x2013; if you want to counter &#x2013; or let's say, not so positive impact from Beijing has been counterbalanced strongly by the stronger demand of the so-called second-tier and third-tier, sorry, towns. So what we see in general is first, a market which will not have the same growth rate that it had over the last two years, but what we have forecasted already when you have started the year, at that time we believe the growth rate could be between 8% and 10%. So maybe it is still feasible, at least on the passenger cars, I'm not talking by the LCVs. We see as well that the second-tier and third-tier towns are continuing to grow strongly, and we believe that the market conditions in general will stay on a positive momentum. For us, there are no signs of getting worried about the market conditions in China. Additionally for us, we do have still a stock level, which is, compared to our competitors, very low, which means we have a very good demand, we have a very good control on prices, and we just launched the new Passat, with a good success as well, at Shanghai. So in general, we are still positive and optimistic on our performance in the Chinese market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I continue with the question on the dividend. We expect to receive 2011 for 2010, and that's most probably going to be more than a billion, and so far we have received less than half of that.</p>
          <p>Then another question was on, when &#x2013; related to Chattanooga, all the effects coming from there, from the ramp-up situation, might represent the worst hit for the P&amp;L. Clearly, Q2 was a pretty &#x2013; in the P&amp;L, sense difficult quarter. Why? Because production is running already still on a &#x2013; some lower level, but it's running. Personnel &#x2013; staffing of course is already there for a much higher level because there are number of training processes taking place. So from that position coming, I would say Q2 and Q3 are the worst ones. As we start shipping then, the end of Q3, that should look much better in the fourth quarter already.</p>
          <p>Then there was another question on hedging. Now let me quickly make sure that we understand it correctly. Because &#x2013; we say is there an effect in the P&amp;L, the answer would be simple, there is no effect because you built the basis for the underlying business by entering into hedges. Once the basis business is triggering the hedge, you realize the business on the basis of this. But I understood your question as such that if we compared business being executed on the basis of a hedged position as compared to market conditions, if we weren't hedged &#x2013; of course we all understand that there is a broad range, but typically in the given framework, I would say clearly there should be a positive effect coming from hedge activities of more than $0.5 billion per annum. Could be also &#x2013; it could also be substantially more than 0.5 billion, depending of course on the range of exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just follow up on that, I mean the spot rate is, whatever, 1.44 against the dollar &#x2013; euro. I mean just to get a feel, in this year, compared to spot, are we talking &#x2013; is it like 0.5 billion or is it more? Just to give us some feel, because from the outside it's very difficult to compare some of the hedging policies of the different companies and what the positive effects are feeding through into the P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You already made the point, it is &#x2013; and you're well aware of this, it is a piece of the business which is of course relevant for competition and that is why I think I took quite a step in explaining this in the way I did, but I don't want to say more on this.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Jochen Gehrke of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, just two quick ones. We've seen most recently some commentary suggesting that the fast growth of VW and the simultaneous buildup of new capacities is causing some quality issues. Now that's a familiar problem we're seeing with competitors of yours and obviously one of the concerns we have. Could you just comment on the developments you've seen in &#x2013; in particular your new facilities? Are you happy with the quality levels that are coming out and if so what are you doing to make assure that this is the case?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just briefly on your cash flow, obviously second quarter was a significant working capital outflow. Just for the remainder of the year, you talked a lot about stocks but working capital in general, is this in the second half of the year going to be a major drag for the company or should we go for give or take a flat number or could it even be a positive? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Jochen, you have two questions for us. The first question will be answered by Mr. Klingler, it's &#x2013; you are asking of &#x2013; about the topic of quality, if we see any quality issues due to our worldwide growth.</p>
          <p>And the second question refers to the cash flow development in the second quarter and if we can give there an outlook for the second half, will there be a &#x2013; and the effect coming from working capital, how &#x2013; which development do we see for the rest of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I'll just start with the question on the quality. In general we continue to increase our quality on our products every year. So if you talk to our dealers, they say of course laughing positively that they have less and less work on warranties. So in general, we see this positive quality development all over in the region. I think you're talking about precisely of the new plants, which are in Pune, in Kaluga and the United States. So for United States, we cannot talk because the Passat launch will happen in several months.</p>
          <p>So if we come now to the quality in Russia and in Pune, I think in general our guys in the company have done a great job. We have cars which are getting very good reception from the customers. For example in India, I think we have won nearly all the prizes which are available due to the products; not only products but as well as on the quality; the same account to Russia. And if there were a quality issue, we are always fighting very strongly to increase. Is everything perfect? The answer is no. But I think you will rarely see a company, which is so much driven, and so much concerned, and so much decided to continue to improve our quality issues. So we do that every day and we fighting for that.</p>
          <p>So, in general, we see a positive quality development. Now, if you come now to some of the report we had seen in the United States, for example, to talk about the J.D. Power report. In the J.D. Power report, we increased the quality as well. Not to that level what we wanted but we know exactly why, so we will fix that step-by-step. But even there, basically an improvement that we have seen, for example that we have the brand Volkswagen &#x2013; six of our cars, which are the best safety picks, which is done here by an authority, and no other brand has this positive momentum.</p>
          <p>So I can assure you that, the concern about quality is fully shared. And as you know, on our marketing strategy, we have four goals and one of that is customer satisfaction to become number one. And of course, the majority in that is to have the right cars, the right time, and of course in the right quality. So I think we have a clear commitment &#x2013; and to a certain extent even an obsession to go further on, on the positive way of increasing our quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So then, I can comment on the question with regard to cash flow and working capital. Now clearly, we are not at all dissatisfied with development in terms of cash flow, because it's necessary to look a little bit closer to some elements. And of course, the dividend payout, as I already mentioned, where Volkswagen and Scania in a magnitude of roughly $1.3 billion is of course a very important issue in this regard.</p>
          <p>A couple of other issues but &#x2013; in a nutshell I would say on a clean basis, cash flow development was pretty much okay. And then on the working capital side, I think it's important to recognize also, looking a little bit deeper, that the working capital development in the second quarter was driven, first of all, of course by some higher funds, which were tied up in inventories. And then secondly, by the situation that receivables was on a higher level, while liabilities stayed pretty much stable. So that's why, looking forward we feel pretty comfortable with this situation.</p>
          <p>And then on the working capital, specifically there, as Mr. Klingler and myself already mentioned, we have, to some extent, improved the situation as compared to the end of 2010 in terms of stocking. So, for the next months to come, we of course would be interested to build some more inventory in the one and the other market. Bottom line, it's going to be difficult because still we run production pretty much at the last point we can. So, on the working capital side, I think it's going to stay pretty much in the situation we are currently in. There might be some more additional lock-up of capital, maybe some release, nothing really substantial going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just a very quick follow-up. So the suggestion that the Passat launch in the U. S. could be delayed because of quality issues you discovered in the ramp-up of that plant, that's just wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's wrong.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's have the next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today comes from Thierry Huon of Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. This is Thierry Huon speaking from Exane. Two quick questions. First, you mentioned during your presentation that the ramp-up costs were -sorry the &#x2013; raw mat impact has been offset by the productivity gain. Could you share with us a split of the raw mat impact on the one hand and the productivity gain on the other one.</p>
          <p>And second question, about the Brazilian market, Mr. Klingler, you said that the &#x2013; the market is getting really tough because of the competition, could you elaborate with &#x2013; on that? And could you tell us if this is specific to Volkswagen or if &#x2013; because you have a lack of new products, or if it's something true for the &#x2013; for all competitors in the market. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, here you have two questions for us. The first question refers to the development of the market in Brazil and Mr. Klinger is happy to give you some more details if we see &#x2013; and what are our plans with regards to new products.</p>
          <p>And the second question is &#x2013; refers to raw materials and the impact of our raw materials in the second quarter if you can give here some more details how big was that negative impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I start with the Brazilian market if you agree &#x2013; the Brazilian market is getting more and more in the focus of manufacturers. So, historically the Brazilian market used to be more or less held by four main competitors. One clearly is Volkswagen, one is Fiat, another one is General Motors and the fourth one at a certain time was Ford. So, this had of course the situation for a long time. Now a lot of new entries with local production are preparing or have prepared already so we see Toyota coming to there with new plants. We see Hyundai and Kia coming there with a lot of products. We see the French manufacturers are taking the Brazilian market more serious. We see even Chinese manufacturers coming over.</p>
          <p>So, what &#x2013; means that the competition in general is increasing heavily. So as one of the market leaders, Volkswagen, it's always our role to defend our position. So the first answer to your question is it's not a specific Volkswagen issue, it's clearly a market which is getting much more competitive and a lot of more people are taking it serious. For this for us on one hand a good chance because we are there since more than 50 years, we know perfectly well the market. As well on the other side, a clear challenge because we do make &#x2013; the market share is higher than 20% and this is, at its own, a very big success.</p>
          <p>If you talk about the products we have launched over the last 18 months to 24 months, a bench of  new products and we will continue to do that. So, we feel on our product line pretty positive. So, the number one car in Brazil is the Gol and will continue to be the Gol. We are pretty successful with the Fox; we have launched the Amarok very successfully. So we're positive there. We have the Saveiro, which is as well on a good track and we see some momentum for Audi the brand as well. So from our side we continue to fight. But in general the market conditions are getting more complicated, more competition is coming and I would guess that that will have, over the next years to come, some impact on the market conditions itself.</p>
          <p>Please do not forget that we have lost some production in the second quarter of 2011 due to some strikes in Curitiba. And this situation will not &#x2013; of course as the strikes have ended several weeks ago, be further projected over the next two quarters to come. So &#x2013; in a nutshell, market is getting much more interest of international manufacturers. We as a market leader, we will defend our position.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>... impact on the pricing and there will be some impact of course on the competition. But we believe that we have some good arguments to continue to fight on a good level. At the end of the day, we try to make the best balance out of, of course, a very important market share, a very good product and margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Then I can continue with the question on raw materials and productivity gains. And at this point, I think I would preferably refer to the swing factor analysis, which we've seen talking about the operating result in comparison of the first half 2010 and first half 2011. And you recognize that the 0.5 billion positive swing is there for product cost.</p>
          <p>And this consists &#x2013; if we take the major elements, of a clear negative in terms of raw materials and that's clearly a three digit number of also a sizable number on the tariff side. Because starting at the 1st of March some new tariff contracts were kicking him. But that and a couple of other points, that's all overcompensated by the performance in terms of purchasing performance, productivity gains in the factories and product changes. And as you're well aware, this is an issue which we've been focusing on for many years in the meantime. And that's organized in a very professional manner. We have concluded quite a few agreements for the future already so that's why we would say more or less we should expect a similar situation for the second half of 2011 also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we can expect a similar performance in terms of product costs as we've seen in the first half, which means that it will also going forward be possible that price increases coming in -- coming through in spite of hedges, contracts and whatsoever will be overcompensated by the performance in terms of purchasing, productivity and product changes.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, it's Stefan here from Goldman Sachs. Apologies for digging into this working capital issue again, but could you just comment on the change in liabilities? It seems that whilst you were growing the business that you have paid your suppliers earlier. There's just an awkward move in the second quarter where the liabilities actually go down while -- and clearly the business in volume terms grew. Your receivables, however, moved up as you would expect them to. So was there anything specific or any supply chain issues? Did you have to pay suppliers earlier, which could explain this or what I am not getting here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Stefan, for that question again on working capital. You want to know if there are any specific issues? Did we pay suppliers earlier or where there any problems in the supply chain, so maybe we can give you here some more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, on the group level, let me just quickly say that there the receivables with regard to financial services play quite a role because it is representing the impact coming in from higher volume and I think that's very well matching to the situation of the company as dealer and customer financing is still a very attractive issue. And then on the liability side, let me say this a little bit bold, we never pay late. But you're right that we took a decision in order to motivate -- to do on the other side something a bit early, nothing of major importance but that's been the situation at the end of the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say what can be expected is a situation that this normalizes, if you get this right.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It is Michael Tyndall from Barclays. Thanks for taking my question. One very quick one, just in relation to the Porsche merger. You stated very clearly that the likelihood is 50% of it happening this year and if I am not wrong, both parties are contractually obliged to work towards it this year. I wonder if you could comment at all about next year, when the framework agreement expires, if we get a decision from the Stuttgart prosecutor at some point and it's favorable, would you be willing to put a percentage likelihood on the merger for next year? That's my question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Michael. So we have a question about the Porsche merger and if that would be possible also at a later stage even if it will not happen this year, if we can give you there some news, we can comment here and give some new details about the likelihood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let me first of all say, as I pointed out also in the little presentation, and hopefully that was understandable, we are doing everything to support the intended merger for 2011 and all the parties which -- who signed up the comprehensive agreement are obliged to do so. And obviously, there is a 50-50 situation which also is pointing towards another situation where there is a 50% chance that for 2011 a merger might not be possible. Now you're asking on whether then a merger would be postponed, there, it is to say that this kind of a scenario is not addressed in the comprehensive agreement. But of course, it's something that could be considered if the merger resolutions cannot be adopted in 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question in relation to your sales planning. Could you talk around the seasonality of your car sales across regions? Just wondering whether we're going to a more seasonal pattern or there are still some regions where we'll see a stronger second half versus the first half? And overall, do you expect to sell more cars in the second half than in the first half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jose, for that question. This question is for Mr. Klingler. He want to know our sales plan, planning and if we -- around the globe and around the countries, regions, if there is any seasonality and how our expectation for the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try to answer the question through the total market. As I mentioned in my first statement, we believe that the general market in passenger cars will increase to a maximum of 6% in this year. So in the first half of the year, it was about 6 something, 6.1, 6.2, and the second half of the year as a consequence, the growth rate could be a little bit lower. Anyhow, it will be a record market. So it's the best market ever.</p>
          <p>Is there or are there impacts regionally? There are impacts regionally. It is pretty difficult to estimate that precisely. Just giving you 2 indications, for example in Spain we've seen the market has been negative over the first 6 months on a pretty strong level. We shall see how it will -development, but we don't see it too positive one over the next months to come.</p>
          <p>We still see for another example, like for example India, a market where the growth rate in the second half of the year will be a bit lower than the first half of the year due to the government's fight of decreasing the inflation and as a consequence, increase the interest rates, which now have -- would be more than 8%. And you see markets, another example, which seems to continue to be very positive, like Russia. So, in general, we believe this market development will end up to this maximum 6%, could be a little bit below. And as always our target is to outperform the market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just one quick question left, which regarding Audi, and I think we touched on that too much right now, but the 12.9%, great margin achieved in the second quarter. Are there any headwinds as you look at that business into the second half, other than the obvious currency and raw material ones applicable to all divisions, particular for the premium car segment right now, whatever its pricing, competition, demand, mix, is there anything that really should make us think that margin should slip back significantly at all in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Stuart for that question which refers to Audi and if we see any headwind in the second half which will hurt the impressive margin Audi achieved in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all I think you already made the point, if it has to be said with the margins of previous quarters, Audi is amongst the best of direct competition. And of course the goal is to continue to deliver double-digit margins also in the future. In terms of potential risks, it is always necessary to point towards the macroeconomic environment and we all are aware of the heights of our in debt levels in a number of major countries and the volatility there. And this is of course specifically in terms of interest rates, exchange rates and raw materials creating some potential risks. That's why, I think for a good reason, Audi has set and established a long-term goal to deliver operating margins between 8% and 10%. And this doesn't say that it shouldn't be possible to generate returns at one or the other time above 10% and for 2011 clearly that's on the cards.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question today comes from Arndt Ellinghorst of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much and good afternoon. I want to come back to your P&amp;L and to the other operating income line. Because really it's been a big, big number with almost &#x20AC;1.1 billion in the Autos division. So almost 40% of your Auto EBIT and also sequentially it increased massively over the first quarter. So I guess there are three issues with this the first one is we need to understand what it is and you elaborated a little bit, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, already.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we need to understand how recurring this line is and then also if we were to adjust for some of the non-recurring or non-operational effects in that number, the underlying profitability would have been quite significantly down in the second quarter versus the first one. So I guess that's also a discussion which should be fed in there. So could you probably talk a bit more about this number, how recurring it is and whether there's been an underlying deterioration in the business in the second quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Arndt. So you are asking again about the operating income and you would like to hear some more details on the development which we have seen in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, if we look at this line item in the P&amp;L, it is important to read that there are a number of elements included which do not necessarily have to do with the release of provisions. There is substantial part included in terms of currency effects and also when we enter into commodity futures transactions, then of course any release of that and the exclusion of that would also be reflected in this line item.</p>
          <p>The other point is also clear of the buildup of provisions is always made on a certain set basis. If the set goes away, this specific provision has to be released. The other point as I already mentioned is, and I think that's important to note that at this point is that new provisions are booked within the functional areas like distribution or administration expenses and the amount of total provisions increased significantly due to the higher sales volume in the last couple of months. So that's why if one looks at the whole picture, it's clearly -- I would say normal development. But it's important to put the few line items together to interpret it in the right way. We're also asking whether this situation would be recurrent. Now, I think and it's difficult that is to predict similar to other items we should see a normalization going forward there.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thanks very much. This question was just about automotive cash flow and financial services. Could you confirm if there was a transfer from auto to financial services equity in the quarter and how much that might have been? How much more we are going to see throughout the rest of 2011? And looking further ahead, do you have any plans to put money into your pension deficits, as you think ahead over the next 12 months? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. So you're asking if we have increased the equity from financial services? If that is reflected also in the cash flow? And then you have a second question for us, if we have any plans with regard to our pension if we deficit -- if we want to put some money in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the first question, yes, we injected money from the auto division to the financial services entity. I don't have to say that it's very important of course to comply with legal requirements in the banking sector, and that's the basis for this. And of course, if the business continues to grow, it might have been to one the other time. Also in the future, the amount is &#x20AC;400 million. And then on the pension side, I think I said to one of you at a time that we checked this point on a regular basis, but so far no decision is made and I would not foresee any decision for the remainder of this year.</p>

          <p>Well, obviously the strategic cooperation licensed with Suzuki developing more slowly than expected and is not currently being implemented with the desired level of intensity. And that's why I think this is a pretty normal thing to do. Volkswagen started reviewing this partnership after the end of the reporting period and of course that's an important matter and that's why the review is still ongoing.</p>
