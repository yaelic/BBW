      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before we turn to Art for a review of our second quarter performance and latest outlook, I'd like to take a few moments to update you on our recent progress on several important operational and strategic fronts.</p>
          <p>As we continue our shift away from coal and increase our use of lower-priced natural gas, we are passing the benefits along to our customers. For example, at our largest subsidiary, Georgia Power, we recently reduced fuel rates by 19% and overall retail rates by 6%, which represents a $567 million reduction. At Gulf Power, several incremental fuel rate adjustments have cumulatively reduced fuel rates by 25% and overall rates by 10% since the end of last year.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, our energy mix will continue to shift along with fluctuations in the cost of various fuel sources, but no matter what the future holds, we will continue to seek the best combination of available sources for the benefit of our customers with the goal of keeping retail prices as low as possible. With that in mind, we remain focused on promoting a sensible national energy policy, first by preserving all available sources of generation including new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewables and energy efficiency; and second, by leading our industry in driving energy innovation, creating real solutions, not rhetoric, to meet the needs of this nation's energy future.</p>
          <p>Two excellent examples of such innovation are Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, and Plant Ratcliffe in Kemper County, Mississippi. Once online, these two projects are expected to provide value to our customers in terms of very low energy costs and relative price stability. The significance of the Ratcliffe and Vogtle projects cannot be overstated. While natural gas appears plentiful and inexpensive today, it is not a panacea and there are many reasons to be cautious about its future. These include: the need to resolve potential environmental issues related to fracing; the need to develop infrastructure including both pipelines and storage; the need to reach decisions about exporting natural gas, both quantity and timeframe, evaluating the price and volatility impact of a shifting demand curve and improving the relatively high counterparty credit risks that hinder our ability to hedge long-term gas exposure.</p>
          <p>Because over-reliance on any single fuel source is never a good idea, we must continue to preserve existing sources such as coal and nuclear even as we cultivate new ones such as renewables and energy efficiency. And as seen on this slide, even relative to a combined cycle plant burning natural gas at $3 per million Btu, the variable cost for electricity from Plants Vogtle and Ratcliffe are expected to be significantly lower with natural gas at $5 per million Btu the cost differential is even more dramatic.</p>
          <p>The relative energy cost benefits at Plant Ratcliffe are driven by the low cost of the projects abundant mine mouth lignite as well as the benefits of long-term off-take agreements for CO2 and other byproducts. For Vogtle Units 3 and 4, the value of production tax credits which are not included in this analysis, are expected to further lower the variable costs for the first eight years of commercial operation.</p>
          <p>Now please understand, we remain convinced that natural gas generation will continue to be a dominant solution in a balanced portfolio. In fact, we expect to have more natural gas capacity in our fleet than any other resource over the next decade. But clearly, the innovative new facilities we are adding should help preserve our fleet's diversity and provide relatively stable, low-cost energy to our customers for many decades.</p>
          <p>With that in mind, I'd like to update you briefly on our recent progress with both of these major construction projects. Construction continues at the Ratcliffe site as we move toward our target completion date of May 2014. Our most recently filed status report reflects an estimated cost for the project of $2.88 billion, including a $62 million contingency.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, the original certification order for Plant Ratcliffe was remanded back to the Mississippi Public Service Commission. The PSC acted quickly to enact a temporary order so that construction activity could continue while it considered the remanded order. The PSC later issued a new order with 70 additional pages of supporting detail and 300 references to the original record to protect against future challenges to the certification.</p>
          <p>In its original order in 2010, the PSC agreed to allow Mississippi Power to recover its financing costs during construction. This agreement was a key to Mississippi Power's initial decision to proceed with this project. The revised order issued in April of 2012 contained the same provision.</p>
          <p>In June 2012, the Commission decided to deny CWIP recovery pending the resolution of outstanding legal challenges to the certification. Mississippi Power has asked the Mississippi Supreme Court, consistent with the stipulation reach with the PSC staff earlier this year, to allow it to begin recovering these costs, subject to refund, until such time as the Court makes a final ruling, denying these rates will increase costs for Mississippi Power's customers over the long-term and we are therefore hopeful for a timely resolution of this matter.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, our current analysis indicate that the overall cost to customers for Plant Ratcliffe will be less than projected in the original certification due primarily to the lower cost of debt financing and the proceeds for the byproduct sales mentioned earlier. In the end, our intent is to provide customers in Mississippi with the benefit of a cost effective, cutting-edge technology that exceeds even the EPA's proposed new source CO2 standards.</p>
          <p>Construction is also proceeding on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 with approximately one-third of the project now complete. This project is expected to provide tremendous benefit to the state of Georgia over the next several decades, contributing to job creation and increased tax base and fuel diversity. Our next regulatory milestone for this project will be the decision by the Georgia Public Service Commission on the costs included in our sixth construction monitoring report which was filed earlier this year. This decision is scheduled for August 21st.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that the Commission's independent monitor has stated repeatedly that Georgia Power continues to manage the project well. He has also recommended that the Commission approve all costs incurred during this reporting period. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its seventh construction monitoring report on August 31st. Tremendous progress can be seen at the plant site and at supply chain facilities located around the world where some of the major components are being manufactured, all of which are on schedule.</p>
          <p>Testing on the heavy lift derrick commenced last week and significant foundation work has been completed on the turbine island, cooling towers and nuclear islands. As we look ahead to the next several months, major progress is expected to be made in the nuclear island, turbine building and module assemblies. Perhaps the most exciting progress will be the arrival of major components to the site later this year and early next year, the first of which is the reactor vessel for Unit 3.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we are continuing discussions with our contractors over the current project schedule and costs and will continue to make decisions that are in the best interest of our customers. Any adjustment in cost or schedule is dependent in part on the outcome of these negotiations and must be approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission during the semi-annual review process. We are keeping the Georgia PSC updated as these negotiations continue.</p>
          <p>We are also reviewing the loan guarantee terms and conditions including the new issues raised by the United States Department of Energy since the Solyndra default. Recall, the nuclear loan guarantee program was put into place to incentivize utility companies to pursue new nuclear construction for the first time in decades. However, if we determine that the final terms and conditions for the DOE loan guarantee will not add value for our customers, we will finance the project through more traditional means. Even without these loan guarantees, we believe that we can still deliver up to the $2 billion in potential benefit to Georgia Power's customers from this project.</p>
          <p>In addition to the work being done at Plants Ratcliffe and Vogtle, we are continuing to place new units into service that reflect our commitment to innovative and diverse energy resources. In April this year, Georgia Power placed a second combined cycle gas unit into service at Georgia Power's Plant McDonough-Atkinson. This 840-megawatt facility is one of the most efficient gas plants in our portfolio and will benefit customers with lower fuel costs. The final unit of Plant McDonough-Atkinson, another 840-megawatt combined cycle gas unit is scheduled to be placed into service during the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Southern Power's new 100-megawatt biomass facility near Nacogdoches, Texas, began commercial operation in June of this year ahead of our schedule and under budget. The Nacogdoches project is the largest biomass plant in the United States, utilizing the world's largest bubbling fluidized boiler and will provide energy under a 20-year contract to the City of Austin, Texas. Southern Power is further expanding its renewable portfolio by announcing a new project with its partner Turner Renewable Energy for a 20-megawatt solar photovoltaic plant in Nevada.</p>
          <p>The Apex Solar Project began operation this week and is supported by a 25-year purchase power agreement with Nevada Power Company. This is Southern Power's second joint venture with Turner, the first being the Cimarron Solar Facility in New Mexico.</p>
          <p>We are increasing our use of other renewable resources as well. Alabama Power recently procured 200-megawatts of wind energy from Oklahoma and also filed an application with its Public Service Commission for another 202 megawatts of wind capacity from Kansas. We anticipate a hearing on the Kansas agreement in August and are hopeful for a positive ruling sometime this fall.</p>
          <p>In a few minutes, Art's going to share our current projections for environmental compliance capital. As a reminder, there were several changes made to the EPA final Mercury Air Toxics, or MATS rule, that provide for more flexibility than the originally proposed rule. Our public <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:16) on the proposed rule were part of an effort to protect our customers from the significant and unnecessary cost of this rule and its burden on an already fragile economy.</p>
          <p>Although these efforts have resulted in a lower expected cost for MATS compliance, this is still a very expensive rule that will be difficult to comply with on a continuous basis. Utility MATS is part of a combination of well-intentioned but overreaching rules and regulations that will eliminate a significant portion of America's current coal generation fleet and effectively prohibit new coal plants from being built. EPA, which is responsible to no electorate, is essentially creating American energy policy, which is the job of Congress. We will continue to be engaged at a national level on these matters.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to turn it over to Art for a review of our second quarter performance and a few other economic and financial updates.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. In the second quarter of 2012 we reported earnings of $0.71 a share, equal to our earnings of $0.71 a share in the second quarter of 2011. We recorded a $21 million net benefit during the second quarter of 2012 for an insurance recovery associated with the 2009 settlement that arose out of the 2003 bankruptcy of Mirant. This insurance recovery resulted in earnings of $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2012. Excluding this item, earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $0.69 per share compared with $0.71 per share for the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of $0.02 per share. Our year-to-date as-reported earnings for the first six months of 2012 were $1.14 per share compared with $1.20 per share for the same period in 2011. Excluding the insurance recovery item, year-to-date 2012 earnings were $1.12 per share compared with $1.20 per share for the same period in 2011, a decrease of $0.08 per share.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our numbers for the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. These drivers will exclude the insurance recovery item mentioned earlier. First, the negative factors, weather effects reduced our earnings by $0.06 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Warmer than normal temperatures contributed $0.01 in the second quarter of 2012 compared with a $0.07 impact in the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Increases in non-fuel O&amp;M expenses for our traditional operating companies reduced earnings by $0.02 a share in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Increased depreciation and amortization representative of our growing rate base reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. An increase in interest expense reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.02 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Now the positive factors, retail revenue effects in our traditional business added $0.05 a share to our earnings for the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. Usage and economic growth increased earnings by $0.02 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011. A reduction in income tax expense increased earnings $0.02 a share during the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011. Finally, parent and other added $0.01 a share to the earnings during the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we had $0.12 of negative items compared with $0.10 of positive items, or a negative change of $0.02 a share, excluding the insurance recovery item.</p>
          <p>Moving now to a discussion of our second quarter sales and our economic outlook. On a weather-normalized basis, our residential sales grew 2.1% during the second quarter of 2012. This reflects the nearly 20,000 new residential customers we have added across our system since the end of 2011. Improving economic conditions and migration into the Southeast are translating into positive signs for the housing market, with surveys of regional brokers and builders by the Atlanta Federal Reserve indicating increased buyer traffic, increased sales, and declining inventories.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Atlanta was recently ranked as the fifth most popular moving destination in the United States by the American Moving &amp; Storage Association. As expected, residential growth was a leading indicator for commercial energy sales, which had a modest weather-normalized growth of 1.2% for the second quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Our industrial sales for the second quarter of 2012 were essentially flat compared to 2011. These results reflect a broad range of drivers that vary from slowing global demand to increases in self-generation to increased production. Sales to our largest industrial segment, chemicals, were flat in the second quarter of 2012 due to slowing global demand. Our second largest segment, paper, continued to grow, while its electricity demand declined as a result of an increase in self-generation. Finally, a number of industrial segments increased their usage as their production expanded. These include; pipelines, up 12%; auto production, up 9%; lumber, up 7%; and fabricated metals, up 6%.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, our region's economic development activity for 2012 is well ahead of its 2011 pace. Some 7,200 jobs were announced in the second quarter alone, a 134% increase over the same period a year ago, and our project pipeline remains robust across a variety of industries.</p>
          <p>In just the past few months, Airbus announced it will build passenger jets in Mobile, Alabama, beginning in 2015, adding up to 1,000 direct and nearly 3,000 indirect jobs. This project is transformational and could be as significant to Alabama in the aerospace industry as Mercedes-Benz has been in the auto industry. State Farm Insurance, meanwhile, will bring 500 new jobs to Atlanta later this year as it consolidates a customer service center.</p>
          <p>We are also very encouraged by last week's announcement that the Obama administration will support the fast tracking of the proposed port deepening project in Savannah. This project, which is in concert with the expansion of the Panama Canal, will enable larger cargo vessels to enter the Savannah port and is expected to spur greater economic growth for our region.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we reconvened our economic roundtable group, which consists of selected economists and representatives of several large commercial and industrial customers in our territories. Overall, the consensus from the roundtable was for U.S. gross domestic product to expand by about 2% in 2012. The group generally agreed that the global economy is slowing and that this is slowing the expansion of industrial production. Low natural gas prices are offsetting this trend and we continue to see signs of on-shoring activity due to a shrinking cost advantage for Far East markets when compared to the U.S. The group has seen indications of improvements in the housing sector, but believes that continued recovery will remain slow. Finally, the group expressed confidence in the ability of the Southeast to grow faster than the U.S. as the economy improves, due to faster population growth, a strong industrial base, and a continuing trend of foreign investment into the region.</p>
          <p>Before I discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and estimate for the third quarter, I would like to provide an update to our environmental compliance capital forecast along with our revised financing plan. As Tom indicated earlier, the final utility MATS rule provides more compliance flexibility than the original proposal. While we still have a few decisions to make on certain coal units, we have completed most of our analysis and have revised our three-year compliance capital forecast to reflect our updated expectations. This forecast is subject to change if the current challenges to the rule result in revisions to the standards.</p>
          <p>As you'll recall, we previously provided a MATS compliance capital projection of up to $2.7 billion for the 2012 through 2014 timeframe. We also indicated that this amount could be reduced by $500 million to $1 billion depending primarily on the number of baghouses in our final compliance strategy, bringing the final number to between $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion. Based on our current analysis, our projection for MATS compliance for 2012 through 2014 now totals $1.8 billion, representing a reduction of $900 million from our previous estimate.</p>
          <p>While the number of baghouses has been reduced to 4 or 5 from a high of as many as 17, other costs have been added to our plan to reflect the need for additive injection systems and related plant modifications. As before, this plan also includes significant investment in transmission projects as well as fuel switching to natural gas.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as part of our review, we have revised our other compliance capital needs to include current estimates for coal combustion residuals, effluent guidelines and 316(b) requirements. While this portion of our forecast includes a reduction of approximately $1 billion over the three-year period, this primarily reflects a change in the timing for coal ash compliance spending. We expect to spend this money eventually, but that money might now occur outside the 2012 through 2014 timeframe.</p>
          <p>Our strategy now calls for approximately 13,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation to be preserved for the long term. Of the remaining 7,000 megawatts, about 4,000 megawatts remain potential candidates for retirement. Most of the remaining units will utilize alternative fuels, primarily natural gas, to provide needed capacity.</p>
          <p>As a result of this CapEx update, we have updated our debt and equity financing plans. This slide shows our 2012 year-to-date financing activity as well as our current forecast for the remainder of 2012 through 2014. Based on revised CapEx projections, our updated financing forecast no longer reflects the need to issue equity in 2012 or 2013. As a result, we plan to use the proceeds from stock option exercises for 2012 and 2013 to buy-back the incremental shares issued. This will keep net proceeds from equity at zero for the two-year period.</p>
          <p>We continue to have success in the debt markets. Thus far this year, we have issued $2.5 billion of long-term securities with an average yield of 3.68% and an average maturity of 23 years. Our equity ratio target of approximately 44% is unchanged. By 2014, we see the need for approximately $700 million of new equity as our environmental spending ramps up. We currently anticipate the ability to fulfill this equity need through our existing dividend reinvestments and employee plans.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to share our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2012. Our earnings estimate for the third quarter of 2012 is $1.12 per share and our guidance range for the full year remains $2.58 to $2.70 per share.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to hand it back over to Tom for his closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Art. In closing, I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our many employees who responded recently when devastating storms struck our neighbors in Florida and also in the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic region. Even though our own service territories experienced damage from these same storms, we managed to dispatch nearly 1,800 workers to assist 10 utilities in the most severely affected areas.</p>
          <p>It's always awe-inspiring to witness the pride and dedication exhibited by these crews whether they're working in their own backyard or in some other part of the country. That pride and dedication is the backbone of our business and expresses itself in the value we provide to customers year in and year out.</p>
          <p>At this point, we're ready to take questions. So, operator, we'll now take the first question.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. First off, I guess in Mississippi with Ratcliffe, can you just walk us through kind of expectations of when you could get a court decision and if it goes your way and the Commission feels like it's all clear, how the resolution would go to get <mark type="ph" /> equipment (30:21) put back in place for cash recovery on financing costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, it's not clear. There is a procedure within the state such that if the Supreme Court does not rule by 30 days, we get half of the rates under bond put into effect. And if they don't rule by 180 days, we get the full asking put into effect. But as to when the Supreme Court will rule, it's just not clear. We hope it is quick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the environmental CapEx changes, I guess baghouses account for a piece of it but for the other compliance issues, is this just kind of a delay on 316(b) and that sort of stuff is just pushing out the CapEx? Do you think that those underlying capital expenditure numbers are still the right cost base for what you know today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly &#x2013; you got it exactly. We think this is just movement in time rather than a change of magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with the comment on maybe firing some of these coal plants with gas, can you just walk through how that works, the ability of the plants to run that way and do they functionally just serve as like a peaking asset for super peak moments, or are these assets going to run more regularly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you got it. Essentially, you change the fuel feed system, so you're going to change a coal feed into a gas feed, burner tips obviously change. So the production modifications are not that significant. So capital costs associated with changing is not that big. You are, however, going to be using gas in a relatively inefficient manner, but recall we're doing this in order to accommodate EPA's own kind of onerous schedule requirements. We think that in general, the heat rates of these units will be in the 10,000 to 11,000 range and will serve essentially as heat &#x2013; I mean, as peaking capacity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Tom, do those serve as a permanent solution or is this an interim kind of fix to make sure you maintain reliability with the need to replace those with the CCGT or some sort of baseload source later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, over time, we'll transition these units out, so it's hard to say when that will occur. When you look at our expansion plan on generation right now with Vogtle 3 and 4, with Kemper County, with bringing the Miller units, recall, we did that last year back from wholesale into retail in Alabama, with the McDonough units at Georgia, and then I guess some another third-party capacity purchases that George PSC has undertaken this year, I guess that's about 1,000-megawatts. When you add all of those together, that really speaks pretty well to our capacity needs, including these MATS transition issues through 2020. So you're really asking a question post-2020. We'll see.</p>

          <p>Hey, Tom. Good morning or good afternoon. Just a clarification on the Mississippi filing, so what legal provision allows you to implement the rates if you don't hear from them? Is that under some kind of provision of the Mississippi just general law, or specific to this project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a state statute. It's state statute number <mark type="ph" /> 77372 (34:02). And the other thing that I just want to make sure everybody understands, when all this happened two of the commissioners there, Leonard Bentz and Lynn Posey came out with their own press releases. And let me just quote these guys. Bentz said, "It is imperative to understand that I believe the IGCC Plant is the best option for the customers of Mississippi Power." He goes on to say some other things and then Posey says "I am still in support of the Kemper County Plant, and believe CWIP will ultimately save the ratepayer millions of dollars." The issue really arose with their reluctance to put CWIP in place while the other challenges in the state Supreme Court continued.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we don't know when the other challenges will be ruled on, that could be whatever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right. We don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Okay. And then just I'm curious on the coal to gas switching, thanks for the data you gave for the first half of the year. Did it change much even just first quarter to second quarter, though? Or has it been pretty consistent this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look in the appendix, we have some stuff in there &#x2013; in the appendix...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...we show how it is changing. And I would argue that as time goes by &#x2013; it's fascinating. So for the first half we're at 45% gas and 38% coal. Recall, we projected for the year a 47%/35% relationship. So for the year-to-date 2012, we're pretty well there. Now what's interesting is, during the third quarter, you should expect the ratio to flip back a little bit more centric on coal. That's because we're selling a lot of kilowatt hours and I was just looking at late-breaking data, we may set a new peak today. We're going to come very close for a yearly peak today.</p>
          <p>So these are things that we're keeping our eye on and as total demand increases, as a percentage, just because the capacity is there, we'll burn a little more coal. But we'll keep our eye on it. We still feel confident with the 47%/35% relationship with gas to coal for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one clarification on Vogtle 3 and 4, it sounds like the resolution of the $400 million of claims will also be, whenever that happens, is also a likely timeframe to update any &#x2013; to do any overall cost updates as well as timeline updates for the project. Is that a fair way to look at it? Or could they've all come at different times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would argue that is the dominant theme of any change. Recall that commercial issue really arose with the delay originally of the DCD which was 11 months long and then ultimately the delay of the COL as a result which was, I forget, seven months long. And so their claim centers on that circumstance. And recall also that the construction period uses as a trigger point the DCD and the COL, so that starts the clock on the contract. So that really is the commercial issue on discussion, who's responsible for the DCD delay and also therefore, the COL delay.</p>
          <p>So my sense is, Steve, there really hasn't been anything material since then. We talked about rebar last time and just to remind everybody, we did that intentionally to say that we will always have issues and we shouldn't measure success or failure based on the presence of issues and challenges, rather, how well we find success paths to solve those challenges. Well, in fact, I think we've got one on rebar and we don't believe that the rebar issue will be at all any kind of material effect on cost or schedule. We'll file a license amendment request and we'll get that done expeditiously. So it's just one of those issues where we're going to work through it and continue to derive constructive results. So I would say now going back to your original question, it probably will coincide with the resolution of the commercial claim with us and the consortium.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey. It's me. I didn't dial-in but I'll ask you a question anyway. The question I have is on a totally different topic. Can you talk a little bit about some of the industrial co-gen that might be going on in the system and if it really means a longer- term trend that we're going to see, given the natural gas deck?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jim, this is Art. Obviously, in the paper segment you're going to see more of that than anywhere else. They're beginning to use a little more natural gas in that self-generation. It's an economic decision for them. In terms of size of that, I don't have any &#x2013; I can get back to you with some of that, but I don't have any data at hand to talk about megawatts and how many are being impacted. But that's a normal operation that we would expect with companies like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So in terms of like industrial growth going forward, we shouldn't expect to see a material change? Is that what you're saying, at the end of the day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I wouldn't think so. Look, I think our industrial growth is still pretty robust. Everything's &#x2013; we do this math. If you adjusted for &#x2013; if you adjusted for co-generation and kind of the major plants that we knew were on sort of maintenance outages &#x2013; in fact, we've gotten some intelligence that one of the maintenance outages is going to result in greater consumption once they come out, they're actually expanding. We think industrial sales quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, would have been a little less than 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>1%, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Switching to just usage and everything else, what are you seeing in terms of residential usage with some of the pickup in customers? It looks like it was up in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, so if you look at weather normal residential sales, you were 2.1%. And if we had to break that out between increasing customers and then usage, you would get to a usage increase of about 1.6%. But you've got to be careful in how you view that, because we've been adding new customers, and especially it seems like we're gaining momentum there a little bit, when you think about usage, let's think about a couple of things.</p>
          <p>One, unemployment is coming down, jobs are showing up, and as a result of people getting more jobs, personal incomes rise and so you see a normal cause and effect relationship with usage. More money begets more consumption. Another issue that is important really goes to when the new customers arise and how we keep score here. Whenever you look inside a quarter, you've always got to be careful as to the longer-term implication to the annual trend or the sustaining trend. Say, for example, we get a new customer in March, so they come at the very end of the first quarter, it will show up as a new customer, but very little increase in usage because they've just joined us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the second quarter, you won't see the new customer, you will see the new usage, and therefore there's probably an effect tied up in that 1.5% or 1.6% increase in usage that really is kind of the catch up effect as we add new customers. So look, there's a variety of effects here. We're gratified with the trend. We think the increase in customers is something that will provide sustainable benefits down the road to our growth projections. And even as Art mentioned with his economic roundtable, if they expect 2%, and that's interesting in terms of GDP growth for the Southeast, we're still staying with our about 1.3% electricity sales growth for the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. Tom, I just &#x2013; I think you've probably answered half of my question on customers and usage, but you also made a comment that you felt you were picking up momentum, and you have these 20,000 customers in the first half. But weren't you at 15,000 in the first quarter? And so that would sort of suggest that, yes, the sales showed up in Q2 rather than Q1, but that the pace of additions dropped off pretty sharp in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The momentum I was referring to was the positive income impact, and recall also that sometimes the addition and subtraction, the ebb and flow of customers is seasonal. So we think there's still reason to believe that we have good growth ahead of us here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is that normal seasonality? You'd see more adds in Q1 than Q2, if you look back to when you were adding, I guess, in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but we still believe there's some ahead of us as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then could I just follow up also on the rebar issue. I remember before you were kind of talking about the fact not having to make a license amendment request was kind of the right path forward. But now you are going to have to do that, or it sounds like you're going to have to do that, but you still think it can be done expeditiously. Can you talk a bit more about why that won't impact the schedule, how long you think it's going to take, and what you can do in the meantime &#x2013; can you keep working in the meantime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How we sort of get into the details of that statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in fact we'd be glad to provide you information. I remember at our recent Vogtle executive oversight meeting, Buzz Miller showed essentially a schematic of work that continues in the nuclear island even despite the fact that we're working on the rebar.</p>
          <p>Now let's go through the blow by blow a little bit as to what happened there. So in an inspection we found that the configuration of the rebar along a particular wall was not per the DCD. We stopped work. We tried to figure out, along with the NRC, what the right path was. Recall too, this is a new procedure that we're following with. In the old days, you built a plant and then you had the NRC basically certify it. Now we have a design certified and we've got to build to the design. So this is a little bit of a new process for everybody to come along with.</p>
          <p>We thought that we had, that really Westinghouse/Shaw had a design that was not going to require a license amendment. We're the licensee here, and one of the things we did was to send a letter to the NRC to basically seek clarity. You know that we have a conservative bent towards these things. Probably didn't need to do it, but we sought their oversight here to make sure that the changes that were being proposed met the NRC requirements.</p>
          <p>And so, what we got back from the NRC was actually helpful. That is, that the NRC responded, in fact, we probably should pursue a LAR or a PAR, a license amendment request, preliminary amendment request. So we know now that we're building to the license and the path forward is as we suggested. My sense is that with all the other work going on, this rebar issue is not critical path. And we do not believe this inures to our cost responsibility in completing the plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of any sense of how long it might take to &#x2013; how long is that the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm a little reluctant to do that, but what's in my mind is a number of weeks, like three weeks, something like that, but that's all dependent upon how you get the license amendment request turned around. We hopefully will complete all the rebar by the fall of 2012, but the weeks I'm talking about is the amendment request from the NRC. We think that will be turned around expeditiously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

So net of this $1.945 billion reduction, is it fair to say when we &#x2013; because I'm not in front of all the data &#x2013; that this takes your budget down to the $16.3 billion, is closer to the midpoint of what you had laid out when you gave that big analyst presentation a year or two ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, at least in terms of what we said before with respect to MATS, we said $2.7 billion and then as we got the new rule, not the proposed rule, we said it could be between $0.5 billion to $1 billion less, and therefore we said $1.7 billion to $2.2 billion. Well, sure enough it ended up $1.8 billion. When you think about the total amount of CapEx, it was $18.2 billion or $18.3 billion, and now we kind of think it's going to be $16.4 billion, $16.3 billion...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple of quick questions, I know you've already given some good detail on these, but when you're looking at the 20K number for customers for the year, just a little granularity if possible on new connections and new build versus maybe some reconnections and kind of what's driving that in the mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've done a little more research on that and it appears that we've got a good mix of maybe some homes that have been foreclosed that had meters removed from the premises that have now been reinstalled and sold. The inventory of unsold homes is down in Atlanta and that's a reflection, we think, of that fact. That is also supported by the fact that most of the 20,000 customers, 60% of them are in Georgia, about 25% in Alabama and the remainder would be in Gulf and Mississippi. So it's not just one state. It's across the system that we're seeing this increase in customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little more color too, one of the effects you have to consider are the tornadoes that impacted Alabama. And we think that people stayed in the region. So what you see is this interesting migration of people that may have been living with relatives or in temporary residences now moving either into multi-family homes or moving into primary residence-looking homes. And another just data point that underlines what Art just told you, unsold housing inventory now is about 2.8% relative to kind of a normal level of about 2.3%. You may recall during the depth of the recession we were in the 4s. So we're making really good progress on eating up that excess inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I guess one other element of that is we saw some multi-family additions as well. So it's not just new homes, it's some new apartments. And we're just surmising that folks that were doubling up before are now creating new households and that's begun to take shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in fact, I've got to give credit to the Fed here. You know I've joined the Board of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. The multi-family housing sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in housing in the Southeast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for that. And quickly on kind of the roundtable discussions that you've had and obviously some really positive news there, I guess just going forward, from a big picture, how do you view like a strengthening dollar, the prospect for a strengthening dollar on the region's export economy, mixed bag between final assembly and maybe a more domestic supply chain. How do you see that developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. But it's not one that we discussed at the meeting. It didn't come up amongst the economists or the chemical folks, who would probably be exporting a lot of their goods with this low natural gas price. They were more concerned with global demand and where that was going, especially in China and South America were more of their concerns. But obviously, the dollar is a factor that they'll have to keep up with. And about 25% of the goods in the Southeast, we think, are going toward the value of that is going to exports. So it will impact the Southeast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's fascinating stuff. I mean the value of our exporting has gone up 8% year-over-year. So that continues to be an interesting area. But I would say most of these businesses are adjusting also because they will also talk about their fear of the continued malaise in Europe. And even though China has a 7% GDP growth, it's reduced from what everybody thought it was going to be. My sense is, businesses in the Southeast are adjusting on the fly. We still benefit from the fact that even with potentially a stronger dollar, but recall we have our own challenges. We've got our own cliff at the end of the year. We have our own fiscal challenges. It is not clear that we are inevitably heading towards a stronger dollar. Perhaps we will against the euro, unclear about other worldwide currencies. My sense is people are watching this like they never have before and they're responding accordingly. At least we can say in the Southeast as we have in the past that we have the prospects for a more robust economy given a business-friendly climate, willing and able workforce, etcetera. So we'll see.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions. One, Tom, going into the quarter, you guys had guided us to a $0.65 number for the quarter. Weather obviously came out relatively normal. So what was the real driver in your mind that caused you to do $0.04 better than what you guys thought going in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ali, if you look at the revenue effects in three of the four operating companies, those certainly offset the weather that we had compared to last year. Non-fuel O&amp;M was a piece of that as well as we were able to, even on a year-over-year basis, O&amp;M were up, but on our expected basis we reduced a good bit of that. I think on a year-to-date basis, we're some $100 million below our original expectation there. So we've done quite a lot to drive those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I always like to &#x2013; as Art and I obsessively compare for this call and everything else, we always like to look for interesting relationships of data. And one of the things that we were just looking at, and it kind of is true for the quarter, is true for the year-to-date, it looks like 2011 year-to-date and for the quarter had much more favorable weather from an earnings standpoint than did 2012. And it completely masks the increase so far we've seen from customers, usage and revenue increases that we've seen through regulatory processes.</p>
          <p>So if you just look at it, year-to-date we've increased on a cents per share basis $0.13 out of customers, usage and other revenues. Weather was negative $0.14. My sense is as we go through the rest of the year, if weather is nearly the same as last year, you'll start to see the power of the earnings capability through the regulatory mechanisms and improvement in customers and usage come to bear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, my second question, one of the interesting anecdotes that came out on the ongoing Duke hearings out of North Carolina was the Southern progress discussions that apparently had gone pretty far along before not getting completed. Just curious if you remind us what your thinking is on the M&amp;A side and what works, didn't work? Or, I mean, how are you looking at consolidation in the industry today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I always laugh about this because we're just remarkably consistent here and you guys could probably give the same speech I'm going to give but I'm going to give it anyway. Our view is, it is part of our fiduciary responsibility to always seek ways to accrete the shareholder value. We think about M&amp;A as a how, not a what. The what would be that we like our integrated regulated business model Even in the competitive generation business, we structure it with long-term bilateral contracts of creditworthy counterparties not taking fuel risk in order to essentially replicate the model that we like that avails our customers, our shareholders with essentially &#x2013; our customers with reliable electricity and low prices with the best service possible, and our shareholders with reasonable returns with the lowest risk profile as possible.</p>
          <p>That serves us we think awfully well. During Franklin's tenure, even when I was Head of Strategy, we coined the phrase: the business we know, with the place we know, with the customers we know. We really do like and believe in our model and think it serves our customers and shareholders exceedingly well. Now we always do look to seek ways to improve it and that is an ongoing responsibility of management and we continue to do that. But I would just remind everybody, when you look at our track record over almost any timeframe, our standalone proposition is awfully strong. So we're always looking for ways to improve upon an already strong value proposition.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So fair to say price was one of the key issues, at least in that specific discussion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously having given you the generality, we don't comment on any specific situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Last question, if I could. Art, perhaps to you, given the reduced CapEx numbers that you're talking about now, what kind of rate base annual growth should we be thinking about for Southern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ali, I believe the number that we're looking at is going to run 6% to 7%. Remember, that's adjusted in the short run. Those projects wouldn't come online until 2014, 2015. So and recall that rate base growth is lumpy. So you're going to see it occur in spurts rather than evenly over time.</p>

          <p>Two questions for you, Vogtle and Ratcliffe related. I'm &#x2013; going back to that slide you talked about, Tom, where you showed the variable cost on a per megawatt hour per basis. Do you mind giving that same information, but all-in? So including both variable and fixed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say that again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just I'm trying to think about the total &#x2013; but customers have to pay for the return on and return of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not just a variable cost economic analysis. What would be the all-in dollar per megawatt hour or cents per kWh numbers for Ratcliffe and for Vogtle relative to like a new combined cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that in front of me. You guys may be able to deliver it, but it's &#x2013; the numbers I have in my head would be on a dollar per kW basis. You're going to look at a new plant like 4,500. Kemper was like 4,200, but I think that's at a $14 billion number for the nuc and a $2.4 billion number. So it's going to be slightly higher than that. We went through this math last night.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Happy to follow up on that offline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that is kind of the number that &#x2013; what I've always said is, it's fascinating about Kemper, it's a coal plant, it has an environmental profile better than natural gas and it has an economic profile roughly equivalent to a nuclear plant and I think that's what that slide shows you. That's how it will dispatch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You also, in one of the slides on Vogtle, you referenced some comments from the independent monitor. But if I go back and look at Bill Jacobs' testimony filed in late May, he makes some interesting comments about his concern that there's not &#x2013; I think he calls it an integrated project schedule that's been published lately or has been disclosed in the public domain lately. He references a number of potential change orders above and beyond the rebar issue that could impact the timeline, these items are redacted in pages 16 and 17 of that testimony. Just kind of curious, at what stage do you have to go back to the Commission and say, hey look here's what the new schedule is, here's where we'll take it forward? Or is that really not mandated on you by the Commission until you actually get everything resolved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Michael, the way I think about our relationship with the independent monitor and the staff and even the Commission, it is continuous and not discrete. We have an exceedingly transparent process as we go through this effort together. So that's point one. Point two really goes back to Fleishman's question and when you think about kind of the major factors that could impact cost and schedule, I guess we have arise all of the time kind of commercial issues that we deal with and have settled and continue to deal with. It's just this one, this $800 million claim by the consortium against all of the owners, that has kind of gotten the most interest by people. And obviously, we've already disclosed that we dispute the claim and all that. But I would argue that as we settle the commercial difference that we have with the consortium, if there is a change in the cost or schedule it would likely be in association with that settlement.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the base is our current range of guidance for this year of $2.58 to $2.70, grow the top end of that by $0.07, grow the bottom end of that by $0.04. And that, over the next three years, would describe the growth in earnings range that we see as possible within the model. Now, with the change in CapEx, remember that, that would probably only affect some AFUDC during the three-year timeframe. So we still see it as possible with a strong economy, with supportive weather, and with Southern Power having the opportunity to do more as well, we still see that range as being reflective of possibilities for earnings growth.</p>

          <p>If I can just add to that, the change in CapEx through this three-year period, you almost can't see the difference. Over time, you start to see more, but in the near-term, <mark type="ph" /> the lines (65:41) don't hardly matter. And remember, we're not going to be issuing &#x2013; we'll be issuing less equity as we have less CapEx, so that kind of offsets some of the effects.</p>

          <p>Okay, excellent. Just on the Kemper County issue, the MPSC they then filed, is it a brief asking the Supreme Court to rule faster? Or what was, I guess, their last filing in that case?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Public Service Commission basically argued against the base &#x2013; I mean, the rates under bond, just to reject the interim issue. All they're doing &#x2013; and it was very brief, it wasn't any kind of associated testimony or underlying facts or whatever, it was really just kind of restating the conclusion that they reached when they decided to defer the inclusion of CWIP rates until the state Supreme Court issue related to certification was settled. It was just that they didn't feel like they should put in CWIP until the issue at the Supreme Court was resolved.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Does that create any, I guess if you guys continue along the path and say the Supreme Court doesn't rule for, call it, 220 days or something, and you guys are already collecting, does that create any issues for the MPSC? I mean, they're supportive of the plant anyway, but why would they &#x2013; I guess, why would they oppose the automatic collection?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't speak as to what was in their minds. We were surprised by this vote, because if you think about it, when the plant was originally certified in the new order it all contemplated having CWIP. The legislation that was passed in Mississippi contemplated CWIP. We think CWIP is warranted for a project of this magnitude.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to follow up on that last question by John and your answer there. I mean, do you think that they're concerned about what the ultimate decision will be in the Supreme Court or &#x2013; because, like you said, it was a little bit of a surprise and it would suggest, I don't know, again, me without &#x2013; not knowing all the legal intricacies, that maybe there's some issue there or is there? Can you elaborate a little bit on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this is my opinion. I don't believe there's an issue there at all. I think when you look back at the testimony, when we decided to go forward with this plant, a lot of what Mississippi was concerned with was fuel diversity. If they had not built this plant, they would've been relying much more on natural gas. And we all know that, that is a higher beta energy policy, if you will.</p>
          <p>We've already seen some volatility in natural gas prices, even though they're historically low, they're now creeping to above $3 per million Btu and it's interesting that since I've been out there, in the weekend interview in The Wall Street Journal and some of the other speeches I've been giving lately, I think more and more people are realizing that while it's a wonderful circumstance we find ourselves in to have cheap natural gas, it's not hard to come up with data, I would argue that, and if you want me to I'll go through this, but I'll save it if you don't, it's not hard to say that you could go from an average daily consumption of natural gas in the United States from, say, a 67 Bcf per day to something well over 100 Bcf. It's not a far putt to get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And I think &#x2013; and I don't want you to get into a lot of detail. I hear what you're saying, I just &#x2013; it's just a little bit of a surprise, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was a surprise to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then just finally the DOE loan guarantees, I mean, what is the hang-up there? And I know you guys feel that you can finance it either way and it seems like it's going on a long time now. And I just was wondering if there's any &#x2013; can you give us just a feeling as to what the specific issue is? And would it make an impact, I guess, with the financing numbers that you guys have, I assume, I guess you don't have the loan guarantees in there, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So any deal you'd come up with would be even a lower deal for customers, I would assume. So could you just sort of give us a little bit of a flavor for what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul. This is Art. As Tom kind of explained in the script, ever since Solyndra occurred, the DOE has gotten much more deliberate in its negotiations around terms and conditions of these loans. The conditional agreement that we had with them was around a corporate finance perspective and where they are going is more towards a project finance oriented terms and conditions. And some of the requirements that they have outlined for us are things that may increase cost to customers. And we're simply saying that at the bottom line for us here will be value to customers. We're not going to do anything to jeopardize the value of those elements that we represent. So that's kind of the bottom line that we'll use to measure as to whether or not we pursue these to final resolution or whether we bypass them and just go to the credit markets for the capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add my own color here, too. When Art says deliberate, I would add it's not just deliberate in terms of slow and pedantic in style, it is new. And that really goes to these notions of project finance on a corporate finance deal, that doesn't make sense and unnecessarily burdens our financial integrity and financial flexibility. We are making good progress. We are working through and we're very hopeful that we can get all this done. But time will tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the tax, the income tax, I notice that that's been going well for the last couple of quarters here. Is there anything in particular that's causing that to be &#x2013; is that kind of unusual? Or do you think that that's pretty much the run rate we should be expecting about the 34%, I guess, rate. And just the $0.01 at parent other than the non-mark benefit at parent, I guess is what I'm talking about. What was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Paul. Your question on taxes was around the $0.02 in the second quarter, was that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The $0.02 in the second quarter, right, and just &#x2013; it looks like it's been good for the last couple quarters. So is that just sort of the run rate we're thinking about here or were there any sort of special settlement gigs or something <mark type="indiscernible" /> (73:04)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were some ongoing normal routine kind of adjustments to some reserves, but these are normal recurring kind of things, sometimes they move positive, sometimes they move negative. Our effective tax rate was 34%, so it's pretty stable as well in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the parent benefit, that $0.01?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That was lower financing cost at the parent year-over-year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I definitely am, thank you. Just a quick question and I guess you kind of touched on it as far as your long-term growth rate in the 5% to 7% range, but I guess kind of just playing with some numbers since a change in some of the CapEx numbers and then obviously just understand on the common stock, so you're not going to issue any next year, right? And in fact I guess you'll be buying back stock for your various plants, right, in the open market? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So we'll basically have flat shares next year. And I guess this <mark type="ph" /> 872 (74:32) number you had on the second quarter that will probably be pretty close to what you have for the year this year. And then I guess you start issuing stock again in 2014. But kind of looking at that and looking at also what you've done as far as your financing plan on the debt side, would it be fair to say that &#x2013; I don't want to put words in your mouth, but just kind of the numbers I'm looking at that you'd probably be closer to the 6% to 7% earnings growth rate everything else equal versus being down towards the 5% range? Is that kind of fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andy, there's lots of moving parts in there. As I mentioned earlier, it's going to take weather, it's going to take a strong economy, it's going to depend on the O&amp;M flexibility we have within those same timeframes. So, yeah, it's difficult to isolate one variable and make &#x2013; and give you an answer on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ashar. Hold on a sec. I've got something here to help me but when we look at the revenue effects that you saw through the second quarter, those will continue into the third quarter. That's at Georgia, Alabama and Gulf. You should have some additional help from Southern Power as they picked up some new contracts this year around Nacogdoches and with Cleveland County and they should be additive in the second half of the year. We continue to have O&amp;M initiatives, which we think may add as well, and I think growth may be an add or dependent upon how our commercial and residential numbers look in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can I just ask, as you stand at the midpoint of the year, based on what you have earned, it seems like is the midpoint the better point where you can end up for the year as you are still trailing on an LTM basis? Or is there still a chance that you can end up at the higher end or upper end of the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you could still end up there. There's lots of moving parts here...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, what we always do is we'll update you at the end of the third quarter. You know the third quarter is so important to our earnings profile and so far we have reasonable weather in July. The one thing I would just point you to is that kind of interesting data profile I gave you for the first six months. And that is when you look at customers and usage and also the revenue changes we've had in some of our jurisdictions, that was up $0.13 in the first six months. Now year-over-year comparisons, we were down $0.14. So, so far for the first six months, the adverse comparisons on weather have basically wiped away the other positive earnings profiles that we've been able to show.</p>
          <p>So far, if you look at the last six months of the year and if weather is the same, and actually we had a mild fourth quarter in 2011. But if weather is the same for the next six months, then you'll see the power of these new earnings profiles, new customers, usage, et cetera come to bare. So obviously, we'll update this later. But I think that's kind of interesting profiles including what Art told you.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Had a couple questions. First, related to your update to the financing plan. And first focusing on 2012, that's up quite a bit from what you issued earlier and I was curious how much of that is just, I'd say, additional refinancing or callable debt that you did versus new net issuance versus the original plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you originally had like <mark type="ph" /> $35.50 (79:26) for 2012 and it's <mark type="ph" /> $42.59 (79:30) now so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's see. We are about $300 million ahead. So I would estimate that that $300 million is probably some refinancing opportunities that we took advantage of.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you haven't increased your debt issuance &#x2013; your net debt issuance plan for 2012, it's all just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still have a number of other issues that are candidates, possible candidates, potential candidates for refunding. But what we've outlined for you is either maturities or new money needed to finance the ongoing needs of the construction program in our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any refinancing, that wouldn't add to the net issuance, that would only &#x2013; because what you retired would subtract and what you issued would add and then it would net out to zero. So I guess &#x2013; so is that the entire reason for the increase in 2012 versus the <mark type="ph" /> $35.50 (80:37) that you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I believe it's just refinancing opportunities. Now with the reduced CapEx, you may see some reduction in the second half, so we'll see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I also had a question related to the industrial. You showed some industrial highlights on page 10 of the presentation and overall industrial was flat. So I was curious kind of two things. One, what were the areas that were negative that kind of offset the positive highlights you showed? And then of the positive highlights that you showed, how many of those or what portion of that was related to, say, new plans or new pipelines that would be expected to continue...</p>

They've opted to self-generate with the low price of natural gas. The others &#x2013; hold on just a second. Paper was down. The military bases were down, that may be somewhat weather-related there. And textiles, which is really housing-related, is down about 10%. So those are the biggest elements of the negatives amongst the industrial segments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the other one was the maintenance outages, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. But that was in chemicals. Chemicals were basically flat year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it was a great big one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the ones that were up, though, how much of that do you expect to continue going forward? Is that <mark type="ph" /> pretty much stay in (82:42) new facilities and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at transportation, auto production, they've added new shifts to their production lines. So it depends on how that demand relates to that. The pipelines, there was a new pipeline customer in Gulf, in our Florida Panhandle. So that would be an additive customer that would help that number to be positive through the rest of this year.</p>
