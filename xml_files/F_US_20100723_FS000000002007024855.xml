          <p>Thank you, Towanda, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Bob Shanks, Vice President and Controller; K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman; and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer; David Brandi, Assistant Treasurer and Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting . Before we begin, I would like to review a couple of quick items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford motor company's investor and media websites for your reference. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the US GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck. Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Ford Vice President and Controller, Bob Shanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Shawn. Okay, let's start on slide 1 and I'll being by reviewing the key financial results compared with a year ago. And as we mentioned last quarter based on our agreement to sell Volvo, all of our Volvo's 2010 results are reported as special items and excluded from our wholesales, revenue and operating results. The 2009 results include Volvo. Now at the top of the slide you can see that our second quarter vehicle wholesales were 1.4 million units, up 224,000 units. The increase was explained by higher wholesales in all of our automotive segments offset partially by the exclusion of Volvo. If we exclude Volvo from 2009 the wholesale increase was 303,000 units or 27%.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter revenue was $31.3 billion, a $4.5 billion increase. This increase was explained primarily by higher volumes, favorable net pricing and favorable exchange translation offset partially by the exclusion of Volvo. If we exclude Volvo from 2009, the revenue increase was $7.4 billion or over 30%.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $2.9 billion, a $3.5 billion improvement. Automotive results improved by 3.2 billion and financial services improved by $280 million. Our second quarter net income attributable to Ford including unfavorable pre-tax special items of $95 million was $2.6 billion, which was a $338 million improvement. For the first half, pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was about $5 billion, a $7.5 billion improvement and net income attributable to Ford was $4.7 billion, about a $3.9 billion improvement. We ended the quarter with $21.9 billion of automotive gross cash, which was up $1.5 billion from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's go slide 2 where we have details on our special items, which were an unfavorable pre-tax amount of $95 million in the quarter. We recorded $229 million of personnel and dealer related charges including primarily costs related to the discontinuation of Mercury. The first half costs associated with Mercury discontinuation and total US dealer reductions is expected to be somewhat less than half of the total expected special item charges for these actions during the 2010 and 2011 period.</p>
          <p>We also had $94 million of favorable held-for-sale adjustments for Volvo, reflecting its operating profit and other held-for-sale related items including cessation of depreciation. As shown in the memo, if we had continued to report Volvo in our operating results, we would have reported a second quarter pre-tax operating profit of $53 million for Volvo. This would represent an improvement of $290 million compared with a year ago, more than explained by favorable volume and mix, net pricing and material costs offset partially by higher structural costs. This is continuing evidence that the Volvo team has returned the business to sustainable profitability. And lastly, we recognize a $40 million gain related to the full prepayment of our VEBA Note A debt obligation at a discount. This and other debt reduction actions will be discussed in more detail in just a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide 3 where we'll talk about our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. We ended the quarter with $21.9 billion in automotive gross cash, which was down $3.4 billion from the first quarter of 2010 as a result of substantial debt reduction actions. Our automotive related operating related cash flow was 2.6 billion positive in the quarter, reflecting an automotive pre-tax operating profit of $2.1 billion and capital spending during the period of about $1 billion, which was equal to depreciation and amortization. We to continue realize efficiencies in our capital spending from our global product strategy and we still expect spending to increase in the second half to support our future growth.</p>
          <p>We also had changes in working capital of $500 million and this reflected primarily higher payables associated with higher production. Other timing differences were $300 million favorable. For the first half, our working capital and other timing differences were largely unchanged. We also had payment of $300 million to Ford Credit reflecting upfront payment of subvention.</p>
          <p>Other major changes in the second quarter automotive gross cash included separation payments of $100 million and pension contributions of $400 million. We also had debt reduction of actions, which included paying down our revolving credit line and making scheduled payments on our VEBA debt and fully prepaying our VEBA Note A debt obligation. These actions will be discussed further on the following slide.</p>
          <p>We also had equity issuance proceeds of about $300 million and other cash changes of$200 million, which were more than explained by the impact of exchange on our non-US cash balances.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide 4, which summarizes our recent automotive sector debt reduction actions. As we previously announced, we completed debt reduction initiatives during the second quarter that reduced our automotive debt by $7 billion and will lower interest expense by more than $470 million on an annualized basis. These actions included a $3 billion repayment in early April of our revolving line of credit and a $3.8 billion payment to the VEBA trust. In addition to the scheduled payments, this fully retired our VEBA Note A obligation. Ford Credit's $1.3 billion purchase of VEBA Note A is a settlement of existing intercompany tax liabilities.</p>
          <p>Further, we made a $255 million cash payment to bring current previously deferred quarterly distributions on the trust preferred securities. As part of the VEBA actions, subject to regulatory approval, we obtained greater flexibility until mid-2013 to prepay all or a portion of the remaining Note B obligation in cash at a discount. These prepayments can be made periodically during the year. The discount is 5% for prepayments made prior to 2012 and a 4% discount for prepayments made during 2012 and 2013. Previously, we could only prepay Note B once a year.</p>
          <p>Lets now turn to slide 5, which summarizes the automotive sector's cash and debt position. At the end of the second quarter, automotive debt was $27.3 billion of which 1.1 billion matures within a year. Our gross cash net of debt as of June 30 was $5.4 billion negative, an improvement from 9 billion negative as of the end of March. Total liquidity including all available credit lines was $25.4 billion. This liquidity includes $3.1 billion under our secured revolving credit lines and $400 million of other affiliate automotive credit lines.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at our key planning assumptions on slide 6 and our operational metrics for the first half and our 2010 full year outlook. First half industry volume SAAR was 11.4 million units in the US and 15.4 million in the 19 markets that we track in Europe. We've tightened the range of our industry outlooks based on an assessment of the first half results. We expect full-year US industry volume now to be in the range of 11.5 to 12 million units. Full year European industry volume is expected to be in the range of 14.5 to 15 million units, which reflects a stronger than expected first half offset by a weaker second half.</p>
          <p>On our automotive operational metrics, all of our regions are on track to improve quality compared with a year ago. Our automotive structural costs were 350 million higher in the first half and we expect our full year automotive structural costs to be about $1 billion higher to support growth and key products introductions. Our cost structure however, continues to improve as a percentage of revenue. Although not shown, commodity costs were about $400 million higher in the first half and for the full year, we expect commodity costs also to increase by about $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our market share in the US in total was 16.7% and our US share of the retail market was 14.1% in the first half. Both improvements compared with 2009 As a result, we now expect full year US market shares to improve compared with last year. Europe market share for the first half was 8.7% and we now expect full-year European market share to be about equal to the first half but lower than 2009, reflecting our decision to limit increases in incentives across the region. Automotive operating related cash flow was 2.5 billion positive in the first half, reflecting our improved profitability. For the full year, we remain confident of our plan to generate positive operating related cash flow.</p>
          <p>And finally capital expenditures were at 1.9 billion in the first half and for the full year we expect our spending to be about $4.5 billion in support of our product plan as we continue to realize efficiencies from our global product development processes.</p>
          <p>We expect to have solid financial results in the second half continuing to exceed the expectations we had earlier this year. Now as in most years, our first half results will be stronger than the second half reflecting normal seasonality including lower second-half volumes related to plant shutdowns and product launches. This year we also expect higher investment and costs in the second half to support growth and key product introductions as well as higher commodity costs and smaller reductions in reserves at Ford Credit.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect to achieve great results for the full year proving a solid foundation for our continuing growth. For 2011, based on our present planning assumptions we expect continued improvement in total company profitability and automotive operating related cash flow including improvement in our automotive operations. These improvements are driven primarily by the growing strength of our global products, continued cost structure improvements and the gradually strengthening global economy.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit will continue to be solidly profitable but at a lower level reflecting primarily a lower occurrence of this year's favorable factors. In addition, by the end of 2011 we expect to move from an automotive net debt position to a net cash position and with that I will now turn it over to K.R.</p>

          <p>Thanks Bob. Slide 7 shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the second quarter of 2010. As shown in the left box, our second quarter pre-tax profit was $888 million compared with a pre-tax profit of $646 million in the second quarter of 2009. You can see in the right box, our June 30 on-balance sheet receivables were $85 billion, about $14 billion lower than the same period last year and about $8 billion lower than year-end 2009. These declines reflect primarily the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda and Volvo financing to other finance providers, lower industry and financing volumes in 2009 and 2010 compared with prior years as well as changes in currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs for on-balance sheet receivables in the second quarter were $86 million and the worldwide loss-to-receivables ratio was a very low 39 basis points, which was down 70 basis points from the same period last year. And I'll speak more about this in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>At June 30, the allowance for credit losses for on-balance sheet receivables was about $1.1 billion or 126 basis points of receivables. The allowance was about $400 million lower than year-end 2009 and about $700 million lower than the same period last year.</p>
          <p>On June 30, we paid $1.3 billion in cash to the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust to settle a portion of the outstanding principal amount of Note A held by the trust and immediately transferred to Ford the portion of Note A that was purchased from the trust to satisfy $1.3 billion of intercompany tax liabilities we owed to Ford.</p>
          <p>We are still projecting total distributions of about $2 billion during 2010; 500 million was paid in the first quarter and $1.5 billion is planned for the second half of 2010. We will continue to assess our ability to make future distributions based on our available liquidity and manage leverage objectives. At June 30, our managed leverage was 6.6 to 1 compared with 8.4 to 1 at June 30 2009. At the end of the second quarter our equity was about $11 billion.</p>
          <p>If I move to slide 8, slide 8 explains the changes to Ford Credit's pre-tax profits in the second quarter compared with the second quarter of 2009. Volume was about $100 million lower compared with the same period last year reflecting the decline in the receivables. The decline in the provision for credit losses of about $600 million reflects primarily a lower credit loss reserve and improved charge off performance. Residual losses declined about $100 million in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. This improvement reflects primarily the impact of higher auction values on vehicles returned during the quarter. The decline in other of about $300 million reflects primarily the non-recurrence of 2009 net gains related to unhedged currency exposure primarily from cross border intercompany lending.</p>
          <p>Our international segment, which is primarily Europe, reported a pre-tax profit of $77 million in the second quarter of 2010, which was $104 million increase from the same period a year ago. This increase reflects primarily a decline in the provision for credit losses, higher financing margin and lower losses on the residual based products offset partially by lower volume.</p>
          <p>We now expect full year 2010 profits to be higher than our 2009 profits. The second half of 2010 will be lower than the first half because we expect smaller improvements in the provision for credit losses and depreciation expense for leased vehicles compared with the improvements we experienced in the first half. We also expect full year 2011 profits for us to continue to be solidly profitable but at a lower level than our 2010 profits. This primarily reflects the non-recurrence of lower depreciation expense for leased vehicles and the non-recurrence of credit loss reserve reductions of the same magnitude experienced in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 shows quarterly trends of charge offs and loss-to-receivable ratios for our on-balance sheet portfolio. The top box shows loss-to-receivable ratios for the worldwide portfolio and loss-to-receivable ratios for the US Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail and lease business. Both worldwide and US Ford, Lincoln, Mercury loss-to-receivable ratios in second quarter are down from the same period a year ago reflecting primarily lower repossessions, lower severity, and lower wholesale and dealer loan losses in the United States as well lower losses in Europe. Both Worldwide and US Ford, Lincoln, Mercury second quarter loss-to-receivable ratios are lower than the first quarter of 2010 primarily reflecting lower repossessions and lower severity in the United States. Charge-offs in the second quarter were $86 million, which was down $199 million from the same period a year ago and down $47 million from the first quarter of 2010, reflecting the same factors I just mentioned.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, it shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the US Ford, Lincoln, Mercury retail and lease business. Repossessions in the second quarter were 15,000 units, which was down 7,000 units from the second quarter of 2009 and down 4,000 units in the first quarter of 2010. Severity of $6,700 in the second quarter was $1,700 lower than the same period a year ago and $600 lower than the first quarter of 2010, reflecting primarily improvements in used vehicle auction values.</p>
          <p>Over 60-day delinquencies totaled 12 basis points in the second quarter, which was down 11 basis points from the same period a year ago and down 5 basis points from the first quarter of 2010. Bankruptcy filings totaled 12,000 in the second quarter, which was about the same as a year ago and up 2,000 from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the least residual performance for our Ford, Lincoln and Mercury US brands. Lease return volumes in the second quarter at 46,000 were equal to the same period last year reflecting primarily a lower return rate offset by higher terminations during the quarter. The second quarter lease return rate was 65%, which was down 18 percentage points compared with the same period last year. This return rate was down 6 percentage points compared with the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, auctions values for 24 and 36 month leased vehicles at constant mix were up an average of $1,100 per unit and $1,600 per unit respectively from the same period last year, as reflecting primarily the improvement in used vehicles auction values. Compared with the prior quarter, auction values were up about $600 for both 24 and 36 month leased vehicles.</p>
          <p>Lease placements by segment are becoming more balanced but remain concentrated in cars and crossovers. In the second quarter, cars and crossovers represented 75% of new placements. Our lease portfolio in total is presently 66% cars and crossovers.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $11.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, which was down from $18.2 billion in the same period last year and this decline reflected primarily the transition of Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda and Volvo brands to other finance providers and lower lease placements for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.</p>

          <p>Thanks, K.R. I'm on slide 12. We remain on track to achieve our full funding plan. We completed about 6 billion of funding in the second quarter including a US public retail transaction at pre-crisis credit spreads and our first Canadian wholesale securitization since 2006. We have completed about another billion of funding during the month of July. We renewed 12 billion of committed capacity and we added an additional 2 billion of net incremental capacity. Part of the renewal included our FCAR 364-day and multiyear lines. Our FCAR multiyear lines were extended for the first time since 2007 and are now 3-year facilities. All of our commitments are renewing at significantly lower costs.</p>
          <p>Our funding strategy remains focused on access to public and private securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper and unsecured debt. Our liquidity remains strong and we will continue to maintain cash balances, funding programs and committed capacity to ensure liquidity adequately meets our business and funding requirements.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows the trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the second quarter, managed receivables were 87 billion. We ended the quarter with over 17 billion in cash including 5.2 billion to support on-balance sheet securitization transactions. Securitization funding was 57% of managed receivables at the end of the second quarter, up from 56% at year-end 2009. We are projecting 2010 year-end managed receivables in the range of 80 to 90 billion and securitized funding to represent about 55 to 60% of total managed receivables.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows our 2010 term funding plan for Ford Credit which does not include our short term funding programs or asset sales to our on-balance sheet asset-backed commercial paper program. Year-to-date we have completed 15 billion of term funding. About 10 billion of this funding was public including unsecured debt issuance totaling about 3 billion in the US and in Europe and about 7 billion of securitizations in the US, Canada and Germany. In addition we completed about 5 billion of funding through our private securitization channels in the US, Canada and Europe. For 2010, our public term funding plans are in the range of 14 to 17 billion consisting of 10 to 12 billion of public securitizations and 4 to 6 billion of unsecured debt. In addition to the public issuance we are forecasting 7 to 11 billion of funding from our private sources.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 details our liquidity programs and utilization. The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity, which includes unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines and our asset-backed bank capacity. As of June 30, we had 51.4 billion of committed capacity and cash. After excluding securitization and cash and adjusting for available assets, liquidity was 39 billion of which 18.3 billion was utilized, leaving about 21 billion available given our present level of eligible receivables. Available liquidity is about the same as first quarter and is 24% of managed receivables.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, our cash not related to securitization totaled over 12 billion. Committed capacity is up 1.7 billion compared to the first quarter as several of our key relationship banks have provided incremental capacity to support a variety of markets and asset classes. We ended the quarter with about 7 billion of excess committed capacity. This excess capacity reflects lower assets and our higher use of public funding. Of the 34 billion of total committed capacity, about 13 billion is up for renewal through the remainder of 2010. Our renewal strategy will focus on optimizing capacity and liquidity to protect our global business and funding requirements. Additionally during the second quarter, we repurchased or called about 1.7 billion of near-term unsecured debt maturities.</p>
          <p>In summary, on slide 16, Ford had a pre-tax operating profit excluding special items of 2.9 billion, a 3.5 billion improvement from a year ago. Net income attributable to Ford was 2.6 billion. As part of our plan to improve our balance sheet, we retired 7 billion of debt including paying 3.8 billion to the UAW Retirement Medical Benefits Trust, paying down 3 billion of a revolving credit facility and reinstating our deferred dividend on our trust preferred securities.</p>
          <p>Second quarter automotive cash was 21.9 billion. For Ford Credit, the pre-tax profit was 888 million and net income was 556 million. We have seen the external funding environment and it continues to improve. Year-to-date Ford Credit has completed 15 billion of term funding and Ford Credit ended the second quarter with liquidity available for use of about 21 billion.</p>
          <p>I will now turn it back to Shawn to being the Q&amp;A session.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Neil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to start the question-and-answer session now. Towanda, can we please have the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle with JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Wow, wow, solid quarter. I guess my question is from a debt standpoint. You guys highlight your desire to move to investment grade and I don't know the adjective I can use here, but amazing progress in net debt reduction during the second quarter. And looking at it, my question is how should we expect the cadence of future debt reduction to play out and what are the major buckets of funding of that debt reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at what was said earlier today, I think we've said we are going to move from a net debt to a net cash position in 2011. And I think the trajectory of that is going to be from the sources you would expect it to be. Operating performance, first and foremost, dividends from Ford Credit are probably the two major sources.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so I mean, if I look back at your last four quarters you guys generated from operations like 1.5 billion of operating cash flows, so that could do it by itself. But K.R., I look at Ford Credit and you are right shy of 7 times managed leverage and I think we've talked about several years ago where that could go in the kind of double digits, let's call it 11 times. I mean if I look at Ford Credit outside of the additional equity you're generating through net income, it looks like you're 4 billion kind of sized over capitalized. I mean once we see the light at the end of the tunnel, I mean is that a potential source as well to kind of carve in there even more or are you going to keep that conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The easy answer Eric is that we have an agreement with the parent company that we would not take our leverage above 11.5 to 1. We actually target a little bit below that but not 11.5 to 1. Once you kind of pass all the noise in the market and you are comfortable that the economy has come back and funding is there, liquidity is strong. We will steadily move up towards our target, which as you point out will be several billion dollars of incremental dividends from this point in time and for example, the first piece is 1.5 billion in the second half of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in talking about the Regulation AB and the agency issue, I guess you got a 6 month stay on that is what Booth said on the earlier call, but how do you see that being resolved? I mean is it going to be, are they going to recharacterize agencies as experts? Are you guys going to have to do more private deals? Are the agencies going to have to pass on the cost of insurance? And if the answer is the final 2, what do you estimate the additional cost of that if you do have to do private deals or if there is an insurance cost embedded in those deals? I mean is there anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Eric I think we're a little ahead of ourselves from the standpoint of what the outcome becomes. I think everybody in Washington recognizes what happened. We were successful with getting the no comment letter or no action letter from the SEC. That gives us the time and gives really the experts the time to fix the problem. And I think the potential solutions that you mentioned are all out there from the standpoint of what could happen. But I think it's early days to try to predict that. I think from our perspective we've got lots of available capacity on the private side. So, if that's where we had to go, I think cost wouldn't be a problem but I think there is going to be other solutions that get created.</p>

          <p>And then if I could squeeze one more in, any color on how your discussions with the agencies are going? I mean we didn't see any reaction, post taking off 20% of your debt in one quarter and generating just shy of 3 billion in operating cash flow. And I'll jump off, I just wanted to see, it feels like some of the agencies have enacted in this year and you guys obviously have outperformed. So just want to know how they feel. Thank you guys.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are hearing a lot about subprime in leasing in the last couple of days and I was curious, we heard yesterday that subprime application approval rates are at historically low levels, do you see that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as application rates for subprime, I don't see anything in particular that I can give you one way or the other. I do know that we continue to buy a broad spectrum of the business, which includes a nice chunk of subprime. So we're still buying this thing. I just won't actually have the request side of the equation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no I understand. Well just stepping back from it a second, is your sense overall that the subprime market is underserved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really want to get into commentary on the rest of the competitors in the marketplace. I mean from a Ford Credit perspective, we continue to buy what we consider to be a nice chunk of subprime and as far as we're concerned, if you come to Ford and want to get a loan, we'll do the best we can to get you behind the wheel of the product. And as far as I'm concerned &#x2013; as far as Ford goes the subprime is being well served.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you don't release penetration rates, but do you &#x2013; can you have any sense for directionally where they're headed in terms of subprime and leasing at Ford Motor Credit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as leasing &#x2013; go back to subprime real quick. As I said before, we buy a broad spectrum of business, which includes subprime, near-prime, prime paper. We have no plans to change how much we're buying of either, any of the pieces there primarily because we want to have our securitizations to be well supported and they perform very well in the marketplace. Concerning your other question on lease and lease penetration, we don't actually give out a number of what our lease penetration is, however, it is a nice chunk of the business for us. We have a, it's a balanced approach with Ford. There are customers out there that do want the lease product and so we'll get you into a lease if you really want one and then there are other customers that want the retail products. So in the end, we try to run a balance in our portfolio to make sure that lease people are satisfied as well as getting the retail done as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The rebound in used vehicle prices has really helped in a lot of different ways and do you have a sense for where used vehicle prices are headed and do you think we've kind of stabilized here? We've gotten to the point where we're approaching new vehicle prices so we're going to plateau.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're approaching new vehicle prices. I mean they have. I think, middle of 2008, June of 2008 they were really low, by December they got even lower and they've had a steady improvement ever since and you can see it in, you look at like the Manheim Index. We kind of think of it right now as to the last 8 months, they've kind of been following what we call normal seasonal patterns. So we're assuming that it follows kind of along the same pattern which is typically they decline a little bit in the third quarter before picking back up toward the end of the year. But in the end, I have been guessing on used car prices for the last 3 years and I haven't been that good at it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys, great quarter. I think I have an easy one for you. You guys did a great job covering everything in the earnings call. The only question I really have is just regarding the DOE loans, it looks like you are into 1.8 billion and I guess the question would be is just presumably, you have capacity for what looks to be around 3.7 between now and the end of 2011, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, through September of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>September 2012, is there I mean presumably you're going to take all that given the rate by which you can get the money. I mean is there a scenario whereby perhaps you would not look to take down those DOE loans?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just looking at your overall capital structure, I mean with intentions of getting to a net cash position by the end of 2011 and getting back to Eric's question earlier with the rating agencies. Obviously I assume from talking to them, their big issue is the amount of secured debt in your capital structure. So, I guess going forward, you have the options to repay bank debt. You have options to repay some of the UAW VEBA debt, but I mean really if you're going to get back to investment grade, the secured debt seems to be really the part of the capital structure that you would have to address. I mean that's more of a comment but I mean would you guys agree with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have &#x2013; what we've said and what we continue to believe is we have more debt than we think we need and our goal would be to reduce debt and that's how you get to a net cash positive, is to continue to improve and I think all of our debt is part of that discussion.</p>

          <p>I just have a quick question, if I recall correctly during your first quarter call, you indicated that you are incorporating somewhat of an interest rate increase before the year-end in your forecasts and I was just wondering if that assumption still holds true in your current forecast.</p>
