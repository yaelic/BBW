          <p>Thanks, Bob, and thanks for joining us to review predominantly our fourth quarter results. Claude will speak a little bit to some full-year results, but most of the time will be spent on this quarter &#x2013; a quarter that I think was very good considering some of the challenges. If you look at &#x2013; our revenues adjusted for exchange were up 4%, carloads were up 5%. Jim will talk about &#x2013; we had the ability to maintain some &#x2013; our pricing momentum. Our earnings, as reported, were up $1.68. Adjusted, we came in effectively flat at $0.90, despite those challenges I mentioned.</p>
          <p>The precision railroad model continues to work. The OR compared to last year was effectively, Claude, I think we were down technically a tenth of a point. There is a few items I would like to highlight that took place that I am very pleased with. One, as you are well aware, we got Prince Rupert open and running and the service has been excellent and we are very, very pleased and Jim will talk to you about some of those numbers as where we see that.</p>
          <p>Two &#x2013; very, very important strategic acquisitions for us, EJ&amp;E in Chicago, subject to STB approval and we will probably have some questions about that which we'll be glad to address. And just recently, the ANY shortline in Alberta which runs north east of Edmonton towards the Tar Sands, and Claude led that file for us and did an excellent job. And I think you probably have seen a press release. But I think we bought the railroad for $25 million and we have committed to put about 130 to $35 million in in capital to get the rail road in the condition it should be.</p>
          <p>We were successful into sales of our sale leaseback effect together of our Central Station Complex here in headquarters, and of our last remaining shares of EWS which helped our cash flow performance. We saw further expansion of the non-rail services from CN WorldWide and North America.</p>
          <p>And last, but not least, on the labor front, I am proud to announce that the first one of these labor agreements to be signed was announced today. We initialed an agreement, subject to ratification with the UTU in the US on the former IC property, which was the first, if you remember, first of the UTU agreements. And so this is the first renewal which was completed.</p>
          <p>In December, we completed an agreement and was ratified with IBEW. And then I guess it was last week we announced that we &#x2013; our new agreement with the steel workers was ratified and it was ratified at 85%, which is effectively unheard of. So some pretty good performance across the board. Claude is going to talk to us a little more about the details of some of the numbers. Claude?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hunter. I think it is indeed a good quarter on balance, given some of the headwinds that we had to face. We had during the quarter the Canadian dollar really rallied and actually twiddled in above parity, close to $1.02 during the quarter and oil prices on the world market were above $90 &#x2013; I think actually $91 on average during the quarter. So given those headwinds, we turned in a good performance, particularly good revenue performance. If you look at it, FX adjusted, 4% revenue growth, good balance between the pricing and the volume performance. Jim will discuss in more detail, but I'm particularly pleased that we have the FX-adjusted growth in every business unit except forest products, which is impacted as we speak by the current uncertainty in the housing market in the US.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we also closed two very significant transactions. The EWS sale to the German railroad and the sale and leaseback of our complex here in Montreal, the Central Station. Together, they delivered a gain of $155 million, but also close to $465 million of cash flow, so good for EPS and very good for cash flow.</p>
          <p>The quarter also had another one-time item, the benefit from the lower corporate taxes that have been announced by the federal government here in Canada. That DFIT benefit was close to 300 million. If my memory is right, it's 284 million. So with this we have EPS as reported of $1.68, excluding the one-time items &#x2013; that is the two transactions and the DFIT benefits, the quarter came in at $0.90, which is basically flat year-over-year. Good growth, good expense performance, but also a few areas where we had help on the expense line, and I would like to turn to the expense to take that in more detail.</p>
          <p>If you look at the expense performance, it's really a story of two tales or two big stories. The clear headwind is fuel expense, up a whopping 49% if you look at it on an FX adjusted basis. As I said, WTI at a $91 level. That's basically, last year WTI was at 60 bucks per barrel in the fourth quarter. It has come down a little bit. So a huge increase on a year-over-year basis. That's not mentioning the increase in the refining margin of 3 to $4 which also add up to the equation. So basically, all-in with the benefit of exchange, you could see an increase for fuel of roughly $100 million, a little bit more than $100 million, if I looked at it FX-adjusted.</p>
          <p>Helping offset this fuel expense was lower labor expenses, a big help here unfortunately was the lower stock-based compensation. Last year, our stock-based compensation was a meaningful expense to the quarter. This year it's a meaningful credit. On a year-over-year basis, it's close to $80 million reduction. So that has been helping us in terms of lower expense. And on the labor line, we also are seeing on our labor line the benefits from lower compensation for incentive bonus, all of these offsetting the slight increase to our head count, which in the fourth quarter were up basically 2.5% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Purchase services and material and equipment grants basically well behaved, up 3% on a year-over-year basis FX-adjusted. Our depreciation is up 8%. This reflects the normal increase that you would see due to our capital expenditure, but also the fact that we have not quite completed, but we have a best estimate for a new depreciation study of our Canadian asset and that impacted our quarter by close to $8 million, 7 to $8 million. The run rate of the increase to our depreciation expense for those categories that we have completed is in the range of $35 million.</p>
          <p>This is something in the fourth quarter that we will have to finalize and I would expect perhaps a little bit more expense into next year. On a year-over-year basis, we should see an incremental run rate in the range of 40 to $50 million for depreciation. This is as a result of the intensity that we use our assets. The main areas of impact are in the areas of rolling stock where you would expect &#x2013; the fact that we are using our locomotive and our car fleet much more productively, this is having an impact in terms of life and depreciation rate.</p>
          <p>Finally, casualty and other, this is a very lumpy category, as you know, at around 66 million for the quarter. We are once again, basically, I would say, around $30 million lower than the run rate that I would expect, whatever that means because, as I said, it's a very lumpy category. The reason it's lower is because we've had continuing benefits in terms of our personal injury reserve, both FELA cases, but also occupational disease claims are coming down based on our actuarial study. The benefit during the quarter was around $40 million, but we also had a $40 million last year when we did our Q4 actuarial study during the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>So all in all, good, solid performance. Clearly, fuel expense, there is really little we can do other than covering ourselves with a fuel surcharge and the help on the labor infringe benefits we hope to reverse next year with better stock performance and an increase in those expenses. That's the way we are thinking about it.</p>
          <p>On the free cash flow, we delivered $828 million on the strength of the cash generated from the sales of EWS and Central Station. If I exclude those gains, but also the significant cash tax installment which we did during the year on account of 2006 taxes, something I've explained in previous calls, our run rate free cash flow would have been in the range of 650 to $675 million. And as you know, we paid during the year basically $860 million in cash taxes because we paid both the 2006 installments and our normal installment now that we're cash tax payable on account of 2007. This is a headwind we will not see next year.</p>
          <p>The CapEx for the full year ended up at 1.680 billion; 80 million of that is just the sale/leaseback portion of our Central Station. So if I exclude that, our CapEx is coming in in-line with guidance at around 1.6 billion. We see next year coming down. We have a number of our programs that have been completed and we're really focusing our &#x2013; and targeting our CapEx next year to the areas that can deliver benefits to us in terms of productivity or growth. We see our CapEx envelope in 2008 in the range of 1.5 billion and that will include roughly 70, $75 million as the first year of the ANY capital upgrade program that Hunter referred to. That's the line that links up Linton to our Edmonton &#x2013; to the Lakeland Waterway, which connects us to Edmonton.</p>
          <p>Basically, the only other item that went up in terms of cash consumption significantly is the dividend as per the increase that the Board has decided last year. And I'm very pleased to report that our Board of Director again, and that is the 12th consecutive year that they do so, agreed to increase our dividend on a go-forward basis. As you will see in the press release that dividend will increase by 10%, which should put us at about our target of 25 payout ratio give or take going forward.</p>
          <p>Just a few words on the full year to say that if I exclude the one-time items, we came in on the strength of the revenue performance, around 3% FX-adjusted growth, at 3.40 of earnings per share for the full year, which is flat year-over-year. I think it's fair to say that this is solid performance. We had our share of challenges to deal with, with a much slower economy, particularly impacting forest product. But also, if you recall, in the first quarter labor disruption and a number of other challenges to deal with, not the least of which are exchange and fuel price volatility.</p>
          <p>So on balance, that 3.40, I think is a very good performance and that's the basis upon which with some trepidation, I'd like to close my presentation with giving you a bit of guidance on 2008. If you recall at our Q3 call, we had reserved the guidance because we thought there was a little bit too much uncertainty to make a call. I must tell you yesterday and this morning when I was seeing world markets and the volatility that we are seeing, I guess the volatility has not fully lifted, but it is our view basically that within this uncertain environment, we are &#x2013; it's our view that the economy in actual fact may not be as feared by some in a full blown recession. I think we still have a good chance of having soft landing. It may be a little bit more bumpy, but what we are calling for is a soft landing, basically on the order of just below 2% North American GDP growth, 1.7% to be exact.</p>
          <p>The dollar has settled back in in a range of $0.95 to $1.00. That's the Canadian dollar versus the US currency. And fuel prices, last I checked, were around $90 per barrel and with a forward for the year in that range. So of course, these items have been all particularly volatile and the economy remains a question mark. But if we are calling it right, we think we are very well positioned and Jim will give you some more detail. We see top line growth next year being the engine of our EPS growth and clearly we will need it because there are some headwinds that we are facing.</p>
          <p>To be specific, we are calling for growth of 6 to 8% which really is around 10% adjusting for exchange. This is will &#x2013; this will be needed to help offset some of the headwinds that we are facing. Let me give you just a few, the foreign exchange if it's in that range, the mid-point should have an impact on our reported EPS, Canadian dollar in the range of 2 to 3%. The fuel at 90 bucks will &#x2013; would be an headline increase on the order of $175 million.</p>
          <p>The important points for you to know is that about 40, perhaps even $50 million of that is the fact that our crack, refining margin, we had some very, very good contracts in the past where the refining margins were well below market. These have been renegotiated at market. We are also not always getting the full benefit of the exchange appreciation when we pay our fuel bill, particularly in Western Canada where there is a very tight supply. So, net-net, we see independent of fuel price, that is the movement in WTI, we see a headwind in a range of 40 to $50 million that will be there on the fuel expense.</p>
          <p>Labor, we hope to turn around, because we hope to have a good year and see the stock price go up. We also have lower bonuses than we would have liked in 2007 and are fully intent on changing that for next year, that's the headline. Both of them will be offset somewhat by lower pension expense, but the labor expense next year should be a headwind, again in the range of 1 to 2%. So basically, if I look at some other &#x2013; some of these item and focus also on depreciation and some of the benefit on the personal injury reserve that we had in 2006 and 2007 and should come down a bit in 2008. We are facing cost headwind, which basically brings us, in terms of guidance, to a mid-to-high single-digit, given the parameters that in the environment in terms of assumption.</p>
          <p>That will be backed up with very good cash flow generation next year. We're targeting $750 million of cash flow and the key uncertainty at this point is whether we are calling the economy right, but you should know that under Hunter's leadership, we are managing and getting ready for both scenarios. We want to be there to accommodate the growth, and if it's there and improve our top line, but we will be ready and also managing our expenses if the economy turns out to be tougher than what we're calling at this point.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Claude. As usual, I'll be discussing the revenue numbers on an exchange-adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter, we had revenue growth of 4%. There was a good blend of volume and price across all the business segments. In total, our car loads were up 5% and revenue ton miles up 3%. These total numbers show the impact of a 45% increase of iron ore loads moved this year versus last year. All of our iron ore companies were back in full production this quarter versus last year when there was an explosion at a mine and two furnace outages. So there are a lot of ore loads here, but on average they only move about 60 miles, so that they do not have nearly the revenue impact. This high volume, low revenue per car move impacts the revenue ton miles, revenue per car load and length of haul as well.</p>
          <p>On the price side of the business, the price environment continues to be solid. Rate increases on a per unit basis achieved this quarter were above 4%. Going through the various business segments, petroleum and chemicals, up 11%; petroleum-related markets continued to be strong, up 16% in the quarter, led by diluent shipment into the oil sands region of Western Canada, strong shipments of fuel oil and diesel fuel and very strong shipments of sulfur due to the strong commodity prices and increased world demand.</p>
          <p>Chemical side of the business, also very good, up 8%, especially imported methanol shipments over the Port of Kitimat on the West Coast. The metals and minerals group up 11%. All sub-groups in the metals and minerals business segment posted increases in addition to the iron ore business that I talked about in my opening remarks. Positive results in all of the metals subgroup. Strong demand for steel slabs, plate and aluminum. Construction materials were somewhat stronger in the fourth quarter than they had been earlier in the year and very good shipments of dimensional loads such as windmills and large pieces of machinery in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Forest products, the only business unit where we saw a decline this quarter, our lumber and panel producing customers continue to face difficult markets. They are rationalizing capacity and curtailing production as demand continues to decrease. Car loads in this area were down 12 and 25% respectively for lumber and panels. Paper results down 8% largely due to the closure of a significant mill in Eastern Canada, which had just started operations earlier in the year, and wood pulp posted relatively flat volumes versus last year as &#x2013; but export prices stayed very strong throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our automotive business segment up 7%, very solid quarter performance. Finished vehicles and vehicle parts up 5 and 11% respectively. Gains there in the finished vehicle segment driven by new vehicle models as well as very strong import traffic to the Port of Vancouver.</p>
          <p>On the bulk side of the business, bulk in total up 8% as the demand for our services from our bulk customers continues to be solid and growing. Canadian coal &#x2013; coal in total up 12%, but Canadian coal, again, a very strong quarter, up 44% driven by strong demand for the metallurgical coal to the export markets, coupled with new mine capacity that's again come on in Western Canada.</p>
          <p>The US coal business down 10%, some short-term production issues at a major Illinois Basin mine as well as an outage at one of the utilities served by CN &#x2013; short-term related issues here affecting the US business. Grain and fertilizers, the total there up 7%. In Canada, lower volumes of wheat offset by a very strong demand for barley to export as well as stronger volumes of peas in the West and in the US. We saw somewhat lower corn shipments, big volumes of ethanol and DDG commodities as well as more soybeans moving to the Gulf Coast export markets.</p>
          <p>Fertilizer segment, very positive as we continue to move more potash from Canada into the US markets where the crop size continues to increase. On the intermodal segment, up 4%, in total overseas up 6%, reflecting the opening in the quarter of the New Prince Rupert traffic. Service there has just been phenomenal throughout to all the destinations as well as we continue to show gains with other steamship companies over the ports to terminals in Vancouver. Our domestic business, also showing strong increases with our retail customers in the fourth quarter, domestic up 3%, and the other revenue up 7% showing the increase there in our activities related to non-rail transportation services.</p>
          <p>Claude had touched on the outlook for 2008 from a top line perspective. There is nothing out there that would shake my confidence in the pricing area. Our previous guidance in the 4 to 5% unit price increase continues. We will see very good growth in virtually all of our business segments, especially intermodal and bulk. On the bulk side, our coal outlook is very strong in the US as the Illinois Basin coal that we've talked about in the past &#x2013; the new mines there come online as well as a continuing demand for Canadian metallurgical coal to offshore markets.</p>
          <p>Corn demand and corn pricing in the US is very strong. Wheat exports out of Canada continue to be very strong. Potash movements should continue to be moving into our US markets as well as strong demand for sulfur in intermodal.</p>
          <p>In the merchandise segment, the area where we saw softness or declines &#x2013; difficult to say that forest products was soft this year, but it was down quite a bit. We think that the housing market has probably stabilized and the run rates that we saw in December will probably be where they were &#x2013; will continue to be throughout the year. But the strong opportunity that we've talked about with more and more product moving into and out of the oil sands, very good outlook for '08 for metals and minerals, especially for the full-year demand for our iron ore. And if you add that up, top line outlook at this point in time, we would certainly expect to achieve 10% top line growth in '08 on an exchange-adjusted basis. Hunter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank, Jim and Claude, for those helpful remarks. Let me kind of wrap up '07 by making these comments that Claude alluded to earlier. But I think if you look at the performance of coming in effectively flat at an adjusted $3.40 and take into account that that was comparing 2007 to 2006, which was a world record performance for us, with the obstacles that we faced, this team faced in the first quarter with unprecedented weather in Western Canada, the worst in history, with the unfortunate work stoppage by the UTU which set us back, and again the strength &#x2013; the continuing strength of the Canadian dollar and the weakness in the forest product segment, if this had not been a strong operating team, we would not have been able to produce those type of results in the face of those obstacles.</p>
          <p>So I was overall very pleased with the performance this organization was able to put together. So looking ahead, it's been very difficult for us, as Claude also mentioned earlier, to try to figure where to put this &#x2013; stick the pin in with the volatility and some of the issues we faced and we went through.</p>
          <p>But all things in, I would just tell you this that I am very optimistic about us being able to achieve those type things. I think we have got several initiatives in our pipeline that can produce some results for us, and so I am looking forward to a real bounce back in 2008, despite some of the things that we read every day.</p>
          <p>We've targeted capital spend for productivity and to accommodate additional growth at 1.4 billion, and I guess &#x2013; that's wrong, it's 1.5 billion because we had the ANY added in. Originally, it was going to be a 1.4 billion, which is backing off about 2, 300 million from where we had planned on being in 2007. Keith Creel and Paul Miller, our Chief Safety Officer, are leading us in a real commitment to take full advantage of the opportunities that this whole safety, loss control, risk management effort gives us and we will continue to be focused on rewarding shareholders as Claude mentioned. We just approved today with the Board of Directors our 12th consecutive dividend and we will continue with our aggressive share buyback programs, which have been going on for about several months now. So, all in all, I am very pleased.</p>
          <p>And operator, with that we will be happy to address questions the group might have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from William Greene from Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look at kind of the carloads per employee or however you want to think about it, I guess I would have thought with the volume growth, it would have gotten a little bit better. Clearly, on the expense side, you've benefited from some of the items that Claude mentioned, but can you talk a little bit about how we should think about this going forward and whether or not the new agreements that you're trying to put in place here over time, maybe can it lead to even substantially better productivity or have we kind of hit a ceiling?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, I think we had a little technical problem. We didn't get the first part of your question. Could you repeat that question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So the first question was just related to the productivity. Given the volume growth we saw, I would have thought it would have been a little bit better in the fourth quarter measured in carloads per employee, but maybe that's not the way to think about it, and so I am curious what your thoughts are there. And then how much better can it get? Have we hit a ceiling or are some of these agreements you're trying to put in place, can those move the needle materially from here?</p>

          <p>Well, they can certainly move the needle. Keep in mind that I have always said that we have not been obsessed with operating ratio. We're trying to grow this business and there are some initiatives that we have got going on, one being CN WorldWide, which is a start-up business, which we are accounted for differently, which shows some deterioration. I guess the biggest issue from those metrics that you're looking at is that when you lose the amount of lumber business that we had in Western Canada &#x2013; that was our largest segment &#x2013; which now has dropped down enough that grain in Canada and intermodal are larger than forest products. So it effects the train productivities, it affects a lot of things, so &#x2013; but we have certainly not hit the ceiling as far as the ability to produce and improve productivity and our operating metrics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add, though, Bill, that basically I think we have had a slight increase in our head count for the reasons that we discussed on our third quarter call. Some of it replenishing our crews in the West, in particular some of it in-sourcing, but the reality is in terms of getting leverage &#x2013; the beauty is when we have a better volume outlook going forward, take Rupert for instance, and all the initiatives that Jim talked about, the ability to handle the business at lower incremental costs is when it's easier to show productivity from a head count standpoint and from a labor productivity that you've been accustomed to in the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with regard to your outlook, you mentioned in particular you don't have a recession in your numbers, can you give us some sense for what you think the sensitivity would be if you had to move toward a more consensus view that maybe perhaps there would be a recession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know what, consensus view is tough to call. If you had asked me yesterday, it seemed the market was calling for a clear recession. Today, I think people are not sure anymore. That's the difficulty and the volatility that we see going forward. All I can tell you is we have initiatives that are totally independent of the economy. Rupert, some of the bulk business out West, some of the initiatives we have to take the market share against, truck, et cetera. For sure, if there is a recession, that will have an impact on our top line, but on balance that may also help with the exchange, it may also help with fuel price. And who knows, our focus will be on doing the best in those circumstances and rebound strong when the economy comes back.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see. I wanted to see first if Claude could give us some insights on some of the moving parts on comp and benefits in your '08 outlook. I guess you talked about pension and that that might be down year-over-year. And on the incentive comp, can you give us a sense of the stock-based incentive comp that was actually paid out in '07 and what that number might have looked like in '06, just so we have a little framework for understanding some of those moving parts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2006 was a stellar year, Tom. So we blew the lights out and we had the highest possible bonus as a team. 2007 was tougher. And again, the Board recognized that and we did not get any bonus. So next year, we're going to have to replenish. We're shooting for a stretch and hopefully we'll get a stretch. So that alone, having said this, might be an increase in terms of expenses in the range of, say, 60, perhaps $65 million which is about the benefit that we will get on pension because of the higher discount rate. So the two of them offset hopefully and the real impact will be the stock-based compensation that could be if things rebound and go, as one would expect, could be in the range of 40, $50 million increase.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, offset by a reduction in pension expense in the range of 60 to $70 million.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Let's see, on the productivity opportunities you tend to run with a lot of different &#x2013; I usually think you guys having a full productivity pipeline, and I'm wondering if, Hunter, maybe you could highlight some of the biggest productivity drivers and what the timing might be for when we would see an impact from some of those things in 2008, 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think three areas I'll mention on a short-term basis and one of a longer-term nature. One is the &#x2013; by year-end, we'll have the new yard at Memphis fully implemented. We will update within the next two months. We'll be quote, "humping cars there," which will have a nice positive impact on terminal expense that we've talked about earlier at Battle Creek, Fon du Lac and Chicago, Stevens Point. So that's one initiative. The continuing initiative and taking advantage of the long-sighting program, which is near completion, it's probably 85% done, but it's just now fully kicking in. That's another one I would mention. There's a lot of them going on in mechanical and smaller, but the largest one is clearly where we're working and spending a lot of time and resources is with the EJ&amp;E transaction in Chicago. And if that &#x2013; I think the more we talk about and the more we learn and the more we look at that transaction, it offers &#x2013; every day I see more upside opportunity than we initially saw in the transaction. So, Tom, that's just an example of two or three things there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Memphis and the long sighting, where would we &#x2013; where would that tend to show up in the P&amp;L? Is that like &#x2013; is that a head count where that would show up or equipment rents or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it wouldn't show up in equipment rents. It shows up basically in labor productivity, predominantly the most of it. I don't &#x2013; I'm not kind of a head count person; I'm more of an expense person. We &#x2013; I don't get expense as a head count when I see expenses down, but we've contracted in a lot of engineering work that we're doing ourselves, which was one of the reasons, I think, that we developed a relationship that we were able to get an agreement quickly with the steel workers and get 85% ratification for it. And then we've talked about the replenishing of the predominantly older work force and the overlap when we do the training. So that will wash itself out. So that's where those two things &#x2013; and that's just two of many. We've gotten new locomotives and we're starting to see the opportunity with the fuel productivity, with the locomotives. That will get better. And to some degree, it's difficult to take advantage of those opportunities when you're looking out here at 35 degree weather in Western Canada, 35 below in Western Canada and you're having to run adjusted to weather. But I can tell you this, as I said earlier, since we got the little setback with 2007, with those issues that I mentioned, we're back where we were prior to that and I think you'll see the productivity metrics make a pretty substantial move forward.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk a little bit about pricing? I know Jim talked about going forward 4 to 5% pricing, but if I look at the reported yields for the quarter, on a mix-adjusted basis down 6%, can you talk about what there is FX, what's fuel, what's pricing, what's mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at the quarter's results and you adjust the volumes for this significant pick up in iron ore, our volumes in the quarter were relatively flat, which, I believe, if you look at the other business groups with forest products being down as much as it was, the other businesses did very well. And then you add to that, and the price impact in the quarter you'll see that the prices are pretty much in line with what we have been talking about in the past of around 4%. Going forward into '08, we'd expect that trend to continue and would be higher than, as I said, slightly higher than 4%, between 4 and 5 in '08.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what makes you confident it's going to be higher, what areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our pricing is pretty much consistent from business unit to business unit, and what makes me confident that pricing in '08 is going to be good is because most of our contracts, number one, are two to three years in duration. So I have anywhere between 66 and a third of our business that is already priced for next year and that is in the range that we have talked about in the past, 3 to 4%. So those prices are already locked in for '08 and the price take that I am getting on my current contracts is higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are there any significant long-term legacy contracts coming up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't have any long-term legacy contracts. All our business, as I say, is contracts for about two to three years, and therefore &#x2013; and we have been pricing in these ranges for the last five to six years and steadily improving on our price take, which has been reflected in our yield numbers in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we have got 4%, let's call it, pricing in the quarter. Let's reset the volumes to zero based on your discussion. What takes us to minus three in revenue from there? Can you take me through fuel as a positive, mix as a negative and FX as a negative, how do we get from positive four to negative three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the reported fourth quarter revenue number was zero. So the impact is the exchange, yes, so that is the difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am guessing that there is some year-over-year fuel positive based on how much surcharges there have been and so forth, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. So there would be a positive impact in the quarter from price. There would be a positive impact in the quarter from fuel. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the fuel part of that 4% or is that separate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that would be separate from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you have to recognize, Ed, is that the fuel is not as large as you would expect because there is a two-month lag in our fuel surcharge. So in effect, our &#x2013; I think the fuel surcharge, WTI price during the quarter was nowhere near the $91 spot price that we pay for our expense. Year-over-year fuel surcharge was up slightly. Price is in line with what Jim is discussing and the volume was up slightly. So 4% price, 1 to 2% for fuel and 1% for volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that is helpful. I appreciate that. Can you talk a little bit about Prince Rupert in terms of numbers? In the past, you have talked about a run rate of 100 million for '08. Are you on line for that and what could take you above that in terms of having other boats besides Costco? Where are you in those negotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think Bob has given some guidance there in terms of that number and that would certainly be the number that we are expecting in '08. Upside to that would be two factors. One would be having another customer make that a protocol and we are continuing to dialog with all the major steamship companies as well as their customers about calling there, and are optimistic that we will have another customer make that call as well as the outlook for the existing customer consortium which is Costco, Hanjin, and Yang Ming who are all in on the vessel rotation to increase their volumes, and we are in dialog with them about them potentially doing that as well. So either one of those scenarios will bring our outlook for the year up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what are you seeing on exports back through Prince Rupert, any business yet filling the backhaul ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in various different commodities. The backhaul  opportunities that we have talked to ranging from machinery to paper products to pulp, working with a number of different customers today on non-traditional products, bulk products that have the potential to move via container, so we are working hard there and we are working with Costco, and those opportunities are coming on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a last follow-up on that, does that 100 million include backhaul  or is that gravy if that develops?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be gravy. But again, we are certainly not &#x2013; I'm not confident enough or bullish enough to say that I'm going to be 100% balanced here in terms of backhaul . This backhaul  business is going to take us a while for us to develop. We are in the process right now of just building a facility in Chicago where we can fill containers with the derivative product from the ethanol production. We have signed some arrangements with customers to be bringing product in there. But again, that's probably &#x2013; we're maybe going to be 10% of the head haul volume filled going throughout 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm testing your guidance. Do you see sort of the earnings growth evenly spread out over the year or are you betting on a recovery in volume in the second half and a slow start to the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If your question is the EPS outlook and how it shapes up by quarter, the first quarter you have to recall last year was when we had the labor disruption. So we're going to have an easy comparison in the first quarter. And then after that, we are seeing the business basically evenly &#x2013; the back-end should be better just because we're expecting the economy to come out of the slumps that we are seeing in some of the sectors in terms of weakness. But some of the initiatives, the growth of Rupert, the bulk business, all of that is stuff that we can deliver in the front-end of the year because it's in front of us. We just have to be fluid and run the railroad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no &#x2013; it doesn't require you &#x2013; it doesn't &#x2013; your assumption, your guidance don't require a sort of recovery in economic activity in the second half to get to your numbers. It's just a case of executing on the business plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say we do assume that the back end will be &#x2013; is when the economy will rebound. But in terms of our EPS, the first quarter is an easy comparison and we have initiatives to have good growth throughout every quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question has to do with equity-linked compensation. Can you give us a sense &#x2013; is that tied to a US dollar calculation or is it the Canadian dollar, and do you &#x2013; how does it work? What's the sensitivity? So if CN stock goes up $1 a share Canadian, how should we budget the equity-linked compensation adjustment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, I would have to give you the model on the basis of all of those factors. It is quite difficult to give you a rule of thumb because it does indeed depend on the Canadian dollar stock price or the US dollar stock price. But by and large, you're not too wrong if you assume that $1 increase in the stock price would give you about 6 or $7 million of expense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally, just with reference to the fourth quarter, so I can get it straight, can you repeat the number that you stated in terms of sort of the comp adjustment down versus bonuses versus the equity-linked component?</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Claude Mongeau:&gt;: We answered that for the full year. Now, you want it for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because it was in the fourth quarter that you had the big change in terms of the labor expense line. I was wondering whether...</p>
          <p>&lt;A &#x2013; Claude Mongeau:&gt;: Well, let me put it to you this way. Our expenses on a year-over-year basis in labor were down 134 million. I would say that the stock-based compensation and the fact that we do not accrue for a bonus in the fourth quarter would explain about 110 of that. So that gives you an order of magnitude.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wonder if you could comment on the EJ&amp;E and just give us any idea how optimistic you are that you'll be able to expedite that environmental review relative to the time line that was outlined by the STB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure that they defined the timeline of the environmental review. I think they made, in my view, an error when they stated in the press release that it said it could take 2 to 3 years. I think that is a little ridiculous in my view. If you go back to the past deals, I think Conrail deal, which involved many, many states, 17 states and billions of crossings and we are talking about Chicago. I don't think that the environmental review will be that long. Now, what is long? I would hope that within a year from when this &#x2013; activities were started that we could get some kind of response in that regard. I think overall, I think from an economic stand point, from a competitive standpoint, I think there are virtually no problems with the transaction. I know a few people that are opponents of it. So our issue is clearly going to be when you cut through the environmental, it's effectively a crossing issue in Western &#x2013; the Western suburbs of Chicago, around the western perimeter. If you looked at the total traffic in the greater Chicago area, there will be fewer trains across crossings. And if you looked at the overall environmental impact fairly for the greater Chicago area, there will be a significant improvement. Now, it's going to be for others to deal with and we'll fight the good fight here and try to decide that trains should move out of the inner city away from McCormick Place, away from Soldier Field, away from Kaminski Park, away from the interstate that it is not much better and more efficient and adds to capacity to go around the perimeter of Chicago. So I guess overall I'm optimistic. I don't want to put any number or percentage on it. I think the transaction will be approved. I do think that there could be an issue with the link that could cause us a problem or there could be an issue that if somebody says we've got to spend a lot of money to mitigate some of the circumstances that we would have to review that very carefully.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Claude, I wonder if you could speak about the dollar impact that the inherent lag in your fuel surcharge program would have had on your bottom line in Q4? Is that something that you can quantify?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, roughly speaking. I think the &#x2013; the &#x2013; the foreign exchanges we do disclose is about $0.05 or five penny during the quarter and the fuel lag is, I would say, was in the range of $25 million during the fourth quarter. That is basically paying a higher fuel price on a higher spot price than our fuel surcharge because of the two month lag.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; I guess one &#x2013; just clarification for Claude on the &#x2013; on the, and I know you've had several questions already, but just in my own mind on the &#x2013; on the labor and compensation side. In terms of the incentive comp, is the lack of bonuses or the accrual, is that just a fourth quarter phenomenon or did you actually reverse accruals for prior parts of the year in terms of how fourth quarter was versus what total year bogies were? Or was it just a fourth quarter phenomenon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We adjust our accrual throughout the year, but in the fourth quarter there was no reversal for prior quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, there wasn't a true up for quarters one through three?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, just wanted to clean that up. And the other question I had, maybe for Jim, was just and you've answered a lot of questions already, obviously on the top line side, but, you mentioned obviously the &#x2013; the one paper producer in Eastern Canada and I don't know what caused that, but I'm just wondering are you seeing any lagged impact from the much stronger Canadian dollar. Because a lot of times goods and trade, we'll see an impact on a lag basis to what was a sharp change in currency exchange rates and I'm just wondering when you look at your book of business, are you seeing some lagged impacts on your volumes, and I'm assuming paper would be one of those, that are affecting the volume outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the &#x2013; Scott, I think the issue with paper is clearly &#x2013; our paper customers in Eastern Canada are clearly impacted by the dollar, but it's more to do with the overall decline in the market for papers, which has put them under pressure now for quite some time, and so in a very difficult business market to begin with, really not associated with the economy for the dollar to have come along and appreciated at this point in time, has made it difficult for them and there has been production cutbacks and curtailments in many locations by many producers in an attempt for them to adapt to the declining market. Some of those production cutbacks have been positives for us and some of them have been negatives for us. From a dollar perspective, that is about the only area at this point in time where I could point to and say where any of my customers are having difficulty there from the dollar. The lumber and panel decline is associated with the housing issue, not the dollar. On the other hand, I have an outlook for the movement of iron ore right now, because US steel manufacturers have looked at raising their production output because of the lower US dollar, which is making US manufactured products right now much more competitive globally. So my outlook right now is very optimistic, and is not dampered in any way, shape or form by the dollar.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on that last question, maybe if you could just comment on the flow of traffic within North America as a result of the Canadian dollar strengthening, but more on the US weakening and be more active in the export market and the flows of volume out of <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take a look at the business opportunities that we've talked about, not only just this quarter in <mark type="inaudible" />, but in the past, we've worked very aggressively to make sure that our company was positioned not to be reliant on one specific market. And so the opportunities that we're talking about are clearly not dependent upon strengths of the US economy or exchange rate in Canada and the US. Western Canadian will commence to offshore, sulfur will then set to offshore. Potash movements from Canada to US driven clearly by record price and a 25% increase in corn production. As I just mentioned iron ore volumes moving into the US &#x2013; lower US dollar, so our traffic flows are very diversified, are very dependant not only on one commodity, but not dependant on one commodity, but not dependant upon any one regional commodity or economy. So I'm very optimistic when I look at my portfolio of business and I see my Intermodal business on the West Coast increasing not only at the New Port, but in the Vancouver, where the predominance of that is coming into the Canadian market, that I am realistically comfortable of that we will not be an impact that maybe as much as some other railroads might be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then, second question just as far as the STB ruling on the new rail-cost formula for regulated freight. How big of a concern is that internally and looking forward, is there any concern about that spilling over into non-regulated freight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't obviously <mark type="inaudible" /> that the exact calculation and in a way that <mark type="inaudible" /> the cost of capital. We think our comp, you should be a better judge at that, actually higher than where they came out, but I think the impact is going to be lagged in the &#x2013; the deep &#x2013; I think people recognized it, whether it's in Canada or the US. We are in a world where there's a lack of infrastructure and if railroads on a private sector base <mark type="inaudible" /> builds up that infrastructure, I think over time.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Bill MacKenzie from TD Newcrest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your service levels and if you take a look back at 2007 how you feel you did from a service perspective with your customers if you have any metrics you might be able to share in terms of on-time originations or just general customer service satisfaction levels and what are the &#x2013; if there are any particular end markets that you're really focusing on for 2008, in those particular areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think overall our service was very good. I mean we measured internally. We used to talk about a lot, but we still measured each one of our non-Bulk carloads as a trip plan. It's measured in hours, not days. And overall we did very well. Now clearly during the weather problems of the first quarter and the work stoppage, you might say that service was not up to our normal levels. But after we came out of the work stoppage and through the second, third, fourth quarter, until we reached a point here with the weather here in the fourth quarter, with first of the year, that as a result of freezing weather, our service has been very good. The issue that you have with service is this: If you have a problem defining what's good service. We have and its &#x2013; I'm trying to learn a new phenomenon. In Canada, when they talk about service, they talk about you have bad service when you raise price. So you got to define service. Our transit times, the condition of our equipment, the timeliness of our switching, the advancements we've made in new equipment in capital, our switching is far better than any of the competition, in our view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. Thank you. And then, Jim, maybe to get into forest products a little bit more for 2008, we've been hearing about more facility closures. I'm just wondering if you have a volume expectation for forest products on an RTM or a carload basis for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, where we are right now, I would think that we would see in the Forest Products Business unit down 3 to 4% in terms of carloads for the full year. It's kind of where we expected to be. After a year where we &#x2013; after this year we were down 13 or so percent for the group, so obviously starting to, as I said earlier, bottom out in terms of some run rates here, and hopefully see some optimism as we move closer to the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, and then just one last question. Claude, in terms of the balance sheet, and you guys have been pretty aggressive buying back stock. You've been spending more money than what you're forecasted for free cash flow for next year. I'm just wondering how sustainable is the current buy back activity and if there are any particular debt thresholds that if you were to hit, would result in you guys being a little bit less aggressive from a buy back perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've been quite consistent in our approach. We adjust as we go based on our performance and strategic agenda, but effectively what we have said is that we are going to focus on a coverage ratio and we have an ability to lever up, which we have in the &#x2013; during 2007 to some extent, but we are still in process of doing that levering up to a point where we target 2.2 times EBITDA coverage as a target going forward. I think we finished the year just under 2.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just on the &#x2013; just further on the buy back, in terms of your guidance, what are you presuming in the second half? Are you going to keep it at the elevated level, or should we have it going back down to say 5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we have a program for the &#x2013; the current program is for 33 million shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at year-end we were basically just a little bit past the midway with something like 17.8 or 17.7 million shares that have been purchased, and I think borrowing unforeseen circumstances, our expectation that we will complete the program between now and next July.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in July, Claude, would you continue on at the 33 million rate or would you step it back down and let's say a 5% buy back again? In other words, what have you presumed in your guidance &#x2013; in terms of the bottom line guidance, have you presumed as of July of next year, in '08, that you've moved back down to say, the 5% level or are you considering just continuing at the current levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know what, we'll reserve our judgment in terms of that decision when we make it with our board in spring to early summer timeframe, but I would say to you that effectively, the first six months of buy back really tell the story in terms of the year over year impact, and it's our expectation at this point that our use of free cash flow will go towards share buy back, and without putting the pinion on exactly how many shares, we expect to the buying back in the second half of 2008 as well as the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and do you have discretion on the program that you can come into these markets at these levels and buy back more shares in let's say a dollar cost average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have to be buying back on an ongoing basis, but we are opportunistic, and clearly when we see the stock price that are coming down, we modulate accordingly, but we are buying throughout the year within the guidelines and what is available to us on a flow basis particularly when buying in the US markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. And switching gears over the Rupert, Jim. I have heard rumors that there is some pilotage or tugboat costs that might be a little higher than let say on the US ports or in Vancouver, how do you, I mean, obviously US ports have obviously raised a lot of costs, as well, how do you benchmark against the US guys, Tacoma, Seattle, Long Beach, I mean is the Canadian &#x2013; is Rupert at a competitive advantage on the cost for that port?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the port there is very productive and competitive and from a complete logistics chain significantly a better service and lower cost than the other West Coast ports.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last one, Jim, did you say that you have locked in about two thirds of the price increase for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be correct, the way our contracts are structured, if I have a three year contract that I signed, it has already been priced.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is a possibility realistically, to some degree some of that is, we have a little leeway with the 100 million that we said when we purchased it, we have talked to every community, just about every community its not every community. That is going to be affected by this that we had a issue and we have encouraged them to have a dialog with us, we are prepared to do the right thing, but there is a limit, so could there be a place where we have to spend x amount more to help that situation, and help them more ways than one, because if there's for an example rate separations, there's a formulas now that says how much is paid by the state and how much is paid by the Feds and how much is paid by the railroads, and if there are separations that's a safer situation, but yes, we are prepared to step up and if we need to spend a little more in capital to relief some of those situations we would be happy to take it under advisement.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. Just on the union contracts, Hunter, you've been pretty successful since the first quarter last year in negotiating some union contracts. On the horizon 2008 can you give us color on the meaningful union contracts that you have coming up, and are you finding it, given that you went the full, all 10 rounds with the UTU and successfully came out of that, is that giving you a little bit more, you call it, leverage on those negotiations? Clearly they're never easy to do, but are you finding the push back or the negotiation process on a relative basis any easier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, a couple comments. I think it's fair to say that I don't want to leave anybody out. We've got a couple of very small numbers as far as a number of people represented in 2008. It's just handfuls. So effectively by the &#x2013; with the steel workers, with the IBEW, and with the UTU, and the US, the big ones are out of our way until the end of '08, and that would be the engineers that would be coming up. Now, we have a philosophy that says we're not going to be able to negotiating table unless we have the ability to say no, and I don't think anybody should. We want to be reasonable. We want to try to make fair deals, but if we're placed with the same situation we were last time would be with the UTU, and I hope we don't get to that situation, we are prepared to say no, and we're prepared to run the railroad.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I'm confident that we can come up with a settlement, and if not, you know, I thought it was a little unfortunate in the whole process that we get the binding arbitration that was mandated to us by the government. But they've basically set a pattern here, I mean, they give one organization 333, and status quo and everything else, that's about all there is. Unless there's some negotiations on both sides, and that's not, it's fighting for a lot of people. So I think we've come a long way. Our labor relations group has done a stellar job the last several years, particularly on the non-op side of the shop, and we'll get there with the operating crafts. It's a bigger chain, and it's something that is more difficult to get done, and I have to remind myself with the first hourly agreement in the US, it took us nine years to get it ratified. So, we have to be, and I'm talking to myself when I say, a little patient. But I think most of the labor turmoil, hopefully, is behind us and everything will be &#x2013; go forward in a positive manner.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great to hear. And just on how you continue on the labor, Claude, you mentioned on the &#x2013; on the &#x2013; the pension topic that you're going to get some relief in the range of the 60 to 65. Just wondering what your assumptions are for interest rates, given &#x2013; we've seen a big 75 basis cut &#x2013; basis point cut today, equity markets are choppy, is there anything in &#x2013; on the horizon in terms of top-ups of defined benefit pension plans in the event that you have to change your &#x2013; change your assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually our expense for 2008 is set on the basis of the discount rate at December 31st of 2007. So that one we know and so &#x2013; and we know that the expense benefit is actually, a little bit more, it's closer to 65 to $70 million in terms of year-over-year decline. Now, next year's discount rate, which will be set on December 31st of 2008 would have an impact on our 2009 expenses. But that one is just basically premature to try to judge where that's going to go. It's a function of that discount rate, investment return and a whole bunch of other items, which are too difficult to predict a year in advance.</p>

          <p>You've given us some sensitivities in the past, I guess they still hold?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A last question just on that the CapEx that you &#x2013; you had budgeted 1.6 million for 2007, it came in at 1.387. Now, you're moving us to 1.5, sorry, go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Walter, I think you &#x2013; we always guide on a growth CapEx basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the net CapEx is after leases and so capital leases, which are basically non-cash CapEx, so we have guided at 1.6 billion for 2006, we came in at 1.6 billion throughout 2007, I'm sorry and we did come in at around 1.6 billion, if I exclude the fourth quarter impact of the capital lease for Central Station. And next year, we are guiding to 1.5 billion on a growth basis and that includes the upgrades for the ANY.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I just wanted &#x2013; that clarifies, but the decline that you we &#x2013; you are budgeting compared to 2007, given that &#x2013; I presume EJ&amp;E is in there &#x2013; you have your higher, presumably higher revenue base and so on, are you &#x2013; is there anything that you've decided not to go ahead with or any projects that you're scaling back on or is it just a function of being a little bit more targeted as you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the function of being targeted, but also a function of a number of the large-scale projects that have been a main thing for CN over the last several years are coming to an end. I would give you as an example, our significant investments in citing extensions. We still have fill-in here or there, but we're basically for the most part completed there. So we're targeting where it matters and we're also sensitive to the general economic environment and so we think that's going to be sufficient to focus on what we have to do and drive productivity and growth and a safer plant.</p>
