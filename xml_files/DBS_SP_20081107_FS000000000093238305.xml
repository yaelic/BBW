          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to DBS Group Holdings Third Quarter Results Announcement. We'll be joined today on our panel here by our CEO, Mr. Richard Stanley; our CFO, Ms. Chng Sok Hui. We will also have our colleagues in Hong Kong; Amy Yip, the CEO of DBS Hong Kong together with Chung Li Chu who is our CFO of DBS Hong Kong and T.K. Chan.</p>
          <p>This quarter we are adopting a slightly different format whereby this session is dedicated to Singapore Media and the Wireless based in Singapore and after this session then we will move over to have a session specifically with our colleagues in Hong Kong and Hong Kong Media. We've done so, so that you can ask more targeted questions and the session can move along more seamlessly.</p>
          <p>Okay, on this note, I invite Rich to come up and make the opening remarks. Thanks Rich.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Some months ago, I said that this financial crisis was the worst I had ever seen. For all my pessimism then, I could not have imagined the extent of the turmoil that would follow on Wall Street nor the additional stress that will be placed on the world's banking system. In the third quarter alone, we witnessed many unprecedented events. The two biggest mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as well as the global insurer AIG have been nationalized. The five independent Wall Street securities firms that once dominated Wall Street have been reduced to two, both of whom have changed their legal states of that of commercial banks. Markets around the world have seen billions of dollars wiped out. A tectonic shift is taking place in the financial markets; one that is vastly reshaping the entire industry.</p>
          <p>Against this extremely challenging backdrop DBS reported today third quarter 2008 earnings of SG$402 million, including a charge we took to compensate certain customers who bought High Notes 5 or Constellation Notes. Chng Sok Hui, our CFO will take you through the numbers in greater detail but first let me share some of my thoughts.</p>
          <p>Since the collapse of Lehman in September, our clients who invested in High Notes 5 and Constellation Notes have faced very trying times. These products were sold to 4,700 customers in Singapore and Hong Kong who invested a total of SG$360 million. We've been very concerned for our customers. So from day one, we spared no effort in being open and transparent with them.</p>
          <p>I've seen our RMs, grown men and women, in tears as they broke the news to their clients. Rajan Raju, Head of Consumer Banking and his team have been in the firing line time and time again, as they met with hundreds of investors in multiple dialog sessions this past fortnight. Our people have been working night and day to identify cases where DBS standards were not met so they can decide quickly on issues of compensation. We are reviewing all cases and also fast tracking the resolution of vulnerable cases. Gerard Ee has been appointed as independent external consultant to oversee the complaints handling process in Singapore.</p>
          <p>KPMG has helped to asses our internal valuation process. In the last few weeks, we have tried our best to resolve the matter expeditiously. We will continue to do the right thing balancing our fiduciary duties to customers and shareholders alike. This episode has been extremely painful for us. While High Notes 5 investors represent one-fifth of the entire Lehman impacted investor base in Singapore, DBS has bore the brunt of investor anger and disappointment.</p>
          <p>When I took up the job of DBS CEO six months ago, I knew the role and standing DBS had in Singapore. This has been amplified by the events of the past several weeks and it's only served to affirm what I believe; Singaporeans and even customers in other markets see us as a steward of their hard earned savings and wealth. Our customers, many of whom have been banking with us for their entire lives, have immense faith in us and hold us to a standard of accountability, equal to our privileged position as a leading bank here. With this privilege comes responsibility, and we take this responsibility very seriously. Let me thus assure you that DBS would never knowingly do anything that will hurt our clients.</p>
          <p>When we sold the structured products over a year ago, the world was a vastly different place, one characterized by high investor confidence and low interest rates. Everywhere, people were seeking higher yields. As a financial institution, we believe we were serving our customers by facilitating and structuring High Notes and Constellation Notes, with high quality names. These are names that no one ever thought would default. The lessons we have learnt from this whole episode will be reflected in our sales and business practices going forward.</p>
          <p>One of the first things we will do is step up training of our relationship managers and our clients to meet client needs, with an emphasis on building and maintaining long-term relationships. I have no doubt that when this is all over the industry will draw new standards. The bar will be raised and DBS will be a leader in raising these standards.</p>
          <p>While, DBS has a leadership position in Singapore and is among the leading banks in Hong Kong, I believe there is still huge untapped potential for us to grow our franchise in these markets. In Singapore, we reaffirmed our commitment to POSB customers launching a slew of new initiatives to meet their banking needs. This includes 50+ Tuesdays which extends special privileges to our customers aged 50 and above. POSB and the Singapore Sports Council recently joined hands to launch the POSB Everyday Champions Award to recognize everyday individuals and organizations that have consistently gone beyond their call of duty and responsibility so that others can enjoy sport and grow through sport.</p>
          <p>This week, Enterprise Banking in Singapore launched the DBS World Business Card, a premier credit card that recognizes the success of SME leaders and helps them navigate challenges presented by the current global economic turbulence.</p>
          <p>We also continue to grow our footprint in the growth markets. In the third quarter, we launched DBS Taiwan, with 40 new branches; we also opened six branches in Indonesia, four in India and continued our China expansion. We remain committed to these markets and more.</p>
          <p>During this quarter we've also taken measures to reposition DBS, so we can be leaner and meaner and be more responsive to market changes. This is especially imperative as we enter into a period of slower economic growth. We have made some organization improvements and will continue to do so to further enhance our productivity and efficiency.</p>
          <p>Let me elaborate, from 1st October we made some high-level management changes in DBS. Jeanette Wong, who was our CFO for the past five years, now heads the newly formed Institutional Banking Group, which encompasses our specialized corporate and investment banking unit, our enterprise banking units and our global transaction services businesses. Jeanette also oversees all geographies in the Group's portfolio, excluding greater China.</p>
          <p>Chng Sok Hui previously Head of our Group Risk Organization is now our CFO. A career DBS Banker, she brings 25 years of banking experience in finance, planning and risk management to this new role.</p>
          <p>Elbert Pattijn, formerly Head of Specialized Corporate &amp; Investment Banking, is our new Chief Risk Officer, a newly created position in DBS. By bringing our group risk and group credit teams together and working closely with the business units, Elbert will help the bank to manage risk holistically going forward.</p>
          <p>I believe these moves will help us leverage on cross functional skill sets, streamline decision making and allow us to be nimbler on the ground, at the same time optimize our capital returns.</p>
          <p>Lastly, to be a more streamlined organization, I believe we must run a tighter ship. We've been vigilant on costs but as the economy enters a more difficult and uncertain phase many financial institutions around the world and in Asia have made head count reductions. In line with the organizational improvements I spoke of earlier and to be more productive and efficient, we will restructure and streamline the organization. Regrettably, this has resulted in the need to reduce our workforce by 6% or about 900 people, primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong by the end of the month.</p>
          <p>In case you are wondering this restructuring exercise is not related to High Notes or Constellation, neither is it a reflection of our financial position. DBS remains strong and sound. Instead, it is a strategic imperative we have been reviewing for some time now in order that we may position the bank for the future. This is a painful decision for DBS and for me personally but something we've had to do in a difficult environment. We believe it will position us again for a great future.</p>
          <p>It has been an eventful six months for me at DBS, however my confidence in the future of DBS remains strong. The senior management team and I are also determined to do what it takes to run the bank in a world-class manner. This entails taking decisions that may not necessarily be popular but are prudent and will position as well for the future. DBS is financially sound and our fundamentals are strong. We will stay focused and continue to be disciplined in cost management. The tough measures we are taking now will enable us to confidently ride out this storm and emerge stronger when this global economic crisis is over.</p>
          <p>With that, let me pass the floor to Sok Hui to take you through our third quarter results in detail. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon everyone. And thank you for joining us. This quarter's results were affected by exceptional market dislocations. Fee income from capital market activities fell while our trading businesses recorded losses. Allowances also rose as we strengthen the balance sheet against increased macroeconomic uncertainties. The results also included a 17 million charge for compensation to certain High Notes and Constellation investors announced earlier. As a result, we reported net profit of 402 million, 38% lower compared to a year ago and 40% from the previous quarter. Profit before allowances fell by a smaller 7% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter. Mitigating the weaker revenues with disciplined cost management efforts expenses fell 11% from a year ago and 16% from previous quarter as we adjusted cost in line with revenues. The cost to income ratio improved to 41%, the lowest in five years.</p>
          <p>Outside of market activities, recent operating trends continue to hold up during the quarter. Net interest income increased with continued growth in loans and deposits. While non-market related fee such as loan syndication, trade products and card transactions were higher than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Earnings for the nine months fell 13% as allowances increased. Earnings before allowances were 1% lower as a 2% revenue decline was matched by similar reduction in cost. As with third quarter, the lower revenues were due to market activities. Net interest income as well as non-market fee income were higher, reflecting broad base revenue growth across regions and sectors.</p>
          <p>Net interest income rose 1% from the previous quarter to 1.07 billion. The increase was due to higher loan and deposit volumes. Net interest margin declined by 5 basis points from the previous quarter to 1.99% as we focused on liquidity management during a period of unprecedented market dislocations. We shortened the turn on interbank assets and switched to higher quality counterparties. This resulted in lower interbank use. We also attracted strong deposit inflows from customers which reflected well on our deposit franchise. The increases in deposits were flat by foreign currency fixed deposits, which resulted in a shift in our deposit mix towards higher yielding currencies. The average yield on customer loans was stable from the previous quarter with wider credit spreads offsetting the decline in market rates.</p>
          <p>Fee and commission income fell 8% from previous quarter and 22% from a year ago to 316 million. This amount is comparable to levels recorded in late 2006 and early 2007. The decline was due to stock broking, investment banking and wealth management fee income. Fee income outside of these capital market activities was little changed from the previous quarter and 10% higher than a year ago. We had a trading loss of 13 million, which included net losses from the unwinding of High Notes 5 and Constellation.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we reclassified 2.4 billion of corporate bonds as investments securities, which is with effect from 1st July, 2008. These securities were reclassified as there is no longer an active market for them. This reclassification has been done to be in line with the amendments to accounting standards but again that was approved by the Accounting Standards Board in Singapore on 30th October, 2008.</p>
          <p>The reclassification resulted in a 74 million gain to our trading results. There was no impact on equity as there was a similar 74 million reduction inavailable for sale reserves. Under the amendments full disclosure of the reclassified securities including changes to the market value has to be made at every reporting period until they mature or are disposed off.</p>
          <p>Staff cost decreased by 49%, from the previous quarter due to lower bonus accruals in line with lower revenues. Headcount rose 2% during the quarter with all the increases coming from Indonesia, Taiwan, China and India, as we continue to invest for future growth.</p>
          <p>Other expenses rose 23% from the previous quarter, due to the 17 million compensation charges for High Notes and Constellation customers. Excluding this item, non-wage expenses were stable as we managed controllable costs.</p>
          <p>This slide reflects a 3% depreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Hong Kong dollar from the previous quarter and a 7% appreciation from a year ago. Hong Kong's performance reflected a very challenging environment in the third quarter. Interest income was affected by a decline in margins, which fell from 2.16% a year ago and 1.92% in the previous quarter to 1.81% as prime-Hibor spreads declined. This offset the benefit of healthy loan growth, which rose 12% from a year ago and 3% from the previous quarter in Hong Kong dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income fell due to lower wealth management sales and capital market activities. In addition, there was a one-time gain of 10 million from the sale of MasterCard shares in the previous quarter that was not repeated.</p>
          <p>The increases in allowance was due to higher specific allowances for SMEs and private banking clients. The NPL rates in Hong Kong stood at 1.4%, little change from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Non-performing assets rose 4% during the quarter to 2.05 billion, as non-performing debt securities increased. The amount of NPLs was stable while the NPL rate fell slightly due to a larger loan base. Our recognition of non-performing assets is conservative, 41% of our non-performing assets are still current in their payment of principal and interest.</p>
          <p>Our CDO portfolio was unchanged during the quarter. The changes from June were due to exchange rate movements. We increased the allowance coverage of our non-ABS investment CDO portfolio to 25% from 6% in the previous quarter. All of these are taken in general provisions which were taken as a result of prudential measure given increased macroeconomic uncertainties. All of the CDOs in this portfolio as still performing with 97% rated A or above. As an indication of the quality of this portfolio, we expect two non-ABS CDOs amounting to $100 million to be fully repaid in the near-term. When we paid our allowance, coverage is expected to rise to 30%.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have taken macro-hedges on U.S. 185 million of our non-ABS CDO exposure. We have been very conservative in making exposures for this portfolio given increased macroeconomic uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Cumulative allowances for all CDOs in the investment portfolio are in excess of the decline in their marked-to-market values. The marked-to-market decline in values have been significantly impacted due to reduced liquidity in the financial assets.</p>
          <p>In summary, the operating environment in the coming quarters is expected to be difficult. The impact of the turmoil in financial markets will be increasingly felt in the real economy. We face these challenges from a strong starting point. Our balance sheet is clean. With this quarter's allowances we have provided more than adequate coverage for our CDO portfolio. Over the past few years, we have grown loans in a prudent manner and have been careful about loan underwriting standards and concentrations.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is strong. Our capital ratios of 9.7% for Tier-I and 13.4% for total CAR provide us with sufficient room to capture growth opportunities. We have an established deposit franchise that ensures adequate liquidity for our funding needs without having to rely on wholesale markets. We have been extensively reviewing exposures to ensure that our various risks are well-managed, in terms of credit, liquidity, counterparty and market risk. We are comfortable with our exposures. We have built sufficient flexibility in our cost structure to be able to adjust cost in line with revenues. This discipline has enabled us to continue investing steadily in the emerging markets for future growth. Our broad base customer franchise has been performing well under current conditions and we will have the opportunity presented by the current uncertainty to strengthen our reputation and to build trust with our customers. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can you please elaborate on the 900 jobs that you said will be cut by the end of the month? Where are these cuts going to be made in terms of geography, in terms of business unit? Also, are they mainly junior staff, senior staff, and how much cost savings do you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Primarily it's across the board, across &#x2013; well, primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong, as I said, but across all businesses and functions and at all levels of the organization. And the results &#x2013; and the reason for this, these cuts, is really to allow DBS to be much leaner and more streamlined organization, which will benefit us for many years to come. We expect &#x2013; we have no plans to cut beyond this, but going forward we'll always be watching the situation and aim to run our business in a very efficient manner. But we felt this was necessary given the circumstances and given our recent reorganization.</p>

          <p>Hi, I'm Gabriel from Straits Times. Just a little follow-up from Conrad's question. Could you give a sense of &#x2013; after you announced, what was the morale like from the staff? I mean, what was their reaction and can we get a sense on what kind of severance they are going to get, a one month &#x2013; I mean, one year &#x2013; you know, one month or one year and &#x2013; ?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a <mark type="inaudible" /> at a large town hall this morning. We announced it. I have sent an e-mail out to the staff. It's hard for me to gauge reaction, because I've been busy in moving from there over to this event. Obviously this is a very difficult situation for the people that will be affected. We will provide severance and support in line with the market. In fact, we already &#x2013; we've announced that we will provide counseling and job outplacement services, we will treat people with dignity and respect. And we'll move on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is the first time that we're doing it broad base across all businesses, across all weekends, but predominately given that Singapore and Hong Kong are our largest markets, these are the markets that would be impacted the most.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sadly, this is as, you know, is something, which is not uncommon in the industry right now. Many banks across the world have announced staff cuts. And again, we felt we needed to do it now, treat people with respect and move on to the future.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I've been reading a lot about that as well. In fact, we are one of the 40 banks that form the syndicate of fund the Marina Bay Las Vegas Sands. Like you I follow the information from the United States in this regard. However, all signals I'm getting from the management of Las Vegas Sands is that they intend to finish the project and move on. So I have to accept what they say and I have seen in recent days a strong commitment to the project from the Las Vegas Sands people. As of now, up until now, all the equity commitments have been made. The project is proceeding apace. I do expect there to be a integrated resort in Singapore in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean as of now the project hasn't &#x2013; there's been no default. There's been no indication of default and like any loan that we would make, we'll sort of see &#x2013; gauge a situation. And if necessary make a provision, but we haven't done it. The project is still moving up &#x2013; moving along. The management of the group have expressed commitment to the project and so, as of &#x2013; at this point there is no need for any provision.</p>

          <p>Okay. Maybe more broadly, also following up on your loans &#x2013; at what part in your portfolio are you perhaps seeing some initial signs of stress loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's the areas we're watching obviously &#x2013; you'll see in the numbers, we're watching some of the private bank clients that have been affected by some of the leverage products that were sold. So, we are watching very closely, the SMB sector particular in greater China. But by and large the portfolio is strong and while we expect a slowdown in the real economy, it's already here, as of now we haven't seen any particular areas of stress beyond what I just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's have a question from the back here.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. Just to follow up to the Las Vegas Sands question, the government &#x2013; Singapore government FCB has <mark type="inaudible" /> has said that they will support the project, but is the bank in talk with the government in anyway and have they showed any &#x2013; have they said that they will support in a way financially something if default happens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not that I'm aware of and in fact I read the same information you do. There's been no particular contact between us and the government. And again, I, this is an important project for Singapore and I expect there will be a very nice integrated resort in Marina Bay in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, we've already made a number of payouts in Hong Kong and Singapore. Every case as per MAS regulations of a refund recommendation comes to me. So I reviewed numerous cases. We have paid some. I'm not prepared to disclose the number. It is not a huge number, I would say. It's a very small percentage of cases, but there were cases, as I said before, where the standard wasn't met, and we've stepped up and done the right thing. And we'll continue to do so. I also need to express pride in the way my team has handled this. We have been in the firing line repeatedly. We have certainly borne most of the attention while we're not the only financial institution that sold Lehman-related products. And again, I'm proud of the way we've stood up and we've addressed the people. And we will continue to do so. But, this is very difficult situation and I think DBS will be stronger for it when it's all over.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of <mark type="inaudible" />. Do you expect you could seek a little income from the products in the coming quarter , you have taken 25%? Anything that is a more reason to buy in the coming quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe the number of 70 million is adequate, that's how we booked it as such. And I believe that the provision on the non-ABS CDOs and CLOs is also adequate. We don't know what's going to happen in the future, in future quarters as, you know, sitting here in August, who would have predicted the events of the third quarter. So one never knows, but I believe we are well provided for in these two areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sok Hui, would you like to elaborate on the 25% provisioning on the CDOs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to reiterate what I've said, the portfolio is actually 97% rated A and better. And we expect repayments of 143 million &#x2013; US100 million &#x2013; to be back in the very near term, which will increase our coverage to 30%. In addition we've taken some macro hedges to the tune of US185 million or SGD264 million. So we believe we've been actually very conservative in the provisioning for this. As well I mentioned earlier marked-to-market for this portfolio we have a provision that exceeds this marked-to-market value &#x2013; marked-to-market losses.</p>

There's nothing we are aware of to say that there is any cause of concern, or any new information that we have to go back to our investors.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the early &#x2013; in the beginning of this statement, you guys mentioned that you're already reviewing some possible reclassification for the fourth quarter. Right? As of now you are reviewing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, we have actually reclassified the investments in our trading &#x2013; on the trading book on a marked-to-market basis through the investments securities. So they are now under &#x2013; classified under Available for Sale. So there is no further impact in the fourth quarter, because they are now considered Available for Sale instruments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Not those ones &#x2013; new ones?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other portfolio that's under review has no impact because we are reviewing the Available for Sale securities to see if some of them might be classified to loans and receivables given a change in the intention. But because they are classified as Available for Sale today, there is no direct P&amp;L impact at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But you don't &#x2013; not know, but you would have them in the first quarter results?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If there is any, it will be disclosed, but it is actually a change in the results, right? It is not a direct impact in the P&amp;L because AFS securities are not taken, the marked-to-market change is not taken through the P&amp;L. Right? So all marked-to-market instruments, which we intend to classify, have been made effective 1 July, 2008. Yeah?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel Stone from the Asian Banker. You mentioned that you've reevaluated the counterparties that you deal it. Could you go into a bit more detail? Does that mean that you've reduced the number of counterparties that you have relationships with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In fact, we've reduced and then we've increased, because the world is a very &#x2013; is an evolving place and governments have stepped up and guaranteed a number of counterparties, so it's a dynamic process. We review all the time as a regular course of business, but certainly this is a more &#x2013; there is a lot of turmoil and we are watching this every day. But we have cut the amount of counterparties. That's not uncommon in the industry. And we're obviously quite prudent and careful in where we place our funds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to check with you. I understand that all the banks are expecting demand for loan growth. Loan growth is slow in the coming months. You expect slower demand for loans, but are you also actively cutting back on lending or cutting back exposure in some areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are watching our exposures very, very carefully. Our loan book is still growing, but at a slower pace. And our intent is to support our best clients &#x2013; to support clients, we haven't stopped lending. We believe that this is a time where we'll see some winners emerging from this crisis. And we want to support them. I had spent &#x2013; I guess, 11 years ago, I was in the &#x2013; during the Asian crisis, in a past life we &#x2013; I have some experience in sort of seeing, there are companies that will succeed in the business, they'll succeed and people that won't. And our intent is to support the winners and to be very careful with people that will have more stress through this process. But we haven't stop lending, but certainly the growth in lending will slow.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I, sorry &#x2013; can I just check as well, you booked a trading loss of $13 million from the unwinding of Lehman Bank investment products during the quarter, it says in the press release here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I check that, is, has, have all of the Lehman linked investment bank &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've booked a &#x2013; there's a trading loss embedded in that number which include &#x2013; part of which is the cost of unwinding and crystallizing High Notes 5 and the Constellation Series. So the number that is embedded in, overall, represents the cost of the unwind and crystallization of these two products and that's it. It's done in the third quarter. I won't disclose the number, I know that's your next question, but it's part of the number. But I can assure you that we, in fact, lost money on these products beyond what our clients lost. In other words, we didn't make a profit, there's been some speculation that we've made money and took advantage. Our clients lost their money, yes, but we lost some money as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last question, sorry &#x2013; I just wanted to ask about the reclassification of the 2 billion loss of assets. Do you &#x2013; is it &#x2013; I'm not familiar with accounting standards, but is it possible that in the future that some of this reclassification be reversed? And also would you &#x2013; I understand that you're reviewing some more assets, but you don't know whether you'll take a further charge in the P&amp;L in the fourth quarter of regards to the new assets yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me clarify. We have the Held for Trading portfolio which we have completed the reclassification to Available for Sale in third quarter. The result is an additional gain of 74 million which we have taken in the third quarter. Henceforth, we are in the AFS portfolio and they cannot be reversed. All right? There is a change in management intention, they cannot be reversed. Okay. So that portfolio will stay in AFS. We also have some of our AFS securities that we are reviewing for potential classification to loans and receivables. But that is expected to have no impact on the P&amp;L because AFS securities are actually taken &#x2013; the marked-to-market changes taken through equity. And there is actually minimal impact on the balance sheet. So you should not expect any material change in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Back to the question on High Notes.

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will, we're not exiting the investment products business. That's very clear. So we will continue to just to sell a variety of products to our clients. However, a lot of lessons learned that we've had through this situation will be applying. I mentioned training our staff, we'll put enhanced controls on the, both the creation, the distribution and the targeting of the products, and this is &#x2013; this will happen in due course. We are now focused on dealing with the situation in hand, but I expect that coming out of this there will be a healthier but active market in investment products &#x2013; it's not going away.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We're, we've, we're not selling the High Notes Series and the Constellation Series but we have &#x2013; we're still distributing unit trusts. The basic products are still being &#x2013; still being sold and distributed and again once the situation is &#x2013; once the dust settles, we'll, we will be coming out with more products but under a &#x2013; say a, as with the industry, a higher standard.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Mr. Stanley. I just wanted to check, if I can just to follow up on Kevin's question. The thing is you did well in your deposit base. Your deposit base has grown this quarter. I mean, in a way, there was this flight to safety away from foreign banks. And now foreign banks are having all these high, attractive interest rates and at the same time the government has issued a blanket guarantee on all deposits. So do you think that will put some pressure on your deposits going forward? And in that sense, will there be a need for more capital raising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe there'll be an impact on our deposits. I'm confident on our client base. We have well over 4 million clients. We have a long history. I think in spite of the challenges we faced with High Notes and Constellation, I believe that as we go forward, we'll come out with even stronger set of relationships with our clients, based in part upon the way we're handling it. So, no, I am confident that our deposit base is ever, you know, ever more solid and we will continue to work on improving our service and providing the right products for the right people in all the markets in which we do business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I have perhaps the last two questions, Kevin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is regarding the layoffs, could you break down the 900 into Singapore and Hong Kong? And also following up on the High Notes and all those, has DBS been hit by lawsuits either in Singapore or Hong Kong, and if so how many?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No lawsuits, as yet. As far as the breakdown, no I do not &#x2013; I will not disclose that. And &#x2013; but I can tell you that most of it &#x2013; the vast majority is in Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Kevin just to clarify the layouts &#x2013; the layoffs are not only in Singapore and Hong Kong, some of the other markets will also be impacted, but to a much lesser degree.</p>
