          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the EADS Conference Call regarding the Nine Months 2008 Earnings Release. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for questions following the presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the floor over to your hosts Louis Gallois, Hans Peter Ring and Nathalie Errard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS's Nine Months 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Louis Gallois, our CEO and Hans Peter Ring, our CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions. This call is planned to last about one hour, but we will try to take as many questions as possible in the Q&amp;A session, which we will conduct after the initial presentation.</p>
          <p>It is also webcast to access on our home page with a special banner. Playback of this call will also be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service. The supporting information package was e-mailed to you this morning with slides, which we will now walk through and financial statements.</p>
          <p>Throughout this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor statement, which applies to this call as well. We believe you should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>Now, to Louis Gallois.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I recognize that this call occurs against the backdrop of extreme economic uncertainty. Impacts on economy and industrials are still evolving. Yet given the long lead times involved in our business, it is too soon to say what it means, beyond the normal cyclicality of our industry.</p>
          <p>The one word I will use to describe it is the current movement is resilient. By resilient, I mean we have the adaptiveness and flexibility to shape our enterprise in tougher times. It is clear that we still need to invest into new breakthrough products the market requires, over the long-term such as the A350. But it is also clear that we remain prudent and selective with new investments.</p>
          <p>So we continue to feel confident and at the same time, we continue quickly to re-shape our company for market challenges. Let me remind you some of the factors which make us resilient.</p>
          <p>We have a strong balance sheet with no refinancing needs in the short-term. Our backlog is valuable. Also commercial activity has slowed down. Our backlog is geographically diverse and our customers are still taking delivery of the aircraft and helicopters.</p>
          <p>Geographical diversity also limits our exposure to downward economic pressures. As you all know, we have suspended expansion of single aisle aircraft production. We are keeping production in line with demand to avoid a suppressive effect on profitability.</p>
          <p>Mid-term we are focusing on cash flow generation. You will see again that the legacy programs in the Defence, Space and Helicopter businesses are delivering above our expectations as these power ahead.</p>
          <p>To add to this picture, we also benefit from the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We are fully committed on delivery on Power8 and Power8 PLUS initiatives across the Group.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we are still grappling with changes on program execution, most of them with the A400M. As we will discuss later we are still not able to define the timetable for steps leading up to fly testing of the aircraft. Nevertheless, the A400M is a crucial Pan-European project.</p>
          <p>EADS has is broad array of suppliers and governmental customers share a common desire for success. I have been in touch with most of the customers after that I believe in the program and I believe we are on the road to a mutual effort to more realistically share the program risk as of the A400M. It is clear that the A400M nations and beyond that other new export customers need this aircraft to fulfill their tactical and strategic air transport missions over the next decades.</p>
          <p>There is considerable opportunity to re-basing certain aspects of our contract. We will discuss this further later in the call. So the next picture of -- is of a resilient company as I said. Resilience based upon our flexible manufacturing base, our continued stress on cost reduction, our geographic spread, our strong cash position with very low customer financing exposure and the ongoing commitment of our military and commercial customers, and above all our non-commercial businesses in Defence, Space in Eurocopter will continue to deliver strong contributions.</p>
          <p>These factors support our confidence in the face of further market uncertainty. On page two please remember that all forward-looking statements such as in our guidance are based on assumptions as conditions may change so may our projections and plans.</p>
          <p>We will now turn toward the main nine months 2008 business achievements, and we will follow with the Group and division performance, then I will close with discussion of our guidance.</p>
          <p>Now on to page four. Demand for EADS products remains robust. Despite the current market uncertainty our backlog continues to grow. At the end of September our backlog stood at 300 -- 3,800 units driven by roles in both commercial and Defence activities. The 3,800 units are concerning Airbus.</p>
          <p>Airbus booked 737 net orders this year, increasing its backlog. Eurocopter also provides a strong contribution, 605 orders were booked by the end of September. The backlog stands at nearly 1,600 units. Of our total backlog the Defence part continues to grow steadily representing around &#x20AC;57 billion.</p>
          <p>In line with strong demand and a growing order book, we have been steadily ramping up our production in a controlled way with notable results at both Airbus and Eurocopter. And you have seen that we have capped this ramp up and we have suspended the continuation of this ramp up.</p>
          <p>Airbus delivered 349 aircrafts in the first nine months, an increase of 19 compared to the same period last year. This includes 7 A380. Total program deliveries now amount to 9 for the A380, 10 very soon, including three heads of version with deliveries to Singapore, Emirates and Qantas.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter has achieved 404 deliveries, 85 more year-on-year including 29 LUH deliveries to the US army all either on time or ahead of schedule and 11 NH90. The fifth successful Ariane 5 launched in 2008 demonstrates continued ramp-up result in Space. With this launch Ariane achieved its 27th consecutive success.</p>
          <p>The strengthening of the dollar is confirmed -- sorry -- but its volatility requires us to maintain our strategy to become less dollar dependent. We will keep the momentum of Power8 to face this volatility in the more changing markets. We have made concrete achievements in spinning off our businesses and sites proving that we are able to implement our divestment strategy.</p>
          <p>We finalized the Filton wing manufacturing unit sale to GKN in the third quarter. In addition we have since completed the sale of Laupheim to Diehl/Thales and DAHER will take a majority share in Socata.</p>
          <p>This divestment will further strengthen our ability to concentrate on core business whilst creating strong suppliers for major aircraft components. And I remind you that we are in the process to creating Airolia in France and AeroTech in Germany with sites which are for the future &#x2013; which could be sold in the future, when the market conditions make that possible.</p>
          <p>Power8 PLUS also progresses with plans explained to social representatives. The &#x20AC;50 million required of headquarters and other division to complement &#x20AC;650 Airbus portion will result from cost reduction and industrial optimization.</p>
          <p>In addition a program called Future EADS is launched. It aims at a leaner organization at Group level and better integration mainly through shared services and will bring cost savings at a minimum level of &#x20AC;200 million in 2011/12.</p>
          <p>And last tangible steps toward globalization include the inauguration of A320 Family Final Assembly Line in Tianjin, marking our growing partnership with China.</p>
          <p>And now I leave the floor to Hans Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Louis. As Louis said before, I believe as well that we are resilient. Our order book strength, strong cash flow generation and solid balance sheet position provide tangible reasons to believe we can face this unstable economic climate.</p>
          <p>It is of course too early to assess the full extent of the financial crises, however, as yet our aircraft and helicopter businesses have only seen a limited impact whilst neither our institutional nor government businesses are seeing material effects at this stage.</p>
          <p>Tightened credit markets with expensive or lack of liquidity and the resulting slowdown in economic growth have over shadowed the US dollar recovery versus the euro and the reduction in oil price of approximately 50% since the summer months extreme.</p>
          <p>We remain resilient to these external shocks and have the means to weather this crisis. From today's point of view, EADS has no refinancing needs. We hold &#x20AC;12.9 billion in gross cash at the end of September and we have &#x20AC;1 billion in euro bonds that mature in March 2010. In addition, we have an undrawn credit facility of &#x20AC;3 billion fully committed by 36 banks. This facility has no financial covenants or Material Adverse Change clause.</p>
          <p>Moreover, our customer financing exposure is at its lowest level for 20 years. Despite these positive elements, we acknowledge that we are currently operating in a volatile market environment. EADS is of course not immune to the financial market shake up. We are aware that the economic crisis will affect us, our customers and our suppliers.</p>
          <p>We are closely monitoring our business, our customer base and supply chain and we deploy a balanced and conservative cash utilization policy. Customer financing which may be necessary will only be done selectively on a discretionary basis in line with our policy in the past and with clear limits.</p>
          <p>We have made several proactive decisions to face the financial turmoil head on. At Airbus, the Single Aisle ramp-up will be paused at rate 36, as we have said already, when achieved in December. For our long range Air Craft family we will be at 10 at the beginning of 2010.</p>
          <p>I have already stated that we are continuously monitoring our business environment. We will use the flexibility to adapt our production policy, as our environmental changes around us.</p>
          <p>This pause in production ramp-up bears no significant impact on our financial health. Our Power8 objectives are maintained and remain within our reach. We retain flexibility in manufacturing through temporary workforce and subcontracting.</p>
          <p>And now on to the next slide, on A400M. As Louis said, the A400M is facing significant issues. Unavailability of a committed and reliable schedule for the propulsion system, for the first flight, is compounding unresolved issues with equipment suppliers as well as equipment and systems integration, which are leading to further delays.</p>
          <p>Systems suppliers and EADS are struggling with technical challenges and extremely ambitious specifications. No reliable schedule is available as of today. Nevertheless, all parties involved, customers and suppliers alike, understand now the requirement to work altogether to get this complex program under control.</p>
          <p>We want to re-balance and change important terms to take into account its nature as a very complex military program. To close the nine-month's accounts we adopted a temporary accounting treatment in line with the IAS 11.</p>
          <p>The high level of uncertainty leads us to shift to early-stage accounting and suspend the milestone accounting. Therefore, the charge of &#x20AC;340 million taken does not reflect a complete new estimate of the loss at completion. Once, the situation becomes clear, we will resume the milestone accounting and update the provision in its entire scope.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the magnitude of the final adjustment will be dependent on the outcome of the A400M program, overall assessment, and of negotiations with customers and suppliers. Clearly, EADS has to cap its own liability on this program.</p>
          <p>Now, we move on to page eight, where we find the financial highlights. First, I would like to remind you that MBDA is now consolidated at 37.5% and nine months 2007 figures have been adjusted accordingly.</p>
          <p>In the nine months 2008, revenues grew by 7%. This increase reflects top line growth across all divisions. Higher deliveries in Airbus and Eurocopter and the volume ramp-up in Astrium and Defence all provided positive contributions.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the increase includes the shift to early stage accounting for the A400M program with a positive effect of &#x20AC;803 million. We will expand on the EBIT explanations shortly and I will emphasize the good underlying performance and the non-recurring charges.</p>
          <p>Order intake remains strong for the nine months, containing strong order flow from Airbus, Eurocopter and MTA for the tankers. Backlog remains at record levels, increasing 18% compared to yearend figures. The backlog is now benefiting by a strengthening dollar rate, due to the revaluation impact at the closing spot rate of 143 at the end of September versus 147 at the end of December 2007. The Defence order book grew by 5% to now &#x20AC;57 billion, driven mainly by the FSTA contract.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at our EBIT performance on slide nine. This slide demonstrates the underlying EBIT trend in stripping out non-operational and non-recurring items. Firstly we have explained to you the impact on the accounts of the shift to early stage accounting and the resulting reassessment of the A400M loss making contract provision.</p>
          <p>On this basis the reassessment to the LMC has been made, resulting in an additional charge to EBIT of &#x20AC;341 million at EADS and around &#x20AC;161 million at Airbus. Over nine months, the revised loss making contract on the A400 -- on the A380, sorry, amounted to &#x20AC;850 million. The increase in the third quarter is due to some higher recurring costs reflecting ramp up challenges.</p>
          <p>The main part of the provision update has been booked against inventory. You are aware that as long -- that as the dollar fluctuates, so to our loss making contract provisions that are revalued at the closing spot. The rebound of the dollar between the yearend spot rate which was 147 and that of the end of September which was 143 has led to a positive revaluation of all loss making contracts amounting to &#x20AC;265 million.</p>
          <p>The nine months benefited from a small positive temporary excess volume of matured hedges because those hedges were put in place before the A380 delivery shift of 2006. As communicated in H1, this positive effect has begun to reverse in the third quarter, as less hedging volumes matured compared to the exposure causing a negative phasing impact in the second part of the year.</p>
          <p>During the nine months, other one-offs include the dollar mismatch impact coming from the reversal of pre-delivery payments, the revaluation of trade liabilities, the sell-down and provision release of customer financing at Airbus, and a provision revaluation for Power8.</p>
          <p>Now up to slide 10. There we see that EBIT margin reached 6.9% in the nine months 2008. R&amp;D decreased to &#x20AC;1.8 billion in nine months 2008, but is expected to ramp up through the year to around &#x20AC;2.6 billion. The interest result mainly reflects a strong net cash balance through the nine months.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the other financial result deteriorated by around &#x20AC;50 million. This is mainly due to the unwinding of the discounts on provisions whose present value grows as we move towards their consumption. The depreciation of the capitalized dollar vanilla options premium and some impact mainly due to treasury swaps. These negative effects were partly compensated by a positive impact from the revaluation of dollar cash balances at the closing spot rate of 143 versus 147 on the dollar in December 2007.</p>
          <p>The earnings improvement leads to a tax expense of &#x20AC;567 million compared to a tax income of &#x20AC;178 last year due to some impairment of deferred tax assets in the UK. As stated in H1 our tax rate for the full year shows now -- should now be above 30%. On the bottom line it leads to a net income of &#x20AC;1.08 billion for nine months 2008, compared to a net loss of &#x20AC;705 million in the nine months period last year.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to the hedging slide, which is slide number 11. Despite the unstable financial climate we have maintained our hedging activities, increasing the pace of our hedging since the rebound of the dollar. In line with Group policy we have further increased our hedge book from 51 billion at year end to $64.9 billion.</p>
          <p>You are aware that our portfolio now contains forward, structured forward and plain vanilla euro call options. Some plain vanilla options were added during the summer period and the total amount now reaches &#x20AC;9 billion. Whilst &#x20AC;12.6 billion of hedges matured 26.2 billion of new hedges were done in nine months 2008, at an average rate of $1.46 per euro if we exclude the options. Regardless of the pace at which we hedge our activities, we always ensure, net exposure for the next two calendar years being more or less hedged. Mark-to-market value has decreased by &#x20AC;3.4 billion following the strengthening of the dollar, now amounting to &#x20AC;1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now turning to page 12, cash flow, in nine months 2008 is robust, as we can see on that slide, we finished the nine months with a net cash position of almost &#x20AC;9 billion which provides a solid liquidity base for our future.</p>
          <p>Gross cash flow from operations for the nine months was &#x20AC;2.3 billion delivered by a solid operational performance. It was weighed down by provision consumptions. The consumptions of the A400M provision for the non-recoverable part of the work in progress had a negative impact which is compensated in the working capital by the decrease in inventory.</p>
          <p>Aside from this adjustment, the strong improvement in working capital over the 9 months is attributable to strong advanced payments received across all divisions partially offset by a ramp-up in inventory.</p>
          <p>Ramp-up growth came across all divisions excluding Airbus. I would like to remind you that the payments for options premiums are reported in the working capital. And there was a cash-out of 300 million as we already reported.</p>
          <p>Inventory decreased at Airbus for the nine months compared to an increase last year, predominantly due to less work in progress for the A400M in 2000 -- than in 2007 and A380 deliveries.</p>
          <p>The inflow of pre-delivery payments was more favorable, particularly, for Airbus and MTA. Investing activities consumed &#x20AC;1.1 billion of cash in nine months 2008. CapEx at Astrium and Airbus was lower than last year. Saving effects and Power8 improvements contributed to the lower CapEx at Airbus.</p>
          <p>An additional benefit came from a positive net contribution from sell-down of customer financing assets compared to a cash-out in the first nine months of 2007. The line other includes the payments for acquisitions like PlantCML, the dividend of Dasso and the sale of our stake in Irkut.</p>
          <p>We expect CapEx to significantly increase in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow before customer financing has improved significantly to almost &#x20AC;2 billion at the end of September 2008 versus &#x20AC;168 million last year. Nevertheless, I must emphasis that we will be deploying cash towards settlements, restructuring expenses and CapEx in the last quarter and through 2009.</p>
          <p>We will now take into each division's performance and Louis is going to present you Airbus on slide 14.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans Peter. So far Airbus has seen very limited impact from the financial crisis. Our record backlog has a diverse geographical spread that can withstand an impact from slower growth regions. At the end of September, the backlog split was approximately 30% in Asia Pacific. The proportion held by leasing companies has increased, now representing 20%. 20% is in Europe and 10% each in the Middle East, North America and the rest of the World.</p>
          <p>During the first nine months, Airbus continued to book orders thanks to a balanced global marketing footprint and the great portfolio of product with improved pricing. I insist on that last point.</p>
          <p>As I said, deliveries remain at record level. I know you interest for the A380. In 2008, seven A380 have been delivered. It means nine globally for the program, achieving two new milestones in the Q3, with head of version deliveries to Emirates and Qantas.</p>
          <p>With exceptional maturity, I want to stress that, the first Singapore aircraft performed its one thousandth commercial flight in summer and celebrated its first anniversary of commercial entry into service in October having carried more than 700,000 passengers.</p>
          <p>Progress continues in the program ramp-up although it remains challenging. On 2008 I remind you we expect to deliver 12 airplanes. On 2009, we planned to deliver 21 airplanes because the preparation of Wave 2 was longer than expected, a couple of airplanes could shift to 2010.</p>
          <p>Revenues increased by 3%, despite the increased number of deliveries and a favorable volume mix overall growth was weighted down by dollar headwind and price deterioration and deliveries that will continue through 2009.</p>
          <p>Revenues include an effect from the shift to early stage accounting for the A400M program, reflecting airbus work share for &#x20AC;482 million. At the nine months EBIT has delivered a strong record rate versus last year due to the underlying profitability of A320 and A330 family deliveries and less exceptional program charges despite the Q3 charge taken on the A400M.</p>
          <p>The underlying business strength is partially offset by increasing recurring cost of the A380 program representing the ramp-up challenges we are facing. Back ended phasing of R&amp;D non-series cost and the reversal of excess temporary volume of hedging -- from hedging have weighted on the third quarter as anticipated. This trend should also be continued in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Hans Peter is going to walk you through the other divisions. Hans Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, at page or slide 15 with Military Transport Aircraft, we have already provided you with our situation on the A400M program. So let's move on to the nine months results. In the nine months 2008 the division's revenues increased 92% to 1.95 billion, this includes the A400M Power-on milestone which was in the first half. And the growth is driven by the shift to early stage accounting for the A400M program resulting in an uplift of &#x20AC;792 million and an increase in invoicing for the Tanker activity. Despite the new charge taken on the A400M program of &#x20AC;43 million EBIT has improved from a &#x20AC;144 million loss in nine months 2007 to less -- due to less exceptional charges taken than in 2007. A temporary delay in Medium and Light deliveries weighs on the nine months EBIT but deliveries will pick up in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We continued to see strong order momentum. The order book stands at almost &#x20AC;23 billion. We booked 20 MRTT for Tankers in the nine months with orders from the UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and two CN-235s, one each for customers in the US and in Botswana.</p>
          <p>As extensively covered the US Department of Defense has decided to cancel the current bid contract for the US Tanker. The contract remains in force pending formal notification. We expect the next US Administration to open a new bid based on new acquisition strategy.</p>
          <p>Let's move now on to Eurocopter on slide 16. Eurocopter has experienced continued market success to the end of September 2008. 605 helicopters were booked. The backlog now represents more than &#x20AC;14 billion. So far Eurocopter has not seen a strong impact from the financial crisis nevertheless we remain vigilant to market changes here as well, particularly as some commercial customers face difficulties financing their deliveries.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter order intake totaled 130 helicopters with large orders in the parapublic segment by the Polish and Bavarian ministries. This also includes part of the award of 17 helicopters, a portion of a multiyear Light Enforcement Helicopter contract for US Customs emphasizing Eurocopter's US market penetration capabilities.</p>
          <p>During the first nine months, Eurocopter's revenues increased by 7% driven by the successful ramp up in both medium and light serial activities. 404 helicopters were delivered in the period. A major milestone was achieved with the first LUH delivery from the final assembly line in Mississippi. This is -- this on time delivery represents Eurocopter's commitment to establishing full production of LUH in the US. The total of 29 LUH were delivered in the first nine months. Total program deliveries now have reached 47.</p>
          <p>Nine months EBIT compared favorably with 2007 which included an exceptional charge for NH90. EBIT growth was driven by favorable volume effects, but partially offset by negative impacts from the dollar headwind and higher innovation led R&amp;D. The NH90 backlog was 485 helicopters at the end of September, ramp up is progressing. 11 helicopters were delivered in the first nine months. A total of 22 deliveries achieved for the program to date.</p>
          <p>The first Spike air-to-ground missile firing campaign was successfully completed in Q3 for Tiger. More than 10,000 flight hours have now been achieved across the whole fleet. Eurocopter derives more than 30% of its revenues from services. In keeping with growth targets, Eurocopter is expending in the UK with the provision of training services for North Sea oil and gas customers in Aberdeen, Scotland. This initiative forms part of a more general widening of Eurocopter's UK footprint and capabilities.</p>
          <p>Let's speak about Astrium on the next slide, number 17. High levels of innovation, a strong focus on efficiency and solid competitive positioning are evident in the Astrium results. The order book is robust at more than &#x20AC;12.5 billion, revenues have notably increased by 25% and EBIT has doubled.</p>
          <p>Astrium generated revenues of &#x20AC;2.7 billion in the first nine months 2008. This 25% increase is driven by telecommunication satellite launches, and a notable increased in services activities.</p>
          <p>Growth in services is generated both organically, coming from Earth Observation services and a ramp-up in Paradigm activity, but also through the acquisition of the majority share in Spot Image. Spot Image now fully consolidated in the accounts since January should contribute around &#x20AC;100 million in revenues for 2008.</p>
          <p>EBIT doubled in the period driven by strong growth in Earth Observation and Paradigm services, the consolidation of Spot Image and efficiency improvements in Space Transportation that have enabled the successful ramp-up in Ariane 5. Paradigm Services performance is exceeding expectations and compensates for the unfavorable translation effect from the declining British pound to the euro exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Order intake for the nine months reached almost &#x20AC;2.7 billion. In the third quarter, Astrium won a repeat order from SES Astra for the construction of a new telecom satellite, the fourth of its type ordered by the company.</p>
          <p>This demonstrates a high level of customer satisfaction for our products. Two Earth Observations contracts for &#x2013; were awarded in the quarter to government customers. SEOSAR will have military technology radar applications for use by the Spanish MoD. SSOT, Chile's first satellite will be used for border surveillance and monitoring of weather conditions. The contract includes a complete partnering and training program, demonstrating Astrium's expansion into the Earth Observation value chain.</p>
          <p>Progress continues on Galileo. At the end of September, Astrium was down-selected by ESA and the EU as a prime candidate for the full deployment sales. In line with EU procurement requirements, Astrium is inviting interested suppliers to submit their expressions of interest.</p>
          <p>The ATV Jules Verne successfully completed its final maneuver after supplying the International Space Station. The ATV delivered on a series of technical achievements and Astrium is currently building a second ATV on behalf of ESA.</p>
          <p>Up to Defence now on slide 18, firstly I would like to remind you that MBDA is now consolidated at 37.5% in Defence and Security. Nine months 2007 figures have been adjusted accordingly.</p>
          <p>Our newly acquired PlantCML is fully consolidated in the segment results from May onwards. Revenues are up 11%, compared to the same period last year bringing nine months revenues to almost &#x20AC;3.5 billion. The increase is driven primarily by growth in Defence Electronics, radar and military platform support services. The accounting adjustment made for the A400M generated a revenue increase of &#x20AC;142 million and the consolidation of PlantCML provided a contribution of &#x20AC;41 million.</p>
          <p>The strong increase in EBIT is driven by operating improvements across all businesses driven by maturing programs particularly in missiles, radar and services combined with cost reduction initiatives across the business segments. The A400M adjustment is EBIT neutral in the Defence and Securities division.</p>
          <p>The back loaded seasonality earnings pattern in Defence is expected for the remainder of the year. Order intake for the nine months is above &#x20AC;3.5 billion driven by a high level of activity in Defence Electronics and new export contracts in both global Secure Networks and MBDA.</p>
          <p>Defence Electronics was awarded several naval radar contracts in the third quarter. Like the naval radars to the US coast guard for the enhancement of situational awareness and to Germany for the protection of the army's training area. MBDA was awarded a contract from the UK Royal Navy's Sea Wolf air defense system.</p>
          <p>The total order book for Defence and Securities now stands at almost &#x20AC;18 billion. Increasing momentum in this business segment remains core to our strategic objectives. A major US milestone was achieved in the third quarter with the delivery of a complete jet-powered target drone system to the US army. This drone is to be used for the training of missile defense crews against aerial targets.</p>
          <p>Consequently the US army is now advertising our target drones in their army catalogs, which promotes our products as a preferred solution to other countries. In line with business objectives DS is increasing global activities. EADS ensured factual radio communications during the Beijing Olympic Games and received very positive feedback from the Chinese authorities. This demonstrates the robustness of our solutions.</p>
          <p>Now we go on to our other businesses on 19. EADS North America is now consolidated in other businesses, as we said already before. Nine months 2007 figures have been adjusted accordingly. The different divisions like Eurocopter and Defence will continue to report their relevant work share in their results.</p>
          <p>Revenues in other businesses have increased 14% driven by higher ATR deliveries, higher passenger seats activity at Sogerma, increasing general aviation activities at Sogerma and the LUH ramp-up at EADS North America.</p>
          <p>EBIT is roughly stable due to some negative effects from foreign exchange. At the end of October Sogerma finalized the sale of Revima one of the subsidiaries demonstrating further progress with the restructuring which has proven to be a real success. The DAHER has received support from both Revima's work force, local authorities and customers. Operationally Sogerma confirms its recovery.</p>
          <p>ATR continues to ramp up deliveries in 2008, 37 aircraft were delivered at the end of September seven orders have been booked in the nine months. The backlog stands at 165 units and at the end of the quarter seven aircrafts were waiting to be delivered due to customer issues.</p>
          <p>EFW aerostructures business performance is mostly compensating for a temporary slowdown in the phasing of freighter conversions. Future business markets will benefit from new cooperation with Lufthansa Technik for the conversion and modification of Airbus aircraft in partnerships with Russian Irkut and UAC on the A320/21 freighter conversion that was launched in the quarter.</p>
          <p>EADS Socata booked 50 orders in the nine months and delivered 41 aircraft to the end of September. The backlog reached 74 aircraft. Earlier this month the final agreement was announced between EADS and the DAHER group for DAHER to acquire 70% majority interest in EADS Socata. This agreement will allow the creation of a leading European industrial player in the aerostructures domain and generate a Tier One partner for the A350. On 30 of September 2008, the order book of other businesses stood at almost &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>And Louis will comment now on the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans Peter. As we indicated in the press release, first I remind you that EADS guidance is based on the closing spot rate at year end 2008 of &#x20AC;1 for US$1.45. EADS expects Airbus to capture above 850 new orders in 2008. EADS revenues are expected to exceed 40 billion in 2008, consistent with about 470 aircraft delivered for the full year.</p>
          <p>With an EBIT of 2 billion in the first nine months of 2008, EADS should exceed its full year EBIT guidance of 1.8 billion at &#x20AC;1 for US$1.45 based on the strong underlying performance. This excludes any additional impact for the A400M due to the uncertainty of the program. Obviously the end result issues in the A400M program challenged 2008 EBIT outlook.</p>
          <p>The variation of the closing euro-dollar spot rate at year end 2008, relative to that at September 30th of 2008 could have negative impact on earnings linked to the revaluation of some Airbus balance sheet items, including loss making contract provisions. Before the impact of customer financing, EADS expects 2008 free cash flow at above &#x20AC;2 billion, keeping in mind it is the most volatile item to predict.</p>
          <p>Now, if you allow us Hans Peter and myself, we will take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. One on loss making contracts and the FX. 145 is all very interesting, but right now we're at 126, 127. Can you give us any guidance on what that would do as regards to writing back provisions? I know it's a nonlinear relationship, but can -- any order of magnitude that you might be able to help us with there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I will try to give you some guidance. I will not give you the precise number, but at let's -- I mean it's a question of what dollar rate you assume.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Let's take 130 or could also take 140, 125, but let's take 130. It is going to be in an order of magnitude in excess of $0.5 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Colin Crook from UBS. Mr. Crook, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Colin Crook from UBS here. Can you give us some level of order cover in 2009 and 2010 in Airbus? We get the numbers from airplanes, but I think those numbers have changed. So if you could just give us the level of overbooking you have, if you do have any in '09 and '10? And then the second question relates to the A380, you've increased the provision, I think, in the period and you talked about higher costs. Can you just explain whether that provision is basically for all future anticipated costs or whether it just reflects the higher costs incurred in the period in which case we should be expecting more costs in the later period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first the backlog coverage, as you remember Colin, we never provided precise figures on that, but with the current decision which was taken by Airbus to freeze the production ramp-up at 36. We retain overbooking so we are more than 100% covered with the order backlog for deliveries in 2009, '10, '11. I didn't look in to the further years, but at least in these three years we have still not insignificant over coverage by our backlog of the deliveries. This is obviously a figure which is a moving target currently, due the fact that we have seen some cancellations already just recently as you are aware. And that we are actively, obviously, managing to replace customers which postpone or cancel by other customers so there is quite some activity in our commercial teams in Toulouse, to manage that and as I said so far quite successfully.</p>
          <p>On your second question, which was the A380 higher costs, yes, it has impacted provision, which means future costs by 100 million and there was also some impact in the period costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we expect to see more costs in outer years? Is the profitability of the A380 in terms of what we've seen from the P&amp;L going forward going to be less than you were thinking three months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, you are very difficult to understand, very bad connection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, is the profitability of the A380 program going to be less on future sales that you were thinking three months ago even when you've adjusted for this provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is a slight deterioration, yes. It's not a big one as we have seen, but a little bit, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Ben Fidler from Deutsche Bank. Mr. Fidler, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Actually two questions that I have. The first one just relates to slide nine, the underlying clean margin that you show for Airbus or the clean profit for Airbus. It looks like the clean margin from the data on slide nine was about 5.5% in the third quarter. If I look back to the same slide and the same analysis you showed for the first half, we have a clean margin in the first half of 11.5%. I was just wondering if you can take us through the reasons for that deterioration in the apparent clean margin in the third quarter, what were the main drivers of that? That's the first question, and I'll come back with the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think, your 5% are a little bit understating of what I would see. In our adjustments we are between six and say six and 7%, but this is lower than it has been in the first half. This is correct. Coming mainly from some recovery on cost items we mentioned before which is in the non-service area in Airbus and also R&amp;D recovery of costs which were quite low in the first half. So these are probably the two major reasons for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just again, sorry, so I understand what does recovery in non-service cost items, what would that actually mean? Can you give us some tangible examples and just -- that we can understand behind that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All kind of cost items coming from the customer support area, coming from the IT area, a number of IT projects which in their cost profile are back loaded in the year, so really number of different items in Airbus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much, Hans Peter. Second question that I had was just your comment, if I could pick it up, on customer financing. Firstly what you see in the fourth quarter potentially for that and also if you can gives a little bit more detail on what you meant when you said it will be done within clear limits. For you what does -- what do those clear limits means as we look forward to 2009 and '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clear limits from today's point of view is I would say something we have experienced and done during the last downturn, so we limited also there ourselves in terms of customer support and you remind and remember the numbers we -- I would say with which we supported the deliveries during that time. So this is, let me say the broad order of magnitude we see, but today, but not more than that. And what was the second item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just relating -- do you see anything in Q4 that you are likely to bring in? Or it's really into 2009 that you --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Q4 we might see a little bit, but most of the customers, or literally all of the customers are funded with very, very few exceptions. And the expectations are covered within our delivery guidance. So in other words, the 470 or more than 470 aircraft is a number where we wouldn't need material support.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Sandy Morris from RBS (sic) [ABN Amro]. Mr. Morris, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. As we discovered on the banking side, we are not experts on derivatives. How much flexibility do these options provide in '09 and '10? And is it literally a case of at 126 we could walk away from them and still achieve a net positive impact on our hedging, any guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First, thank you, Sandy. The options are taken for 10, 11 and 12. And they give us full flexibility. So we are not obliged to honor them and we might try to restructure them over time. So they give us full flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the second quick question. The increase in your free cash flow guidance of a billion, is there any one thing you can attribute that to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the increase is coming from continued robust PDP inflow, and it's also due to the fact that we, I would say, in Airbus have less inventory increase than probably anticipated.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>The next question comes from the David Perry from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Perry, please go ahead with your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good morning. Two questions please. One of them is quite general, Hans Peter can you give us any thoughts just on the underlying margin in 2009 at Airbus in terms of where you see that heading, whether there is any update you can give us on prior comments you've made? And the second one is a significant part of your Helicopter and Space business is derived from commercial sales. Do you see that being impacted at all by the economic conditions at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's first go to the second one, the commercial sales in Helicopter, yes, they are impacted. They represent about one-third of revenues in Eurocopter, because you have to be aware that I mean we have roughly, very roughly a split one-third, one-third, one-third, Military, Commercial and product support in Services business. So Eurocopter is with the Services business and with the Military business obviously much less cyclical than Airbus, but it's clear that on the commercial segment we see some weaknesses with some of our customers today and this will probably and most probably persist into next year. And we might also, but this is really not comparable to what we are doing on Airbus, we might help one or the other customer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Space the commercial business is rather low compared to the revenues of the division. I mean, space transportation is 100% -- close to 100% military and government business. There is obviously a small impact on the launcher side -- on the commercial side of the launching. And there is some impact on the telecom satellites. I can't give you from the top of my head exact percentages, but the exposure to the commercial business in these two -- in the space area is limited.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But your slide says 68% is civil in that stream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Louis Gallois speaking. Civil doesn't mean commercial. A large part is government. Yes, for example, observations satellites are civil, but they are not commercial, they are government. We can't exclude to have some consequences on telecommunication satellites, but it's a market with specific features and I don't believe that it will change a lot of thing in this market. We don't see for the time being, we don't see any evolution. The market is as it was in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And in terms of the outlook for Airbus margins in -- underlying margins in 2009? Obviously there is many moving parts, but your old guidance was for quite a severe degradation, do you still expect that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean slight degradation in the last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no in the full year 2009, the issues you've talked about in the past in terms of R&amp;D, pricing in the backlog, absorbing the FX. Clearly you are starting maybe from a better underling position. So I just wanted to know how you felt about the trajectory going into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If we -- I mean if we look into the items we have mentioned so far. For this year, the pricing impact persists into the fourth quarter. What we have seen in the third quarter already was pick-up in customer services costs, or in non-series costs in a broader sense and also in R&amp;D which means the fourth quarter will be burdened by those issues as well as with the higher excess volume which is reversed in the last two quarter this year. I don't give you at this point any outlook into 2009 because first it's too early, it's too volatile and we did not even yet finalize our own internal planning for next year and the years after. So I think it's too early at this point.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello there. First question is on the A400M and the 341 million charge just to clarify exactly what that is, because I think the slide says it's to do with the change of accounting on the program, but I am not clear is it kind of an accounting charge or is it because you stopped the milestone accounting you now book all of the costs that actually occurred in the quarter, maybe if you could just explain that 341? And I'll tell you the second question at the same time is on Airbus, cancellations and deferrals, I think at the start of this year John Leahy told us that maybe something less than 30% of the order book could conceivably be subject to cancellation or deferrals on his worst case scenarios. I wonder how you are feeling about that and also over what timeframe do those cancellations and deferrals present themselves to you? If conditions stay as they are, will all the customers who were going to cancel, will they come and cancel in the next couple of months or will it be a drip, drip, drip over the next 18 months maybe? Maybe if you can give me some idea about that. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll start Louis, and you take the second question on A400M. I am not sure acoustically whether I understood, do you mean accounting charge and not change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you changed the accounting methodology, haven't you, on the program because of the lack of visibility. So I wondered if --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not actually an accounting change. It is change in the treatment of the program. It's the same accounting rule IAS 11. So we switched from the percentage of completion method to early stage accounting, because of the lack of visibility currently on certain issues on the program. So this is the background. Is that answering the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and then so is the 341 to do with the fact that there was this change in the way you treat the program or is --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is, it is indeed. It has to do with the way we treat the program, because I mean, I could explain it shortly -- I mean we are expensing work-in-progress on the program against revenues. The expense exceeding the revenues is taken against existing provisions and then the LMC the loss making contract provision is updated, included costs that could be reliably estimated at this point. But it excludes everything, we cannot estimate at this point. So this is the way we were treating that. And in other words, the 341 is an update of the loss making contract provision as far as it is estimatable for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a word on the cancellations. You have seen that cancellations so far stay at a limited level and none of them are linked to the present financial and economic crisis. The main cancellation we have on 2008 are partly linked to the shift of on the past A350 to the new one, and to the bankruptcy of Skybus in April. And we have taken into account the 65 airplanes cancelled through this -- the bankruptcy in October after a legal discussion we had with the company.</p>
          <p>To make a forecast for the future is extremely difficult. The crisis is -- has a different shape from the past. First, it's a double crisis. It's a crisis with the market, with the air traffic decreasing slightly in some part of the world and it's a crisis linked to the financing of airplanes also. And I think on the second topic we could help. It means that we could mitigate the effect of the crisis on some airlines.</p>
          <p>Second element we -- our backlog of orders is much more diversified than in the past. And it means that we are not -- and there is the threat of one market going down sharply as it was in the past, for example the US market after 9/11. We are not so sensitive to one particular market. It could be a projection but I don't want to be overoptimistic. I don't want to give the feeling that we are not waiting for cancellations. I am sure we will see cancellations in 2009. We are, as Peter explained, we are working with airlines to reorganize our delivery schedule. And so far we are doing that in a successful manner. We will see -- we are very vigilant, we follow the market very carefully. And we will see -- we will have I think better visibility in three of four -- between three and six months.</p>

          <p>Add something Louis on the question of support for the customers, what we did not mention so far is that we have seen very low levels of export credit cover deals in the last two to three years because of a very strong financing market. Obviously, this will come now to more normal levels again. So I mean we have seen so far this year 20%, roughly 20% being ECA covered and the normal level would be in an order of magnitude, which is between 30 and probably 40%, which means -- and we have addressed that, there will be higher requests for ESA coverage.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just two questions, if I may. First of all on A380, could you just give us an indication of what level of delivery you expect in 2010, and what kind of ramp-up we can expect going forward from there? And then secondly on A400M, you said the discussions with relevant bodies are going encouragingly well. When can we expect some kind of timeline as to when an announcement can be made in terms of new terms being agreed? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I could say that we are not giving any indication on the ramp-up in 2010. We are, certainly we are managing the ramp-up, but we are not giving figures on 2010. On the A400M, we are just beginning discussions with our customers and we will have also to engage discussion with our suppliers for systems in particular. I can't give you a time schedule, it's not only depending on us. We want to go as fast as possible, but it's certainly a question of several months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. Good morning, Louis, Hans Peter and Nathalie. I have two questions. First of all, could you tell us how many of your 2009 planned deliveries are un-funded or seems to have difficulties to be funded? That's my first question. My second one is related to Power8, could you tell us what are the savings -- cumulated savings on Power8, at the end of September and what kind of figure we could be waiting for the full year? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cut it short, the number has not changed for the full year between six and 800 million, 400 of which we had achieved in the first half. I don't have the precise number for the third quarter yet but it is certainly somewhere in between the ramp-up we see in the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Then on your first question un-funded deliveries for next year, it is a question I think which can literally not be precisely answered because of a very simple phenomenon. I mean most of the delivery provisions next year are covered from today's point of view. Now what we see though in the weak financial markets is that obviously the commitments, which are given by financial institutions, are sometimes put in question by material adverse change clauses. In other words, it will heavily depend on, let me say, the health of the airlines as it develops going forward, how much finally is going to be covered. At this point, I mean we cannot see such a material impact yet but this is the level of uncertainty we have in that topic, Antoine. I'm sorry that I cannot be more precise because it's beyond our control.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Nick Cunningham from Evolution. Mr. Cunningham, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I take your point very clearly on why Airbus might be resilient and have a widespread backlog and so on, but typically this industry has a 38 to 73% decline in volumes over the last five cycles. And Airbus is now half the market so it only seems reasonable to think that you will have a substantial volume downturn to deal with it at some point over the next few years.</p>
          <p>So I think two questions arise from that in my mind. First of all, you've got &#x20AC;18.5 billion of short-term customer advances in current liabilities. So one question, how much of that is Airbus, and what happens to that if volumes fall significantly? And secondly, looking at Power8 PLUS, how does your cost savings program get affected by any significant declines in volumes because it seems to me it's one thing to cut costs in a rising volume environment it's a different thing in a declining volume? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's first talk about Power8 PLUS or Power8 in general. I mean conceptually if volume is lower obviously all the volume related savings are impacted. Now the question is finally, obviously then the volume and we also discussed with Airbus that obviously we are going to try to recover on volume impacts if they occur. So there will be some impact most probably. We try to manage that within the targets we have currently, but we cannot say that there would be probably not an impact. On the 8.5 billion of short-term advances, I am afraid, I don't have the number for Airbus here, but -- no I don't have it here. Yes. We don't have the split of current and non-current this is the problem Nick, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a word on your pessimism on the market, perhaps you are right, but we have no evidence that we are going -- so far we have no evidence that we are going to such a crisis. When we have an empty delivery slot we have a lot of companies trying to get it for the time being. And we have not this feeling, perhaps in the form -- in some months I could have a different opinion, but for the time being the most pessimistic scenario is not based on evidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Nick if I may add something, I mean, I've seen your research notes, yes, there is this 30 to 40% downturn impact. The question is on which we are applying that because due to the backlogs, of course, manufactures you would today assume still increases and then the question is do you deduct the 30% from today's volumes or from the volumes which are supported by the backlog, which is a 10 to 15% difference probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I take your point. The 38% decline was last time and that was because the Asian crisis took the top off the last cycle. If you look at the previous three cycles, it was a 50% peak to trough decline, and the one before that was 73%. So it does depend what happens to the peak and obviously Boeing's strike and your decision not to increase the A320 rate will somewhat, if you like, reduce or mitigate the peaking effect.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, you could also argue that this is probably the most coordinated global downturn since the Second World War. So this -- the demand side might actually be worse than previous cycles. It's clearly impossible to call at this stage. But I just wanted to ask -- the basic point was that in a substantial volume downturn however large that may turn out to be, what's the cash effect in terms of the working capital impact on advances and PDPs?</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning. On the slots that you're talking about, you've seen them open up and you've seen customers come in and take those slots. Where are you seeing those coming from? In other words, what regions of the world are you seeing that interest in taking these earlier slots? And then, are you having to make any concessions on pricing related to those?

          <p>It's not a question of region. It's a question of airlines. In every region we -- you have fragile airlines. And in every regions you have airlines taking the opportunity open to widen their capacity and to take the lead. We know that some areas are weaker than the others, the United States, India, for example are weak areas. But we see also that some airlines are very active and they want to take the opportunity of the crisis to expand their business on the back of their competitors. It's a diversified situation, perhaps it could be worse in a few months, but for the time being it's extremely diversified.</p>

Second question on the hedging cover. Thanks for giving us a breakdown on the hedging slide of the options and the forwards. Can you help us to understand Hans Peter, how much of the forward cover is the structured forwards you've spoken about before? And what is the rate at which they are knocked out?

We were announcing in 2009, I said we planned 21 airplanes. And a couple of airplanes could shift to 2010 because we were late in the preparation of the Wave 2, but I am not pessimistic on the way we manage the -- we recover the control of the program for the time being. I think the new team is very active and people are regaining moral and I think we are improving significantly. I could say that -- I don't say that we will be able to deliver the 21 airplanes in 2009. I said that some &#x2013; a couple of airplanes could shift, but globally I am more confident than a few months ago about our capacity to manage the ramp-up for the further years.</p>

          <p>Then on the telecom satellites Harry. I mean, if we excluded the government or military satellites, we are in an order of magnitude this and next year, this year around six, next year around eight. The telecom commercial part of that is roughly 50%.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So roughly 3 a year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>3 to 4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Between 3 and 4, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, 3 to 4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the structure forwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The structure forwards, they do not represent a big part of the hedges. I just have to look here, yes it's around say between 7 and 7.5 billion. I don't have all the knockout rates in mind, some of them we certainly have been knocked out already so they are not included in that number any longer. So -- because I cannot give you the rates, because they are taken at different times with different knockout rates, so -- and I simply don't have the average here Harry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Hans Peter, just on the slide 11 with hedge policy. Any structured forwards that are knocked out are no longer there, they are removed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no structured forwards any longer. They are back to the rate which was, let me say, how would you call it, our secured rate. The minute you hit one of these knockout rates if the dollar has strengthened, you are back to square one due to the rate -- more or less the forward rates plus some cost obviously, $0.01 or a little bit more than $0.01, you are back to the forward rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the structured forward is not void, it continues to exist, but the rate is reset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
