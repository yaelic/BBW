          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Sanofi 2011 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> I now handover to S&#xE9;bastien Martel. Sir, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Sanofi's Conference Call on our Q2 2011 results. Before we start, I would like to remind that our slides are available on the website as always. I must advise you that our present today &#x2013; presentation today, sorry, contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results to be materially different. These factors are detailed on our annual report on Form 20-F and in the Document of Reference.</p>
          <p>On Slide 3, you can see the agenda for the day. Basically, the presentation will be divided in four parts. First, Chris Viehbacher, our CEO, will share with you the key highlights for the quarter; then Hanspeter Spek, President, Global Operations; David Meeker, Chief Operating Officer of Genzyme; Olivier Charmeil, Senior VP of Vaccines will provide some color on the Q2 2011 business performance.</p>
          <p>Dr. Elias Zerhouni, President, Global R&amp;D will review our upcoming key regulatory findings and will come back to the first Phase III results of Lemtrada. And in conclusion, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, our CFO will comment on the Q2 2011 financial performance. We will then host a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>And without any further ado, I will now hand the call over to Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xE9;bastien. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody. I'll first just give a very warm welcome to Dr. David Meeker who is joining us for the first time. We thought it would be helpful for some of our investors who haven't been as familiar with the Genzyme portfolio of products to have David as COO of Genzyme be able to provide some of that detail.</p>
          <p>I'm going to move straight to Slide 5, because I think it really best illustrates what's been going on in the company. As we have been predicting now for several years, obviously, there is an impact of generics on the many blockbusters that have driven this company's success for many years. I showed this slide for the first time at the first quarter, this is an update for what it looks like in the second quarter. To remind you, the first part of the chart really shows the sales of those nine products that are subject to patent expiry. In Q2 of 2009, the sales of those on a quarterly basis were &#x20AC;2.1 billion and you can see when we fast-forward for two years that those sales have vaulted to &#x20AC;773 million.</p>
          <p>And in fact, the impact of generics in the second quarter was stronger even than in the first quarter with an impact of about &#x20AC;800 million of sales lost to generics in Q2 versus &#x20AC;500 million in our first quarter. But, of course, that also says that at least in terms of sales, we're getting a major part of cliff behind us and that cliff gets more and more behind us with every quarter that passes. That's not really the story of the company though. The story of the company really has been the other side of the page, where you can see the growth platforms.</p>
          <p>And as you know, we made a massive effort two years ago to reallocate resources and shift management attention and strategically align the whole company behind these growth platforms. And the growth platforms are not just there really to replace those lost sales, but to restructure the sales into areas of business that have natural barriers to entry and which are substantially less exposed to patent expiries, to really avoid the more of the same on the left side of that chart. What you can see is that, of course, over time and again with each quarter, that these growth platforms become an ever more important part of the company and if we look at the sales of Genzyme plus the growth platforms, you can see that already two thirds of the company are in this part of the business and those have performed well.</p>
          <p>So, that's really where we're going. This is &#x2013; you're seeing increasingly the new Sanofi emerge with the green bars and really the bars on the left side starting to disappear. So, if we move to the next chart, we can see what the impact is on earnings per share. Again, if we hadn't had the ability to consolidate Genzyme, sales of Sanofi would have been down 4%. As it is with the consolidation of Genzyme, those sales are up 6.9%.</p>
          <p>Sales on a constant exchange rate basis are affected obviously &#x2013; those are our current exchange rates. So, you can see the current exchange rate, yeah. Then if we look at earnings per share, we have obviously a decrease of 12.1% without the benefit of the Genzyme consolidation. And with the Genzyme consolidation, then we have 7.4% decline.</p>
          <p>Now, so what's been going on with Genzyme? So, we've made huge progress on integration. We basically began the integration just after we announced the deal in the middle of February. We've had a global integration committee made up of executives from Genzyme and from Sanofi, with basically that being chaired by Henri Termeer and myself. We had an executive committee in Cambridge last week and basically came to the conclusion that the global integration effort was largely completed. So, I think we've done a very good job of actually bringing these two companies together in a relatively short period of time, recognizing that Genzyme has 10,000 employees in 80 countries.</p>
          <p>Now, there is still some level of integration work going on, particularly in countries outside of the U.S. But largely we believe that from a global point of view, we've made the key decisions on people, on structures, how we want to organize our business, and I have to say on a people basis, we had a dinner together last week and I think we've made a huge step in starting to move from the inevitable parts of integration where we're we and you and we all become more we.</p>
          <p>Now, what do we actually do in terms of structure? We looked at Genzyme's four businesses and they were essentially the personalized genetic health, they are the biosurgery business, the renal business and the oncology business. And, of course, there is a new business which comes from creating a new multiple sclerosis platform. And we decided that really the personalized intensely patient-centric approach would really be best served with the personalized genetic health business and the multiple sclerosis business. So, the new perimeter of Genzyme, if you like, is the PGH, the rare diseases and the multiple sclerosis business.</p>
          <p>Into that we have put the Sanofi MS product, Aubagio, and this is actually quite an exciting opportunity to launch two major drugs in a category within a short time of each other. So, we will be able to become quite rapidly, I think, a leader in multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>The other businesses we felt could benefit from Sanofi's size and scale, geographic presence around the world. And so, the oncology division of the two companies have merged and that's really where the true integration has occurred, so we put our portfolio together. And then that actually was very helpful because we actually had an awful lot of extra capacity on the Sanofi side given the patent expiries. So, really those could help the oncology businesses.</p>
          <p>And then in the pharmaceutical businesses, we've put renal business and the biosurgery businesses in with Sanofi's businesses because we can see some cross-selling opportunities and again the opportunity to get some scale behind that.</p>
          <p>I'll move to the next one, you've seen this morning that we put out a press release separately on forecast for the CVR. Essentially, when we went through due diligence and if you remember on some of these calls even before the close of the transaction, we had expressed some skepticism that the recovery could be as quickly as had been forecasted and certainly as we went into due diligence and were looking at the manufacturing forecast, we just felt that those were too optimistic. And so at that time, to really bridge the gap between the two managements, we essentially reallocated $1 of the CVR from Lemtrada to the manufacturing forecast.</p>
          <p>Now, the company, and you can see that from this chart, we continue to make very strong progress. You can see on the left that in the first half of 2010 there was a significant decrease in production due to production issues but that the recovery had really been largely affected by the second half of 2010. And the production in 2011 is showing the consistency of the production that we're able to achieve with roughly the same level. I would point out, that's actually a slightly pessimistic view because there was actually a key lot that was approved for release on the 1st of July, had it been on the 30th, that would have actually been showing a small increase versus H2 of 2010.</p>
          <p>So, Cerezyme is an exercise in now trying to build stock and really optimize the production, but I think is in good shape. Fabrazyme, of course, has been more difficult to come back and really get the yields out of the new cell banks and you can see that between the first half and the second half last year, that it was more difficult. But the first half of 2011, we're seeing a significant increase and I think there will be a significant increase again in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>So, the progress is there. We're in line with the Consent Decree, in fact, the fill-finish operations at Allston, which were partly at the root of the Consent Decree were stopped and that's ahead of schedule. So, we've got every confidence in the recovery of manufacturing, it's just that the actual levels of production are not going to leap to what was originally forecast. For Sanofi, there is no real difference because we never built the higher forecast into our plans and so this has no significant impact on the outlook for Sanofi and where we're going with our Genzyme colleagues.</p>
          <p>The next slide, I think, is also important and Elias will go into this a little bit more in detail, but I think I'm extremely happy to see progress firming up in a number of areas of the company and particularly in R&amp;D. We've made a number of &#x2013; had a number of milestones, some of which are related to R&amp;D and some aren't. Obviously, we completed the divestiture of our Dermik business. I like dermatology, but we had no critical mass in that business and found no clear path to getting it, and so we decided to sell that business at what I think was a very good price.</p>
          <p>Jevtana has now been approved in the EU and the rollout is in progress. Certifect which is a new parasiticide for dogs has been launched in the U.S.; it's extremely important because of the key element of Frontline to our business and Hanspeter will go into a little more detail on that. We did have some positive Phase III results in second-line colorectal cancer for Zaltrap and you'll see more of the detail of those presented later in the year.</p>
          <p>Lyxumia has also had a lot of data presented at the ADA earlier this year. Lemtrada, of course, you saw the Phase III data and I think Elias will talk a little bit more about that. We've got a new product, semuloparin coming along for VTE prevention in chemotherapy patients. Hexaxim in Vaccines, we've started the process for licensure in emerging markets. There's sarilumab, which had positive Phase IIB results in rheumatoid arthritis and so that's looking very positive in an interesting market as well. Not everything goes well, of course, and the sarilumab results in ankylosing spondylitis didn't work and, of course, we had the PALLAS study in Multaq, which was stopped due to side effects.</p>
          <p>So, &#x2013; but I think there is a lot of good progress on R&amp;D and Elias will give some more benefit to that. I think the one thing I would say is we did a &#x2013; we culled the portfolio if you remember two years ago and took out 35% to 40% of the portfolio. What I think was good is that the stress test that we've put on the portfolio that year, I think, really generated a set of decisions on which products to keep, which appear to have been validated two years later, because most everything that we decided to keep has now progressed and is looking at being filed. So, that gives me some confidence that some of the discipline and rigor that we need in the decision gates for development are in place and are predictive of &#x2013; are better predictive of success in development.</p>
          <p>So, if we could go to the next slide, we've also made some personnel changes. So, we've strengthened our management team. We announced this morning the appointment of David-Alexandre Gros as our Chief Strategy Officer. This looks at business development and M&amp;A, but it's also an opportunity to make sure that we've got enough strategic thinking going on at the executive committee level. Lot going on in healthcare, a lot more integration in healthcare. There is opportunity everywhere and David's background is both a physician, consultant and banker, I think, will add lot to our team.</p>
          <p>With the departure of Bel&#xE9;n Garijo to Merck Serono, Peter Guenter has moved up to head our European operations, a seasoned marketing executive most recently running our German operations. One of the things that we did as part of the integration of now both Merial and Genzyme is to take advantage of that and move to a new support function model in North America. So, rather than having all of these support functions duplicated in our five U.S. businesses, we created a new organization to support those businesses and that will be headed by Greg Irace who has been running our U.S. pharmaceutical business, and as he moves up, we have brought in Anne Whitaker who was previously running a major part of GSK's U.S. business.</p>
          <p>The growth platforms, as I said, continue to perform well, double digit growth in emerging markets for the first half, Diabetes Solutions doing extremely well, Lantus up 14.5%, I think is good. Consumer Healthcare clearly driven by the Allegra launch. Animal Health up 6.7%. You are going to see in Vaccines and Animal Health that second quarter growth was a little lower. This is largely seasonal and shifts between first and second quarter. Vaccines, you're used to seeing it. Animal Health, of course, you're less used to seeing because we haven't consolidated for that long, but you have seasonality with the tick season and so there is no real change to the underlying growth, you're just seeing the quarterly variations.</p>
          <p>Emerging Markets, Hanspeter will take you through as well. The growth in Emerging Markets looks a little lower but that's really related to a couple of specific markets and that are largely from the point of view of a different comparator period for the last year.</p>
          <p>So, finally if I take all of that together and look at the outlook for 2011, obviously, we've decided to update our guidance for 2011, now that we've been able to consolidate Genzyme. And so, the earnings per share guidance that we had at the start of the year, which to remind you was down &#x2013; was expected to be down 5% to 10% has now been raised, so that we would expect earnings per share to be down by 2% to 5%.</p>
          <p>So, I think the business is in good shape, quarter two basically is again demonstrating the execution of our strategy. Every quarter takes us less out of the realm of generic risk and more into the realm of sustainable patent growth. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Hanspeter Spek.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I kindly ask you to move onto to page number 14, where you'll find an in-depth analysis of our quarterly sales. You see that the sales on a comparable level are at the same level, &#x20AC;8.3 billion. We continue to lose to generics &#x20AC;778 million as you have seen in Chris' part. Evidently, this is still very significant. Lovenox and Taxotere makes a vast majority of those &#x20AC;778 million, but it is already significantly less than in the previous three months.</p>
          <p>The growth platforms you have seen also contribute significantly approximately half to this loss, and yes, there is also first time then the contribution of Genzyme, which further helps us to compensate a negative ForEx impact of more than &#x20AC;500 million, which largely but not only of course comes from the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>On page 15, the &#x2013; already traditional focus on our performance in Emerging Markets, we have a two-digit growth rate as in previous quarters, 12.3% equal $2.5 billion. This would be 7% excluding Genzyme and the avian flu effect. You see then that, yes, the Emerging Markets became our largest most important market segment, more important than the U.S. and Western Europe, and if you then analyze the Emerging Markets inside, you see that, yes, by far the largest contribution to this growth comes from the so called BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>
          <p>In the previous quarters, we had a little bit of a question mark during 2010 on our performance on Lantus, and I described by the third and fourth quarter 2010, what we are doing in order to correct this performance and I'm happy to report today that we are back to a two-digit growth already in the first part of the 13% for Lantus, which we further accelerated north of 14.5%. The product achieved close to &#x20AC;1 billion in a single quarter. But also, overall our diabetes division, which achieves nearly &#x20AC;1.2 billion sales is growing by impressive figure, this 12.4%.</p>
          <p>We were happy also to report during the past quarter positive Phase III result for the upcoming intended launch of Lyxumia, which has been presented during the ADA, and also, another product also for insulin portfolio accelerate nicely; it's close &#x2013; Adipra is close to 30% growth of sales in the second quarter in the United States, but also outside.</p>
          <p>Another growth platform becoming more and more important is Consumer Healthcare, as you find then on page 17. Also, there we see an accelerated growth of close to 18%, achieving &#x20AC;644 million in the second quarter. This is a growth largely driven by Allegra, which we launched in March 2011 due to a switch from a prescription to an OTC status in the United States. The product has sold in the first half &#x20AC;143 million and as such, we immediately leapfrogged on to second market rank and we are quite proud concerning this achievement, but also outside the U.S. we continued with the growth of this activity and as you gave us an example, we launched for example, Lactacyd in China and we very actively build and rebuild our portfolio of CHC products also in Europe, we are quite confident that the current growth will continue in the upcoming quarters.</p>
          <p>Generics then on page number 18, and as a growth platform performing extremely nice with 17.6% sales above &#x20AC;400 million. You know our policy in this respect. We have a more opportunistic approach to generics, as you know. We strongly concentrate on the emerging market where we feel that it is most adequate to propose generics as a contribution to make medication affordable. Consequently, 64% of our generics have come from those markets, hence, they grow nearly 14% with &#x20AC;279 million.</p>
          <p>In the United States, we have a more defensive attitude. We continuously since years launched authorized generics through a partner and we continue to do so with Ambien and quite recently with Taxotere. Overall, our strategy has two axis, one is in Europe and in the Eastern European and Middle East countries driven by ZENTIVA and in the South America driven by our acquisition of Medley, which by the way continues to perform extremely well.</p>
          <p>A last word then on Animal Health, Chris had indicated that Animal Health has a strong seasonality overall coming from the flea and tick season in the first quarter of any calendar year. This has been even more pronounced for the first quarter in 2011, because we were in a kind of defense battle against upcoming generics. We can state that at least for the time being, we have not won the war, but we have won a number of battles; one in the marketplace where we defended our market share very successfully in the United States but also in Europe. But also in court, as you see from the chart, we have won two court battles leading to the fact that three of our generic competitors in the U.S. were obliged to withdraw from the market.</p>
          <p>So, we believe that the semesters in the second half of 2011 will bring back therefore Merial to the expected growth rate, which will be in the range of 5% to 7% for the total year and to CCS, Certifect, our recent launch in the flea and tick segment in the United States will contribute and will build therefore a certain bridge in the upcoming new generation of those products, which we intend then to launch as of 2013, 2014.</p>
          <p>So, far on the pharmaceuticals and I'll pass now on to David Meeker to give you more insight on the performance of Genzyme. David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hanspeter. So, the second quarter for Genzyme was a solid quarter with revenues of &#x20AC;796 million, that's in the context of continuing to work our way through the supply challenges and deal with the distractions that inevitably accompany an acquisition as we have been working through the integration part of it. The quarter was up 16% year-on-year and that was driven predominantly by a strong performance in our personalized genetic health business up 36% and if you look at the pie chart on the right, you can see that within our growth of enzyme replacement therapies, this growth came predominantly from Cerezyme, up 58%. The Cerezyme picture was driven predominantly by the increase in supply and the stabilization and increased consistency of our ability to produce that Chris highlighted earlier.</p>
          <p>Myozyme/Lumizyme up 42%, this is a product that's very much in the launch phase and that reflects just increasing growth of the product overall. Importantly, the balance of this portfolio, Synvisc up 17%, again this is a product that's relatively &#x2013; despite being an older product, has enormous room to grow given there's still relatively low penetration of viscosupplements overall into the osteoarthritis market, up 17% and Renagel and Renvela, again the main dominant offering, if you will, within the phosphate binder space is in excess of 52% share in the U.S., up 14%.</p>
          <p>We're on track, continuing to make progress feeling with the Consent Decree, and as Chris highlighted, have discontinued fill-finish activities. Fabrazyme, the good news on Fabrazyme is that we have again consistently been able to supply at our current level and we're working toward to being able to move definitively out of the supply constraints, which will require approval of our new plant in Framingham.</p>
          <p>And finally, here of course, we were quite encouraged by the initial positive top line results from the first Phase III study, which Elias will review shortly.</p>
          <p>Now, over to Olivier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone and good afternoon. So, Q2 flu vaccine &#x2013; Q2 means for us in the South Hemisphere as the end of the season for flu. The pattern for this year has been a little bit different from the pattern of last year with more sales coming into the first quarter. So, overall, as this translate for the total vaccine business into growth for the quarter of 3.4% and year-to-date performance at the end of June of 6%. We had record sales in terms of Southern Hemisphere flu with growth showing more 41% growth. We are very happy with the performance and it has been very much driven by our performance in Latin America.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, where we've taken the benefit of some unlocked potentials that we have been able to save, and of course a very strong performance in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:30) Overall, our market share for flu is in excess of 70%. In the meantime, we continue to defend our position in the U.S. on Menactra where Menactra has been showing in the last couple of months very strong resilience. Our market share remains close to 90%, and in the emerging market, we will continue our rollout of our Axim family we have just launched in China.</p>
          <p>Our Axim family continue to show a strong growth with Pentaxim growing more than 36%. We are very happy also to announce that the licensure process for Hexaxim has just being initiated. Hexaxim which is the six-in-one is a very important growth driver for the emerging market, and the process just started.</p>
          <p>Regarding flu and looking at the upcoming Northern Hemisphere flu campaign, after Fluzone High-Dose that was launched last year, we got the licensure for the intradermal form that we will be launching and we, for the time being, are very happy after the first shipment that started on July the 18th, we are very happy with the pre-bookings that as expected.</p>
          <p>I now handover to Dr. Elias Zerhouni.</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Olivier. In terms of research and development, what I can say is that the organization is extremely busy following, as you know, the stress testing that Chris mentioned before and focusing on delivering on the portfolio and I'm pleased to report that we're busy, in fact, filing six new molecular entities in the next nine months.</p>
          <p>The first one that was filed this month is Kynamro (mipomersen), which is indicated in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and has been filed in July this month in the EU and will be filed in the fourth quarter in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Visamerin/Mulsevo (semuloparin) was one of the best highlights of ASCO, it is the first therapy to prevent venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism in chemo-treated patients. And we are planning to file that in the third quarter of 2011 in the U.S. and the EU.</p>
          <p>Aubagio (teriflunomide), which is another new therapy for relapsing multiple sclerosis, will be filed in third quarter of 2011 in the U.S. and the first quarter 2012 in the EU.</p>
          <p>Zaltrap or aflibercept which is a VEGF trap, but has the particularity of being able to trap not only VEGF-A but B and PIGF, and has been successful in second line metastatic colon rectal cancer and will be filed in the third quarter of 2011 in the U.S. and the fourth quarter of 2011 in the EU.</p>
          <p>You've heard about good results in Lyxumia or lixisenatide and this new molecular entity will be filed for type 2 diabetes in the fourth quarter of 2011 in the EU. And finally, we've had the CARE-MS I results from Lemtrada (alemtuzumab), for relapsing multiple sclerosis, which will be filed in the first quarter of 2012 in the U.S. and the EU. Obviously, this is putting quite a stress on the organization. It's unusual to have six filings coming in such a short order, but were happy to be able to announce that.</p>
          <p>There has been some &#x2013; next slide please, there has been some good news in the CARE-MS I which has been positive in its Phase III for top line results that we released with a 55% reduction in relapse rate over Rebif, which is an interferon beta-1a inhibitor, over two years compared to Rebif. This is remarkable reduction, which is confirming Phase IIB result. However, we could not confirm the Phase IIB result in sustained accumulation of disability; there were not statistically significant results on time to six month sustained accumulation of disability with 8% of patients with Lemtrada and 11% of patients with Rebif having &#x2013; showing sustained accumulation of disability and safety profile was consistent with phase two clinical trial experience.</p>
          <p>So, as I said, we are planning the filings on the basis obviously of CARE-MS I and we are expecting the results of CARE-MS II, the difference between the two trials is one has been performed on treatment na&#xEF;ve patients whereas the CARE-MS II is performed on treatment experienced patients and we'll have the results in the fourth quarter of 2011 and are prepared to file in first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>And we are happy to see that fast track status was granted by the FDA for Lemtrada, as we go forward, we're looking to continue our development jointly obviously between Aubagio which is coming as you heard from Sanofi and Lemtrada which is coming from Genzyme as a new approach, new franchise in multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Contamine, our Executive Vice President and CFO.</p>

      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Elias. So, first on Slide 26, so I come back on the sales &#x2013; and a lot of things that have been said already. So, just to remind you of a few technical comments, the first one is that the Q2 2010 includes as has been restated with Merial being consolidated which has been represented, so clearly amount is not what we posted last year Q2, it includes 100% of Merial.</p>
          <p>The second is that as we said already, the second quarter has been the most challenging in terms of generic impact on sales precisely because of Taxotere being generified from the beginning of April. Therefore, we post minus 4% organic decrease over the quarter and clearly this is on the lowest point, on the toughest point, let's say in terms of generic impact on sales that we will see over the year 2011, and I remind that as from Q3, we already had the generic of Lovenox as from the 27 July. So, therefore, on a like-for-like basis, the impact of generification will be somewhat lower on Q3.</p>
          <p>Genzyme is clearly a contributor, and it allows us to post an overall growth and this is clearly plus in our gain is &#x2013; I mean, it's aligned with our strategy of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:56) and creating new growth platforms. And on top of that on a like-for-like basis, you remember that the exchange rate of the dollar against the euro was strong dollar in Q2 which was not the case in Q1 in 2010 and exactly the reverse this year. So, we have a strong negative impact of forex on Q2 which is 6.4% mainly driven by somewhat stronger euro on a weaker dollar as you can see. But all in all, with all these effects, we post sales for Q2 which are slightly up against sales of Q1 on the current basis.</p>
          <p>So, also if I look at the P&amp;L, this P&amp;L is &#x2013; for Q2 is impacted for the &#x2013; by the consolidation of Genzyme as well as the as the general mix, so I think it deserves some explanation. So, when we have stable sales on the reported &#x2013; on a reported basis on increased sales, on a consolidation basis, we are decrease on operating income. This was expected, let's say, and in line with our guidance, but still I think these are some explanations which I will give more following the coming slides.</p>
          <p>So, if I start with the gross margin on the cost of sales, I said at the Q1 presentation that the level we'd reached in Q1 was basically the floor we should reach for the full year between 30.5% and 31%. And again 31% is the highest level we should see, so we should remain in this range. There is for Q2 specifically negative impact of the shift of mix with the loss of sales from highly profitable product impacting by 2.5% gross margin if I compare to Q1 2010. On top of that, the exchange rate has not been favorable because we are positioning more in euro and we're selling more in other currencies. So, here again, if I compare the Q2 2010 to Q2 2011, we have negative 0.5% impact of the exchange rate.</p>
          <p>More on Genzyme, Genzyme contribution to the cost to sales ratio is very slight accretion by &#x2013; the gross margin of Genzyme has been around &#x2013; between 70% and 71%, let's say, 71.5%, i.e. the cost of sales for Genzyme for the Q2 has been around 29.5%. So, now I move to the R&amp;D expense. I would say that along with the high activity, which Elias has described, I think that we have been able to stabilize our R&amp;D expenses on the comparable basis. Of course, Genzyme adds some expense and precisely &#x20AC;135 million for the quarter, which is normal, so if I exclude that, we have a slight decrease of R&amp;D expense despite activity on late-stage phases both in Pharma but also in Vaccine, because we are reading the process of the Phase III study, Phase III clinical study for Dengue. And clearly, we have been able to reach that thanks to the decrease of our infrastructure cost as well as our internal cost over the period . So, we now take advantage of the actions we've taken over the past two years, so that we're able to stabilize on the comparable basis our R&amp;D expense for the quarter.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, here again, I think it deserves some explanation; I mean, we here again include Genzyme contribution and this is before the synergies that we are planning to generate. So, we have an increase of SG&amp;A to sales ratio. In fact, if I take out Genzyme, the SG&amp;A expense has decreased as compared to last year, and is doing somewhat better than during the first quarter on a comparable basis. And once again, if I include Genzyme, we are going to implement some synergies in particular on support functions, so that we will benefit from that in the coming quarters and all over the year of 2012, so that we can come back to a level of ratio, which was in line with the, let's say, our objective, which is to be more in the range of 25% to 26%.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income, then if I look at the net income, I mean I'm proud to show that despite of the increase of the gross debt and the net debt, the net financial expenses have been kept stable and this is a result of the very good cost of financing that we achieved for the Genzyme acquisition.</p>
          <p>As you can see from Slide 32, the gross debt &#x2013; the average gross debt over the quarter has been slightly above &#x20AC;20 billion, so net debt being around &#x20AC;13 billion, when the average gross debt in Q2 2010 was &#x20AC;9 billion of the net debt from &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>So, on one hand, we'll be less of the cost of carry of having cash on the balance sheet, but on the other hand, we also benefit on average cost of gross debt, which has been significantly reduced, thanks to the good financing conditions from the Genzyme acquisition. So, as you can see from this slide, the average rate of &#x2013; of the cost of debt for the quarter for the gross debt has been 2% compared to 4%, which was now the heritage of older debt on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>One word on the tax rate, so, we have revised our effective tax rate for the year. We have taken into account Genzyme consolidation, but we have also taken into account the evolution of our spate of activity between various countries and having more profits being generated in countries with lower tax rate; also some extra optimization on our ability to benefit from the lower tax rate on royalties being paid in our French operation.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, the tax rate for the year will be 27.5%, so lower than what I said at the beginning of the year. We have taken the impact for the two quarters in our P&amp;L in the second quarter. Therefore, the tax rate for the second quarter has been 26.5% which in fact in line with an average of 27.5% for the first half year.</p>
          <p>Now, I move to Slide 33. I think as Chris has mentioned that already as well as David; we have revised up our objective of cost synergies for indication of Genzyme from $600 million to $700 million. This is a result of an extensive work, which has been performed both in terms of putting together and putting in place a new organization and evaluating in detail where the synergies could be generated. So, as you can see from the graph on the right side of the slide, clearly a large part of it would come from support functions as well as rationalization of IS-IT systems. Also, there will be some synergies to be generated benefiting from both Sanofi and Genzyme organization in R&amp;D, particularly in the U.S. And when it comes to operations, it's very much related to the simplification of the Oncology business of Genzyme within the Oncology business of Sanofi.</p>
          <p>So, all in all is $700 million of synergy, this should be achieved by the end of 2013. Don't ask me as instead if it could be fourth quarter or the third quarter, so you can say that at least we'll get $700 million full impact 2014 and we'll do our utmost to accelerate, let's say, the ramp-up of these synergies.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, which is our next Slide 34; so if I take the take the quarter, we are generating &#x20AC;1.6 billion of free cash flow, &#x20AC;2 billion from net cash flow from operating activity; &#x20AC;428 million of CapEx. From Q2, obviously, we take into account the CapEx we spent on Genzyme on the new facilities as well as the upgrade of existing facilities. So, it's &#x20AC;90 million which are coming from Genzyme, so the rest is therefore in line, which what we posted during the first quarter. The sources and uses of funds table takes into account the acquisition of Genzyme for this quarter, so this is obviously the bulk of the &#x20AC;13.6 billion you can see on this side.</p>
          <p>And we have paid out in-cash &#x20AC;1.5 billion in dividend in cash plus some share repurchase for &#x20AC;100 million. So, all in all, the net debt at the end of the quarter is around &#x20AC;13.2 billion, which is basically one-time EBITDA and shows that we still have a very strong capital structure and balance sheet structure.</p>
          <p>So, if I just summarize before moving to Q&amp;A, on the other &#x2013; H1 2011, the growth platforms have generated a double-digit sales increase, and of course, this doesn't take into account Genzyme. We achieved that despite a very significant generic headwind over the quarter by &#x20AC;1.3 billion for the full first half of the year. We managed to limit the impact on our EPS evolution, which is down 6% if I include &#x2013; if I exclude, sorry, the impact of H1N1. We are again on-track to deliver the &#x20AC;2 billion cost saving objectives by the end of 2011. This refers to our previous plan, of course, it doesn't refer to the integration of Genzyme, which comes on top on the &#x20AC;700 million synergies which I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>And last but not least, now we can say that including Genzyme, our exposure to patent expiry on, let's say, old not growing products is being reduced again, and growth platform post-Genzyme represents now more than 65% of our overall sales.</p>
          <p>With that, I think I'll pass over to S&#xE9;bastien.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> You have a first question from Mr. Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A question on Genzyme and then one on Multaq; on the missed milestone, you know, the easy interpretation is that your progress in fixing manufacturing is going slower than expected. But if I heard you right, you seem to be saying that it might have just been overly optimistic timelines set by Genzyme and not by Sanofi, is that correct?</p>
          <p>And then, just looking at the history of manufacturing issues with drug companies, they tend to drag on longer than companies originally think and I'm wondering how much you're willing to reassure us that this won't happen and that things like the 1Q 2012 milestone you set up for Fabrazyme will be met?</p>
          <p>And then on Multaq, can you assure us that Multaq won't be removed from major markets like the U.S. and Western Europe? You have two trials now showing worse outcomes, ANDROMEDA and PALLAS and only one trial showing better outcomes, which was ATHENA. And then on PALLAS, were the CV events adjudicated? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Elias to take the Multaq question, just I will confirm what you said on the missed milestone, Tim, it &#x2013; that's why we built the CVR in. The issue though I would say here is that you talk about biological manufacturing. So, in some cases, it's &#x2013; in a lot of places and I know this from a previous Consent Decree experience, it's sometimes hard to get the full capacity going again because you essentially have an awful lot of duplication of effort between trying to get the manufacturing back again and doing all the things like training and quality.</p>
          <p>Here, the issue is really around yields and that's just a question of art of biological manufacturing. You'll remember there was a vial contamination and the facility had to be sterilized, so new cell banks were there. Cerezyme is actually up and running to expectations. Fabrazyme, it's really just been a challenge of getting these cell banks back to previously levels of productivity.</p>
          <p>The real increase in supply will come with the increase in capacity at Framingham in the first quarter, and assuming our validation runs work out well, then I think we would be confident in saying that they'd come through. So, you know, that's why we're at pains to say that the number was not going to be met. We didn't believe the number back in this time we did the CVR. And I think that's been confirmed but that doesn't diminish the very significant progress that has been achieved on getting the Allston facility back up and running. So, perhaps, Elias, you could address the Multaq question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, in the first question you asked, Tim, was whether or not we can be confident that Multaq will not be removed. I think personally that I can never predict the behavior of regulatory agencies, but we're confident that in its current indication, Multaq shows all of the evidence that we had accumulated in the ATHENA trial and, specifically, in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation.</p>
          <p>But remember that we focused on that population because early patients in early atrial fibrillation that have converted to sinus rhythm or were in sinus rhythm at the beginning of the therapy, whereas the PALLAS trial is completely different. It is a permanent atrial fibrillation population over six months and these patients, as you know, have a higher incidence of underlying cardiovascular issues. So, I don't think the ATHENA trial or the other populations that you mentioned are comparable.</p>
          <p>So, from my standpoint, I think we need to fully evaluate the data. As you asked the question about adjudication, as of last week, we had a 40% rate of adjudication both the EMEA and FDA, you know, want to see all the data over the summer and we're adjudicating, hopefully, we'll be fully adjudicated by September and that will give us a basis really to come back to you and tell you what we think. Again, I think it's important to understand that the expansion of the indication was really never included in our projections, as you know. We do not do that until we have positive results and are in line for registration.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions please. A follow-up on the manufacturing issues at Genzyme, can you please give us a guideline, any guidance on the volumes you think you will be able to reach for Fabrazyme and Cerezyme and also, if possible, the sales amount corresponding to that volumes for 2011?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Eloxatin in the U.S., can you please give us an update on the situation regarding the patent litigation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I mean I think that in terms of the volumes, the only thing that we can tell you now is that, you know, we believe that we can continue to supply Cerezyme patients. So, all Cerezyme patients are getting the full dose today and so we consider &#x2013; we believe that there'll be consistent manufacturing going forward and essentially supply and demand are in sync.</p>
          <p>We're mostly just trying to get the yields up a little bit so that we can start to build further stock. Fabrazyme, we've said that the essentially supply will increase when we have the Framingham facility approved. So, at this stage I think we're expecting, you know, stable second half production, perhaps some increase, but I think at the moment we are willing to commit to being able to maintain supply for existing patients and then we can update the forecast once the Framingham facility comes online.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not yet, I mean, we have some inventory, but it is still fairly tight and that's why we need to production level somewhat to be able to really build up stock.</p>

          <p>No, the appeal, it says &#x2013; hearing is set but there is no exact date, so it is entirely up to the district judge who has re-received the trial and evidently they have neither knowledge nor influence on the setting of the trial.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Leuchten from Barclays Capital. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have two questions please. Number one on your guidance, it looks like you've amended that for Genzyme, and Genzyme only, despite the fact that your growth platforms are going quite well, your tax rate is coming down. I was just wondering, do I read caution into that? Your peers, specifically in the UK, have made very cautious comment about the industry outlook, not only this year but certainly going forward. So, any color there would be welcome.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, on the Genzyme synergies, I'm surprised not to see more synergies coming out of the R&amp;D side. I thought that would maybe be where most of the overlap between the organizations are. Why isn't there more synergy potential at this point in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the guidance, this is essentially our best estimate of what the outlook is. There's still an awful lot moving around. There's some &#x2013; we shouldn't forget that we still have &#x2013; we lost Xyzal and we've had Ambien CR which we intend not to say, but which have an impact on the results. Obviously, if we can do better, we'll continue to do better, but today, I will say, we don't really see anything on the immediate horizon in terms of the U.S. or U.S. pharma outlook.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the situation in Europe remains challenging and you're seeing some recent moves in Spain, for example, to have an across-the-board reduction in price. So, just given where deficits are, I think most of the industry would like to see how that shapes up. But as of today I'd say that's where we believe the company is going to go. In terms synergies on R&amp;D, I'll let Elias take that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are two reasons that I can give you. First of all, the perimeter of synergies in R&amp;D is not what was initially in the budget of R&amp;D at Genzyme. For example, the initial R&amp;D budget was $821 million approximately but some of that was not really R&amp;D. It was product support and in our approach to R&amp;D expenditures at Sanofi, these would have been more appropriately allocated to different areas. So, the synergies are really achieved on two-thirds of the pre-existing Genzyme budget and that's what you see.</p>
          <p>The second is that we have decided to actually concentrate all of our research activities in Boston in what we call a Boston hub and, therefore, if you looked at the total plan that concerns the rest of R&amp;D, it didn't make sense to extract more synergies out of the Boston region, because remember we have Sanofi Pasteur there plus oncology and we think it's a strategic move for R&amp;D to have a much larger footprint in the Boston area because of the Open Innovation model that we are adopting. So, those are the reasons why you might see a little bit of a discrepant sort of percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. One of the things on this that we haven't really included in this is the full impact of what Genzyme will do for the overall company. I mean, to give you an example, really the acquisition of Genzyme and Merial put us in a much different situation in the U.S., for example. So, two years ago, we had a pharma operation in New Jersey and a vaccine operation in Pennsylvania.</p>
          <p>Well, now, with these five businesses that we have, we can move to a much different &#x2013; we've moved to a shared service transaction model, now moving to a shared support function model, not only is there to help achieve synergies in Genzyme and Merial, but we would expect to see cost savings in the rest of the business, which we actually haven't put in here because they're not necessarily specifically the result of the integration savings.</p>
          <p>So, some of the savings are coming out, we haven't fully evaluated all of those. I think Elias is going also through an exercise in all of R&amp;D now and saying, okay, there are some immediate synergies. So, in other words, what we were trying to do is establish some very clear accountabilities for some immediate synergy targets that we need to achieve, but there are &#x2013; it's kind of a second layer, if you like, of looking at, okay, now as we look at the broader group with all of these businesses, are there further cost savings that we can be making, and those aren't really in these numbers.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, I have a couple of questions on the enzyme business Genzyme. So, firstly on Cerezyme, can you quantify the impact of the Latin American tender in the second quarter? And on Cerezyme, are you seeing switch back from VPRIV? Could you just give a bit of color on what the split of patients that you're seeing there.</p>
          <p>And then on Fabrazyme, how confident are you that you can regain share in Fabry's in that ex-U.S. region, given that Shire has had an opportunity there? And then on Eloxatin, was there a stocking effect during the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And then finally on the tax rate, obviously, you are now guiding to that lower tax rate, but over time, should we still expect it to creep up as you lose the benefits of the lower tax from the Plavix apropos royalties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luisa, I'll take the Eloxatin first, it's the easiest. There was there was no stocking effect in country, we found a little bit more stock of the generics than we had expected, so there is no stocking effect on our side at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, do you want to take Cerezyme, Fabrazyme?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think the first question was on the Brazilian tender, that was less than 10% of the overall total. I don't have the exact number here, but to give you a perspective. With regard to switching in the VPRIV Cerezyme market, these enzyme replacement markets tend to have relatively little switching overall. I think we're still pretty early in that experience, but I would say for the moment, both companies have supply constraints which are impacting the overall markets.</p>
          <p>So, it's not particularly dynamic from a switching standpoint, so we'll see where that goes, it's quite early. Next, we got Fabrazyme, of course, that's a more complicated history where when we prior to having the supply limitations back in 2009 in competitive markets, for example in Europe, we had in excess of 70% share. With the shortage, we actively worked with Shire to move patients to REPLAGAL product in markets where REPLAGAL was available to ensure that all patients in those markets could access, at least to the greatest extent possible, some form of enzyme replacement therapy.</p>
          <p>So, I think, how confident are we? We took 70% share in the beginning based on what we felt was a strong competitive positioning in terms of the value offering of Fabrazyme. I think once we get back to full supply, we'll see how this market shakes out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just quickly ask, with the CVR and the milestone payment that you're going to miss this year, how are you actually being controlled for best efforts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know actually, it's all Genzyme team that has been doing the manufacturing and, in fact, it was the head of Genzyme manufacture up until the 30th of June. He has decided to leave the company for personal reasons and, resultingly, we've appointed the former head of Sanofi Pasteur manufacturing, he was previously head of global manufacturing of Sanofi Pasteur, and so he has stepped across to become the Global Head of Manufacturing for Genzyme.</p>
          <p>But essentially where we are is because we produce the enzyme in lots and then we purify it and, given the lead times, we can kind of already see that the enzyme that has to be produced for the second half of the year already exists and the lots that will be produced in the second half of the year won't be purified in time for the end of the year. So, we already know the yields. We already know the lead times and, in fact, actually Henri Termeer has been within the company up until 30th of June. So, I think plenty of people have had oversight and it's all pretty clear. So, I don't know, David, did you want to add anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just going to add one other thought. I mean, in terms of the diligence, the Genzyme employee base, I mean, the CVR was out there. But the intensity and the pressure to make products given the patient populations that we serve is extremely high. So, again, it's hard to quantify that, but I think if that helps at all, understand the pressure and the drive was here was less the CVR than just the fact that we've been underserving these markets and that's a pretty high motivation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and given that we could sell anything we could produce. I mean, obviously, there is a whole lot more interest in producing more and also for the reasons that David pointed &#x2013; do you want the one about tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I mean, yes, you're right, Luisa. I mean, you still should assume that there will be an uptake in the tax rate when we lose &#x2013; I mean, when our patents, in particular on Plavix, comes to an end. So, we are continuing to optimize as you can see and we manage to be a bit better than what we were expecting and take advantage of evolution of tax registrations here and there.</p>
          <p>But I think that you could assume that we should be back to somewhere between 28% and 29% next year or probably going closer to 30%, let's say, after we have totally lost patent on Plavix, of course, unless there is some other products going forward which could -- I mean patented products which will come into production. But, if think about the coming two years, I mean, this is what I can give you as a overall average guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. On Multaq and the PALLAS data, just given the contraindications on heart failure, are you able to say whether the cardiovascular events correlated with severity of the heart failure? And then, one quick second question which should be straight forward, in terms of globalizing Genzyme, should we continue to assume that Allston and Framingham are the facilities needed to fulfill incremental global capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the &#x2013; this is Elias Zerhouni &#x2013; in terms of cardiovascular events and correlation with the level cardiovascular failure, we know already that there is in fact a correlation that is the more severe the cardiovascular failure, the more likely you'll have a cardiovascular event. We know that from the previous studies and that's why in the current indication, we do not recommend the use of Multaq for Class IV congestive heart failure, for example. So, we know scientifically there is such a correlation.</p>
          <p>In the PALLAS study, obviously, we had more severe patients who had permanent atrial fibrillation as opposed to the current indication with non-permanent atrial fibrillation, and by nature, you'll have more severe patients in that category. Now, in terms of data relative to the PALLAS study in terms of fully evaluating the correlation, we're not through that analysis yet, we have not adjudicated every case. We are doing this diligently and hopefully, by September, we'll know in more specific terms. That's the answer to your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any risk though that the contraindication on heart failure could be in the current indication could be moved to less severe forms of heart failure based on the PALLAS data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the current indication, we actually do not recommend it and it is in the label to use it in severe Class III or Class IV, so it's already, we know that correlation and we see a very good reason to use Multaq in Class I, II or mild Class III. So, it's already in there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in regard to global manufacturing supply, so between Allston and Framingham, we currently are supplying our existing population out of six 2,000-liter bioreactors in Allston, with approval of the Framingham plant and the bioreactors will come on sequentially, but we will end up with four additional 2,000-liter bioreactors and that will, as I said, enable us to supply globally both the Fabry and Gaucher populations.</p>
          <p>Our Myozyme and Lumizyme patient population is served out of our Halle, Belgium plant where we have two 4,000-liter bioreactors with a third 4,000-liter bioreactor scheduled to be approved by end of this year.</p>

          <p>We'll have the next question from Mr. Graham Parry from Merrill Lynch. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks for taking my questions and I was just wondering first of all, on the guidance uplift, if I just look at the top end of the range and compare it to the previous guidance is down 5%. The difference really here is the 3% mechanical Genzyme accretion with no synergies that you talked about on the Q1 call. Yet, there you should theoretically be benefiting from some synergies on a better tax rate.</p>
          <p>So, does that mean you're seeing something in the business which is worse now than it was when you gave your prior guidance at the beginning of the year, and if not, is there any Genzyme synergies we should be expecting to accrete through the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>Second, on the Eloxatin case, if you can you just give us a feel for why wouldn't the Eloxatin judge rule the same way in the Sun case as he did previously and then thirdly, question on iniparib, just wondering if you're in a position now to confirm whether you need a new Phase III trial for the second third line triple negative breast cancer indication? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Graham, let me take the first question. I'm not totally in agreement with your math. We gave an initial guidance between, and there was no Genzyme at the time, between minus 5% or minus 10%. At that time, we had no generic of Taxotere. We had generic of Xyzal. So, clearly to reach the higher range of the guidance, we had to assume that there would not be any generic and we don't know, if you remember at the time, when would happen, for instance, the generic of Taxotere.</p>
          <p>So, if I take the Genzyme aside, by no way if I put me back to where we were in February, we would have been able to reach 5%. So, the higher range of the guidance. So, it's not just adding an upper range of the guidance and having this nice Genzyme on top of that. We have more information. And unfortunately, I mean what we've said in February, I mean there are now generic of Taxotere. We don't know yet exactly what will happen on Lovenox, so clearly, I mean, if there is no generic of Lovenex up to the end of the year, it will help us to be on the high range of the new guidance.</p>
          <p>So, it has nothing to do with Genzyme or nothing to do with the rest of the business going lower than expected. It's clearly how you come back to not only math, but also history of the various time where we &#x2013; when we announce the settlements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps on Eloxatin, I mean, the basic answer of course must be that we cannot speculate on the outcome of a patent trial, especially not in the U.S. In this specific case, I remind you that we already had lost this case about one and half years ago, which was totally against our own odds and then we have won it again. So, of course, I tend to your underlying optimism, why should we lose it, but evidently we cannot exclude it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of iniparib, internally, we are focusing on understanding the results that we have had. We have ongoing trials, as you know, we have a Phase III in non-small-cell lung cancer. We are focusing on understanding the mechanism of action more precisely, and I think we have made progress there.</p>
          <p>We are identifying biomarkers that are more predictive of response, and obviously, once that's done, we'll make that determination obviously in terms of Phase III, but at this point, I cannot say 100% that we are going to do that, but I'll tell you that one thing we know is based on all the results we have is that is a molecule that will continue in development path as we understand it better.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just two quick ones. On the Lantus-lixisenatide combination, you mentioned in the press release, you're going to start Phase III in 2013, which I think is a bit of a delay. So, can you just give us some color as to what's causing that?</p>
          <p>And then on the global rollout of the non-enzyme replacement products for Genzyme, you mentioned Synvisc, I think, this quarter. Should we expect a sort of big impact for the rest of this year? Is it going to be more 2012 and would you dare to sort of give us any numbers as to what sort of revenue synergies we might see? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the lixi-Lan, the combination, the explanation is very straight forward, the FDA changed its stance in terms of how to conduct trials when you do combinations by insisting that the device used for commercial application be the same device that we used for the Phase III trial and putting together a device that can accomplish that goal delayed the program by the appropriate amount of the time. That's the only reason that the program is delayed at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to talk about the revenue synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, I think, two things about Synvisc to keep in mind; one is the viscosupplementation market does have a significant seasonality. Q2 tends to be by far the strongest quarter, but then we tend to hold on Q3, Q4 with Q1 often being a down quarter. So, again, if you look at that product going forward, keep that in mind. Second is, in Genzyme's hands that product was predominantly a U.S. product and the vast majority of the revenues came out the U.S. with relatively little presence outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>So, the advantage is that putting this together with the Sanofi organization is that their global reach will provide, I think, a significant opportunity. What will determine the rate of growth in global markets, as with any products is reimbursement and that's something that again will take some time and certainly a number of countries to work through. So, whether it will be a 2012 event that you will see the big ex-U.S. growth or in the subsequent years, again we will see. But those will be the factors that will dictate sort of the performance of that product going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon all. Two questions, firstly for J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me, you put out a figure of &#x20AC;0.75 to &#x20AC;1 of accretion from Genzyme in 2013 on announcing the deal. Just wondered whether you have sort of rerun the numbers and whether there is &#x2013; firstly, whether you can sort of give us confidence that you are happy with that range still and whether there is any finessing of that that range?</p>
          <p>And secondly, a question for Elias, we had a lot of data recently at the ADA, et cetera, on potential Lantus competitor Degludec, just wondered if you could give us your perspective on that and how you expect to compete the Lantus against Degludec in future? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, on your first question, I maintain the guidance. I remind you that it was based on an exchange rate of dollar against the euro of 1.3 and I think that this is a range which we can confirm taking into account the ramp-up of the CNG as well as the growth profile of the various products of Genzyme.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the question on Lantus and Degludec; I mean, clearly when you look at the published data, there are lots of questions that we have about exactly the construct of the head-to-head trial. As a physician, I can tell you, you will have different rates of hypoglycemia, if you take an insulin at midnight as opposed to dinner time and we think that by construct, these make appear &#x2013; I mean, make some difference appear, not really significant in the relevant categories.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think there has been any &#x2013; there is no evidence to my satisfaction that Lantus is not actually the best basal insulin at this point. We'll see more data as they are published. We don't have the full data; we do have data ourselves comparing dinner time versus midnight versus other times of the day. So, we published them seven years ago and we've had over 10 years experience in that. So, we are very confident that Lantus will hold its own.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I'll go a little further. I mean, I think, when those data were presented at ADA, I can tell you there were number of physicians in the audience that questioned me with some of the ethics behind that study of trying to artificially induce even more hypoglycemia, and I think dosing, we had two products who are comparators at different times is not, in my view, a fair comparison. And so, we'll be able to show a little bit more data, but quite honestly I seriously question the ethics behind that &#x2013; the way that those data...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking my question. Firstly, J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me I just want to confirm you gave an SG&amp;A guidance for the year range of 25% to 26%? Secondly, you haven't mentioned that much about why the non-BRIC growth rate was so low, if you could go into that in bit more detail. And then finally, how stable is the Cerezyme net pricing been since coming back on to the market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll take the non-BRIC first. Once again, we see &#x2013; I think it has been said before that there are certain differences between the second quarter 2011 and the second quarter 2010 which is a little bit more true for the non-BRIC countries which has to do with seasonality of cough and cold seasons and other technical effects like the situation in Russia.</p>
          <p>Now, outside BRIC, we see a lesser growth in two major markets, one is Russia inside BRIC of course and the other one is Turkey which is for us one of the major outside BRIC emerging markets. In Turkey, it has mainly to do with price cuts which appeared by the end of last year, not at the beginning of this year. So, this is what you see, beside I see no substantial differences. Once again, it's a technical effect and it's also a specific effect on Turkey.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In regard to the sales and pricing question, so obviously, pharmaceutical pricing globally is under increased pressure and we are not immune from that in the rare disease world. But that said, we historically have done reasonably well in either being carved out as an exception or having a more moderated impact, and I would say that's where it holds. The supply shortage has had no specific impact at all on our pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the D&amp;A to sales ratio, what I meant is the following; last year, we had an average of 25.2%. Clearly, the ratio for the quarter and probably still for the coming two quarters will be affected by just the addition of SG&amp;A expense from Sanofi and SG&amp;A expense from Genzyme and clearly as long as we are implement the synergies and that you saw from this side on this specific topic, a large part of the synergy are our support functions.</p>
          <p>Definitely, the D&amp;A on top of it is also on the S part of SG&amp;A in operations, in part in Oncology. We are saying that we could &#x2013; I mean rapidly over the quarters come back to a ratio, which would be more in line with what we had in 2010, i.e., somewhere between 25% and 26%.</p>

          <p>Great, thanks for taking my question. Just a chronic specific question on Taxotere and the emerging markets; it looks sales were down about 30% in the quarter. I think traditionally as we look at some of these products entering the latter parts of their life cycle and emerging markets, we kind of expect a little bit longer of a tail.

          <p>No, once again you have seen effect of 30%, 35%, there is nothing to report. We have a similar situation inside and outside, but once again we had a price cut in Turkey, which additionally damaged the performance of the product.</p>

          <p>Yeah. All right, so I think it's time to wrap up. In our view, a solid quarter. Obviously, a busy quarter. We've been busy integrating not only Genzyme, but also Merial, because Merial is now a wholly-owned company and I think we've spent a good amount of time thinking about how to integrate both, and we now move really over the coming quarters into execution mode. Really driving the synergies out of our businesses, making sure that we can now drive a lot of revenue synergies, which we really don't quantify at the moment. But it's pretty clear on businesses like renal and in particular biosurgery that there can be a significant benefit from having Sanofi sales reps behind that.</p>
          <p>In terms of guidance, I think we've overcome a number of things and there is an increased guidance because we are more positive in our outlook. But as always, we continue to drive the businesses as hard as we can. A number of things I think we'll come back to on the 6th of September. As you know, we're doing an investor seminar. We'll be able to deeper dive into each of these a different businesses, have a look at some of the medium term outlook for those businesses.</p>
          <p>So, we certainly look forward to seeing all of you there. As I say in the meantime, we continue to march through the cliff getting it further and further behind us and we, you know, are driving our both platforms and I think I am personally extremely excited about the opportunities that both Merial and Genzyme present for the business, and I'm also, you know, I just come back and say, look, for a company where everybody thinks there is no pipeline, having six MMEs to file over the next nine months, is something I don't think I have ever seen in my career before. So, I think that provides a very positive outlook for where R&amp;D could go in the future as well.</p>
          <p>So, thanks everybody for listening and hopefully, we'll see many of you on the 6th of September. Take care.</p>
