          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Before I begin, let me remind you that my comments may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. This afternoon I will review CIBC's second-quarter results. Following my remarks, our Chief Financial Officer, David Williamson, and our Chief Risk Officer, Tom Woods, will provide the financial and risk review. Sonia Baxendale will then cover retail markets performance, and Richard Nesbitt will discuss the actions underway to refocus our World Markets business.</p>
          <p>This morning CIBC reported a net loss for the second quarter of $1.1 billion and a cash net loss per share of $2.98. Results this quarter were impacted by charges in our structured credit run-off business. Earnings apart from these charges and other items noted in our press release were $1.63 per share.</p>
          <p>Our loan losses and expenses were well controlled and our Tier 1 capital ratio, after accounting for write-downs this quarter, was 10.5%, the highest for the Canadian and U.S. money center banks. While the second quarter was a challenging period as market conditions remain difficult internally, it was very much a quarter of transition, change and progress at CIBC.</p>
          <p>We made significant progress this quarter in exiting non-core business activities, managing down our structured credit run-off activities, enhancing our risk management functions, and refocusing World Markets. We're encouraged by the progress made given the scope, range and intensity of these activities. We are confident these actions we are taking will strengthen CIBC over time, and get us back on track delivering the performance and value we had achieved in 2006 and for much of 2007.</p>
          <p>I will touch on these actions in more detail in a moment. But first, let me comment on our business performance in the quarter, starting with Retail Markets. The retail business continued to deliver solid performance this quarter. Retail Markets reported revenue of $2.2 billion and net income of 509 million. This result is lower than a year ago, primarily due to a tax recovery in the second quarter of 2007, and the Visa launch in the current quarter. Strong volume growth in cards and mortgages, as well as continued expense and loan loss performance, contributed positively to our year-over-year results. Sonia Baxendale will comment further on our retail performance and our priorities in her remarks.</p>
          <p>In the area of productivity, we continue to make steady progress. Expenses for the second quarter were 1.78 billion, down 10% from a year ago on a reported basis. Our target for 2008, which was established at the end of 2007, is to hold expenses flat to the fourth quarter of 2006, excluding FirstCaribbean and our restructuring activities. We are exceeding that target through the first half of 2008 and are confident that we will continue to deliver further progress by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In the area of balance sheet strength, we continue to be very well capitalized. As you know, we raised 2.9 billion of common equity in January to provide a capital cushion against a potential decline in market conditions. This action, along with ongoing capital discipline, has enabled us to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5% and as I said earlier, that's after taking into account the write-downs in the quarter. Our Tier 1 ratio remains well above our target of 8.5% and continues to the highest amongst the major Canadian and U.S. money central banks.</p>
          <p>So in summary, the charges in structured credit has a &#x2013; had a significant impact on our results this quarter. However, we did have solid business performance in many areas as well as continued expense and capital discipline and a high level of transition and restructuring activities.</p>
          <p>Let me know comment on the ongoing activity related to previously announced business exits, structured credits run-off, risk management and the refocusing of our World Markets business. Our primary area of focus has been on making the necessary changes to our business mix to ensure that we are in the right businesses in the right way and managing the right risks.</p>
          <p>As a part of this process, we exited certain businesses that did not fit with our strategy and desired risk profile. In January, we closed the sale of our U.S. investment banking, equities and U.S. leveraged finance business to Oppenheimer. The businesses did not fit with our risk-return hurdle. During the second quarter, we continued to provide infrastructure support and manage remaining positions related to our U.S. run-off activity. Also earlier this year, we exited our leveraged finance business in London. This business was performing well through the current environment, but carried with it potential further risk which is beyond our tolerance level through the cycle. We also have a separate team managing the runoff of our structured credit business, where our U.S. mortgage exposures were originated. As we have told you previously we are committed to exiting this business and managing downward exposures as quickly as we can. We've intentionally separated this activity and designated separate leadership under Ron Lalonde to provide added focus and minimize disruption to our core ongoing World Markets business. During the quarter, we made good progress in this area.</p>
          <p>We reduced our correlation and flow trading books by 30 billion and unwound related hedges of the same amount for a reduction in notionals of approximately $67 billion. Positions we sold were relatively low-risk and liquid and therefore we were able to exit them at a price that was close to their carry value. Doing so, we decreased the potential for tail risk in this overall portfolio. We also sold several of our U.S. mortgage exposures that were hedged by ACA and reduced other credit derivatives positions.</p>
          <p>In total, we reduced credit derivative notionals in our trading book from 152 billion to 84 billion this past quarter. David Williamson will discuss this further in his presentation. With our remaining positions, we continue to look at pricing different stress scenarios so we can assess the value of opportunities to exit. We also made progress this quarter towards enhancing our risk management capabilities. Our objective here is to ensure that all our management activities are updated to reflect not only industry best practices, but also the evolution of the marketplace that we have seen over the past several months.</p>
          <p>Our risk management review covers three areas. First and most important is ensuring we are in the right businesses. This has led us to a series of actions I just spoke about, where we are exiting non-core business areas in World Markets that do not have a history of risk-controlled earnings growth. Second, we are enhancing risk management capabilities within the business. Risk management starts with the right front office capabilities.</p>
          <p>Particularly within World Markets, we need the ability to react quickly to changes in the environment. Therefore, we are creating a risk function within World Markets, to provide a real time assessment of risks and work closely with our businesses on new strategy and product development. This group will partner closely with our corporate risk management function, but will not have any override rights relative to the central risk management group.</p>
          <p>Third, we are adapting our risk management functions to the evolving financial market risks that are present. Under the new leadership of Tom Woods, we have completed a full assessment of our risk management department and identified specific areas for enhancement. These include strengthening our talent base, simplifying our risk management structure, increasing senior management forums for debate of risk issues, and strengthening underlying processes such as stress testing and reporting. Tom Woods, our Chief Risk Officer, will provide further details on our risk management progress in his remarks.</p>
          <p>In World Markets, our review of the business has extended beyond exiting certain businesses and tightening risk control. Under Richard Nesbitt's leadership we have engaged in a bottoms-up assessment of our entire World Markets organization. Our objective is to ensure that plans for our core and profitable World Markets businesses are aligned with our clients' needs and CIBC's strategy of consistent and sustainable earnings.</p>
          <p>As part of our overall refocusing of World Markets and our stated priority to improve CIBC's productivity, we announced this week plans to eliminate 100 positions in CIBC World Markets. Combined with the other reductions year-to-date, this will reduce cash levels within World Markets by more than 15% by the end of 2010. This reduction does not include the 600 employees transferred to Oppenheimer with the sale of out U.S. investment banking and related businesses.</p>
          <p>Our goal for this work is to refocus World Markets on core Canadian client businesses with linked activities in United States, United Kingdom and Asia. Richard Nesbitt will talk more about the work underway here in a moment. In summary, we were active in the quarter on many fronts making progress in many areas. Our strategic imperative continues to be consistent and sustainable performance over the long term. This strategy has delivered strong results for CIBC over the past two years, and we believe it will again in the future. Now let me turn the meeting over to David Williamson, our Chief Financial Officer, for his financial review. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gerry. Good afternoon, everyone. My comments also contain forward-looking statements and I would remind you that actual results could differ materially. I'm going to refer to the slides that are posted on our website, starting with slide five. It's a summary of results for the quarter. At the top right you can see items of note that generated the loss per share of three dollars in this quarter. I will provide more details on structured credit run-off activity shortly, which is the largest of the items. The other large items can be described as follows:</p>
          <p>A $50 million, or $0.09 per share, charge resulting from an amendment to the calculation of credit valuation adjustment or CVA for our derivatives positions with counterparties other than financial guarantors. This adjustment results in a more consistent basis for calculating CVA for all of our derivative positions, after a move last quarter to a CVA calculation for financial guarantors, and is now driven by current market spreads versus historic default rates.</p>
          <p>Next, for the payment of the $500 million dividend for our U.S. subsidiaries of the Canadian parent bank resulted in a release of a portion of the foreign exchange losses that have accumulated within other comprehensive income, or OCI. This item does not affect total shareholders equity as it represents only a movement between OCI and retained earnings via a charge to the income statement or $21 million after-tax, or $0.05 per share. The $26 million, or $0.05 per share, of higher than normal severance, we have separately identified with this item, is the cost associated with the reduction of staffing level in World Markets that Richard Nesbitt will cover shortly in more detail.</p>
          <p>The Visa loss aggregates two divergent factors. Visa's final allocation of shares to Canada resulted in CIBC receiving more shares than we had initially anticipated. However, the IPO was completed at a lower price than originally expected. The net result of these two factors is a $22 million, or $0.05, reduction to the combined gain CIBC and FirstCaribbean had initially recorded in Q4 2007.</p>
          <p>It's worth noting that the Visa shares are still held with a combined unrealized gain of 70 million at quarter-end. Given these shares have a sale restriction for three years, this unrealized gain is not being recorded in either income or OCI. Excluding the items of note, our results this quarter were helped by higher volumes in retail markets and good expense performance, but were hurt by a challenging environment to World Markets and retail brokerage, and lower treasury revenue.</p>
          <p>As Gerry noticed, our Tier 1 capital ratio at 10.5% is the highest amongst the major Canadian and U.S. money center banks. The next slide is a summarized statement of operations on a reported basis. The largest impact on results this quarter was for charges related to our structured credit positions. These positions, along with leveraged finance, are now recognized separately as run-off activities led by a focused team with a mandate to manage and reduce the residual exposures.</p>
          <p>Slide seven provides details of the 2.5 billion in net pre-tax losses relating to our structured credit run-off activities. These losses resulted primarily from the further deterioration in the credit quality of financial guarantors, and the U.S. residential mortgage market in general.</p>
          <p>In addition, I noted the line item on the slide for net losses on disposals as we took action during the quarter to reduce our exposure. Specifically, we exited certain positions with a notional amount of 1.5 billion, that were protected by ACA at prices we believe were favorable relative to likely future values. The run-off team also exited our flow and correlation trading books producing notional exposures by 30 billion, and unwound related purchased credit derivatives for a total reduction of 60 billion in credit derivatives notional. The net cost to exit these trading books was approximately $18 million, which is included in the structured credit charge for this quarter. In aggregate, trading related credit derivatives declined by 67.8 billion this quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide eight is a summary of our U.S. residential mortgage market exposure that is hedged with financial guarantors. In U.S. dollars, the slide shows that we have 7.9 billion of credit protection, which now has a fair value of 6.2 billion. We've taken credit valuation adjustments to date of 4.7 billion, and therefore have a net fair value of 1.6 billion. After the additional provision we took this quarter of 1.8 billion, if the value of all the U.S. residential mortgage market assets and the value of all the protection from financial guarantors both fell to zero, the maximum remaining exposure shown on the slide would be 3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Coming now to the summary of our exposure to the U.S. residential mortgage market that is not hedged, after the write-downs we've taken to date, including an incremental provision this quarter of 114 million, the net exposure is now down to 105 million. Mitigating this exposure, we have subprime index hedges with a notional of 300 million, a fair value of a 197 million, and therefore remaining value of a 103 million. Given current market conditions, we may take actions to unwind some of these hedges.</p>
          <p>We have counterparty protection provided by financial guarantors, but the assets are not related to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Given the quality of the underlying assets, this portfolio continues to perform well even during the difficult market conditions we experienced in the second quarter. The far right column shows the fair value of protection we have with each counterparty, which sold 1.8 billion at the end of Q2. Against this balance we have taken aggregate credit valuation adjustments of 502 million, which includes 390 million taken this quarter for a net fair value of 1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>This next slide shows our unhedged structured credit exposure that is not related to the U.S. residential mortgage market, and is now contained within our run-off book of business. This disclosure also provides information that has been recommended by the Financial Stability Forum. Excluding for a moment, the third-party-sponsored, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, our net exposure hear is $1 billion. The notionals are listed down the left-hand side of the chart and are as follows: 346 million of AAA rated CLOs, which are supported by European based senior secured leveraged loans, 337 million of corporate debt with a fair-value of 308 million.</p>
          <p>Next is 201 million of CMBSs in FirstCaribbean, rated between A2 and AAA with a fair value of a 199 million, and 159 million of unhedged warehouse non-RMBS assets with a fair value of 84 million. Total charges taken to income in Q2 in relation to these holdings was 61 million and includes losses taken to exit positions. For clarity, I should mention we also have our real estate finance business unit that originates commercial loans and mortgages and sells commercial mortgages into CMBS programs. At this point our CMBS positions have less than 5 million, so effectively nil, and all loans and mortgages are performing.</p>
          <p>This business unit is performing well, and it's an ongoing business within World Markets, and therefore their positions are of course not included in these slides. Turning now to our third party asset-backed commercial paper conduits. In Canadian dollars we hold par value positions of 358 million in non-bank asset-backed commercial paper subject to the Montreal Accord, and 26 million in investments and conduits that are not parties to the Accord.</p>
          <p>In addition, subsequent to quarter end, we purchased an additional amount of non-bank asset-backed commercial paper with a face value of 94 million. Losses of 144 million were recognized in the quarter against these combined positions. In addition, we provide liquidity facilities of 266 million for one of the conduits within the Accord. However we believe a draw in this conduit is highly unlikely. We also provide liquidity facilities of 632 million to parties outside of the Accord.</p>
          <p>This next slide outlines our Canadian conduit positions that are part of our run-off activities. The reference portfolios consist of diversified entities, corporate loans and bonds. These conduits are in compliance with their collateral posting arrangements and as the chart shows, they post a collateral well in excess of current market exposure.</p>
          <p>Great North Trust is sponsored by CIBC and the remaining conduits are parties to the Montreal Accord. The final element of our run-off activities is European leveraged finance. We currently have 851 million of leveraged loans and underfunded letters of credit and commitments of 374 million. None of these positions are impaired.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our business results. Starting with Retail Markets. Revenues of 2.2 billion, down 70 million, or 3%, from Q2 of last year. Excluding the Visa IPO adjustment, revenue was down 50 million, or 2%, from the same period a year ago. In personal and small business banking, revenue was 540 million for the quarter, up 8% versus Q2 of last year.</p>
          <p>Deposit balances were up 5% and spreads improved. Revenue for Q3 is expected to increase with two additional days in the quarter, and a seasonal increase in mortgage activity should drive higher internal sales commissions. Imperial Service is the group covering the mass affluent customers in our branch banking network. Revenue was 239 million for the quarter, up 3% versus a year ago. Deposit balance growth, and a slight improvement in spreads were partially offset by soft market conditions that reduced trading volumes. Revenue for Q3 will benefit from the longer quarter, and higher sales missions from the anticipated seasonal increase in credit products.</p>
          <p>Retail brokerage revenue of 264 million was down 30 million, or 10%, in Q2 of last year, as more challenging market conditions drove lower transaction volumes and new issue activity. Annuitized revenue continued to grow, as annuitized balances were up 4.9% over Q2 last year.</p>
          <p>Q3 performance is highly dependant upon development in marketing conditions. Cards revenue of 415 million was impacted by the Visa IPO adjustment. Excluding this, revenue was 7% higher than Q2 of last year as balances were up 14%, offset somewhat by higher funding costs.</p>
          <p>The growth in balances represents the highest year-over-year growth since 2001, and the majority of this growth is coming from our premium cards segment, which offers a lower loan loss experience. We continue to hold the number one position in both outstandings and purchase volumes, and we continue to see strong growth in purchase volumes, which were up 7.8% over the last year.</p>
          <p>We expect higher cards revenue in Q3 as a longer quarter and seasonally higher volumes will help revenues. Mortgages and personal lending revenue was 302 million, down 54 million, or 15%, from Q2 of last year. Mortgages revenue decreased 6% in Q2 of last year, mainly due to higher funding costs, partially offset by volume growth.</p>
          <p>Despite the highly competitive market, we continue to maintain our market share, as residential balances continue to show strong growth, and are up 13% from a year ago. Personal and small businesses lending revenue was down 44 million, or 24%, from Q2 of last year, mainly due to higher funding costs. Total personal balances were up 6% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in our secured portfolio, which was up 15% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We saw a modest growth in the unsecured and small business portfolios this quarter after a 11 consecutive quarters of decline in these portfolios. The outlook for mortgages and lending revenue is for a modest improvement in Q3. FirstCaribbean revenue was 122 million in Q2, down 28 million, or 19%, from Q2 of last year, mainly due to a stronger Canadian dollar and the effect of the Visa IPO adjustment.</p>
          <p>Other revenue of 124 million was down mainly due to a lower treasury revenue. Retail Markets net income after tax was 509 million, down 108 million from the prior year. Excluding the Visa IPO adjustment and a tax recovery in Q2 of last year, net income was down 11 million, or 2%, from Q2 of last year.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn our attention to CIBC World Markets. Revenue in Q2 was significantly affected by credit valuation charges on credit protection purchases from financial guarantors, although to a lesser extent than occurred in Q1. This quarter also included mark-to-market losses related to our exposure to the U.S. residential mortgage market and charges related to third party asset-backed commercial paper. Excluding the impact of structured credit run-off Q2 revenue of 246 million is down 174 million from Q1 due to less favorable market conditions.</p>
          <p>Looking at the individual lines of business starting with capital markets, revenue was up from Q1 due to lower credit valuation charges and lower losses from our unhedged exposure related to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Excluding structured credit, revenue was 159 million versus 208 million in Q1.</p>
          <p>Within capital markets, fixed income on currencies had lower performance this quarter primarily in the area of interest rate derivatives. This was partially offset by improved performance in global equities, where the weaker results in Canadian equities was more than compensated for by improved revenues in equity structured products.</p>
          <p>Investment banking and credit products revenue of 102 million was down 181 million in Q2. Q2 revenue was lower due in part to the sale of our U.S. investment banking and related business in January 2008. In addition Q2 saw substantially lower mark-to-market gains on corporate loans hedges as investment grade credit spread stabilized during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Investment banking revenue was lower in Q2 primarily due to lower M&amp;A and advisory revenue as well as lower equity new issue activity. Merchant banking results were down slightly from Q1's already-low levels. We had gains in distributions of 28 million, offset in part by write-downs and funding cost of 23 million. We expect low levels of earnings for the remainder of the year. Other revenue of 40 million was up 59 million from the prior quarter, which included a $70 million loss on the sale of our U.S. investment banking and related businesses.</p>
          <p>Turning to World Markets expenses. Q2 expenses of 358 million are up 7 million from Q1 due to higher litigation and severance expenses, partially offset by lower performance-related compensation. During the quarter, World Markets recorded a severance expense of 26 million and it is expected that the ongoing annual expense savings will exceed this amount. World markets reported a net loss of 1.6 million. Excluding the impact of structured credit losses, net income was 35 million.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our total expenses and our performance versus our 2008 target. Our target is to hold our expenses flat relative to annualized 2006 fourth quarter expenses. To ensure a reasonable comparison, we have excluded expenses relating to FirstCaribbean, the U.S restructuring, our structured credit run-off activities and other items of note this quarter.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the slide, we are running ahead of our objectives to continue to expense discipline. Thank you for your attention. I will now turn it over to Tom Woods.</p>

          <p>Thanks, David. My comments may contain forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. Slide 54 credit risks, specific loan loss provisions in the second quarter were 174 million or 41 basis points of net loans and acceptances. Quarter-over-quarter increase of 3 million was due to $17 million of increase in the retail markets, partially offset by $14 million decrease in World Markets.</p>
          <p>World Markets reported a net recovery of 3 million in the quarter. We had several reversals in the quarter and new provisions were down from the first quarter. Retail markets, specific loan loss expense was 177 million. Current portfolio provisions were up due to slightly higher seasonal losses and volume growth.</p>
          <p>Net impaired loans decreased to 315 million at the end of Q2. The decrease from the previous quarter was largely due to the sale of one loan in World Markets' U.S. portfolio, as well as decreases in several of our Canadian portfolios. Turning to Market Risk, slide 55 shows the Q2 distribution of revenue in our trading portfolios. In Q2, 53% of trading days were positive, up from 50% last quarter but down from 75% last year.</p>
          <p>Trading revenue here does not include the reductions in mark-to-market value of our structured credit assets, as we do this work only at each month end.</p>
          <p>Slide 56, the Tier 1 ratio was 10.5%, the impact of structured credit write-downs was partially offset by internal capital generation and reduced risk-related assets, including the effect of receiving OSFI approval in reducing the debt-to-one floor factor to 90%, which helped the Tier 1 ratio by 24 basis points.</p>
          <p>As Gerry said, at 10.5% our capital position remains among the strongest of the North American banks and on that metric, number one among the money center banks in North America, and provides substantial cushion in the event we have further structured credit charges. I would like to spend a few minutes now talking about Risk Management, CIBC.</p>
          <p>Since I became Chief Risk Officer, we've launched a number of initiatives and made several changes to the way we oversee risk. The overarching objective we have is to build a risk culture that is aligned right across the business, not just in the Risk Management Department. And that could be sustainable in good times and bad. To this end, we've made &#x2013; we have four main areas of focus and those are on Slide 57. Risk Appetite, Risk Governance, Risk Organization and Risk Reporting/Transparency. Let me spend a moment on each of these. We started with formalizing our risk appetite statement, which will provide the basis for establishment of individual business line risk limits and guidelines.</p>
          <p>Our risk appetite is consistent with our overall business strategy, which as Gerry said, is to provide &#x2013; is to focus on our core franchise and deliver consistent, sustainable earnings without the kind of volatility we have experienced recently.</p>
          <p>Specifically, our objective is to be a AA-rated bank and to be seen by investors and other stakeholders as a low-risk Canadian bank with high-quality earnings. To get there and stay there, we will be monitoring our progress against a number of metrics, including backward-looking metrics, such as earnings and share price volatility, versus our competitors.</p>
          <p>And more importantly, several forward-looking metrics, including four that we have used for several years and reported externally: the Tier 1 ratio, earnings per share growth, the loan loss ratio, and our retail/wholesale business mix. We will also have targets on other metrics, such as the buffer of tangible common equity, <mark type="inaudible" /> on the capital, trading bar as a percentage of tangible common equity, maximum stress test losses we will tolerate, and our funding liquidity horizon.</p>
          <p>In developing a risk appetite statement, and indeed in reassessing everything we do in risk management, we have engaged our senior business line people, the risk management committee of the Board and our full board. We have also used outside advisors to ensure we are up-to-date on the emerging best practice among the top performing financial institutions globally.</p>
          <p>For the topic of risk governance, an important initiative has been the changes we have made to the senior management committees that oversee our risk positions, and approve new product launches and significant new trading strategies. We have expanded membership on these committees, and are providing enhanced discussion material, including more extensive scenario analysis and stress testing.</p>
          <p>Having said all of this, I would have to say that our willingness to embark upon many new initiatives with elevated levels of risk is low at the moment, given the challenging market conditions we continue to face. Organizationally, we've made several important changes. As the Chief Risk Officer I will be going from having eleven people reporting to me, down to six, including consolidating all of our corporate credit risk staff under one person, combining market risk management with counterparty credit risks and traded credit risks under our newly created position, staffed by a senior person we have just recruited externally.</p>
          <p>Another senior external hire we've just made, reporting to me, will oversee credit portfolio management with the current incumbent moving into a new important role, resourcing the risk committee reporting I mentioned a moment ago.</p>
          <p>The head of our retail credit risk group was appointed to his role late last year from our credit card risk management group, meaning that overall we will have a substantially new and very experienced risk management leadership team. In addition, as Richard Nesbitt can elaborate on, he has formed a small group within CIBC World Markets to provide supplemental risk management oversight within the business. As Gerry said, this group will not have override rights relative to the central risk management group, but will, we believe, further enhance the alignment and accountability in our wholesale business for risk management.</p>
          <p>Finally, risk reporting and transparency. This is the underpinning of sound risk management governance. Although our reporting from the front lines and from our analytical groups is very good in most respects, we need to synthesize the data for decision-making by senior management and discussion with the board. As we make further progress in each of these four areas of focus, I'm confident we can develop our risk management capabilities to the point where they are a competitive advantage, and help us achieve our broader set of goals: to deliver more consistent financial results.

          <p>Thank you, Tom. My remarks may also include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially. This quarter was one of consistency and solid performance to the retail market. Loan loss performance was again well-contained. This is the reflection of the actions we have taken over the past 24 months in partnership with risk management.</p>
          <p>Our credit card business delivered strong results and we continue to be disciplined in the area of expenses. Across retail markets, the fundamentals of our business are tracking well, particularly with respect to balanced growth and new sales. Revenues in certain businesses, such as retail brokerage and mutual funds, were adversely impacted by the market environment. That being said, we see this is very much a market-related impact versus any systemic issues in those business areas.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly comment on our performance by business line beginning with credit cards. Credit cards outstanding grew 13% year-over-year, primarily due to premium card volume growth. We also continue to experience strong new account growth as a result of effective in-branch cross-selling to existing banking clients and new client acquisition through direct sales activity. As I mentioned last quarter, our overall portfolio credit quality continues to perform well. Our loan loss rate has decreased year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Mortgages performed at industry growth rates with balanced growth of almost 13% year-over-year. We have seen good progress in terms of both originations, as well as continued improvement in mortgage retention rate. In lending we had continued modest improvements as a result of initiatives to improve acquisition and account management. Our total personal lending balances were up by 7.3%. We improved sales activities in our unsecured portfolio, while maintaining a strong focus on credit quality. Deposit accounts and GICs also continue to perform well. Personal deposit balances grew 9.3% and GICs, 5.7%.</p>
          <p>We are focused on enhancements to our deposit offer. Yesterday, we launched an improved student banking offer and in the coming weeks, we will be launching additional new features on our checking account products that will provide incremental value to clients who consolidate their day-to-day banking transactions.</p>
          <p>Mutual funds net sales in Q2 were 613 million. In Q2 investors continued to be cautious, and mutual fund flows were primarily into short-term funds. In addition, we received four fund awards in April, recognizing mutual funds that excel and delivering consistently strong risk-adjusted performance relative to their peers.</p>
          <p>At retail brokerage revenues were down 10% due to continued volatility in the capital markets, and a significant decline in new issue activity. And in distribution, we made further progress on our strategy to enhance clients' accessibility in all of our channels. On April 3rd, we announced 13 new locations as part of our strategic plan to build, relocate and expand over 70 new branches across the country.</p>
          <p>We expanded our Montreal telephone banking center outbound capabilities in support of continued sales activities, and we are expanding our Sunday hours pilot to more branches this summer. We are strengthening our business banking by increasing our advisory capabilities through more robust and specialized trainings, enhancing the clients experience through improvements to credit processes and through the development of targeted offers to high-growth client segments.</p>
          <p>So, in retail markets overall our focus on leveraging our core strength in delivering strong advisory solutions to our clients continues to generate business growth through consolidation and attraction of new clients. This focus, combined with prudent risk management strategies and a continued disciplined approach to cost management, provide us with a solid business foundation.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Richard?</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sonia. My comments may also contain forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially. I will review CIBC World Markets quarterly performance, provide an overview of our strategic direction moving forward and offer some observations on my first three months as CEO of CIBC World Markets.</p>
          <p>As detailed by David earlier, World Markets recorded a loss of $1.6 billion, excluding the impact of structured credit losses, net income was $35 million. Excluding structured credit, overall revenues declined $174 million from Q1. As this is case throughout the industry, market and business conditions remained difficult through most of the quarter. These conditions were a major contributor to the flat or negative revenue growth we saw across our four primary lines of businesses.</p>
          <p>In our global equities business, revenues were up slightly with our equity and commodity structured products improving versus Q1. In fixed income and currencies, revenues were overall down. A bright spot was foreign exchange, where we had another strong quarter. In real estate finance, we are intentionally operating at about half of our revenue generating capacity due to the ongoing uncertainties in the commercial real estate market in the United States.</p>
          <p>In our investment corporate merchant banking area, liquidity crunch had an impact on the number of equity new ratios and advisory opportunities.</p>
          <p>The strong pipeline that had carried into Q1, as a result of robust conditions earlier in 2007, slowed during the second quarter. Despite the difficult market conditions, we were involved in a number of significant advisory deals, which underscores the strength of our Canadian franchise. Key mandates included acting as sole lead on British Columbia's $500 million, 30-year bond transaction; lead agent for a $200 million, 10-year bond deal for Union Gas; placement agent on transactions involving $350 million in convertible debentures for AbitibiBowater; book runner on a $125 million Calloway re-convertible debenture offer; joint book runner on the $357 million Aeroplan Income Fund; and book runner and co-lead manager on $250 million financing of debentures for Harvest Energy Trust.</p>
          <p>And these transactions were all good wins for us. So in addition to our focus on our clients, we are also continuing to position our business for the future. In order to ensure that all of our employees understand the direction going forward, we have set a mission statement for World Markets. And that is: CIBC World Markets mission is: to bring Canadian capital markets products to Canada and the rest of the world, and also to bring the world to Canada. To illustrate this mission, for example, we distribute Canadian fixed income and equity products from all of our Canadian offices as well as our offices in New York, London and throughout Asia.</p>
          <p>We also advised major international companies on mergers and acquisitions. For example, Rio Tinto on its acquisition of Alcan. So this mission describes what most of our employees do everyday across World Markets. In addition to the primary businesses that carry out this work, we will also be selectively involved in other activities, provided they are consistently profitable, risk-controlled and well managed. So this is a very client-focused strategy, and our goal is to be the premier client-focused investment bank in Canada. Each of our operating businesses has now completed a review with me of their activities to ensure they are consistent with the World Markets condition and strategy. This process has resulted in a number of decisions.</p>
          <p>We are investing in businesses that offer good returns and strong future growth, and at the same time, we are exiting and reducing the businesses that no longer offer strong returns, acceptable risk profile or a strategic fit. This is a major transition and it is going to take several more months to complete and it's something we must continue to manage aggressively. Doing so will allow us to transition as quickly as possible to our most important long-term task: growing a World Markets business that delivers outstanding service and value to our clients, and consistent financial returns to our CIBC shareholders.</p>
          <p>As a result of this business review, we announced earlier this week we are eliminating 100 positions across World Markets, and these are a mix of management and administrative positions. The total number of positions in the World Markets has been reduced by about 15 per cent since the beginning of the fiscal year. This includes the impact of changes to our business earlier this year, for example, the exit of our European leveraged finance business and the exit of our structured credit business. It does not include the impact of a sale of U.S. businesses to Oppenheimer earlier this year. These most recent reductions resulted in a severance charge of $26 million in Q2 and we expect the annual savings be greater than that amount. World Markets will now have approximately 1,100 employees and four primary lines of business.</p>
          <p>So why not conclude my remarks with some early observations during my first three months as CEO of CIBC World Markets. This is clearly a strong franchise with the legacy of talent and strong client relationships. As we realign our focus, there is a major opportunity to build this business. This requires a disciplined approach to delivering value to our clients, and internally it requires effective leadership and management, risk control and profitability. I've been encouraged by the attitude and commitment of the professionals in our firm during a difficult time in the industry, and I'm looking forward to working with this team as we continue to build our leadership position in the marketplace. I'll now turn it back to John.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, since the valuation adjustments were done based on the CDS spreads of the guarantor or the counterparty, is it fair to say that it's not really indicative of the guarantor's ability to pay?  There may be some write-ups on these valuation adjustments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The move to using a credit spread is really just to make sure we're using the market view of the credit quality of each of these guarantors. In the past what we used was the historic rates of default. So, we feel, by going to the credit spread as a measure of credit quality, it is a better barometer and better basis for calculating a credit valuation adjustment. And what you maybe referring to, but I am not 100% sure, is during the course of this quarter we've now made a move on the credit valuation adjustments that we're booking on the derivatives that aren't the financial guarantors. And again, with a view of moving that methodology to be more in sync with looking at credit spreads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then, I have another question. Based on slide 8 through 11, if there's continued deterioration in underlying assets or the guarantors, could there be an additional write-down of about 5 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just bear with me one second I will get to those slides. That was &#x2013; if you could remind me what slides you are looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>8 through 11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>8 through 11. Okay. So, depending on for example 8, by all means what we've got on slide 8 is a &#x2013; that is the real estate hedge position, so that slide do show that you have got in effect a total potential exposure of $2.2 billion, half of which is a difference between a notional amount of 7.9 billion, and the fair value, right. So you could have another roughly 1.5 billion charge there if the value of the underlying continues to erode and say goes right to zero. And then you've got another 1.5 billion, in the far right column, which is the amount of protection we are looking to the financial guarantors for, and if they were to fall away or that protection totally went to zero, there will be another 1.5 billion there. So, to your question, yes. If the financial guarantor, on this particular slide for example, if the financial guarantors failed completely on this slide, slide 8, there would be 1.5 billion of incremental exposure.</p>
          <p>And that would be true of any slide where we have financial guarantor support. So again if you went to slide 10, which is non-real estate exposure, that also is backed by financial guarantors and they're in the right-hand column, for the current fair value of 1.8 billion, we have reserved, as you said, using the credit spread methodology, we have reserved 500 million. So our net exposure there is 1.3 if all the financial guarantors were to fall away</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gerald, again my question deals with the CDS portfolio, I was just wondering, in looking at the stuff on page &#x2013; The purchase option under Credit Derivatives, I mean, we actually see on 31 that reduction of about $30 billion there. The fair values come down by just over a billion. My question is, what caused the risk-weighted amount rise by almost 3.8 billion, when the hedge amount and the credit equivalent were coming down? It sort of suggests that there is a shift in the mix of the counterparty credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, it's Tom Woods. So the risk-weighted amount &#x2013; you are referring to slide 32, are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's 8.4 billion now, up from 4.6.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually it's above, Tom the credit equivalent amount, which suggests that the remaining counterparties are perhaps non-rated. Is that the correct interpretation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Brad. It's the &#x2013; so just rather the slide 32 under the Q2 '08 purchased options, the 8.4 billion was very seriously affected by the Basel II impact on the downgrades of the monolines. That is why the RWAs are up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's the reason for the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's more than offsets the reduction in notionals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. I guess I have one other question, just if I could. The 1.84 fair value on slide 10 that we're just looking at, I believe that's up about $1 billion from the end of the first quarter and that's roughly a 4% development rate. I'm just wondering what's your expectation for that development rate in that non-USRMM exposure? Do you think that's going to go up by 4% a quarter, was there something particular in this quarter that caused it to almost double?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Brad. You are right. It's the last quarter that valuation was about 885 million, if memory serves, and we're now at 1.8. So I guess one thing is that Q2 particularly was a tough quarter around, March was a tough time. The overall indices have come back in this space, I bet you would know this probably better than I. So the underlying indices have come back, but these instruments here are not as liquid by a fair stretch relative to the indices. So that's where the indices have bounced back from the low point in March.</p>
          <p>We saw these track down with the indices through that period, but not to get the same bounce back, and we think that's primarily a result of the illiquidity, the instruments we get evaluations like those price points, and we think that the case is that they certainly rolled them down with the market, and they're less likely to post bids that have rebounded. So it's really I think relevant to the liquidity issue, relative to the indices.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. What's the purpose of the risk management group in World Markets if it has no override authority, and will this group be involved in pricing decisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Hi, it's Richard. So the purpose of this group is really to be on top of risks as they happen on a real time basis day-by-day, and to assist the line managers in assuring that they are looking for the changing nature of risk. A trade that is put on at one point in time may change completely with external events, even though the risk parameters don't change or the risk limits don't change and I want our people to be very much on the top of the changing nature of the risk. As far as the pricing decisions, no, they are not going to be involved in pricing decisions, but they will be very much involved in any new initiatives that we have working with Tom Woods' risk management group to ensure that any new initiatives are fully vetted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael, it's Gerry here. When we talk about no override, you got to remember that the central risk management group, for governance purposes and all of the usual processes that are in place in all the banks, sets the limits and that's the group that's under Tom Woods, and you've heard what he has said about the actions that he is taking within the central risk management group. What Richard is talking about is, how he manages within those limits and I can assure you that, the group working under Richard, if they wish to manage at a lower level than those limits, because as Richard said of the evolving risks, that group working with Richard Nesbitt, most definitely has the capacity to manage risk at a lower level than the central limits that are set by Tom Woods' group. And that's what Richard is trying to do, he is trying to have more acute and rapid allocation within the business of risk, working within and with no override in light of the firm's governance as to overall risk limits that are set centrally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I asked about risk override and pricing together because as much as we like to avoid risk, if we get paid for risk, that's okay. The problem is when you take risk, but you don't get paid for it. So this is what I'm really getting at. Can you speak to that and that can be within the normal operating parameters, so what I'm really getting at is, how will this group ensure that a product in World Markets properly get rewarded for risk that's being taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you mean that they properly get rewarded in terms of we allocate our resources to the most profitable and on a risk/return basis or do you mean, we eliminate businesses that don't have acceptable risk return profile?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I mean is that you ensure that products are priced properly for the risks that are being taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's actually a very good point. I think you are right. Some of the activities that investment banks have been involved in in the past throughout the industry have not had an acceptable return relative to the risks that they have taken. So the way we've started to get at that and I think there is always more work to be done, is we have gone through each and every business now as of the end of May, each and every business activity that World Markets is involved in, and as a result of that, certain of those activities that we were still involved in, even after the exits of certain businesses, certain of those activities we are exiting or reducing or repricing. So I think that's a line manager's job to ensure that we're getting the proper return for the risk that we're taking. And it's also the line manager's job to ensure that we get out of businesses where we're not generating the proper risk return in that profile, and we've done quite a considerable amount of that in the last two quarters.</p>

          <p>Sonia, when I think about CIBC retail markets, there's been a lot of changes over the past few years. You have largely exited the unsecured lending business, you've done a lot of work on trying to build the business. I'm really having a difficult time seeing how &#x2013; give me your comments on how share is good and you're holding your own &#x2013; how it seems as if you've meaningfully underperformed your peers this quarter. In a quarter with pretty good loan growth and a quarter where your loan loss is actually down, the pre-tax earnings are down, I mean what's the growth rate of the business as you think about it going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ian, I think there are a number of factors that go into this. I would say we had strong volume growth in our card, our mortgages and our deposit businesses. We had good expense management and we had positive loan losses as you described. A few factors that negatively impact us. One, if you look at our lending business, which as you've described, we've had good strong growth in our secured balances, but we have had far less than market growth in our unsecured. So that mix shift over the year has certainly has an impact to us in terms of our spreads.</p>
          <p>We've had higher funding costs in this particular period through internal transfer pricing. And we've had &#x2013; we've been challenged in the business lending area. So we've been growing at less than market in that area. Add to that an environment that has negatively impacted, and I think this would be industry-wide, retail brokerage and mutual fund revenues. Those are the factors that would cause us to be where we are, but I would emphasize that in cards, deposits and mortgages, I would say the growth is quite strong and in the other areas that I have referenced, they are either market-driven or we have initiatives in place to work towards narrowing that gap, most specifically in lending, both personal and business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If Canadian loan growth, which has been double-digits slows to single-digits, what do you think you can grow your business at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's reasonable to expect that we would be coming into line with the industry. So we'd be in mid-single digits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Darko Mihelic from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have, maybe a question here for Tom Woods. Tom, have you actually filed any claims with the Monoline and if you have, have they paid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer for that is no to the first question and the second question is not applicable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And a question again, maybe getting back to Sonia on the retail side. I wanted to drill down a little bit more into some of the revenue line items and understand what the possibility is for a springback. I mean, when I look specifically at mortgage and at personal lending, when you mentioned that you had industry growth rates of 13%, that revenues dropped by 15% in that line of business. I'm just want to understand how much could you get back on the funding side, perhaps, or maybe you could just run me through how badly affected you have been by margins in that businesses, and why you continue to run it at such high growth rates, and yet margins are declining so fast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a couple of pieces to it, so let's separate, Darko. We separate mortgages from lending. So on the mortgage front, a couple of additional factors, which are positive in terms of the business but mortgage fees from customer penalties are also down. So if you are looking at &#x2013; trying to reconcile where we are as our retention levels have improved.</p>
          <p>So retention level is going up &#x2013; is a good thing over the longer term.</p>
          <p>The other factor is as the mortgages are maturing they're being replaced by lower margins. So certainly on the mortgage front there is some repricing of the portfolio given the change in environment. On the lending side I would say that there is certainly some opportunity as we gradually increase our unsecured lending sales and as we increase our business lending, both of which are fairly high-margin businesses, that we have been significantly lagging the market in. So those would be two factors. On the funding cost side I might maybe refer that to Tom in terms of our expectations going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Darko. In Q2 the retail business was affected by the way we transfer price. I mean typically &#x2013; I don't want to get into too much complexity here, I am happy to follow-up afterwards. But we transfer price basically partway between the cash curve and the swap curve. And as you know that the cash curve diverged quite a bit this quarter. As a result the transfer pricing into World Markets assets &#x2013; or retail markets assets rather &#x2013; was quite a bit higher. Typically that comes back to an allocation to the extent the treasury does not term finance, which it didn't given the shorter term available in the marketplace. But that offset wasn't as high as the ineffective penalty due to the widening spreads. Since the quarter end as you may know spreads have come back, not to where they were a year ago. But have come back somewhat over the last 30 days or so. So I would say &#x2013; as you look forward for retail names generally. There is the same three or four factors that you show to them here: prime BA, what is your call on that, right now it's pretty steady around 165 which is a historical norm. We don't see any reason to change that. How competitive the marketplace would be, you have your own view on that I don't know that that's going to change very much.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, funds that are rolling over are being financed slightly at better rates now, now that the spreads have come back and absolute rates are down. In our case, we are likely going to be trying to extend term debt as the appetite in the market has improved. So that would probably offset the lower absolute rates in the short end, so I don't know that there is a case for much change in the ends overall.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I think that's helpful. And one last question is for Sonia. The deposit offers you are talking about, are they aimed at higher-margin products, or should we be looking at this as a way to defend what looks like being a decline in deposit market share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination, but they are aimed at higher-margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Mario Mendonca from Genuity. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Quick question sort of along the same line as funding, what can you tell us about CIBC's funding costs relative to the other Canadian banks, throughout the quarter, near the end of the quarter, in your outlook going forward and any commentary you can offer us on whether the issues that the bank has experienced in World Markets are having a detrimental effect on the bank's capacity to compete with your peers in retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I'll start on the first one, Mario; it's Tom speaking. The cost in the funds market in the short end are pretty flat almost out to one year. Once you get beyond one year, there is a bit of divergence. Through Q1, our spreads widened a bit but had come back, actually, quite nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean Q2, Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, in Q1 they widened, yeah and towards the end of Q2, since the 17th of March when the market changed, they've come back. Not completely, but quite reasonably significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the disparity relative to your peers such that the bank is at a disadvantage in retail now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say it is a material disadvantage. I think when you look at NIMs in retail, the NIMs are actually up a bit Q2 to Q1 but that &#x2013; because NIMs as you know are computer-based on interest income. But when you consolidate that with non-interest income because of the transfer pricing and treasury reallocation back. That's where the retail business here had reduced revenue. So did it materially affect retail, I mean, it's a question of degree. I wouldn't say materially, but enough to affect the comparative revenue growth, probably a couple of points. So it's not insignificant, but it's not dramatic, and I think, although I don't want to give you guidance going forward. What I can tell you, and you can verify this in the market, the spreads of the banks still into one year are pretty flat amongst each other and beyond one year have come in quite a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so CIBC is currently beyond the <mark type="inaudible" />. Certainly I see your point beyond one year. CIBC's spread over call it royalty BMS, whomever, right now you could say lower than where it was throughout most of Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely. And the banks are in a pretty narrow band right now, but certainly lower than where they were at the beginning of Q2 and even really at the end, but certainly quite a marked difference between the ends of Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And did you suggest the retail margins, NIM, they were up sequentially this quarter, Q1 to Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you use the accounting definition of NIM, which is net interest income divided by assets, it's marginally up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marginally up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as Sonia's point about higher funding costs, the way the math works on revenue is, you have to add in the non-interest income that gets allocated back because of our transfer pricing and that was down quite a bit this quarter. So net-net, when you look at margins on a macro basis, if you just took revenue divided by assets, it was down in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you help us understand margins that are going forward by providing some disclosures? I think it's the only &#x2013; CIBC might be the only bank that doesn't disclose their retail margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. We actually do &#x2013; we do disclose the NIM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do. Yeah, it's on &#x2013; what's that slide number? Slide 49. But to your point Mario, which I think is a good one, that's the biggest part of the story, and in Q2 it's the non-interest income component of the story was recently material. So we can help you on that.</p>
