          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss first quarter 2009 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the internet that can be accessed at the site www.petrobras.com.br/ir/english. Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the slide two. We may make forward-looking statements, which are identified by the use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras's results prepared in accordance with Brazilian GAAP. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues relating to US GAAP results. The conference call will be conducted by our CFO and Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions you may have. Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss first quarter results. Earnings very strong as a result of growing production, stable prices for all our key products in Brazil and lower costs. Even with low oil prices and record CapEx in the field, our cash product increased while our net debt to net capital remained unchanged at 26%. On the cover fleet, we picture the most significant development since our last conference call.</p>
          <p>On this cover is a picture of the BW Cidade de S&#xE3;o Vicente better know as the platform that is the performing, that extended well test up to peek. With the first oil on May 1, we were able to start production only 36 months, after announcing the discovery of this vast new frontier.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. First, oil and gas production in Brazil drives our business plans and our cash flow. Let me begin with the production update. During the first quarter, production in Brazil is up 7% year-over-year. We couldn't have been higher, except that we should meet 87,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas because of reduced domestic demand. On May 5, we set our record for oil production in Brazil of 2,059,000 barrels per day, we achieved above our production targets for the year of 2,050,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Next is growth in annual production was generated by increase in P-54 and the start ups of P-53 and Cidade de Niter&#xF3;i. As you can see, the three new units contributed an average of 99,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. As they catch up on their full capacity, they will help us reach our production targets for this year and next. Next slide, please. Still to be installed in 2009 are Frade and Parque das Conchas operated by Chevron and Shell respectively. Our share is 30% and 35%. Both Frade and Parque das Conchas were the result of five miles of block obtained by Petrobras in 1998 in what we call Bid Zero.</p>
          <p>In the future, more of our projects will be with Parque and the consortiums that were formed to share exploration risk during the past latest round begins production. The first production from complete well in the pre-salt of the Santos Basin began with the extended well test of TUPI on May 1. The test will last for a period of 15 months and will provide valuable information about the carbonate reservoirs and the optimal way to extract oil from the pre-salt. While the platform capacity is 30,000 barrels per day, we do not expect to produce more than 14,000 barrels per day due to the limit on the amount of gas we may draw.</p>
          <p>You can see in this slide some of the challenges we face in producing volumes at extreme condition. Fortunately, we have as many years developing the know-how, the asset base, the organization and the technology to meet these challenges. We still need more time before we can announce definitive results. But we can say now that we have not encountered anything that is expected or surprising. We continue to remain as optimistic as ever about the economic viability of this reservoir.</p>
          <p>Next, please. New discoveries for Petrobras, are not limited to the pre-salt. We continue to find a number of other new fields as a result of increased exploration. These findings, <mark type="inaudible" /> through development, that are not yet incorporated in our production target but will give us many opportunity in the years to come. We are confident that Brazil, the Brazil coast is highly prospective and will continue to yield discoveries as we explore new frontier.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2008, the price of oil continued to decline. The average price of Brent fell from $54 per barrel to 44, while the price of our own crude fell from 37 to 32 per barrel. Some unusual factors affected the price of Brazilian crudes in the first quarter such as the relationship of WTI to Brent and also how we calculate the value of our crude for internal price. This had at least effect on our overall results as the lower price of our crude oil captured in higher margin of our downstream segment.</p>
          <p>We are always seeing a substantial reduction in the second quarter of this unusual wide differential between Brent and the price of our domestic crude oil. We are also now noting an improvement in the price of Brent, which has averaged $52 per barrel during the second quarter to-date.</p>
          <p>The decline in the price of oil continues to have a positive effect on the lifting costs. Lifting costs expressed in U.S. dollars and, without government take, declined by 5%. These results would have been better, but for the full operating cost of the three new units recently installed, that were only producing 25% of the capacity. Additionally, the shrunk mean as I mentioned earlier, increased our per unit cost of production. Production tax declined substantially in the period given the linkage to international oil price.</p>
          <p>Lifting costs, include government take declined 19% quarter-over-quarter and have declined by 53% since the peak in the second quarter of 2008. The trade balance between barrels of oil and oil products exported and imported continues to improve with a surplus of 100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of '09 versus an average of 7,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of '08. Over the same periods, the commercial trade balance declined on a $775 million to a deficit of $150 million. Growing export of crude oil because of increased production and decline in diesel imports due to reduced demand were the principal cause of the improvement.</p>
          <p>Next. Our prices for gasoline, diesel and LPG did not change during the first quarter, which is consistent with our policy of pricing at international parity in the long-term. As a result, this average realization price for products sold in Brazil declined only slightly, we continue to monitor the market carefully as oil and oil product markets remain volatile and future price uncertain. For example, the price of gasoline in the U.S. Gulf Coast has increased 17% in the last 10 days, while crude oil increased 15% during the same period.</p>
          <p>Next please. The market for oil product in Brazil decreased by 6% in the first quarter of 2009 versus the first quarter of 2008. Diesel declined by 6% year-over-year, of that decline more than half was a result of utilizing diesel in the first quarter of '08 for thermoelectric power. In the first quarter of '09, there was no such contraction. The increased use of biodiesel also reduced demand. Gasoline construction was unchanged despite the growth of fuel cost, still income and a larger automobile fleet of certain economic weakness.</p>
          <p>Jet fuel demand remained constant as new airlines routes were added. Fuel oil demand was flat. Switching from natural gas offset, reduced industrial demand. And for chemical naphtha consumption felt the impact of economic downturn declining by 9%. Natural Gas fell much more decreasing by 29% year-over-year. A large part of the decline was caused by the need of thermoelectric power during the first quarter of '09, due to available hydroelectric power. The remainder of the decline was a result of less industrial demand and substitution of fuel oil or natural gas.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses: operating income more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Net revenue declined as a result of lower international oil price, but our pricing policy in Brazil limited the decline. Lower prices for our imports and lower production costs and the government take especially reduced the cost of goods sold, leading to higher gross income. Operating expenses were reduced primarily by a decline in freight cost and in G&amp;A by the cost cutting efforts that we have undertaken since the third quarter of last year. As a result of this movement, and the absence of non-recurring items that occurred in the first quarter, operating income increased 117%.</p>
          <p>Next, please. In the first quarter, our operating income was reduced by a number of non-recurring items, offset by positive financial results, minority interest and lower income tax. In the first quarter, the absence of extraordinary items led to higher operating income that was offset by negative financial results, minority interest and higher tax. In the end, this result was relatively flat.</p>
          <p>Net income: Quarter-over-quarter net financial results declined from a positive 2.5 billion to a negative R$849 million. Most of the decline occurred as a result of the exchange effect and negative ratio of the assets and liabilities in U.S. dollars. I discussed in previous calls along dollar for these accrual assets of foreign subsidiary will cost foreign exchange gain when the real was very devalued against the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>As a result of this self-devaluation real during the first quarter of 2008, monetized under exchange variation left positive income of 2.2 billion. In the first quarter of 2009, the real strengthened slightly leading to an exchange and monetary loss of R$415 million. Also affecting the financial result was a quarter-over-quarter reduction in financial income of R$620 million from a commercial hedge in the first quarter of 2008. There are strong &#x2013; consolidated investment decreased by R$735 million from the third, prior quarter, primarily from reduced monetary and exchange losses of all our petrochemical subsidiary. Included within the large offset in the first quarter is a provision of the R$141 million related to be the arbitration of the Pasadena refinery.</p>
          <p>Minority interest decreased from a R$1.9 billion to a negative R$342 million, a difference of 2.3 billion. The difference was largely attributed to the absence of debt related foreign exchange losses in the first quarter consolidated subsidiary. With a minority interest primarily SPCs established for project finance.</p>
          <p>As a result of our higher operating income that results in deduction from interest on capital debt during the first quarter of 2008, our bad debt spend increased by R$1.1 billion. While operating income more than doubled from the first quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009, as per accounting law, the effects of the exchange rate and higher tax, net income was down 6%.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Net income for the Brazilian exploration segment was down sharply as a result of the declining price. While production increased, sales declined slightly as we stocked our new platform. Lower demand for our gas approximately 87,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas to be shutting, reducing revenue potential and increasing per unit lifting cost. Costs were favorably affected by lower lifting costs, especially when considering production tax.</p>
          <p>Next please. Net income for our Brazilian downstream segment was up sharply. Our revenues decreased only slightly, while costs of production per drilled well were changed from our E&amp;P division and internationally continue to decline. Capacity utilization increased from 88% to 91% in the absence of refinery shut down. The percentage of domestic crude in our throughput increased from 78% to 80% as our refineries were adapted to process domestic crude with higher asking levels. And because reduced demand and prices for diesel made it more economical to run domestic crude while generally yields &#x2013; which generally yield less diesel.</p>
          <p>Our Gas &amp; Energy segment showed a small net loss, especially reduced sales of natural gas and less thermoelectric generation. Natural gas sales declined by 13.8 million cubic meters per day while electric generation was reduced from 2094 megawatts to 651 megawatts for our first quarter. With adequate supply of imported domestic gas and continued development of our gas infrastructure, the segment did not pay the contractual penalty that had already resulted in the past.</p>
          <p>The national operator of Brazil's electricity grid recently ordered Petrobras to dispatch 2.3 gigawatt of thermo-electric generated power to compensate for the drought in the south of Brazil. Combined with an action mechanism, we have brought in place for short term gas sale, or short term gas sales, we expect to see special increase our sales of the domestic production this quarter. Improvement in the International segment was due largely at the expense of certain items that hurt the first quarter-end.</p>
          <p>Growing production in Nigeria, it was certainly declined in production elsewhere. Our share of Agbami production is now 20,000 barrels per day, up past quarter. We expect production from these two projects to be contributing 60,000 barrels of oil per day by year-end, and will contribute an average of 40,000 barrels per day to 2009 production.</p>
          <p>Next, please. Capital spending increased 41% between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, approximately 50% of our spending was for domestic E&amp;P and the remainder of our integrated operation. Our capital expenditures were funded largely from cash flow, as net debt-to-EBITDA were at R$13.4 billion in the quarter. In the first quarter of last year, when the price of Brent averaged $97 per barrel, EBITDA totaled R$14.1 billion against R$10.2 billion of income tax expenditure.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we were active in various markets to finance this project differential between cash generation and the pay back. Borrowings increased by R$5.6 billion. While cash balance grew in the R$19.5 billion &#x2013; at least to R$19.5 billion, access to capital continued to improve. In February, we issued $1.5 billion of 10 year bond and that traded up in price to now yield approximately 6.75% versus an yield to maturity of interest of funding more than 8%. The U.S. Ex-Im Bank recently issued a preliminary commitment to purchase $2 billion of U.S. goods and services. We continue with our discussion with other export credit agencies and developing them and are also told that we can raise the capital we need to continue with our business plans.</p>
          <p>Thank you. With that, let me start and answer any question you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Frank McGann with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. And thank you for the complete presentation. Two questions I have really. One is on costs and the cost trends going forward and your efforts to get reductions from suppliers and in other ways, reduce costs in your business. Maybe you could explain, how much you think you can pull out over the next year, what kinds of trends you're seeing in your negotiations now? And then secondly, in terms of a potential equity offering which is &#x2013; have been talked about a lot lately. I was wondering, if you could perhaps &#x2013; if you were to decide to issue equity, when do you think you might need to do that, under what conditions would you likely do that? And if that's going to be done in conjunction with the government contributing some pre-salt areas to Petrobras, what is the process for the valuation of that and also for minority shareholder involvement in the approval of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay, Frank thank you for the questions. Regarding cost, we're holding the market. We have received many proposals of ads showing cost reduction, we are also working in making our project in a simplest way using more of the standard in the market than our tailor made project. And we are doing many other &#x2013; taking many other initiatives to reduce cost, including G&amp;A cost in the company and we saw some reduction already in this quarter. But we expect to have more along the year mainly in the CapEx. Because the CapEx we are spending now is &#x2013; most of them is based on contract that we signed one-year ago or some time or more than that. So the reflex of the cost reduction we are getting mainly contract now is going to reflect in the future. But the main point of your question, how much we are expect or how much we are seeing. We are not &#x2013; we don't have yet a conclusion on that because we did not consolidate, we did not did an analysis on that, we don't have the information to come to this conclusion. I hope by the end of the second quarter, we will be better equipped for that, but yes, we are seeing some reduction, but let's wait some time more to say something in term of percentages.</p>
          <p>Regarding the capital, the stock issuance or capital increase. We don't have any plan to do this. Of course, all depends on the oil prices and the costs of our CapEx. If oil prices gets up, this will produce what we'll be needing to face most of what we are spending, cut our expenditure. What we can tell is that we don't intend to be in a leverage beyond 35% but when we may reach that really I don't have a clue. It would be a guess if I say anything <mark type="inaudible" /> (30:42  -we based our financial business plus in a oil of Brent of $37, we are seeing much better price and these will be producing more cash than we were expecting. So instead of having only '09 and most of 2010 <mark type="inaudible" />, globally we will be entering 2011. So this gives us a lot of comfort, but we will be following our leverage. We don't want to have our investment grade under stress. And just covering a little bit of the case of capitalization of the government. This is of course &#x2013; this is a decision that is not dependent on Petrobras, this is a decision of the government if they are going to do or not, the controller. And if they do, the Brazilian Corporate Law provides for the opportunity for the minority shareholder to accompany the controller. They will have the opportunity to buy the proportionate share of the stocks of the company they hold in the process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Will they be able to &#x2013; just to clarify, will they be able to &#x2013; or how would those areas be valued, do you know that the government might contribute?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, could you repeat that, Frank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If the government were to contribute areas to Petrobras, how would those be valued in order to get a price that shareholders will then be able to buy shares at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This according to the corporate law &#x2013; the Brazilian Corporate Law, this value shall be attributed by a independent, an independent engineering company. The evaluation and this report, this evaluation shall be approved by the minority shareholder with the <mark type="inaudible" /> of the controller on this meeting. So there might be an independent evaluation approved by minority shareholder. So the Brazilian Corporate Law is a very well equipped law. I believe it incorporates well this kind of situation.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good day. I wanted to see if you could update us with respect to the incremental 28 rigs that you are planning to order for drilling in the pre-salt, there was some news coming out over the course of the quarter on that. And I just wanted to hear you directly speak to what your plans are there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The rigs we have announced that we are going to lease or to buy beyond the ones we have or rather ordered. And we have ordered last year 12 to be delivered in '10-'12. We have another <mark type="inaudible" /> to be delivered from '13 to '17 that has not been ordered yet. We intend to do it along this year and probably in three four months this will be coming to market. And <mark type="inaudible" />, we are now planning to place the order of 28 at once. Probably, we are discussing the strategy to do this, but most probably we are going to do by tranches, we will take five, six, seven or eight of each type.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you confirm whether your strategy has changed with regard to whether these will be constructed in Brazil or perhaps in Asia instead?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no change in this area. They have to be built in Brazil.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Gustavo Gattass of UBS Pactual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions. The first one, in your presentation you mentioned the discoveries in Jequitinhonha as one of the post-salt objectives. I was just wondering if you guys could actually give us some kind of update on that? Especially in light of the comment that Director Sergio had made about Jequitinhonha had turned out to be disappointing. If you could give us any idea of how you guys are actually feeling about that find? The second thing that I just wanted to check, it has to deal with the utilization of Brazilian oil in the oil refineries it actually rose to about 80%. I just wanted to check with you guys, is that the result of the upgrades that you have been doing or was that actually a strategy that's more related to the products linkage that you wanted to get out of the refineries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the second question. Maybe I'll have <mark type="inaudible" /> help us. But, I can tell you, we are adding new coker units in the old refineries we have, every year, every year. Six years ago, we started building new capacity to process more of the domestic crude, and these used to give us more capacity to process the crude oil produced in Brazil. So that we will be more &#x2013; like 5 basis points.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> the amount we went, we have <mark type="inaudible" /> . And we have &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's go to --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My apologies, but it was very low, from what I understood, you use more domestic oil, because you didn't need to produce as much diesel. Is that the case? I just was unable to hear what you were saying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> was away from the microphone. Now with regard to downstream, the refining national crude deposit in downstream, we don't try them. And we won't be able in convincing more than that you try. And then for international Brazilian crude oil conversion, less the diesel and mostly for oil. If we have low diesel market in Brazil we consider between Brent volumes to produced diesel and to support in the end volumes to finish at 15. okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's go to Jequitinhonha with <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Jequitinhonha is a big area, is a new spot in the frontier. It was acquired in the fourth bid round of the national <mark type="inaudible" />. And Jequitinhonha offered 920 &#x2013; 80,000 square kilometers. So we do adjust the threshold there. But result was not as we expected but anyway it needs to be last and lot of information about the geography of that area. So we are studding the results we have to date as to drill a second well in the area.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> thanks for taking my question. Well, I actually have two questions. One is, I want to hear your talk from the recent development from the oil price, particularly with the role of China and news that the Chinese government is somewhat retreating on letting oil products to go in free market, hence there will be subsidies and those sort of things. So do you think that that has a major impact on the oil prices, is that something you're looking at and generally what are your thoughts on the recent development of the oil price with regards to China? And the second question is also about China is to &#x2013; I don't know I've read a few news articles about you talking to Chinese potential investors in the sense doing deals like that for oil or those sort of things. Can you clarify if you have conversation, if there are certain deals that you could do and how does that compare to what you can get in the capital markets, is it better. Can you talk a little bit about that? Thanks.</p>
