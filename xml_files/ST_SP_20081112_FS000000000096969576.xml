        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and a warm welcome to all investors and analysts. We are listening to SingTel's Earning Conference Call for the Quarter Ended 30 September 2008. My name is Yang Fong. And let me introduce panel members on the call. Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Ms. Jeann Low, Group CFO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO Singapore; Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, CEO Optus. Also assisting them are other representatives from the management team.</p>
          <p>Before we start rolling in the questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results. Sock Koong, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We just announced the results for the quarter ended 30 September 2008. Maybe just let me run through some key highlights before we take the questions. The group's earnings for this quarter declined 12% and that reflects weaknesses in the Australian dollar and the regional currencies, also declines in associates' earnings. The group's revenues were up 5%. It has got strong revenue growth in both Singapore and Australia. And if you exclude the impact of the currency translation losses, then underlying net profits would have declined by a slower 5%.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, despite the slowing growth in the economy, we actually showed double digit revenue growth of 10%. Operational EBITDA declined 4% due to stronger customer acquisitions and higher handset subsidy costs, mainly because of the iPhone. In Australia, Optus revenue grew 7% on the back also of strong mobile customer acquisition. Operational EBITDA was stable at AU$479 million, that has similarly been affected by higher iPhone subsidies. The group and its associates now have 217 million mobile customers and we have seen a steady increase each quarter.</p>
          <p>Earnings from the regional mobile associates, however, declined by 29%, and that's due to low contribution from Telkomsel and also share of losses from Warid. The Board also has approved an interim dividend of S$0.056 per share. That's the same level as last year and represents a 53% payout ratio.</p>
          <p>So maybe I will stop here and we can take questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ma'am. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First on line we have Mr. Guerra from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Thanks for your time. I've just got three questions for you this morning, please. Firstly on your outlook comments, you've obviously discussed how you are seeing the economy or the economy in your region and markets in general at length. You say that a slowdown in growth is expected. Just wondering if you could talk to us please about which revenue lines in particular you think will be most impacted?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you please update us on your thoughts on M&amp;A, mergers and acquisitions and corporate activity versus capital management in the current market, given how comfortable your balance sheet is?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, a question on Optus. Paul, in the second quarter we saw a huge decline in mobile margins. I'm just wondering how much longer you intend to keep the foot to the floor in terms of trying to pick up customers in the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll ask Jean to talk to give you a bit more color on the outlook and then and also maybe take the capital management versus M&amp;A questions. And Paul, you may want to take the last question on Optus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, yes, I think, we in our outlook we've signaled that the GDP for the quarter in Singapore has declined, contracted by about 0.5%. Now this compared to 7% in the first quarter and about 2% in the second quarter. So you're seeing a slowing down clearly based on the macroeconomic factors.</p>
          <p>I think in Australia, in fact on Monday the RBA lowered the growth rate estimate from 2.8 to 1.5. In the region, we are expecting &#x2013; I think the consensus estimates on GDP growth forecast is tracking around the mid single digits. And clearly, in the case of India, you have somewhere just around the 7 percentage points in terms of estimates. So I think that is the macro economic environment that we're operating under.</p>
          <p>I think, when you look at our performance for the second quarter, as well as looking at the results of our associates, we haven't quite seen the evidence of the slowdown in our numbers at this point in that revenue growth numbers. If you look at Singapore, it has grown by 10%, and if you look at Optus, it has grown by close to 7%. And but we are clearly mindful of what's happening.</p>
          <p>And clearly in the case of Singapore, you would know that part of our businesses, the economic drivers, a strong economic driver in Singapore is the financial sector. And we do expect to see some implications coming out as a result of what's happening in the world. So I think that's basically the scenario that we are operating under. And we have given guidance on the associates.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight that really we are taking into account the six months' result, which one of the key drivers is Telkomsel and you have seen Telkomsel's revised outlook last week. And we have factored that into our guidance statement as well. And then of course there is currency volatility in the region as well. So I think, if you look at the underlying performance of Bharti and AIS, they continue to be very strong.</p>
          <p>On the M&amp;A and capital management, clearly we have a strong balance sheet. We have flexibility in terms of assessing different sources of financing or funding. When we look at M&amp;A acquisition opportunities, we would also look at where the sources of funding will come from and whether we will clearly make a decision based on the business case returns and of course taking into consideration the cost of capital.</p>
          <p>I think on capital management, we have fairly low debt gearing. We have got credit facilities in place and we are very comfortable with our liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Paul, do you want to take the Optus question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will. Thanks. So, Christian, we've actually disclosed in the MD&amp;A, as I'm sure you've seen, that we incurred about an extra $44 million incremental subsidy as a result of the iPhone over what we would have done on normal devices. It's an exceptional device and it does attract an exceptional type of customer. In common with other carriers, such as AT&amp;T, we think it's worth the investment and it is worth making the effort to bring these customers, not only are they good ARPU, but they're also picky customers in a sense that they use it for broadband as well as for voice, and there's also obviously a potential synergy if we can cross-sell them over time onto broadband and fixed. So we think, it's a good investment.</p>
          <p>Interestingly and importantly, if you back out that $44 million incremental subsidy for using the iPhone, our underlying EBITDA margin in mobile is 32%, the same as this time last year.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, we believe it's good value for money for us to be investing in iPhone customers and for as long as the iPhone is attracting customers, we will continue to invest in it. Over half of the customers we've sold onto iPhones have come from competitor carriers and we see that also as a very cost-effective way for us to be winning customers over, especially high ARPU customers from our competitors. Hopefully, that's answered the question for you on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paul, that's great. And just on those new customers, which obviously is a pretty impressive performance, are you able to shed some light on which other carriers you've taken those from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we generally don't like to wake anybody up at the switch, Christian. So I might &#x2013; I'll let Murray, Murray, do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the only other comment I would make, Christian, is we do believe from our market intelligence that we are taking the majority of the share of the Australian marketplace with regards to iPhone sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next on line Mr. Raymond Tong, Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just had three questions as well. Just firstly, can you please discuss some of the cost initiatives that Allen alluded to a month or so ago in Singapore? How confident are you of putting these through, and that they won't impact revenue growth? The second one is just on Optus. We saw a decline in the CMM margins sequentially and I just wanted to ask whether this is just seasonal or what's the reason for this? Can you give a sense of what sort of margins we are expecting in a medium to long term? And just finally, on &#x2013; in &#x2013; on Optus as well, on the 90% mobile coverage now, do you have many, I suppose, handsets at the moment that can actually operate up to that coverage levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll let Allen elaborate a bit more on our cost management initiatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our cost management initiatives are split into two phases. One is the short-term and then one is medium and longer term. I think in the short-term, our revenue growth is reasonably healthy at 10% for the Singapore business. So we will flex our costs according to that. If you look at our staff cost, actually our staff cost is growing at less than that. If you look at our traffic expenses, they are also growing less than that.</p>
          <p>I think the only area in the short-term, where our expenses are growing faster than our revenue is in selling, admin and cost of sales. In selling and admin, it's primarily because of higher SAC's, because of the iPhone, expensing the handset in the month that we acquired the customer, a little bit of Mio TV costs and also some is our MNP. What we have implemented in Singapore is actually a head count freeze, a hiring freeze, and right now I think we are watching our revenues and we will continue to make sure that we adjust our costs in these areas appropriately. In the medium and longer term, it's all about getting more automation into our system, allowing our customers to use the Internet.</p>
          <p>And you know, in Singapore broadband penetration for the fixed is at 75%, with mobile broadband now is up to more than 100%. So basically what we are doing is allowing customers to do self-service. That phases the need to have dealer commission phases, the need to have physical locations. We've implemented e-bill as well, so I think the other big part that we are focusing on in the Singapore business is outsourcing where it makes sense, especially in terms of the backroom activities that do not interact with the customers. I'll handover to Paul to answer the Optus question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Allen. We've got two more questions. One on CMM margins and one on our availability of handsets that can use our 900 as well as our 2100 3G network. I'm going to ask Murray to talk about the CMM margins, which has actually got a lot do with an one-off adjustment in the previous quarter, and then we'll pass over to Michael Smith to talk about mobile handsets. Murray?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks, Paul. As Paul indicated, in quarter one there was a one-off adjustment of $14 million to do with the ACCC ULL connection pricing adjustment. If you adjust for that in quarter one the underlying CMM margins were around 13%, which are consistent with the quarter two margins. So you've seen consistency in relation to margin performance between quarter one and quarter two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, would you like to talk a little bit about the build out of our coverage obviously into the regional areas, we are starting to use the 900 megahertz frequency. So I guess the question is, have we got a wide enough range of handsets that allow customers to use that full coverage if they wish to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The handsets now would be ranged on both spectrums, the 900 and 21, we're now ranging about 13 handsets across all the price points. So from multiple devices carrying e-mail all the way down to single band, and importantly in the Christmas range will actually in the pre-paid level this year introduce handsets that work on that range as well, so across the spectrum they're well covered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just in terms of CMM, sort of medium to longer term are we expecting much margin uplift from the 14, 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to the margins, you've seen us continue to grow our ULL customer base to the point where we have 400,000 customers. We added 32,000 ULL customers in the quarter. The growth in the ULL customer base will slow as a consequence of the majority of our retail customer in the ULL footprint now having been migrated, so as a consequence of that the margin expansion will moderate over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next on line Sachin Gupta, Nomura Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. I have four questions actually. Firstly Paul, just going back to the CMM business once again, if you look at the &#x2013; obviously the run rate has slowed down, which is expected. Just wondering, what's the strategy with the balance 140,000 Off-Net customers. Are they in the coverage areas where you actually have DSLAMs and that can be migrated or not?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just Allen, just for the Singapore business, any further color on the iPhones? I think you talked about 170,000 total. Just any indication how many are in Singapore currently. And even the ARPUs, you do talk about &#x2013; you did talk about the release last week you're expecting one and a half times increase in ARPUs, but when can we expect that, because sequentially the ARPUs have gone backwards by 2 or $3 this quarter I think?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, for Sock Koong. Sock Koong, earnings from PBTL as well as Warid, I mean, they continue to disappoint. I'm just wondering what's the strategy for those businesses or what's the outlook from your perspective. And lastly, just looking at the balance sheet, the current debt is about $2.7 billion. Is that something you're looking to refinance over the next 12 months, and any implication for the interest cost as a result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll jump in and answer the beginning of that if that's okay. So just on the CMM, I think it is an important point as Murray just said. The areas where we could see it possible to migrate customers quickly and cheaply to our own ULL are the ones that we've targeted first. So at this stage, we've covered the vast majority of areas where there is a large percentage conversion opportunity for us onto our own network.</p>
          <p>So the bulk of what remains now in the retail base are in areas where there's not quite the same conversion potential for us. So that's why Murray said, you can expect the rate of migrations to significantly moderate over the next couple of quarters. We do have an ability to sell some of those customers wireless broadband, and we have found that there is some interest among that base in wireless broadband offers, but obviously that is not going to show up on the CMM line, that's something that we convert into the mobile line.</p>
          <p>So I think, it is important to say that if you looked at our ULL sales, moving forward, we're going to be largely relying now on sales to new customers in the ULL territories. Back to you Allen on the Singapore business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Paul. With regard to the iPhone question and the ARPU question. Firstly on the iPhone question, we still have 70,000 across four countries in the group. Our commercial agreement with Apple does not allow us to disclose the details of what we sold in each market. So unfortunately I can't tell you how many we sold in Singapore. All I can say is we are very happy with the take up that's happening and bearing in mind that Christmas is coming, and in Singapore we remain the only operator that's tied up with Apple, so we'll take advantage of that during the Christmas season as well.</p>
          <p>With regards to when we will see the ARPUs starting to flow through from the iPhones. The iPhone, we've talked about we've seen a big uplift in the ARPU as the number of people that use the iPhone and not just the iPhone, other touch screen, other data friendly devices, we have packaged for these customers a data brand that goes with it, so we'll see an uplift there. We will leave our execution capability and track record to speak for itself in subsequent quarter. At this stage, we won't give any projections with regard to that. And then finally, why have ARPUs gone down. I think, if you look across the entire industry and our competitors as well, all the post-paid ARPUs have gone down for everybody. It's a reflection in our case and in StarHub's case of bundling, because both of us are starting to bundle a lot more.</p>
          <p>You can see the number of people that have taken up our mio plan has increased quite significantly, 11,000 in the quarter to 87,000. So that is affecting our ARPUs and the same for start up. I think in M1's case, bearing in mind what we are seeing from reporting numbers, it appears that their ARPU has gone backwards primarily because of a loss in high value ARPU customers to other competitors in Singapore. But really, I think that's our analysis on our part, you may want to talk to M1 about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the question on PBTL and Warid, I mean, just to put in perspective PBTL is a relatively small investment for us. It's a CDMA operator. We had built up a network of about 3 million customers. We are here in the process of loading the network to a breakeven cash level. We now have about 1.7 million customers in PBTL. We're not quite at the breakeven levels yet, which is why you've seen increased selling, admin costs, subscriber acquisition costs as we try to increase the customer base to get to that breakeven level.</p>
          <p>In the case of Warid Telecom, the results were really impacted both by &#x2013; on the revenue front. While we continue to add customers, the uncertain political situation has certainly impacted consumer spending. So we've seen lower spend on &#x2013; from our customers in Pakistan. And on the cost side as we rollout the network, we've seen an increase in network maintenance and operating costs.</p>
          <p>There is also an additional foreign exchange loss, because of U.S. dollar liabilities sitting in the books of Warid. So these factors have contributed to the weaker short-term performance in Warid, and in the longer term we're still confident of the telecoms market there and we are continuing to rollout the networks in the country. On the refinancing question, I'll pass it over to Jeann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the refinancing, I think just to put in context we have currently a net debt of $7.1 billion, debt-to-equity ratio very comfortably within the 28%, which we have. Also very good credit ratings, and that's been reaffirmed by both Moody's and S&amp;P as recent as in June '08. And we have &#x2013; in respect of the debt that is maturing in the course of the next 12 months, we have refinancing and credit lines in place to handle the situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly in this global credit shortage, you would definitely see a flight to quality, and you would expect a borrower like SingTel to be a company that the banks will still want to do business with, within their &#x2013; with reduced credit capacity, I think, there's also a question on cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the interest cost, I think, inevitably credit spreads have widened, but I think bear in mind that the benchmark rate has in fact come-off. So on the net-net basis, there is certainly limited impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the call. I have three questions, one &#x2013; sorry, two on Singapore and one on the associates. Just following up on the iPhone queries, I was wondering if given that you are the virtual monopoly seller of the iPhone in Singapore and Philippines, will you be reducing the level of subsidies you are giving going to this December quarter? And second in terms of the Formula One related expenses, I've noticed it's amortize. I just wanted to get like the full amount and over what period it's being amortized over. And the last question as regards to the associates, I've noticed that Globe and AIS Management have indicated they will be going to the credit markets in the March quarter, just wondering if SingTel also is going to do the same, and if in general the refinancing efforts are more for CapEx or capital management?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me answer the first question Luis for you regarding the iPhone and whether we'll be reducing level of subsidies. In Singapore SingTel is the only operator that works with Apple. We will look at the demand in the market and we'll look at the current levels of pricing of other equivalent handsets in the market and we will do what's necessary to make sure that we can achieve our objectives for this device for the year both in terms of short-term and long term strategy and branding for SingTel Singapore business. I can't talk specifically about what levels of subsidies we'll be having from the iPhone because of competitive and commercially sensitive arrangements that we have with different parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the F1 question, again there's some confidentiality agreement on what the level of subsidy is that the F1 cost has been fully amortized over the four quarters of this financial year. Okay? On the Globe AIS funding issues, I think both companies are listed and both companies have very extensive IR efforts. I think you've talked about what they are doing with the &#x2013; what they are doing in the capital markets. I think, it's probably more appropriate for Globe and AIS IR's to be talking about their own capital plans. Maybe I'll ask Yang Fong whether they have touched on those points specifically in their results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, both Globe and AIS said, they are going to seek refinancing. Yes, I think &#x2013; but the question is &#x2013; Luis, your question would be, is it the March quarter you are specifically asking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes, whether SingTel itself will look at the refinance &#x2013; the whole group is looking at the refinancing effort in the March quarter and whether the funds is more for CapEx or capital management -</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, clearly you do your financing as they fall due, you look at market situations and you try and take advantage where you can see a good window to do that. I don't think we can be more specific than that. And obviously, cash is also tangible and we manage our overall cash flows looking at what the operating cash flows are and what the requirements are for capital expenditure and for dividend payments for interest payments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. I have two questions on the regional front. One is on when you're guiding for the associates contribution being lower than the last year, what are the foreign currency assumptions? I mean, are you saying, I mean, there's no exchange rate variation from the last year or are you saying it's at current levels of exchange rates? That's question number one. And second question is on Bharti. We have seen one-off item of 57 million I think financial loss booked in &#x2013; booked for Bharti's contribution. We did not see this item in Bharti results, so what is the reason for the discrepancy? Yeah, second question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin. The Bharti losses are actually &#x2013; is actually reflected both in Bharti's own results and ours as well. I think you just need to take a good look at the associate section of the MD&amp;A. There will be something like $14 million FX losses which is our share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in Bharti's account is shown under the finance income line, so you've got all your interest expenses, interest investment income, and then we've netted all the mark-to-market losses in that item. I think it's fairly well disclosed in the MD&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the number is $57 million for our share.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The reason I ask is because Bharti's earnings grew about 27% in local currency, so &#x2013; I mean to me it looked like when I look at the Bharti's contribution it is down year on year. Even after I factor the exchange rate impact, it should be probably around 10% up, but it's a decline. So that's what I was trying to understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The decline is due to how we have recognized dilution gained from the tower Infratel transactions in the previous year and that treatment was not the same treatment that Bharti had adopted for reducing their shareholding in Infratel subsidiary. So that accounts for the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You had a question on the FX among the associates. I think if you look at the quarter results, I think the quarter results have shown that if you assume that currencies were stable, the post-tax profit contribution would have declined by about 5% versus 16%. So I think that is a key point. I think in terms of the guidance, we have basically stayed clear of any currency predictions. I think we have taken into account, as we said, in the guidance, we expect profit to be lower, share of contribution from the associates to be lower after taking into consideration the first half results, but I also would also like to highlight also taking into consideration the revised guidance that's been given by Telkomsel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if exchange rate comes back in a favorable position, I mean, that's a kind of thing, right? So I mean, there might be some assumption right? I mean at the current levels or &#x2013; because last time you said no exchange rate variation, right? So that is my question because the exchange rate is playing such a crucial part.</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot. Just one question for Paul on the iPhone. The 45% subs that were already with Optus, I was just wondering what the ARPU uplift you've got across those subs has been as they've moved to the iPhone product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Andrew, we've deliberately chosen not to get too granular on iPhone for competitive reasons at this stage, so I apologize. Not trying to be misleading, but we just feel it's a bit of a sensitive topic at the moment, because as you can see there's quite different approaches to marketing and selling it being taken by the three carriers in Australia. And we believe that we've got a formula which is very, very different from the others and clearly has driven a very significant amount of acquisition for us. So maybe in future quarters when it's a less competitive issue we can maybe talk about that.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I at least get clarity from you, I guess you've obviously got great subscriber growth coming from your competitors. Are you actually getting an uplift on the internal customers?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you could say generally we find that there is a desire for people to be able to use the device quite flexibly.

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to specifically get down to that level of detail, Andrew. But generally speaking it would be fair to say that there is a strong push by us to get existing customers to sign up onto a higher plan by giving them a more flexible option.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thank you for the call. I had four questions. Firstly, just going back to the iPhone, I mean it's obviously a success. So is there any reason to suspect there shouldn't be incremental spending costs into the third quarter, especially the Christmas quarter and maybe the fourth quarter? So, I mean, you've given a guidance which basically is unchanged for Singapore and Optus. So I guess my question is there any reason to suspect that additional spending has come off at all? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Question two is on NBN, you've said in Singapore it will not impact FY '09 guidance. I'm just wondering on how we should look at it into FY '10. I'm not looking for guidance. I'm just looking out for the various moving parts we should be thinking about into FY '10 at least?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on the tariff rises in local line in Singapore, is it possible for you to give us a feel of how much this will impact tariffs by, or the local revenue line item by assuming everything stays unchanged in terms of usage as it is today?</p>
          <p>And lastly, Warid, should we be expecting more investment going through from shareholders? Certainly seemed like it when they did their presentation. So I'm just wondering if you could give us a color on what the extent of that refinancing would be if it is there at all from a shareholders' perspective? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me handle the three questions that you had on Singapore about iPhone, NBN and DEL, excuse me, Warid. Firstly on iPhone, going to the third quarter and fourth quarter, I think we have done an analysis on what is the likely demand. And basically we stick to the guidance that we've given. And basically we have looked at what are the likely take-up rates. We have seen basically the demand for the phone over the last 10 weeks or so and we have projected that. And on that basis we're confident to stick to the guidance that we have put at the end of our MD&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's true for Australia Optus as well, right, because the impact was obviously much bigger on Optus relative to Singapore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why not I let Paul answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paul here. Murray, would you like to summarize our response to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Anand, well you see a bigger impact in this quarter for Australia because they have an earlier launch than Singapore. Singapore's launch was in August and Australia's launch is in July. So you actually have got almost a full quarter for Australia, but only just over a month for Singapore. I'll let Murray elaborate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think in respect to quarter two you've seen Optus hold their margins flat, you've seen the margin expansion in our fixed on-net strategy focus and that's allowed us to be able to aggressively grow the customer base through the likes of iPhone propositions and Timeless propositions.</p>
          <p>In relation to our ability to meet guidance, we're reaffirming guidance that we'll grow our revenues at single digits and our EBITDA will grow. And as a consequence of maintaining momentum with regards to customer growth and increased ARPU from those high-value customers pulling through into latter quarters, we believe, we'll be able to deliver that guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Anand, with regard to your second question on NBN, what is likely to happen in the next financial year when we release our full year results, we will give the guidance for the next financial year. And within that guidance will be some implications to our CapEx and to our other lines in our financial statements as a result of the NetCo win that we've got with OpenNet.</p>
          <p>In terms of the direct exchange line, we increased, and what that does to the overall national telephone revenue line, again, the increase happens in Q4 of our financial year. So when we report our Q4 results, you will see that as is normal we don't forecast what is going to happen to our revenue lines for any particular product, or even revenue lines in general.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on Warid, the investment is relatively new. I mean we invested in September last year. The company is still in the process of doing its network roll out, and clearly as shareholders we would be supporting the company in the roll out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and if I could just confirm, so we should expect a very low probability that two weeks ahead of third quarter results, we would probably receive some incremental spending news, because as you say, most of the demand for the iPhone is probably flat than included in whatever estimates you have and therefore into guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just one question from me. With regard to the iPhone, you mentioned that ARPUs are around 1.5 times that of normal postpaid subs. Just curious, on a like-for-like basis, if you take the same subscribers migrated from an older unit to an iPhone, is there actually any material ARPU accretion to justify the increased SACs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me talk about it for the Singapore business. When we said our ARPU has gone up 1.5 times, it's weighted average of both new as well as existing customers. So we are seeing a lift in our existing customers. We can't tell exactly why it is, but it's in line with what we have said the overall ARPU increase is. So I think from our perspective, if you look at getting the customer for two years and you look at the accretion that you get as a result, the increased ARPU, it makes sense for us to subsidize it to the level that we have right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I was just trying to get a picture whether it's actually an improvement with regard to the customer raising their spending or are you just basically getting higher spending people to begin with because of the iPhone?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not just the higher spend &#x2013; we're getting people across all different segments and consumers, small business, and even some corporate customers. So it is not that we are just migrating the higher value customers and hence we get the ARPU lift because it's a higher-value customer. It's &#x2013; even some of our medium value SMB and consumer customers are giving us same percentage uplift in revenue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions for Paul and one for Sock Koong. Paul, just wondering if you can give us some bit more clarity in terms of mobile adds for the quarter? Obviously you had the deactivations through, but just interested to get what the total postpaid net adds were for the period? And then, also in relation to that, you touched on the level of subsidy on iPhone that you are hoping to see those consumers move across and take a broadband offer. Just curious as to why it's not being pitched as a bundle, if that's the case?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just wondering if you're seeing any slowdown in the pipeline for Alphawest? Obviously given the economic environment, IT spend programs are more likely under pressure. So just wondering if we can read anything into that slowdown in the Alphawest contribution in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And then Sock Koong, I think you've previously indicated that SingTel would consider investing one to two billion in the Australian FTTN project. Just curious whether that is on top of the $1 billion per annum that's currently invested in Optus or whether that's inclusive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tim, it's Paul here. I might get Murray just to go through our mobile adds to get you the detail, but before he does that I'll preempt the second question, which was the iPhone. The way we &#x2013; from experience what we found is that if you make the sales process too complicated at point-of-sale, you actually reduce your conversion rates. We also have had the issue with the iPhone, but certainly for the first quarter of those sales demand has been quite strong and certainly in the first four to six weeks we actually acquired a logistics issue by making sure that we were able to get a throughput through our stores and through our centers. So for those reasons our strategy is to sell the phone as a complete sale in its own right and then we go back to the base with cross sell offers and with opportunities to give them the broadband bundling. So that's our general approach. We find it to be a more cost effective approach. Murray, did you want to talk about the mobile adds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Tim, our total customer net adds for the quarter were 182,000 as disclosed but as you've seen in our MD&amp;A there was a one-off cleanout adjustment for one of our wholesale providers of 31,000, so a total of that 213,000, 159,000 are postpaid customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess can you give me the split then, because I think you had about 104 wireless broadband? I'm trying to get back to a pure mobile number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes 104,000 wireless broadband customers in total and as we've indicated we launched our prepaid wireless broadband product during the quarter. And we don't provide a split of that 104,000 between our postpaid and our prepaid wireless broadband customers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess I'm just looking at the net adds less the &#x2013; or the total, the 213 less the 104 and then trying to get a read on what's the split of the balance between prepaid and postpaid?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I indicated our total postpaid was around 159,000. As I've also indicated the 104 includes some prepaid customers, so you can't just take from the 159 the 104 and determine that that's all postpaid voice because we don't provide that split of the 104 between postpaid and prepaid.</p>

          <p>Tim, on the FTTN I'm not sure where you &#x2013; do you &#x2013; you saw that number from. I think the group obviously is evaluating our options for the Australian FTTN project and we're looking at how we would structure this. So I think certainly too premature to talk about how &#x2013; what the equity of that split is and who the partners are, et cetera.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we had an additional question from you, Tim, on Alphawest and what some of the drivers are behind our performance in that sector. I think it's probably important to say that look, of course, in the current market there are a lot of businesses who are reevaluating their plans but it's also true to the sales cycle for the business divisions it is fairly lengthy. So I wouldn't have said that our numbers this quarter reflect necessarily any impact from the economic cycle. What they do reflect though is the fact that there's been a fairly significant review done in the federal government. It's called the Gershon review and that certainly had an impact because business that we had expected to pull through in our ICT and managed services area has been impacted by delays in projects or by postponement of projects that's being caused by that review activity and that's certainly been a factor which contributed to our number this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I've just got some three questions actually. Mostly, actually I think all three relate to Optus. The first one is just looking at the CapEx guidance, I notice that you've kept the guidance sort of mid-teens. During the first half of the year you've just done probably just under 13%, I mean that implies high teens in the second half, which would suggest a big ramp up. I just wondered whether you can give us a bit more clarity in terms of those plans?</p>
          <p>The second question is regard to just on the iPhone just to reiterate again, just looking at the sums you did 170,000 new iPhone sales and I think in Aussie dollars the EBITDA impact was about 77 million. So it's about $450 per sub, which is obviously nearly three times the existing SAC, but you're saying the ARPU is only up one and a half times. I just wanted to get a bit more clarity in terms of those two numbers. And then the last one is just on forex impacts in terms of obviously both on handset procurement for the group but also for --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Richard, I'm going to &#x2013; I'll maybe pick off the iPhone first if I may and then I'll ask Murray to talk about the CapEx guidance and then was the question on forex Australia related or more generally related to the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both Australia and the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What we can do is give you a preliminary answer on that locally and then may be Jeann might like to talk on behalf of the group. Actually may be I might let Jeann talk on behalf of the group overall and she can include Australia. Just on the iPhone, I think you're deriving a lot of numbers there out of our group disclosure and we haven't issued that level of granularity in Australia. And I'm not seeking to be difficult or to try and hide anything, but to be very, very frank the iPhone is a very competitive device at this stage in the market.</p>
          <p>Unlike in Singapore where we're the only carrier, in Australia we're one of three, fact we're one of the few markets globally where Apple has taken that model. So, for quite natural reasons, we're not keen at this stage to disclose very widely what the economics are for of individual customers versus the subsidies we put on. All I would ask is that people have some confidence in understanding the way we run the business and the track record we put in. Our underlying margin, if you exclude the iPhone for the quarter is the same as last year at 32%. And I think you all know that we have a lot of discipline in the company in making sure that customers are NPV-accretive and that we add profitable growth to the business.</p>
          <p>But it may be that when it is less competitive we're happy to talk about it in more detail. But it's also true that I don't think we've ever talked about any specific device or tariff historically and gone into great detail on it. These are always very competitive issues. And this is what we hire marketing managers to do in the company. And they spend weeks and months working out the economics of it, so the last thing I want to do is to give that and to give my competitors chapter and verse on how we construct our economics. So with that lengthy explanation, let me pass over to Murray to talk a little bit about our CapEx and our CapEx profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Richard, as you indicated, for the quarter where our capital to &#x2013; our cash capital to revenue rate has been around 13%; for the half year we've invested around $500 million odd dollars. We continue to hold to our guidance that our capital expenditure revenue ratio will stay at mid teens. You've historically seen that our capital expenditure in the second half has been high, for a number of reasons. But we do &#x2013; we don't have any reason to believe that we will not be able to hold to the guidance of capital to revenue ratio being maintained at that mid teen level.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeann, did you want to comment on the overall impact with the Foreign Exchange movements on procurement issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think on the FX strategy that we have, whatever we committed from a transactional point of view, whether it is CapEx commitments or handsets, we would have anyway committed that in foreign currency, we would have hedged that. And we do have a fairly conservative hedging policy, so we would have hedged that.</p>
          <p>I think if we &#x2013; as we go forward and if there are &#x2013; obviously foreign vendors that are quoting in foreign currency, we would obviously look at that quotation relative to the other vendors. And we don't just measure it on the FX impact but on the overall cost to us. And this is something that would be experienced across the industry in terms of competitive pricing. So when it comes to, if we do have foreign currency commitments, we would have taken the necessary hedging.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Couple of questions for Paul, if you don't mind. You mentioned Paul, in the consumer business the retail migration is coming to an end or, sorry, is moderating, both off net and on net, using ULL. And you would be looking forward to wireless solutions. I just wonder what &#x2013; the margin effect and revenue effect of that would be perhaps in the mobile division rather than consumer division. Does that suggest we've reached a kind of a level for operational EBITDA in the consumer business, at around that 45 odd million mark?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the network or CapEx issues, there are a few highlighted issues in that quarter, which seem to be related to the rate of growth in high speed mobile and from wireless products. And I just wonder, in particular whether that has got some impact on your capital spending in future, both in the next half-year to year. But also more generally whether this trend towards data hungry, high-speed products in mobile and indeed in fixed line in future. Whether that's kind of presages an increase in the network capacity needs that Optus has and therefore what the future CapEx profile might look like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that, Ian. Yeah, in terms of the consumer division, as you know we don't give outlook or guidance on specific divisional forecasts, we just give it at the company level. But I think if we try and guide people enough in interpreting the numbers today to reach their own conclusions. I think we would say that, yes the statements you just reiterated are our view, which is that the amount of capital in view of the potential to migrate out of the existing retail base is going to be smaller and smaller over the next few quarters because we've largely achieved it. So, the refocus for the consumer division is on growing new customers into those areas. And obviously that means that overall the numbers will grow less rapidly than they have been up to date for our ULL growth. Obviously, we don't just focus on the customer's side, a lot of our work in the company as well is on how we take cost out.</p>
          <p>And in fact Murray, who is with us today, leads a fairly major transformation effort inside the company using the lean process. Which is designed to try and find ways in which we can service our customers, connect them and bill them monthly, etcetera, at a much lower cost. So that will remain a focus for the division, and certainly we'll seek to achieve. But I won't get to any specific level in terms of the divisional guidance. If I turn to the question on network and CapEx, if you look at the guidance we just talked about as in our CapEx spend for this year, that includes the spend we're making on rolling out our coverage more widely and that's largely to provide HSPA. In fact, we disclosed today is at 90% footprint and our goal is 96% by year-end.</p>
          <p>And we're doing the work now to prepare ourselves to roll out beyond that, with a view to increasing our coverage next year. We've also in this year's capital guidance, included an allowance for the fact that we are spending on beefing up our backhaul. And we have spent on that over the last couple of quarters and we will again in the second half. And you're correct to say that there is an increasing demand for backhaul from our base stations to our core as a result of the increases in mobile usage. I think as we look at the next few years, we'll probably come back with more specific guidance in time. But, I would expect that once we've completed our coverage build, you'd probably see a slight reweighting of our annual mobile CapEx more towards backhaul and transmission. That's probably very likely. But at this stage, we see no reason to alter our guidance for this year. And we're comfortable we can operate the network and achieve our goals on capacity within that guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good morning. Thanks for the call. Just want to check in again some clarification on the guidance. Firstly, for Singapore, you've guided for EBITDA margins to be maintained at 40%, roughly. I just want to understand if this incorporates the iPhone impact for the entire year. Second question relates to the guidance for the original mobile associates, you said overall pre-tax earnings contributions to be lower. I just want to clarify if this is on a local constant currency basis year-on-year, and when you say lower, this would be I take it as lower year-on-year. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jeann. On the EBITDA margin, the guidance that was given, yes, this takes into account the six-month results. And we continue to hold the EBITDA margin guidance for Singapore to be around 40%. On the associates we have basically guided that the overall pre-tax earnings will be lower and yes, it is versus last year. And we have stayed clear of any currency predictions. We're basically taking into account the six-month results and we have obviously taken into account the six-month results for September, including the currency volatility. On the Singapore margins, I would say that I would just clarify that the guidance of 40% does include the iPhone impact.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Cool, cool. And just to clarify on the associate side, Jeann. You're saying that that means assuming that the currency rates that you saw for the associates last year stays unchanged, we would see pre-tax earnings come down year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The current guidance, which is different from the previous guidance says that it's going to be lower than the last financial year. And we have already factored in the currency movements from year-on-year up to 30th September. So whatever losses, currency losses have already crystallized up to 30th September.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you everyone. Just picking up on Ian's question, one for you, Paul. We've obviously seen some good acquisition growth in the iPhone. But at the same time, we've seen some negative press around network related issues on the mobile network. I just wonder if firstly you can add a bit of color to that and what you're doing with respect to that. And following up on that just whether you're seeing any certain level of customer complaints or customer credits as a result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, you take that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we were talking but we were on mute and we didn't realize it, apologies. So, thanks, Daniel, for the question and I'm glad you asked it because it gives me a chance to clarify an issue, which I think is important. If I talk just about the iPhone coverage to begin with. I think there are two reports that I'm mindful of that I found quite disturbing. One was I think it's Wired Online which did a survey which described us as having very slow speeds. And the other one was a blog which appeared in one of the daily newspapers here. Needless to say, we go down the burrow in great detail on any of these issues.</p>
          <p>On the Wired Online survey, the problem actually didn't relate to our mobile network but related to the way in which our terrestrial network was interacting to the server in Dallas that the test was conducted from. And so that is issues to do with our core. Whilst it's still an issue for us I think it indicates though that there is not an issue there with our wireless capability or our wireless radio interface. Likewise, when we looked at the blog issue which related to a customer in Sydney, what we understand, what we uncovered was a localized issue to do with performance of the cell and not a general issue.</p>
          <p>We actually do monitor performance across the network very thoroughly. iPhone users are actually quite good because their usage is very consistent through the day and they're frequently using the mobile broadband network at times when it's not heavily used. And from our own work when we do tests using iPhones and we go to some of the public servers that are used for speed bursts we're getting consistently good performance and performance that in fact competitively puts us in pretty strong shape against our competitors here.</p>
          <p>I think I'd probably separate those issues from the network performance issues which we've received publicity around on 3G. Those relate to the fact that we are building out our 3G network. We had two specific outages on mobile 3G, which affected customers over at two isolated events ten days apart. They each lasted for a few hours and they happened around about six weeks ago.</p>
          <p>Each of those related to a software performance issue on the Nokia network and we worked very closely with Nokia to overcome those. I know from watching competitors in Australia that there were similar issues had by them as they were constructing their network and loading it up. And I'm hopeful that we're now past that issue and that it is now stabilized. So I think it's important to distinguish between those.</p>
          <p>Overall we're getting a positive experience with iPhones. At any given time there will always be issues from one individual to another be it voice or data on any device any time. iPhone is performing no differently than we're getting a general experience from our customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it'd be fair to say, Paul, these are teething issues. I mean have you seen any feedback from your customers with respect to those in terms of complaint levels or credits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think teething issues is right. We've not had a general issue with the iPhone. Quite the opposite. And in fact I use it myself so I can keep abreast of the overall performance of the network. I think actually there was one last issue, I think there was an issue as well early on with some of the optimization of the antennae in the phone. And I think there's been a software patch put out by Apple pretty soon after we launched which has addressed that issue by and large. So teething problems would be a good way to have described it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you care to comment just around any customer feedback or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've not had, other than the reports I just referred to. In fact, we've generally got a quite positive feedback on it.</p>
          <p>And as I say I use it myself. I should add that we continue to add modifications and improvements to the network every week as we learn more about how people use this, we get more ways in which we can groom the network and optimize it. And as I said in the answer to Ian, we are also increasingly spending more on capacity through the year but all within guidance.</p>
          <p>I thought actually after I reflected on as well with Ian's question, probably in terms of the outlook on this as well. It's true to say that over the next couple of years, our spend in areas like ULL and satellites will actually start to come down. So that actually it comfortably allows us to absorb any spend we see ourselves making on mobile transmission.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Luis, yes. The answer is the exchange rates for the second half-year will be based on the exchange rates that are stated in the MD&amp;A. And any forward looking rates that we have forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>They will be based on the &#x2013; it is basically I think what Chua Sock is saying is when you look at the associates guidance we are assuming a rate as of September 30, '08.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Hi. Thank you for this opportunity. Just two key questions from me. One is within the overall guidance that you've given us, can you just please talk about the relative impact on your different market of the ongoing global slowdown? I mean can you just help us understand which segment or which markets you think may be impacted more or less? And my second question is on the cost front. Can you help us understand what you are doing in preparation for a possible slowdown in top line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the impact of the macroeconomic factors around the associate, I think if you look at the latest round of the results that's been released by our associates, one is that our customer additions has not been impacted, but there could be some impact particularly in the Philippines on usage. And I think Globe has basically flagged that as well. And that is really two factors. One of course is with consumer and business sentiment, as well as the overseas foreign worker remittance growing. But there may be some uncertainty, the impact from the global downturn will be uncertain and it will obviously affect consumer spending.</p>
          <p>I think if you look at AIS, AIS has done well. If you look at Telkomsel, notwithstanding the slowdown the minutes of use, usage has gone up. The results have been affected by tariff cuts during the quarter. And if you look at Bharti, Bharti continued to track very well in terms of both subscriber growth as well as more use. So those are the key associates that we are currently operating in. So...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What about Singapore? Sorry to interrupt, but can you also talk about Singapore, particularly your corporate exposure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Corporate exposure. I'll let Allen take the question the impact of macroeconomic factor on Singapore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In Singapore you've seen in our second quarter that our revenue is still growing at double digits. So we have some momentum going into the third quarter. As a precaution we've implemented a head count freeze already with the exception of customer care and sales. One of our key differentiators is customer experience.</p>
          <p>We are also doing the normal things that you would do in terms of controlling some of the variable expenditure like advertising, promotions, traveling costs, admin costs. And we're also taking a hard look also at being more stringent in expending credit terms especially to our corporate customers and some of our wholesale customers, and monitoring our payments to improve basically our collection rates and also looking at our inventory levels.</p>
          <p>So basically, we are taking some precautions, but I think you need to understand that going into Q3 we have a lot of momentum. You'll see our mobile growth and our data growth both very strong from the revenue line perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For your wholesale business so far there is no sign of an impact of the global slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in our second quarter. Our wholesale business is in terms of overall revenue for the Singapore business it's quite small.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'd like to just take one more caller question maybe?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. There are no other questions.</p>

          <p>All right. That's great. All right. So we will stop the call here. And I just want to highlight that available from this quarter onwards a transcript of today's call will be posted onto our website and that will be available by midday tomorrow, Singapore time. So, on behalf of the management in Singapore and in Australia, we thank you for your interest and we'll speak to you again next quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>
