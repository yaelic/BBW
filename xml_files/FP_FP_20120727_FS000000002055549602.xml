          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Earning Results Q2 2012 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session. Instruction will follow at that time. Just to remind you all, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to the Chairman and CFO, Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re. Please begin your meeting and I will be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re speaking. Before commenting on the second quarter results, I will start with a brief update on Elgin. The gas leak was stopped on May 15, and the situation is under control. We are preparing the cement that will permanently plug and abandon the G4 well and we expect to complete this by mid-September.</p>
          <p>The UK authorities have launched a formal inquiry, and of course we are cooperating fully. Our targets remains a gradual restart before the end of the year. It is challenging but we are making every effort to restart production as soon as and our teams and the authorities agree that it is safe to do so.</p>
          <p>Regarding the incidents in Yemen and in Nigeria, Yemen LNG is fully operational now and we have increased security of the pipeline. In Nigeria, we are restarting gas production on OML 58 and we should be back to full capacity by the end of the third quarter. In the meantime, we are divesting gas from other fields to supply Nigeria LNG. Obviously, because of these events, the second quarter was very difficult for Total. In fact, because we had some positive momentum when these incidents occurred. However, in my view the takeaway message is that we were able to respond quickly, effectively, and professionally to multiple events. And I have to say that I'm very proud of Total for this. It is too soon for me to comment on production growth targets. This will have to wait until our investor day in London on September 24, but I would emphasize that these incidents have had only a one-off effect on production.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to add new production. So far this year we have started up four new fields: Usan, Islay, Bongkot South and Halfaya and these were delivered on time. Between now and the end of the year Angola LNG, Sulige and Kashagan should start up as well. This week we launched the Tempa Rossa Oil Project in Italy. Total is the operator with a 75% share, and we can confirm that the project economics are very good using our $80 per barrel Brent scenario.</p>
          <p>Tempa Rossa is planned to start up in early 2016. I would also add that we were successful in increasing our share of Ichthys LNG from 24% to 30%, and as you know this is an excellent project in a core future growth area for Total. So, we remain very confident about the progress we're making with portfolio of major projects.</p>
          <p>For exploration, we recently acquired new high potential exploration acreage notably in Kenya, Uruguay and Bulgaria. And over the next 6 to 12 months, we will be leading some of our large deep offshore prospects notably in the Gulf of Mexico, Ivory Coast, Gabon and Kenya. We started the year with positive momentum and our task is to regain it by year-end.</p>
          <p>Now, I will comment on our second quarter results. Adjusted cash flow from operation was $6.1 billion in the second quarter Adjusted earnings per share was $1.62 per share, a decrease of 9% compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net operating income from Upstream segment was $3.2 billion in the second quarter, a decrease of 17% compared to the first quarter. The main explanation of course is the decrease in the Brent price. In addition the one-off incidents, Elgin, OML 58 and Yemen, had a negative impact of about $200 million in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>From a volume perspective, Upstream production was 2.26 million barrel of oil equivalent per day, a 5% decrease compared to the first quarter. The new start-ups had a positive impact of about 40,000 barrels per day compared to first quarter 2012, but this was offset by seasonal maintenance and normal declines, so again we can attribute this decrease essentially to the one-off incidents.</p>
          <p>In the Downstream, falling crude price created a more favorable environment, higher margins for both refined products and petrochemicals combined with higher utilization rates in Europe lead to a strong rebound of refining and chemical, increasing net operating income to $491 million.</p>
          <p>Supply and marketing was slightly weaker, contributing $309 million in the second quarter. In the second quarter, net investments were $5.1 billion, in line with budget. This includes acquisition of $0.6 billion mainly for the additional 1.1% of Novatek and the carry on Ithica and asset sales of $1.1 billion, mainly for sale of Sanofi shares.</p>
          <p>Our gearing at the end of the quarter was 21.5%, still at the low end of our target gearing range and essentially unchanged since the end of last year. And our liquidity position is very strong with more than $18 billion of cash and cash equivalent on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>One final but very important point, we announced today that we increased the interim dividend by 3.5% to &#x20AC;0.59 per share, delivered on December 20 this year. This is in line with our policy to maintain a payout ratio of 50% on average over time, and this increase demonstrate our confidence in the future growth of Total, and our commitment to providing a sustainable and competitive returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>This conclude my comments, and I have just a quick remainder that we will be in London on September 24 for our investor day presentation. So certain information will have to wait until then. But having said that I'm now ready to take your question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. Three questions please, could you just first perhaps just give us a little bit of guidance on DG&amp;A for the full year, how you see that progressing through the quarters, and particularly relative to last year? Secondly, also an update on Usan and the ramp up there and your thoughts? And then lastly just on the dividend and the increase today, I just wanted to sort of &#x2013; wanted to find out if you can provide a little bit more color on what has changed in your view in terms of providing the confidence to an increase in the dividend today relative to let's say the full year results in February. Is there anything specific within the project portfolio that has matured and can you give any numbers around cash generation there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Theepan for your three question. First one was about the DG&amp;A, two main explanation for increase of DG&amp;A versus second quarter 2011, of course a stronger dollar versus euro, $1.28 per euro versus $1.43 per euro last year and an increase of our DG&amp;A per barrel in our E&amp;P activities. Most of this increase of DG&amp;A in the E&amp;P was coming from a ramp up of project like Pazflor and Usan. And for going forward in the next year I expect DG&amp;A of course to increase a little bit also.</p>
          <p>Your second quarter about Usan, Usan started production on February 24, our share of production during second quarter of this year was around 20,000 barrels per day. Usan is producing 110,000 barrels per day in July and is expected to reach 440,000 barrels per day by year-end with the addition of two more producing wells. As ramp up is expected to be slower than originally planned, I have to recognize that due to some well completion issues which delay availability of wells.</p>
          <p>About &#x2013; your last question was about dividend. It has been more than three years that we haven't increased our dividend, and we are extremely confident in our future and the future of our cash flow. Therefore, we wanted to return cash to our shareholder. The $0.59 we give to our shareholders this quarter with 47% payout for the quarter, which is in line with our policy of 50% payout in average. And I'd like to say that and I guess take this opportunity to mention to you that despite the one-off effect, we had a very strong quarter. Next question please?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Robert Kessler from Tudor. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patrick. Just to ask you a little bit more on the dividend. It does pay a very nice yield and a little more so today. And I know, as you just stated, you've got a strategy to maintain that payout ratio. But, I know you've also got a very heavy reinvestment program and management has of course commented in the past that that's funding tomorrow's dividend. But, in the meantime, you're fairly significantly free cash flow negative after the dividend and so that requires the balance sheet, of course, for asset sales. And so, can you give a little bit more color about how management thinks about free cash flow and cover for the dividend in this interim period where you're spending quite heavily?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, thank you for calling. I'd like to remind you that the cash flow from operation more than cover CapEx and dividends this quarter. On top of that, with our 21.5% gearing this shows that the balance sheet is strong. On top of that we are confident that free cash flow in the coming years will continue to benefit from the contribution from our new start-ups that I remind you are accretive, and on top of that we are extremely confident that our free capital discipline will continue and make both project more accretive in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry this quarter had the cash flow from operations covering the dividend, did that include the &#x20AC;2.8 billion of liquidation of working capital?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Nitin Sharma from JPMorgan. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. Thanks for taking my questions. Three questions, if I may. First one on Stockman, what is the update on this project? I think the agreement between the three partners expired in early July, an update please. Second, you recently declared commerciality on Absheron discovery in Azerbaijan, how are you thinking about the exit options for this gas, if possible some thoughts on likely timeline for starting production in this field. And third a point of clarification, you have increased your stake in Novatek by 1% in this quarter, therefore your stake now is 16%, if I'm not mistaken with an option to buy an additional 3% more within three years, is that correct? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nitin. I hope you're happy with the increase of the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very happy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way. Some comment on Stockman and honestly this is not an easy part of your question. You were right the joint venture agreement for that joint venture terminated on July 1. We did not obtain terms that would have made this project profitable for all parties involved. Stockman is still in the pre-project phase. The bulk of engineering studies are done. There are still some unresolved issues including the tax treatment for instance. We are now discussing new contractual framework in respect of further defined joint Stockman project based on a 15 million ton of LNG. Total remains pretty much interested in playing an active role in this development. It will be up to Gazprom to decide who should be the partner of this new project, but we wanted to be part of this project. We cannot obviously launch this project or any project until we have a good visibility on all the major issues, and we are confident that it meets our financial criteria.</p>
          <p>Your second question was on Absheron. It's too early to say what type of exit we will use as a pipeline from &#x2013; if it will be the same pipeline or not. The drilling of the first exploration was started in January. You remember and of course I'm glad you noticed that we made a major discovery. It was a several Tcf discovery, the first test has been completed end of March with very satisfactory results.</p>
          <p>The side track is currently being drilled to reach deeper zone further north. Field development plan will now be prepared and submitted in the coming years, but very frankly speaking I'm not able to tell you any potential date for production. The last question was about Novatek. We own to date 15.2% of Novatek and not 16% as you mentioned, it's 15.2%. We cannot comment on Novatek results obviously because they're not released.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Guy Baber from Simmons. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy Baber with Simmons &amp; Company. Thanks for taking my question. Your partner in the oil sands earlier this week made some comments about potential time line slippage a little to the right on some of your joint venture, namely Fort Hills, Joslyn and Voyager upgrader as you all attempt to optimize the scope and the economics around those projects. So I just wanted to get your perspective there as to how you're thinking about those projects at this point. How you think the returns profile looks like in this oil price environment and the path to sanction, and just how important those projects are to you strategically? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Guy, for your question. Aside from Fairmont we have three major projects in Canada in association with Suncor, Fort Hills, the Voyager upgrader and Joslyn. And we're continuing to work on the engineering for each of them. And this is a typical step leading to an FID. We are reviewing the scope and design and we're looking at the profitability of those projects. Obviously, all aspects are taken into account including technology and also the new oil balance in North America. Fort Hills is fairly well advanced, but there is still room for optimization to reduce dramatically engineering and construction costs. In the context of our JV with Suncor, we expect to review those three project individually and as a group in mid next year. So at this stage, I would prefer not to speculate on any potential FID on those projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then I had one follow up. Obviously, you guys strongly prefer the dividend, but I had a question about share buybacks. So, clearly the stock here is trading at attractive levels on a valuation perspective and I assume it's trading well below what you all believe the net asset value to be. You have significant cash reserves, solid balance sheet. So my question is how do you think about buybacks as a management team and at what point would you consider using excess cash to opportunistically repurchase some shares in light of where the stock's trading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, we are happy to be able to return some cash to the shareholder by being at an increased dividend. Both share buyback we were I remind you, very active until 2008. Since then, there have been a couple of times where we did consider share buyback. But as a matter of principal we believe it's better to return cash directly through dividend. But I would never say never. I don't rule it out. That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your comments.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Patrick. A question on Halfaya in Iraq. If you could just illustrate or tell us about the cash flow recovery or what sort of cash flow we should expect in the next couple of quarters, now that that is project started up, I guess recovering the initial CapEx. And then secondly the LNG this quarter gets 30% reduction in sales. It looks like pretty much all of your LNG facilities are suffering some form of maintenance or other. I assume that would be the worst quarter or at least could I assume that that's the worst-case quarter and 3Q, 4Q should see a lot that volume come back? Yes, that's it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question on Halfaya, production started mid-June. We need to produce during three months at the rate of 70,000 barrels per day before we get some remuneration. So, we just started a month ago so just give us some time to reach the 70,000 and maintain the 70,000 barrels per day minimum production. Under the terms of the contract, yes that is a 70,000 barrel per day minimum production that we have to maintain. The current production is close to 100,000 barrels per day. So, we are on track. Both LNG &#x2013; on Halfaya, just one comment, it will be a minimum impact in second quarter production due to the term of the contract.</p>
          <p>On LNG, you must remember that we had security issues on the pipeline feeding the Yemen LNG plant and that we had maintenance in Snohvit, so Yemen and Snohvit are the main reason why our LNG contribution was less than in the previous quarter. Currently LNG is contributing about 20% of the net operating income of the upstream division.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Patrick, I have a couple of questions if I could. Firstly just picking up on the CapEx number, and looking at the organic CapEx number in dollar terms, you spent about $10.7 billion in the first half. I know the organic run rate was about $24 billion. I'm just  wondering are you still happy that you will reach that level or is it a case of a few more acquisitions will offset the asset sales to get you to the same net investment number? And then secondly, if I could just go back to the LNG, I think I missed this. Are you able to give what the contribution from the LNG business was for this quarter compared to a year ago and just how the costs have moved in the Upstream business because they looked a little bit higher than they did a year ago. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the LNG contribution, I just mentioned the question before that LNG contribute by 20% to the Upstream division net operating income versus 25% usually. About the first question you asked about CapEx, our organic CapEx was $10.7 billion first half this year compared to an annual budget of $24 billion, so we're in line with our budget because last quarter 4Q is normally higher than average.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. I had two questions. Both on two special charges you show in Q2. So first of all, there is a $48 million restructuring charge. I wonder if that might refer to the merger of Refining &amp; Petrochemicals. And in terms of that merger, what can we expect in future in terms of the synergies, the benefits from that? And my second question relates to the $338 million special charge shown. What does it include and specifically does it include any right of previous expenses capitalized on Stockman given that the shareholder agreement has expired. Have you written that off? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about the special charge of &#x20AC;316 million. This is related to a very old story that we already disclosed in the part in our annual report filing. In 2004, the SEC and the DOJ started an investigation into the company use of consultant in securing gas contract in Iran in the 1990s. We have cooperated fully with the U.S. authorities in this investigation. And we are currently operating with the U.S. authorities. And while the company denies any wrong doing in this matter, there has been discussion with both authorities since 2010, both of settlement as it is typical outcome for this kind of proceeding in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In the recent weeks, there has been some progress in the negotiation with the U.S. authorities. This is why we took the decision that it was a good timing to provide for this amount corresponding to the best estimate of the potential cost, fine and this government as they call it to be taken into account this quarter. It seems that finally, we will put this issue behind us, but I have no other comment on this subject. The restructuring charge of $48 million is not in refining and chemical. It is related to new energies and mainly sun power.</p>

          <p>Okay. Secondly, I don't know if you mentioned this earlier, because I got a little bit late on the call. But Elgin in terms of what's going on there and sort of kind of safety inspection, when do you think it's like that field is going to start up now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned in my speech, we, Total, and the UK authorities are making investigation on what happened on Elgin. The question, your main question is when do we expect to start production on Elgin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Production was tough for obvious safety reason, and the investigation is currently underway. Our teams are working on several scenarios which will take in to account the lesson learned. Approval from the relevant authorities will have to be obtained before restarting. It is challenging but our target remains a gradual restart before the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And third question on asset sales. There's been some media reports about you're selling your pipeline interests in France. Is that correct, and what sort of a value should we be looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no process at this stage in respect of this asset. As everybody know we have a program to sell asset and it's normal that you have rumor on the market. And we do not comment on rumor.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi it's Nicky from JPMorgan, thanks for the question. Basically two questions from me. Total UK has recently signed a two-year contract with a prospector offshore for high spec jack up rig. So the first question is, do you plan to sign more such contracts for high spec jack up rigs?

        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. It is nice to see the improved downstream results. I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you stand with the restructuring efforts in the attempt to improve return on capital employed through 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started the restructuring a few months ago. The objective is within a 2010 economic environment, we expect the return on capital employed to reach 15% by 2015. We are currently making the internal merger for refining and chemical. Many action plan are currently implemented, they will deliver value month after month and maybe year after year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it's fair to say that the improved results this quarter are simply a function of the improved benchmarks or macro-environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of the result is coming from the margin we enjoy in refining, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question I had, I was just hoping if you could provide a little bit of an update on new joint ventures in the U.S. activity in the Utica, the activity in the Barnett, given the weak natural gas environment here in the U.S. and then I think you mention a Cobalt spot in the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first question about our big joint venture on the Barnett. Due to the low gas price, we chose ourself to basically reduce the number of drilling rigs operating on this play. In Utica we started operation and we will increase gradually the number of rigs and the number of wells producing on this area.</p>
          <p>For the JV with Cobalt in the Gulf of Mexico, we're currently drilling the north plateau in the deep offshore Gulf of Mexico with Cobalt. I have to say that this is one of the most promising well in the JV. I have also to say that Ligurian #2 is disappointing, but that's the nature of exploration. As you know we have already drilled two wells as part of the alliance with Cobalt and North Plateau is the third well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question on Argentina. My understanding was Total is expected to start drilling for shales in the Vaca Muerta formation, could you give us more details on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you Jean-Luc for this question. Currently we're pursuing an active exploration campaign for shale gas and shale oil in the Neuqu&#xE9;n area and basically the Vaca Muerta area. We have so far drilled four vertical wells in the Vaca Muerta shale. We fraced one well on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:21) in April and the results were encouraging. This well has been successfully connected to the production network and the flow is exceeding 100,000 cubic meter per day. Overall, we intend to drill 10 wells this year, including some wells targeting liquid-rich gas prospect. We are running two rigs today and expect to add an additional one this year.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Mr. Jon Rigby from UBS. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Hi, Patrick. Two questions, the first is just to go back on the dividend, no one's asked a question for a little while. When the board considers the dividend and looks to it, how do you look at what the underlying earnings are to come up with the sort of 50%, because clearly, all the segments are pretty volatile at the moment. And I guess how do you balance what looks like a rather high or relatively high debt target of 20% to 30% against a relatively high payout ratio, 50%, against actually a fairly ambitious CapEx program. Would a lower payout ratio be somewhat more conservative I guess is the question I'm asking.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just on Myanmar, with it becoming sort of rejoining the international community slowly, I guess two questions, one is does that present you with greater opportunities, and second is are there restrictions or restraints or inhibitions on what you have been doing globally up till now, which will sort of fall away as things normalize with that country? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you Jon for your question, which once again give me the opportunity to repeat that we increased the dividend to $0.59 that quarter. The board consider in line with what we foresee in the future with the ramp up of our project which I remind you are accretive in term of cash flow and of course net income. We made always clear to the market that we wanted and we had a policy of a 50% payout in average over our long period of time. We favor dividend in respect, in comparison to share buyback as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>When you have a look to the gearing, which is quite low to the 21.5%, obviously this giving us room to implement to our strategy and continue and invest in our CapEx program. I remind you also that we can use a long list of assets that we can sell if needed and we have a commitment for this year in term set of asset and we will give more guidance in September during our Investor Day in London.</p>
          <p>Your question on Myanmar. Obviously Myanmar offer exploration potential, we are obviously looking at it. Our long time presence and good image in the country including among the population is an asset for us. We will continue and try and develop our activity and look forward to other opportunities in this country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm sorry, just follow up. Is &#x2013; maybe you can't answer this, but were there issues to do with the global operations of the Total that were being inhibited while Myanmar was regarded sort of on the blacklist?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A few years ago, we were prohibited to develop new field in Myanmar, that's correct. In the past, that was correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just with regards to production rules, I had a question about two licensees, which will influence that in the medium term. Could you perhaps update us on the state of negotiations with regarding the Mahakam block which I think is due to expire in 2017? And then secondly, a little bit shorter term, the ADCO license renewal in Abu Dhabi, what would be your sort of preferred option for that renewal, would it be change in partnership, fewer partners, higher fee I guess, and also perhaps just clarify what assumption you're making for ADCO in your 2015 production target? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Both the completion in Abu Dhabi ADCO where we own currently 9.5% and the production sharing contract where we own a 50% interest in Indonesia are under our negotiation, and I'm afraid that I can't comment on both negotiation.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Just a usual question on this type of conference call. The taxation in the Upstream division has been quite volatile. So, I don't know if you could be in a position to help us assess what could be the Upstream taxation based on, let's say trample prices for the remainder of the year? Then another usual question for this type of conference call, what's the status on Engina?</p>
          <p>And finally, a more longer term question with regard to the cost inflation that currently take place in Australia. You have two significant projects and I am wondering to which extent, especially on GLNG on which you are not the operator, you can truly be in a position maybe to mitigate this cost inflation? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, many question ahead of the Olympic games. First question, about the taxation rate in the Upstream division. The Upstream tax rate decreased by almost 4 point versus first quarter. This is, and I'm sorry for the answer, but this is true. This is mainly due to a mix effect on production with a decrease in related contribution from countries with higher tax rate like Nigeria, UK and Norway.</p>
          <p>About, the second question was about Engina. The field development plan is based on the standalone facility, already approved by the authorities. The basic engineering is completed and the call for tender made. Recommendation are given to LMPC and to the Nigerian Content Development Board and to the partners. The FID is pending these approvals, but obviously ongoing discussion around the new PIB are slowing the FID process.</p>
          <p>So, your last question about inflation in Australia and the GLNG, where we're not the operator. And I'm pretty sure you know that Santos around that gross CapEx for GLNG has increased by 16% up to $18.5 billion. The additional capital will accelerate at greenfield development in the Fairview and Roma areas. And as a result, some field development producing plan post 2015. We'll know we both forward and we now expect to produce more of our feedstock versus the initial view of acquiring a larger portion from third parties. This last comment is quite important. This is explaining an important part of the capital increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just a follow-up on your last comment. What are the implications on the net-net basis of the internal rate of return that you were expecting from the project prior and after this increased scope and increased CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A very small effect.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much Patrick, hi, I hope you're well. Patrick, three if I might. Firstly, just around the dividend, treatment of the French tax increase. So, I presume that the company will suffer that, it won't be suffered by the shareholders? And also on the dividend, I mean, and increases, do you review and think of the dividend now on a quarterly basis or should we, when we think about how the dividend will progress into the future be thinking or be considering upwards movements of or flat whatever on a every other quarter basis, as was the case obviously when you paid dividend on a half yearly basis? Secondly, if I could just ask you to give some indication on what you expect maintenance downtime to be like for the Upstream in Q3, relative to a year ago and also relative to the quarter that we just passed? And thirdly Syria whether you've got any thoughts in terms of how we should be thinking about your production going forward in that country. I mean my assumption is just to assume there will be nothing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about Syria is very simple, we are producing nothing in Syria and honestly with the current situation I cannot foresee any date when we would resume operation in the country, unfortunately for the Syrian population by the way. Your question about the French tax, on dividend you were right, the dividend is paid by the company. It is not a withholding tax. So, when we increase the dividend by 3.5%, you will receive 3.5% more. When we look at dividend of course we are not going to increase the dividend one quarter, to reduce it the quarter after, so we are reviewing it on a long term basis.</p>
          <p>And your last question about maintenance, maintenance was quite low, relatively low second quarter of this year compared to second quarter last year. This is a reminder, but last year in 2011 maintenance was much higher than in average in the past. Nevertheless, it is likely that third quarter 2012 maintenance will be higher than second quarter this year.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all right. Just going back to the dividend quarterly, if I think around a company like &#x2013; well I don't want to use an example, but I don't expect you to cut or reduce the dividend, I expect you to think about it long term. What I'm trying to get at is, is this something that you're going to be assessing or that we should be thinking about in terms of movement every other quarter, once a year, i.e. the dividend declaration you've made today, is that how you see things progressing for the next four quarters, is it next two, and then we review again, I don't know actually know how quarterlies will work in the mindset of Total, whereas I did understand how biannual worked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Being very, it's a simple answer from my side is that having full installment of dividend per year, this gives us four opportunity to increase the dividend every year. And that's it.</p>
