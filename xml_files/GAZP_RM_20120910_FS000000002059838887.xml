      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, dear ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you at yet another teleconference dedicated to the publication of the consolidated financial reporting by Gazprom Group covering Q1 2012 prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards.</p>
          <p>Once again, let me introduce myself. My name is Andrey Kruglov. I'm in-charge of the Finance and Economics department of Gazprom. And now I would like to introduce to you the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:08) and my part. I have here with me the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and the General Director of Gazprom Export, Alexander Medvedev; and members of the management board, the Head of the Production Department, Vsevolod Cherepanov; the Head of the Investment and Construction department, Yaroslav Golko; the Head of the Strategy department, Vlada Rusakova; Strategy and Business Development as well as the member of the board and the Head of the Economic Assessment and Pricing Department, Elena Karpel; as well as the Head of the Taxation Policy Department, Karen Oganyan.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, we have the Deputy Chief, Senior Accountant, Mikhail Sirotkin; and the First Deputy, Head of the Marketing and Gas Processing and Liquid Hydrocarbons, Alexander Medvedev. That is the representative attendance that we have.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by a brief review of the results of operations by Gazprom during the reporting period. As always, we have prepared slides, which have been uploaded respectively to our website and that you can familiarize yourselves with the already existing provision I shall make references to the slides.</p>
          <p>So, let me begin with slide number three. Based upon the results of Q1 2012, there had a decline in the number of the macro indicators covering our operation. The net revenue from sales went down 7% compared to the similar period in 2011. This could be explained by a decline of the gas volume sales in the former Soviet Union countries and Europe, which just partially was compensated by the growth in the dollar-ruble exchange rate. Also in Q1 2012, we took into account the effect from the reconsideration of prices as part of the long-term contract and were shift to the gas supplies, which took place in 2010, 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Retroactive review of prices was reflected in the reported Gazprom decline of revenue by the amount of RUB78.5 billion, which became the basic factor I think of such decline. The EBITDA, it went down 33%, amounting to RUB378 billion or $12.5 billion. Again, based on the end of the Q1 2012, the net profit of the company went down by 24%, amounting to RUB385 billion or $12 billion.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, 2012, the overall debt of the company went down by 9% compared to this figure by the end of 2011. At the same time, the correlation of the overall debt to the adjusted EBITDA remained at the level of 0.8.</p>
          <p>The production of gas during Q1 in 2012 remained practically unchanged compared to the previous period, and I would like you now to go over to slide number four. At the same time, the amount of the production of the liquid hydrocarbons grew. Gazprom Group produced 3.3 million tons of gas condensate, which is 14% higher than the level of Q1 in 2011.</p>
          <p>Production of oil amounted to 8.2 million tons, which is 4% higher than the level of Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, facing the results of Q1 2012, the production of electricity and heating by our generating assets remained proportionately at the level of Q1 2011, amounting to 49.5 billion kilowatt hours and 44.1 million gigacalories, respectively.</p>
          <p>The next slide presents the balance of the operation of our gas transportation system. I shall remind us that this figure reflects physical movement of gas through the trunk pipelines rather than commercial operation of Gazprom Group. During Q1 in 2012, the amount of gas transported through the gas transportation system grew by 3% compared to the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>The next slide, which is number six, one can see that during Q1 2012, the revenue from the sale of gas into the domestic market remained at the level of Q1 2011. The shipment of gas into the European countries and further abroad went down by 8% compared to the similar period last year and amounted to 42.7 billion cubic meters. However, due to the growth of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (05:52), the resulting reduction of revenue from the sale of gas in that region was 3%.</p>
          <p>The net revenue from the sale of gas in the former Soviet Union during Q1 2012 went down by 30% compared to the Q1 in 2011. This reduction can be explained by the reduction of the volume of the sold gas by 32% in this region, which was in part compensated for by the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (06:17).</p>
          <p>A few words about the oil and energy business or power electricity business in Gazprom Group, and here I'd like to draw your attention to the next slide. In Q1 2012, the revenue from the sale of crude and the gas condensate, as well as the refined products, grew by 18% compared to the similar period in 2011. The net revenue from the sale of electricity and heating inconsiderably went down primarily because of the decline in prices and the reduction in the output of electricity during Q1 this year. 26% in the structure of net revenue come from the sale of oil, gas condensate and refined products, and 9% from the sale of heating and electricity.</p>
          <p>Please, let's go over to the next slide. When writing a report about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:07) cash and money, one should pay attention to the changes in the working capital. Positive changes in the working capital during Q1 2012 by RUB248 billion can be explained by the following factors. The reduction of the reserve of gas by RUB71 billion because of the seasonal kind of activities, in Q1 the take of gas from the underground storages was in excess of the injection. The growth of the payables, primarily because of the commitments in retroactive payments for the gas. Changes in tax obligations of RUB149 billion, and the reduction in other payment of taxes by RUB55 billion in greater obligations in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:49) taxes, which due is to operational activities by RUB94 billion, as well as the increase of cash in deposits from three to 12 months of RUB15 billion.</p>
          <p>Please, slide number nine. Speaking about the operational cost, one should mention that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:10) growth came from leading Mineral Extraction Tax growth, which primarily can be related to a greater rate, growing from RUB257 up to RUB509 for 1,000 cubic meters as of January 1, 2012.</p>
          <p>The <mark type="ph" /> equity (08:25) tax grew by RUB49 billion. Besides, because of the reduction of the dollar and euro exchange rate to the Russian rubles, we ended up having a considerable net loss in terms of exchange rate differences, the growth being here RUB13 billion. Considering the fact of the growth of the operational cost came from losses, <mark type="ph" /> but (08:47) they grew the financial instruments related to a considerable growth at our Poland market gas prices during three months of 2012 compared to a relatively stable pricing forecast in the course of three months in 2011. The converted financial instruments of the group are primarily are represented by the commercial contracts for the supplies of gas, which are being re-evaluated according to the market price.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10, a few words about the investment program. When developing idea, we've been guided by strategic priorities for the development of the company and the expected market indicators. We adjust our investment program based upon actual results of our performance during the first half year.</p>
          <p>On September 11, which is tomorrow, we are planning to hold a management board meeting which will consider the issuance for a refined investment program in the amount of RUB877 billion, which is RUB100 billion above what the board of directors of Gazprom imposed in December last year. I'd like to note that Gazprom Group completely funds its capital expenditure through the operational cash flow, which makes us stand apart from the &#x2013; in our peer group all over the world.</p>
          <p>Slide number 11. Based up on the results of Q1, 2012, the net amount of debt went down by 31% compared to the indicators we had on December 31 of 2011. The reason in the decline of this particular figure are related to the improvement of long-term and short-term loans, the reduction of the euro and dollar exchange rate to the ruble, as well as an increase of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:23) their equivalence. The debt equivalence are considerably below the allowable levels. We continue to decline. The correlation between the net debt to the adjusted EBITDA was 0.4 in terms of the overall debt to the adjusted EBITDA of 0.8x.</p>
          <p>Now, based upon the results of Q1 2012, the net average rate &#x2013; interest rate in terms of all our borrowings was 6.5%. The structure of debt repayment by the group is well placed throughout the years.</p>
          <p>Now summarizing, I would like to note, in the efforts of ensuring a dynamic development of the company, we continue to pay special attention to control over the cost in capital investments. Based upon the results of the first quarter of 2012, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:07) considerably improved the free cash flow figure, which amounts to $7.1 billion. We also do our best to optimize our debt load, and based up on the results of Q1, we would considerably reduce the amount of net debt.</p>
          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all of you for your attention to this presentation. And now, I would like to switch over to questions and answers that we have about 45 minutes left for. Thank you very much. Myself and my colleagues would be eager to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Rodney Thomas from London. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for doing the call today. Would you give us any comment about the announcement today that you'd hold buying gas from your independent suppliers starting for an indefinite period, just what's the motivation behind this?</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] (12:42 &#x2013; 13:09)</p>

          <p>This question is going to be answered by the First Deputy of the Gas Marketing Department, Mr. Seleznev.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the issue that is being definitely considered, and the reasoning behind this is quite simple. Because today, in the gas market of Russia, we are confronted by an evident excess of resources, and consequently the demand for it. And so, in view of this situation, we do think about the possibility to change the amount of gas that we take from the independent producers and to take it into our gas transportation system. But I would like to calm everybody and say that no restrictions or limitations in terms of the supplies of gas from the independent producers to the consumers here are going to be applied, because this is taking place in full compliance with the existing legislation. Thank you. Next question please.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. This is a question to Alexander Medvedev. I have two, in fact, questions. The effect of retroactive price adjustment, the $2.4 billion, is it only at gas that was purchased in 2010 and 2011 or does it also take into account take-or-pay, i.e., did you reduce take-or-pay and reimbursed your clients in Europe, the first question? Is this taking also into account &#x20AC;1 billion you gave back to E.ON, or are we going to see &#x20AC;1 billion later in Q2 or Q3 this year? And the final question is about, while the European Commission has mentioned regarding anti-competition things, I was wondering if you had any comments, what do you think the European Commission had found in September 2011 rate and what are you going to do? Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] (16:21 &#x2013; 17:27)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Medvedev will be answering this question</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question is concerned, one should make the distinguishment between the retroactive payment on the one hand and the take-or-pay situation on the other, because these issues are completely unrelated to each other. The $2.5 billion which you mentioned, they apply to the retroactive payments which have been paid in Q1, and this amount reflects upon the agreements that we have with all of our basic counterparties, basically suppliers, for the supplies of gas in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>And as far as E.ON is concerned, then according to the agreement which we have with it, we reached it later. And so, this retroactive amount of &#x20AC;1 billion is paid according to the schedule which we also agreed with E.ON for this year, and this definitely will be reflected in accounting reports in the subsequent period.</p>
          <p>But on this particular point, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the amount paid in Q1, which was &#x20AC;2.5 billion, is almost two times &#x2013; more than two times lower than the request that was made when the prices were being reconsidered. And this, in its turn, means that a part of the impairment demand which was specifically for retroactive payment has already been freed and will continue to be freed in the future.</p>
          <p>And as far as take-or-pay question is concerned, I should say that not a single cubic meter of gas was lost by us this year. And in a number of cases, because of the difficult situation in the market, certain take-or-pay levels were reduced, with the consequent plan to raise them in subsequent periods. In such an adjustment, in neither case was more than 5%.</p>
          <p>And as far as the investigation by the European Commission is concerned, we in Russia have a very good saying that you can always see who the robber is because the hat is burning on his head. And so, in this particular instance, it's the hat on the head of the European Commission which would go into flames. Because first off, it was Gazprom who initiated the liberalization of the gas to market in Europe, and that was during the time when nobody make any gift to anybody in the form of market prices.</p>
          <p>And secondly, Gazprom continues to suffer from the blocking of transportation capacities by the major players in the European market. And thirdly, Gazprom has always been working in very strict compliance with the legislation of those countries where we perform our export and marketing activities. And as far as the abuse of the dominant position in the market is concerned, we do our negotiations exclusively based upon contractual terms and condition. And therefore, any request to reconsider pricing must be validated. And as overall, the destiny of prices is being resolved in the course of negotiation.</p>
          <p>And so, there are only four counterparties or four partners that we haven't yet resolved the pricing situation. First, this is RWE company in Chechen market, which is of particular surprise to us because in the adjacent Slovakian market we have long ago reached an agreement with <mark type="ph" /> STP (24:55). Then, another company is PGNiG in Poland, where we're still going through the arbitration process. The third case is in Lithuania, which as far as we understand is one of the instigators behind this investigation. And the inability to come to any terms on pricing with this counterparty can be explained by the fact that so far, we haven't been able to hear from Lithuanian side how much gas and for which period the Lithuanian Republic requires. So without understanding the volumes, without understanding the period of time, it is impossible to discuss any pricing whatsoever.</p>
          <p>And right next to it, in another kind of development, which is about a major gas buyer in Lithuania, which is a major producer of chemical fertilizers, and specifically <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:57) company. These are the issues that we have already resolved together with for a long period of time.</p>
          <p>So I could mention quite a few Russian things, but I would rather not do it right now. I would keep them for some later time. I would simply like to conclude by saying that I like to express hope and confidence, that together with the European Commission in the formal dialogue, we will be in a position to resolve the issues that the European Commission have to us. And so, in some very near future, I am planning to have a meeting with the Deputy Market Competition Commissioner and look him straight into the eyes and just ask the situation. Thank you. Next question, please</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Ron Smith. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, gentlemen. Of course, we noticed over the weekend that a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Japan on the Vladivostok-LNG plant, potentially 10 million tons, expanding to as much as 25 million tons. A few questions. First, what is the timeframe for the next step for this plant? When might we see a final investment decision? What might be the amount of investments and how much you split that up between the Japanese and the Russian side? And finally, with taxation set to rise substantially on the extraction of gas in Russia, how will that be addressed? Because it seems to me that the extraction tax goes up as much as the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:55) wants, it could materially impair the returns of such a plant. Will you have a special tax regime for gas that's heading to this plant? Thank you.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] (29:13 &#x2013; 30:03)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have Mr. Medvedev answering this question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The signing of this memorandum was not accidental. Gazprom made the announcement that in terms of the shipment of gas from the Far East, priority will be given to the liquefied natural gas. And there is not just one project that is going to being considered, but actually two projects for the Far East, which are the Vladivostok-LNG project as well as the expansion of the current existing Sakhalin II project.</p>
          <p>And our transition into this stage of the final investments decision will be made once the stage of a preliminary feasibility study is completed, which if one is to use a specific term for that particular part of the project, is the pre-FEED which is currently being done both by Vladivostok-LNG as well as Sakhalin II.  And the standard period of time for the next stage in such a project, if we do a quick work, that would take about 12 months. If we go at in an easy manner, that might take 18 months.  And so, in case we move along the Vladivostok project &#x2013; I mean in case the positive decision has been made, the final decision will be possible in the middle of 2014.</p>
          <p>As far as the taxation issue is concerned, I'd like to say that our government is sufficiently wise in order to kill the chicken which is laying not only golden, but also silver eggs. And so, quite obviously, in order to be able to keep the ability to be able to lay any sort of egg, it is necessary for the Mineral Extraction Tax not to be used as a fiscal instrument, but rather as an instrument to incentivize on the tax side of the operation of the natural resource producer. And this is the kind of an understanding that both in the case of the Minister of Finance as well as the Minister of Energy is really strengthening. And so, we would expect for the critical mass of such understanding to accumulate, and that would allow for the special taxation regime to be applied to the projects which are being developed in the risk areas.</p>
          <p>And on our part, we are preparing the very serious validation of both for the benefit not only of our off-shore, but also the LNG project that we're doing as well as the Achimov gas project, specifically where without exemption tax regime it is very difficult to make any final investment decision. And by way of a good example of the case, I would like to remind us that the export of gas in the form of LNG is exempt from the export duty by the resolution of the government of Russia. Thank you. The next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. During the presentation, you mentioned about the capital investments, that the management board will consider the possible increase in the capital investment. Could you possibly explain as to which particular projects you would expect the CapEx to grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Golko will be answering this question, the Head of the Investments and Capital Construction department.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as Mr. Kruglov mentioned, tomorrow we're going to have the management board at which we're going to consider this issue. Preliminarily, I can say that the investment program will grow, and the figure was mentioned in terms of &#x2013; overall, it's going to be growing by $100 billion, maybe slightly north. In terms of the overall amount of investment that we are going to work on, it will be about $190 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, if we talk specifically about different areas of our activities in terms of how this money is going to be distributed, as far as production is concerned, on the production side, this is about $243 billion. As far as transportation is concerned, this is about $490 billion. Underground storage would be slightly in excess of $30 billion. Surveying work, $30 billion as well. So these are the basic figures that one can basically share right now.</p>
          <p>Now, speaking about specific increases that we're going to have, then the basic one will take place in the transportation &#x2013; gas transportation system, which is Bovanenkovo-Ukhta connection. And in the similar token, I should mention the project in relationship slightly increased in Ukhta-Torzhok, and that is as far as the gas transportation part is concerned.</p>
          <p>Now, specifically in relationship to investments into production transportation, there will be also an increase here. That is the production drilling, and the booster stations will increase in terms of the number, as well as the changing of a physically redundant equipment in the NP area. Thank you. Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for the presentation. There are two questions that's coming from this particular speaker. The first one is about Gazprom's investments, as far as the group is concerned. In your presentation on slide number 10, you are showing that in 2012, these investments may go down by 27.9% or the level of RUB1.180 trillion. And in Q1 2012, investments within the group remained at approximately the same level as 12 months ago. So respectfully, my question is what is the reason because of which you expect that these investments would decline considerably in quarters second, third and fourth this year?</p>
          <p>Now, the second question is that next month you are launching the Bovanenkovo gas field, which gradually would boost the output of gas up to some serious level. And taking into account the fact that we do not observe any growing gas demand on the country, it is declining, wouldn't this mean that in the future, Gazprom may not need the volumes of gas from the third producers at all such as the Central Asian countries and the independents? Particularly, this question is of interest within the context of Gazprom naturally requiring to repay or return the investments which haven't done into this mega project, which is Bovanenkovo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this question will be answered by Mr. Kruglov. And the second question, with respect to the acquisition of gas from the third parties in the Central Asian gas will be answered by my colleagues.</p>

          <p>And now, with respect to the amount of investments that we have as the result of the first quarters, you can see some considerable amount indeed. But I would like to explain that the distribution of investments in the gas business in between quarters is not regular &#x2013; is not even. We do most of the work that we have to do during the winter months, and the Q1 is very much capital intense from this point of view, when we do the delivery of materials along the winter roads, when the fundamental work is being done which simply cannot be done because of the weather conditions during the summer months.</p>
          <p>Besides, one should not forget that this year, we have had several major launches which were ended. This is the Pestsovoye booster compressor station as part of the Nord Stream project. And also, the launching of the first line of the gas transportation between Bovanenkovo and Ukhta was also done. So these amounts of investments are going to be specifically this year, as I mentioned, and with respect to the increased by $100 billion that we heard from Yaroslav Golko.</p>
          <p>So specifically, the big amount in the first quarter can be explained by an uneven process in the investment process, as well as the need to complete the commissioning of our facilities in the beginning of &#x2013; as far as investments of the first quarter are concerned.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to the independence and the acquisition of gas from third parties in the Central Asia, I will pass the floor to my colleague.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] (47:55 &#x2013; 49:23)</p>
          <p>So as far as the Central Asian suppliers and the FSU countries are concerned, I would like to tell you the following. The companies in these countries, in Uzbekistan, in Kazakhstan, they act as our strategic partners. We have a number of very important joint projects together. So the issues of any adjustments or corrections of our current existing contracts are going to be considered very, very thoroughly by us, as well as cleared through our partners.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as the acquisition of gas from the independent producers, and specifically the question about what do we need the Bovanenkovo field for, I'm not an operations man, but I would like to give you the following kind of answer. Both the independents as well as others have their gas fields reaching the maximum <mark type="ph" /> per toll (50:29), and these are some major fields that they have as well as we have. And the Bovanenkovo is specifically intended in a certain part to compensate for the declining volumes of gas in the future that we get from the mature fields.</p>
          <p>As far as the acquisition of Gazprom from the independents is concerned, this is the kind of practice that we shall continue, depending upon the market environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, Mr. Medvedev is saying that he will also elaborate specifically upon the topic of Central Asian gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With each of our partners, we have a very special situation. The export from Kazakhstan is being done by our joint venture, KazRosGaz. And on top of it, the raw gas from the Karachaganak field is being processed at the Orenburg gas processing facility. So, these relations do not fit just a straight-forward buy or sell arrangement. They have a more complicated set of things in them.</p>
          <p>As far as Uzbekistan is concerned, in this country, we jointly produce gas together. And together with our Uzbek counterparts, we entertain plans to expand such cooperation in the future. And as far as Turkmenistan is concerned, I would like to remind us that the Turkmen gas, when we were arranging the contract, we expected that it would be shipped to Ukraine, and therefore we have this big volume, 40 bcm, 50 bcm, 60 bcm. And currently, we are buying under the contract, and I would like to emphasize, strictly according to the contract, about 10 billion cubic meters of gas a year. And so, it is the Gazprom's gas which changed the Turkmen gas in exports of gas in Ukraine as well as the further exports, which quite naturally brought about a very considerable economic result. The volume of Turkmen gas for next year hasn't been agreed upon. But it is quite evident that if the old volumes are going to remain &#x2013; sustained, in no way they are going to be related to the old indicators. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. We have time left for two questions. The next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Igor Kurinny. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the first question is about CapEx. Could you specify the figures which have been mentioned in the presentation, RUB1.180 trillion? Does it include any possible increase of CapEx? If not, what is going to be the total amount once the increase takes place?</p>
          <p>The second question is about the acquisition of gas from the independent producers of gas in Russia, because there have been not a complete picture given by the media. Could you give us a little bit more of information? Have you reduced this acquisition so you have completely stop them, and could you give us an outlook in terms of the gas for discounting, what took place in 2011, and how this would look now in 2012?</p>
          <p>Now the third question, about the average gas price sold in Europe in Q1, it was $384 which is lower than what was your output the whole year at $450. Does it mean that this outlook was a bit exaggerated, and that it's going to be adjusted downward?</p>
          <p>And my last question, could you also enlighten us about the retroactive discount forecasts? Do I understand correctly your answer that the maximum discount on top of $2.5 billion is going to be &#x20AC;1 billion or maybe even more? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Now, Mr. Kruglov is answering the first question, and other questions will be also answered by Mr. Seleznev and Mr. Medvedev.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the answer to the first question is very simple. Yes, the figure includes the planned increase of this amount that has been mentioned on slide number 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to the next question is coming from Mr. Medvedev. As he is saying, it was partially already answered in the previous instance, and he would simply like to add that the amount of delivers from the independent producers is going to be the bigger than last year. So, that's basically it as far as the independent's question was concerned.</p>
          <p>As far as the question of price outlook is concerned, the effect of the matter is that the figure of RUB415 billion did not take into account the retroactive adjustment. And consequently, both the revenue is to be adjusted as well as the respective applicable price.</p>
          <p>And as far as specifically the E.ON's case is concerned, this RUB1 billion, this is the total effect, retroactivity, plus the point adjustments for the period that the agreements hold. So if one is to perform a post-mortem, then there will be a lot of interesting things that one will be able to see. And so, unfortunately, we are not in a position to disclose all of the details of our agreements. You will &#x2013; later on will be able to see them based on the payments, as well as the level of prices.</p>
          <p>And as far as the price outlook is concerned, generally speaking, for the period of Q2, Q3 and Q4, I would say that that will be at the level of, maybe, RUB1 billion, give or take between 10%, 15%, while the remaining unregulated pricing issues will be reflected in the reporting for next year, but the size of the amount of consequences is incomparably less than what was taking place in the very beginning.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is with respect to the restriction of the acquisition of gas from the independent producers, could you please explain why this decision was made in September when <mark type="ph" /> in principle (01:03:00) the demand is starting to grow and not in June or July when the demand was at the low level? What exactly happened during the past two, three months which led to this decision being made now?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for a very good question.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] (1:03:22 &#x2013; 1:04:37)</p>
          <p>I would like to say that in the first quarter, there is a very good <mark type="ph" /> occurrences (01:04:43) in terms of the shipments into the trunk pipeline and its distribution, and we do the underground ejection of gas into the underground storage and also respectively increase the take from the independent producers. And so, the September is the time when the injection into the underground storage is coming to an end. But at this point in time, the demand is not yet growing. So that is why this situation came to be in September. But I would like to repeat that there are no restrictions in terms of the already issued access are being expected to be done by us, so.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] (1:05:29 &#x2013; 1:06:23)</p>
          <p>To further elaborate upon the gist of the question, dear ladies and gentlemen, let me also offer the following comment which might explain why the taking of gas is not as even as one might expect it to be. You might understand that our operations have a very seasonal nature, and the end of the spring and the beginning of September, specifically Easter time, which is being reserved for planned maintenance work, all of our capacities &#x2013; basic capacities, as you might know, are located in the north of the country, in Siberia, and they are &#x2013; all of the work is quite dependent upon these seasonal nature of weather, the most favorable season being summer. And about 18 comprehensive gas treatment facilities during the summer period are idled exactly because of the maintenance and repair work or for the upgrading work. So, thank you very much.</p>
