        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very pleased to be here with the top management of BNP Paribas to comment our 2012 Group results. So let me start first with the key messages for the year. The main feature of our 2012 results was certainly the adaptation plan that we announced back in September 2011 and that were fully completed at the faster pace than originated the plans.</p>
          <p>Just in 2012, we managed then to reduce our risk-weighted assets by &#x20AC;62 billion. And despite significant de-leveraging especially in our CIB, our operating divisions showed good resilience as revenues were actually 0.8% higher than in the previous year.</p>
          <p>The difficult economic environment put some pressure on our cost of risk, which showed a moderate increase at Group level to 58 basis points. Taking out Greek impairments, the actual increase in 2012 is in the region of 9%.</p>
          <p>We continued to improve our liquidity position quarter-after-quarter, more than doubling the excess of stable resources compared to year-end 2011. This now stands at &#x20AC;69 billion. We confirmed one of the highest levels of solvency in the industry with a common equity Tier 1 ratio and a fully loaded Basel 3 at 9.9%. All these contributed to an 8.3% improvement in net income, which reached &#x20AC;6.6 billion for the full year 2012. And as you can see, these were solid results despite a challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to the exceptional items. So before I go into more detail on the results, I would like to take a look at the main exceptional items that have affected the year.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the fourth quarter, the overall impact was negative for over &#x20AC;650 million, mostly due to own credit adjustments and to goodwill impairments, the latter mainly in connection with the &#x20AC;298 million adjustment on the goodwill of BNL.</p>
          <p>Looking at the full year 2012, the main elements were own credit adjustment on one side and the capital gain on the disposal of 28.7% of this year of Kl&#xE9;pierre on the other. Overall, the different elements almost compensate one another leading to a negligible impact.</p>
          <p>Going through the actual Group numbers, revenues were 7.8% lower, at &#x20AC;39 billion for the year, while costs were 1.7% higher. Cost of risk was lower at &#x20AC;3.9 billion, down 42%. Adjusted for the impact of Greek debt provisions, it actually showed an increase of 9.2%. Pre-tax income increased 7.5%, topping &#x20AC;10 billion.</p>
          <p>On the right column, you can see the operating division, which showed good revenue resilience. Taking into account slightly higher operating costs and a moderate increase in cost of risk, this led to a 0.8% improvement in the pre-tax income for operational divisions. Hence, as I've already mentioned, our net income improved significantly to &#x20AC;6.6 billion and due to sizable increase of our solvency in the course of the year. The return on equity remained essentially in line at just under 9%.</p>
          <p>Key to the good resilience of our operating divisions have certainly been our significant business diversification. As you can see, Retail Banking revenues as a whole were 0.4% higher, while those for domestics markets were a bit lower, minus 0.4%, due to a more challenging economic environment in Europe.</p>
          <p>Investment Solutions revenues marked a good progress driven in particular by the insurance business, while CIB revenues held up well despite the full implementation of the adaptation plan.</p>
          <p>Looking at costs of the operating divisions, Retail Banking showed good cost control with a 0.1% reduction. Domestic markets were even better with 8.8% contraction in the year. Investment Solutions costs were up 1.4% and they benefited from the adaptation plan in asset management, at the same time continued to invest in the development of its main businesses.</p>
          <p>CIB costs were 2.4% higher, but at constant scope and exchange rates they were actually down by 1.1%. CIB started to accrue the benefits deriving from the adaptation plan in particular from the completion of the staff reduction plan but continued to invest in the development on soft profit activities.</p>
          <p>Cost of risk at Group level remained moderate in 2012 despite an unfavorable context. As I've previously mentioned, cost of risk stood at &#x20AC;3.9 billion for the whole 2012. This was 40% lower than 2011, but adjusted for Greek debt provision; it marked a 9.2% increase.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter showed an increase of 17 basis points, compared to the previous quarter, which was mostly attributable to three main factors: 6 basis points to provision on one large ticket in CIB, 3 basis points for the impact of the macroeconomic context on BNL in Italy and 2 basis points for one-off impairments by Personal Finance.</p>
          <p>Let me look at the operation of cost of risk by business unit now, starting with French Retail Banking with cost of risk remaining low essentially in line with the previous year. As I've mentioned, BNL in Italy was affected by the difficult context especially in the latter part of the year, and Belgian Retail Banking showed a slight increase in cost of risk but remaining at moderate levels.</p>
          <p>Moving on the Euro-Med, cost of risk remained significant at a level essentially in line with the previous year. BancWest in the U.S. continued to benefit from the more favorable economic environment, confirming a decreasing trend, and personal finance saw a lower overall cost of risk for the full year, but with an increase in the last quarter partly due to the one-off adjustments I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Finally, cost of risk in our Corporate Banking was higher compared to the previous couple of years, which were at exceptionally low levels and had benefited from significant writebacks. The fourth quarter was affected by the single large ticket I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Based on the full year results published up to now, our 2012 net income of &#x20AC;6.6 billion ranks among the best vis-&#xE0;-vis our comparable peers confirming BNP Paribas profit generation resilience through the cycle. As I've repeatedly said, a key element in this resilience of our profitability has been, and remains, our diversified business mix. You can see from the chart of the allocated equity of our operating divisions how the well-balanced mix of our businesses and geography has been maintained.</p>
          <p>And to conclude with this introductory part, just a brief focus on the fourth quarter results, the last quarter of the year showed revenues at &#x20AC;9.4 billion, 3% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2011, while cost showed a 1.9% increase. Cost of risk were 21% below the level which in the fourth quarter 2011, however, adjusted for provision on Greece debt, it actually showed a 26% increase. Pre-tax income exceeded &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>You can see in the right column that the operating division showed a good operating performance, as compared to the previous year, which was impacted by the sovereign crisis. Gross operating income was up 32%, driven by good revenue growth and an effective cost control. Cost of risk, as already seen, was higher due to the challenging economic environment. If we look at the bottom-line, net of one-off, the fourth quarter showed a net income of close to &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to hand over to Fran&#xE7;ois, who will take you through the performance of our domestic markets. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. So some words about domestic market. I remind you that our domestic markets operation cover our full domestic networks in Western Europe, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Italy; and three specialized business: Leasing, Arval fleet management and Cortal Consors, our broker online.</p>
          <p>Domestic markets had to deal with a very adverse economic environment, obviously, last year, with flat growth and low interest rates. But despite this adverse environment, we had strong satisfactions. The first one being the point you see with the growth of deposits in each of our network and at an average, of 4.7%.</p>
          <p>We also had an increase of loans, but which a deceleration through the year due to a slowdown in demand on each of our markets.</p>
          <p>Despite this environment, we were able to maintain, with minus 0.1%, the level of our revenue, and we were very reactive in all networks on our expenses which, with the decrease, you see at 1.5%. This leads to an increase of our gross operating income of 2.5% and you see it on the right bottom, further improvement of our cost to income ratio in each of our main countries: Belgium, France, and Italy. I will come back to them.</p>
          <p>As a whole, and due to the increase of cost of risk mainly in Italy, we had a very slight decrease of our pre-tax income, minus 1%, so we are more or less at the historical high we reached in 2011. These are solid results with an improved operating efficiency we are very pleased with.</p>
          <p>If I now turn to our three main countries, beginning with France. You see the same evolution regarding deposits and loans. We focused on the development on small businesses and, especially important, we were able to innovate for our individual customers a strong acceleration in mobile banking services, I will come back to them for the future. And we are also very pleased with the quick development of a new line of products, protection insurance, bank insurance for our customers, which are low capital requiring and which bring to us a new purpose for revenues.</p>
          <p>Due to the environment, revenues decreased minus point &#x2013; minus 1.4%, but it's the same reactivity on expenses improving operating efficiency. Due to the success in maintaining a low level of risk, which Jean-Laurent mentioned, with risk to assets ratio of 22 basis points, French retail was able to maintain its high level of pre-tax income, a bit more than &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>If I now go to Italy, we are especially pleased with the growth in deposits. You perhaps remember that last year, at the end of 2011, we had a decrease of deposits in Italy. We were able to reverse this trend, especially in the field of corporates and local public entities.</p>
          <p>Loans decreased for the year, due also to the evolution of the market. But we were able to maintain a significant growth of revenues, the main explanation of it being the fact that margins on credit side held up well in Italy.</p>
          <p>BNL was very reactive in managing its costs, so we have a jaws effect of 3.6% in Italy between the evolution of NBI and the evolution of expenses. And you will see it on the bottom right again, a strong increase of gross operating income of 7%, so a very strong operational performance for the BNL.</p>
          <p>The challenge obviously in Italy is the evolution of risk. We had, like all Italian banks, probably in a lesser proportion, an increase of risk and so a decrease of pre-tax income of minus 12.9%. But we are very confident in our Italian operations and very pleased with this profitable result of the BNL despite a challenging risk environment in Italy.</p>
          <p>Belgium, which is our third important country; here we have an evolution of volumes on deposits and loans which remains a bit strong as in other country, due to the bit &#x2013; slightly better economic situation. The Belgian retail has been also very innovative with this as Easy Banking application, which is a hit in Belgium and even in Europe. And we were pleased on the corporate side to develop our cross selling with the various business line of CIB fixed income and cash management in first line.</p>
          <p>Positive evolution of revenues, slight decrease of operating expenses and, it's a new and important step in the necessary improvement of the cost to income ratio in Belgium. Due also to the low level of risk we had, in Belgium, and this is a very good performance, an increase of our pre-tax income as you see it of 8.4%.</p>
          <p>I now come to our action plan for next year for domestic markets as a whole. We like speaking about preparing the retail bank of the future. What does it mean? If we take our four clients' business lines, the main evolution is obviously for individuals with a strong development of all online and digital innovations. I mentioned mobile. I mentioned the Easy Banking in Belgium. We will also be very active in all the new payment solutions, contactless and on the mobile. We intend to be among the first European and worldwide banks for this new kind of digital services.</p>
          <p>Second business line, corporates. You know about what was the project, which is what is now a reality, what we call One Bank for Corporates in Europe and beyond with our CIB colleagues. We were very successful in acquiring new customers throughout Europe, and we want to leverage on our cash management capability. We are acknowledged as a leading actor in the eurozone. It's very important for our European customers, but now more and more for our American and Asian firms also.</p>
          <p>Third business lines, very small enterprises and small and medium enterprises. We developed a network of small business centers very successfully in France and in Italy. And the two specialized businesses I mentioned, Leasing and Arval, can develop synergies with the network for this kind of clientele.</p>
          <p>Last line: Private Banking. It's also a clientele where we are seen as very strong in Europe. We are the leader in the Eurozone. We are &#x2013; we have been awarded by the private bank as the best private bank in Europe. We have a strong growth in Italy where we are now implementing this model of cross-selling between retail and private and in all our geographies, we would like to have more synergies with corporates and small businesses.</p>
          <p>Through these four business lines, an adaptation of our networks, there will be still branches in the future, but their content will significantly change: more advisory, less daily banking or transaction-related services; more diversified formats and much more technology in the branches.</p>
          <p>We presented in Belgium just before Christmas a plan called Bank for the Future, which is exactly the implementation in Belgium of this strategy I just presented to you. We took into account the evolution of the behaviors of our customers. And we intend to develop significantly mobile banking and customer relation centers.</p>
          <p>So, key objective for Belgium remains to improve its operational efficiency. We had a step, as I said it last year, but do we intend to go further and further in the three years to come. So as a whole, strong commitment to our clients through the crisis: we did it last year, we will do it this year, investing in innovation despite a constant effort to improve our operational efficiency.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now I give the floor to Georges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fran&#xE7;ois. We will now move to &#x2013; good afternoon, first of all. We will now move to all the other business lines of BNP Paribas. So I will begin with International Retail Banking, Europe, Mediterranean, then BancWest.</p>
          <p>Europe, Mediterranean, I would like to focus especially on two or three things. First of all, we will continue and we have continued to develop deposits, you know it's very important to us, deposits for the new liquidity coverage ratio. And so the deposits are up 13%, this is the first point I would like to mention. Second, the success of the merger between our two subsidiary in Turkey, the former subsidiary of Fortis and the former subsidiary of BNP Paribas, TEB, into TEB.</p>
          <p>And you see, the cost/income of Turkey have declined a lot from 19% &#x2013; 90% to 60%. Due to very good operating performance in Turkey, we think that Turkey is very good for growth because there are a lot of people and we think we can develop a lot. Also, thanks to a cost saving with CIB and Investment Solutions inside TEB.</p>
          <p>Just to comment about Ukraine, Ukraine naturally continued to be difficult, but let's say now, we think the difficulties are over, and we think now we are back to normality except if, naturally, Ukraine will have some more difficulties.</p>
          <p>On top of that, in Morocco, which is also probably a growth area, we continue to open new branches because we think it's &#x2013; we can develop the business.</p>
          <p>BancWest now, BancWest is now back to strong profitability. You see that the pre-tax income is now &#x20AC;860 million. We have continued to grow the deposits, global policy of BNP Paribas, at a lower level to loans. We are going to develop our private banking activity as we are making in all the other domestic market, as Fran&#xE7;ois mentioned before.</p>
          <p>And so operating expenses are growing a little, just because we are strengthening the corporate and small business and also because we develop, as I mentioned, the Private Banking. In fact, the pre-tax income increased just because we have enjoyed the decrease of the cost of risk. As you know, the activity is much better now in U.S. than it was previously. So very strong engine for profitability as they develop as a group.</p>
          <p>Globally, what is our action plan for 2013? Let's say, continuity. The business is okay. So, first of all in BancWest, as I mentioned, we will continue to develop cross-selling with Corporate and the Investment Banking and to develop cash management. Cash management is naturally very good for deposits, and we will continue to develop wealth management as I mentioned. And naturally, we will continue to optimize the branch network.</p>
          <p>In Europe-Mediterranean, we &#x2013; naturally, we will continue to invest in our growth area. I mentioned Turkey, also Morocco, and we will continue, naturally, also to invest in cash management. Turkey, let's say, we &#x2013; as I mentioned, we think it's clearly a growth area for BNP Paribas.</p>
          <p>So now I move to the second large part of BNP Paribas, Personal Finance. You know that in Personal Finance, in fact, there are two activities, the consumer loans, which we continue to grow and the mortgages which are in a one-off model. And so that's the reason why you see that the global outstanding are flat but in fact, we decreased the mortgages and we increased the consumer loans.</p>
          <p>What is interesting in that is that we have developed a lot of very interesting commercial relationship. Large, we are deep &#x2013; we have signed some partnership with CORA and other &#x2013; and we are in the process to sign with other partners, but it is not public, so I cannot comment.</p>
          <p>And on top of that, we have a new model of development in some market where we have no funding, for example, Russia. In Russia, we have a specific joint venture with Sberbank. They give the funding and we bring the know-how and naturally we anticipate to be the first in personal finance in Russia. So we developed a new model to have funding with local actor.</p>
          <p>At the end, the results are that unfortunately the revenues are a little down due to two things. First of all, outstanding are flat; and second, we have naturally new regulations mainly in France what we call Loi Lagarde, which are not very, very favorable for personal finance. But we adapt because we have been &#x2013; as you can see, we have reduced our operating expenses of around 4% if we exclude adaptation costs.</p>
          <p>All in all, we have delivered a strong pre-tax income, &#x20AC;1.2 billion, just increasing a little because the cost of risk has begun to decrease as we have announced during the previous quarter. So globally, we think despite a challenging environment, we will continue to deliver good results.</p>
          <p>Action plan, very simple. We will continue to develop our business model. I remind you that Cetelem now we not only deliver loans, but we try to attract some deposits and to sell some insurance products through protection insurance. Globally, it is the beginning of a success we will continue. Naturally, we have also an industrial approach. We have some platform with BPCE just to be more productive. In Italy, same type of model. We know that &#x2013; you know that we have bought 100% now of Findomestic, so now we can deliver the synergy and we develop the same model as in France with Findomestic Banca, which is to try to get some deposits.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned, in other countries where we have some retail banking activities outside our domestic networks such as Turkey and we developed PF Inside, which is consumer finance inside banks. And as I mentioned, we have great &#x2013; we think that we will have great opportunity with Sberbank and probably also partner such as European manufacturers, car European manufacturers. So globally, we think it will continue to be a good profitability engine.</p>
          <p>Investment Solutions now. Well, we have developed our assets under management, not due to net asset &#x2013; positive net asset inflows, but due to performance effect. You know very well that the markets were good, equity and bonds. So globally, we are now close to &#x20AC;900 billion under management.</p>
          <p>Our net asset inflows, we can say that it is negative if we take into account the decision of our clients to re-internalize some operations. If we exclude that, in fact, our net asset inflows is positive of &#x20AC;5 billion. Business line, by business line, naturally, you know that asset management is under pressure and that, let's say, our clients, your clients, all the clients were risk-adverse in 2012. So we have outflows in equities and reserves, but inflows in money market and Banque de France; wealth management, it was okay mainly in Asia.</p>
          <p>Insurance, good asset inflows everywhere; and also in France, small asset inflows which is, let's say, not so bad in a challenging environment, because I keep reminding you that globally, in France, there were asset outflows at the level of the global insurance profession.</p>
          <p>So the results are very clear: good, let's say, good jaw, positive jaw effects, revenues plus 5% and operating expenses, minus 0.6%, at constant scope and exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Why is that? First of all, because we have strong business such as insurance and security services, as I mentioned. Asset management is under pressure, but we have decreased the cost. If you remember, we have explained that we will have &#x2013; we would have, last year, an adaptation plan. Now it's over and you can see that the cost of asset management are down 10% as we have explained that last year.</p>
          <p>So all in all, the pre-tax income is now at more than &#x20AC;2 billion. It is the first time, &#x20AC;2 billion and &#x20AC;100 million, which still we are very proud of this activity of Investment Solutions.</p>
          <p>Action plan, very simple. As I mentioned as before, continuity. We were, let's say, we were looked as very good for private banking in France with high net worth individual and also for institutional clients. So, we will continue.</p>
          <p>Specific focus on security services: as you know, there are some change in regulation in security services. We think we can use that to develop our business in security services. And naturally, and Jean-Laurent will come to that later. We will develop in Asia and &#x2013; for investment solution also naturally in the Gulf countries. So globally, our Investment Solutions is a very good place for stability and for growth at the level of the Group.</p>
          <p>I come now to CIB: so Corporate and Investment Banking, you can see that the decrease of the revenues is low. In fact, it is a little high than 2%. It is around 10%, if we compare what is comparable, don't take &#x2013; taking into account the fact that in 2011, there were some specific losses due to the sales of loans, as we mentioned at that time. But globally, we think it's a good performance just to comment. Concerning the financial &#x2013; the corporate activities, corporate bank, you can see that now globally the revenues are down 15%, which is in line with the fact that we reduced the assets of roughly 15%. It was our de-leveraging plan. We explained that last year.</p>
          <p>And concerning the Investment Banking, let's say, the first quarter, you have to remember that in December, the client activity was very low because the market was not very active and on top of that, Christmas was, let's say, during Christmas and New Year there were not act &#x2013; no activity at all, so like a seasonal effect.</p>
          <p>And naturally, we are very proud to have been nominated as the Bank of the Year by IFR.</p>
          <p>The results, the operating expenses, we are decreasing our operating expenses by minus 1%. This is a result of two different effects. First, we have reduced our workforce, as we mentioned last year, and we have invested a little in active &#x2013; in new &#x2013; not new activities, but activities which are very interesting for us, which are cash management and global deposit gathering because, as you know, our liquidity coverage ratio, I show, is very interesting, as Philippe will mention in a moment, to develop cash management and deposit.</p>
          <p>All in all, our cost to income ratio, if we exclude the adaptation plan is around 62% which is, let's say, quite high compared to all our competitors. As you can see, we will continue to be one of the best-in-class vis-&#xE0;-vis our competitor.</p>
          <p>All in all, so pre-tax income is close to &#x20AC;3 billion, minus 20%, due to the fact that on top of that, the cost of risk has increased. As Jean-Laurent mentioned, now, we are at a national and classical level because last year, if you remember, the cost of risk was very low and not normally, it was not classical so globally now, it's a normal cost of risk. So at the end, the pre-tax return on equity is more than 18%, which is correct in this challenging environment.</p>
          <p>If I look in some detail, advisory on capital markets, you can see that we continue to use a low value-at-risk. You know that the business model of BNP Paribas is client-oriented, not a lot of proprietary trading activities. So globally, we continue to have very low level of value-at-risk, perhaps too low by the time being at 34, but, let's say, we will continue to manage correctly this indicator.</p>
          <p>All in all, what have we done? We have first adapted to the new environment, Basel 2.5 and Basel 3. And second, two different things, in fixed income, the activity was good and you know that there were a lot of bond issuance run. In equity, the market was not very active as you know all, so the results are &#x2013; the revenues are down of 20%. All in all, the pre-tax income is at &#x20AC;1.5 billion, which is nearly 20% and we'll continue to be number one in all bonds in euro ranking. We &#x2013; I think &#x2013; we think it's very important in today's intermediation of the market. So we think we have shown some resiliency in this market.</p>
          <p>Corporate Banking, you know we have changed our model because now corporate banking, it's deposits and loans and the good franchise of BNP Paribas CIB is to have a lot of clients. That's the reason why we can continue to collect client deposits without overpaying these deposits, which is very important for the results. And to continue to manage our new model, which is Originate to Distribute approach. And this is, for example, interesting, and we are very pleased to have been named Aircraft Leasing Innovator of the Year.</p>
          <p>Now, we continue to originate aircraft activity. We don't keep the launch or any engagements in our books because now we go to the markets selling aviation bonds, which are very important. We continue to be there for the clients and it is not &#x2013; no more in our balance sheet. We continue to develop, as I mentioned, client deposit.</p>
          <p>All in all, the pre-tax income is lower, as I mentioned, because revenues are lower due to the de-leveraging and because the cost of risk have increased to a, let's say, a normal level.</p>
          <p>Action plan. Just to continue to transform our business model to develop client deposit and, as Jean-Laurent will mention in some moments, to have a specific plan in Asia as it will be explained later. In &#x2013; and naturally, to continue to &#x2013; our Originate to Distribute model as you can imagine is a an evolution for the staff, so we are in the process to continue and to &#x2013; also to differentiate our action region by region, because we think that our clients in Asia are not at all the same type of clients, for example, than in North America. So globally, we'll continue and we think that we are well placed and then our franchise in CIB is good, because on top of that, some of our competitors are leaving the floor.</p>
          <p>So now, I leave the floor to Philippe just to speak of our Group financial structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Group financial structure. So I will speak about liquidity first then solvency and then the book value per share.</p>
          <p>Liquidity. Our &#x2013; well, you know this chart now well, so I'm not going to enter into much detail. Just I would like to stress that our stable funding surplus was more than doubled in one year and so moving from &#x20AC;31 billion to &#x20AC;69 billion, so plus &#x20AC;38 billion. And more or less, it is to be connected with the increase in the central bank deposits in yellow at the top left. That was increased by &#x20AC;45 billion. So basically, we have increased our structural funding surplus and the additional surplus has been put in the central bank account.</p>
          <p>And while the total of this surplus, to a certain extent, the &#x20AC;69 billion being also included in a certain way in the &#x20AC;100 billion, total &#x20AC;100 billion of deposits at central bank. So we are building. We have plenty of long-term liquidity. We are building a surplus. We are depositing it at central bank for the sake of complying with the ratio. And of course, this has a cost because we are paying long-term liquidity and we are being paid almost nothing at the central bank. And the cost is in the corporate center as you have noticed.</p>
          <p>These &#x20AC;100 billion of deposits with central banks, a part of the &#x20AC;221 that are here, that is our available liquidity buffer made of deposits to central banks and assets that are eligible to the central bank's windows, meaning that we can get immediate liquidity against them.</p>
          <p>So this &#x20AC;221 billion are representing 119% of the &#x20AC;185 billion that are in the range on the previous page and that are the wholesale short-term deposits, meaning that we have here &#x2013; this time it's about a very short-term liquidity, in the previous page, it was about the structural long-term liquidity, this is about the very short-term liquidity. We are in excess of safety, if I may say so. First, because, it's 119%. And second, because the wholesale short-term funding is not overnight, of course. Its one month, three months, six months, up to one year. And so we could have hedged against that by maintaining liquidity at the same maturities. But indeed, all these amounts are available overnight immediately. So it's a lot of safety, a lot of security that is imposed to us by the new regulation.</p>
          <p>In order to keep this structural buffer, long-term buffer, you have to keep issuing medium and long-term bonds and notes. And so we have set 2013 issuing program at &#x20AC;30 billion this year after &#x20AC;34 billion last year, I remind you.</p>
          <p>The program last year was completed early November. And so we kept issuing indeed so in kind of ahead of in advance for the 2013 program. So at the end of January, indeed we have three months of issuing and we are already at &#x20AC;11 billion. So we are ahead of the curve.</p>
          <p>And the average &#x2013; what's interesting is to note that the average cost has been reduced significantly and we are issuing in average at LIBOR plus 73 basis points, mid-swap plus 73 basis points, sorry, on average versus mid-swap plus 109. So it's a significant reduction in the cost. So we have a diversified medium and long-term funding at competitive conditions.</p>
          <p>Now solvency. About solvency, I would just like to stress that we have reached an 11.8% common equity Tier 1 according to the current regulation that is applicable to us and translated in Basel 3 metric, it means 9.9%.</p>
          <p>The second thing I would like to say is that as you can see here on the graph, basically compared with the end of 2008, it's doubling; doubling of the ratio from 5.5% to 12%; doubling of the amount of common equity Tier 1 as well from less than &#x20AC;30 million to &#x20AC;65 million, so more than doubling indeed.</p>
          <p>So we are now extremely safe in terms of solvency having in mind that the figure at the very beginning was well not so relatively safe as well as it's shown by the fact that we behave relatively well during the crisis all along.</p>
          <p>Then the net book value per share is reaching, so it's &#x2013; we're reaching a round figure so it's easy to remember; &#x20AC;60, &#x20AC;60.8, &#x20AC;60 for the net book value per share and &#x20AC;50 for the net tangible book value per share.</p>
          <p>It's an increase &#x2013; for the book value per share, it's an increase by 6.5% per year since 2008, and we are relatively proud to have increased that book value per share year after year due to two things. First, we enjoyed positive results year after year throughout the crisis, so positive results. We never dented the capital. And second, we avoided dilutive rights issues that could have reduced also the ratio &#x2013; the book value per share as well. So we protect our shareholders and we are &#x2013; we try and succeeded in avoiding too dilutive rights issues.</p>
          <p>And so the dividend now &#x2013; so we are proposing a &#x20AC;1.50 per share at the next AGM. You remember that in the context of the adaptation plan, we had announced &#x20AC;0.25 payout and strip option for two years. But indeed, as we over-performed, it was no more necessary this year to do that. So we pay in cash and we move up to a payout ratio of almost 30%.</p>
          <p>The chart is showing that in the past and again, it's the kind of exceptional situation of last year but adjusting for that, in the past, we have paid between 30% and 40% payout ratio in the recent past.</p>
          <p>So this is it now. I hand over to Jean-Laurent for the action plan of the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philippe. So now let's move to the 2014-2016 business development plan. The first stage of this plan is represented by the launch of Simple and Efficient ambitious plan to improve the Group's operating efficiency. I'll tell you more in a second. The second stage will comprise development plans by region or business. The first example being our Asia Pacific plan which I will present to you afterwards. Development plans will be progressively announced during the year with the objective of presenting a full 2014-2016 development plan at the beginning of next year.</p>
          <p>Let me introduce now to you Simple and Efficient, BNP Paribas' ambitious plan to simplify the Group's operations and improve its operating efficiency over the next three years. It is a far-reaching plan that involves all businesses and all geographies. Over the next three years, we intend to invest &#x20AC;1.5 billion in order to generate by 2015 yearly cost saving of &#x20AC;2 billion. These savings shall be split essentially in line with the current business mix of the Group, that is to say, half Retail, one-third CIB and one-sixth Investment Solutions. The implementation shall be monitored transversally in order to optimize its effectiveness and the steering of the plan shall be followed directly by the top management.</p>
          <p>As I've said, a key point is that all businesses and all geographies where the Group operates will be involved in the plan. The plan will center on five main access of transformation namely; reviewing processes, rationalizing tools, simplifying operations, client serving, and cost optimization.</p>
          <p>In addition, there will be transversal approaches, sorry, to enhance operating efficiency such as digitalization processes, increasing delegation or simplifying internal reporting. I can tell you that to date, we have already identified over 1,000 initiatives for this plan.</p>
          <p>The second plan I referred to earlier is our Asia Pacific development plan. We are already one of the best-positioned non-Asian banks in that region. For example, we have a presence in 14 countries, with full banking licenses in 12 of them. This is an area where we already generate some 12.5% of our non-retail revenues, it's close to 8,000 staff in the different CIB and Investment Solutions businesses.</p>
          <p>We can leverage on a strong platform with recognized franchises. Let me mention a few significant example. In CIB, Trade Finance, we have a setup with 25 trade centers which is performing well. In Cash Management, we ranked number five in Asia. In Fixed Income, we're a top player in derivatives, but this is also true for Investment Solutions. For instance, we managed &#x20AC;30 billion of assets making us the number eight private bank in the region, and we are also the number seven non-Asian insurance with a presence in six countries.</p>
          <p>Our presence in Asia Pacific is then complemented by our partnerships with large local players such as State Bank of India, Shinhan Group in South Korea, Bank of Nanjing in China. As you can see, we have today solid platform to build our future development in that region.</p>
          <p>BNP Paribas is fully committed to increase its presence in this fast-growing region. As you can see from the map on the right hand side was specific growth plans for each country. Our growth strategy will target two types of clients, corporates and investors. With corporates, we intend to strengthen the commercial setup with multinationals as well as with medium, large, local companies.</p>
          <p>As a result, we intend to broaden our local client base accompanying our global clients in Asia as well our Asian clients in the process of internalization. In addition, we shall leverage on our Corporate Banking to further develop Trade Finance and Cash Management, and on Fixed Income to push development on bonds, flow products and hedging instruments.</p>
          <p>Looking at investors, we shall increase the Group's presence to boost funding capabilities and we shall develop our originate-to-distribute approach, strengthen local asset management and securities services as well as expanding our private banking clientele base, especially with the wealthier ones. All this while concurrently identifying the cross-selling between our CIB and our Investment Solutions.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we shall look to develop new partnerships with large local players especially in insurance where we intend to develop our activities especially in China and in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>Our target is to generate a significant revenue growth over the next four years. In fact we aim to boost the revenue contribution of our Asian CIB investment solutions division to over &#x20AC;3 billion by 2016, meaning an annual growth rate of 12% over the next four years. And we aim to increase our funded assets as well as our deposit base at a similar pace. In order to foster this plan, we shall be hiring some 1,300 additional people locally over three years. And making sure that we actually get where we want, we have a member of the executive committee already based in the region who will steer directly the development plan. I'm confident that BNP Paribas can play an increasing important role in the development of the Asian economy, and that Asia Pacific can represent an increasingly important part of our core earnings.</p>
          <p>And now to conclude, I would like to sum it up with three takeaways. First, BNP Paribas has delivered solid results thanks to its diversified business model designed to serve its clients in a challenging economic environment. Second, BNP Paribas' model has already adapted to the new regulations, meaning that the focus can now shift to the pursuit of commercial development. And then, third, we are working on the development plan for 2014-2016 and have launched the first phase of this plan I've announced to you today, that is simple and efficient.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to you, and together with my colleagues we shall be happy to take your questions. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The way I sort of envisage your program is that you're taking out costs from existing businesses and creating room for investment back in the Group in areas like Asia. So, presumably there will be a lot of inflation and investment to offset the &#x20AC;2 billion cost takeout. So I was just wondering how you were thinking about the actual impact in the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have already answered your question, so congratulations. The evolution &#x2013; normally, the evolution of our cost should be the normal inflation drift year-after-year, less those amounts and ultimately after three years, less &#x20AC;2 billion, plus the one-off cost in the meantime, of course, but after three years, nothing anymore, and plus the costs associated with the development plans. And to a certain extent, we could say that these cost savings efforts are, in a way, helping the financing of the development costs that we are going to incur in our development plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Can I put it a slightly different way then? In terms of how you perceive the sort of ongoing, normal business as usual, inflation and investment in the business. Would that &#x2013; if you didn't have any cost programs, would we be talking about 3% or 4% per annum?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> With the (54:28) inflation this &#x20AC;2 billion cost program is considering that the cost base of the Group will normally evolve along with inflation. So if we take a normal trend, including inflation, that might be different according to the different geographies; this is the normal definition. Out of that we are taking &#x20AC;2 billion. And away from that, we have development plans in which we'll have to invest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And inflation is 2%, 3%, 4%, depending on the country part and the like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Kinner from Citi. So, just to follow-up on <mark type="ph" /> Robin's (55:13) questions, I guess the natural question is to ask how much kind of investment do you see in terms of the development plan?</p>
          <p>And then if I may ask another question, just on the capital ratio, Basel 3 ratio at 9.9%. Your previous target was, I think, 9%. Clearly this will grow in 2013, 2014 onwards. That kind of growth in your Basel ratio will weigh on your returns, so at what point do you think that you need to make a more dramatic change in terms of your payout ratios? Or alternatively do you see that much growth in <mark type="ph" /> your tranche to use that capital? (55:55)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is two very different questions. First one, there is no reasons why the Basel 3 ratio would go up. 9.9% is good enough. The minimum for us including the global SIFI surcharge is 9%. It could be &#x2013; even go down one day when, one day, it would be considered that the Eurozone being one single currency area with one central regulator is not anymore the <mark type="ph" /> addition (56:25) of different countries. That day there would be a positive effect looking at the global SIFI valuation of the surcharge. So, 9% we consider it's the minimum for us but it's also the maximum looking at &#x2013; from the regulatory side. So, we have room to grow and to invest this excess of capital and we intend to invest that excess of capital organically. So, this is first.</p>
          <p>Second, we look at the payout. This is going to be one dimension of the development plan. In one year time, we'll tell you basically what could be or what should be the policy of the Group looking at the payout ratio. Historically, we were in between 1/3 and 40%. Looking at the size of the capital base, basically, it would push for some kind of an increase of the payout ratio, but it's too early to say and clearly it's one of the key dimension of the, let's say, development plan to be released in one year. Until then, we cannot comment more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sorry, just on the cost savings, just how much investment on the cost side do you expect in the development plan? This was just a follow-on from <mark type="ph" /> Robin's (57:45) question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to say. The development plans, we will have to wait next year just to have a comprehensive picture of the portfolio, of different development plans we'll have either geographic or businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, if may just ask one more question? Just on BNL, the higher provisioning that we saw in Q4, just to try and better understand, was that related to higher NPLs? Or was it related to bolstering the provision coverage of the existing NPLs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>BNL has the best coverage in Italy by far compared to other Italian banks. This is simply the result of the deterioration of the economic trend in Italy last year. And well, this is it. This is the NPL.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Neuez from Goldman Sachs. I just had two questions, please. The first one is on the risk-weight. So you have a very high capital ratio now, but investors continue to question sometimes the validity of the risk weighting in particular because of the model usage. And the Basel Committee published a report on that showing that BNP had some of the lowest risk-weights in particular on their trading assets. Then there is an exercise that has been asked for banks to do but where banks are not named on how much they allocate towards standard portfolio of assets. Just had &#x2013; could you give us a sense of sort of where you stand in that hierarchy? That would be my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The sense is that we are very comfortable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question, again, on this cost program, if I may. Have you got a sense of where you want to end up in terms of the cost-to-income ratio for the Group? If not for &#x2013; and is the &#x2013; you used to, before, in the stable environment take out about a point a year. Is it something that is reasonable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a Group as it is today and we are improving the cost efficiency. We take out away from inflation &#x20AC;2 billion and then we have a bunch of development plan to be released progressively and then we will have some adverse effects that can come from either the new regulation, it can come from economic scenario. So, it's too early to talk about the global cost income of the Group. There is no one single figure, one single target for the Group.</p>
          <p>We are going to consider each potential development either by business or geographies. These are separate initiatives. We are going to improve the cost efficiency of the Group. We will have to suffer from additional cost of doing business, that is to say the new regulation. We're adding up layers of regulations in Europe, in the U.K., in the U.S., all over the place, so this will have a cost. And in the end, in one year's time, we'll give you the cost-income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>It's going to be an aggregate figure. We are not driving the bank, looking at one single figure that might be the cost-income, because there are so many different businesses, with so many different level of, I would say, cost-incomes. You cannot just look at BNP Paribas with one single figure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Piers Brown from Macquarie. Just a couple of questions. First of all just in terms of the capital again. You're obviously very comfortable on a Core Tier 1 ratio basis, I'm just wondering how you think about the leverage ratio under Basel 3 and whether you see that as a business constraint going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just on the funding structure. A lot of progress obviously in terms of deposit gathering. I wonder if you could just share with us your thoughts on what is the sort of the end station would be in terms of your targets for the balance sheet structure, both on a loan-deposit ratio and also in terms of the short-term funding component of the balance sheet? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the leverage, we are at now below 20x. Indeed it comes along with the rest. As you all know we have worked for 18 months, we have worked for on the solvency issue, on the deleveraging, on the liquidity issue, and by improving both the liquidity ratios and solvency ratios, we ended up improving by the same token improving the leverage. So less than 20x, if we translate that into the Basel 3 metric that includes the off-balance sheet elements it makes less than 30x and the limit will be 33x so, we are &#x2013; well it seems that we are okay as well.</p>
          <p>About the structure, I think we have to come back to the cash balance sheet I have shown. I mean, what is important is not the loan-to-deposit ratio. I mean, if you look at GMAC I mean they have no deposits. They are borrowing money and they are lending to customers and nobody questions the loan-to-deposit ratio. Indeed what is important is the sum of deposits and stable funding, and of course, equity and reserves, so &#x2013; and on top of that not only the loans but also, as we are not purely a lending bank, but we are also a CIB bank with market activities and markets require an inventory, so you have to take the inventory as well as something that is necessary. Even if it's short-term, you have a minimum inventory that is always there, so you have to take that as a kind of need for stable funding. So the figures are here, I mean, so the total is that we are 110%.</p>
          <p>And at this level, I mean we think it's okay because &#x2013; well, to be counted at I think at 100% would be okay. We were at 100% previously and it was quite enough as shown by what happened over the last two years. But the regulation, in order to comply with the liquidity coverage ratio and the future net stable funding ratio, we found that we had to be more than that, so to pile up, structural excess, surplus of long-term liquidity. But we think that that 110% it's okay to be in line with the regulation.</p>
          <p>And sorry, and last element of answer to your questions, back to the same slide, sorry. About the short-term wholesale funding, I think what is above the line, if you want, the orange part and the red and yellow parts on the left-hand side, this is &#x2013; it doesn't matter. If you have more short-term funding, you have more short-term assets, and then it's not that important. Indeed, what is important is to have always a good maturity matching between your short-term liabilities and your short-term assets in order to be able to reimburse your short-term liabilities if they are not renewed, by not renewing your short-term assets. So, it's what we did last year during the second part of the year. So &#x2013; and the total amount is not that important.</p>

          <p>It's Jeremy Sigee from Barclays. Two questions, please. Firstly, could you talk some more about CIB revenues? You talked about seasonality, but you seem to have declined more than peers sort of on a full year basis, and I wondered whether that's one of the areas that you see scope to regrow as part of your growth plan?</p>
          <p>And secondly also on the growth plan, could you talk about how ROE comes into your thinking as you sort of, like a number of banks, try to get your ROE definitively above the sort of 10%, 12% level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, about the return on equity, just make it simple, we are not trying to have a guess. There are too many actors that are trying to have a guess about what might be the future. We are building a business plan, and when this is ready, we are going to disclose the return on equity. So, we are not going to say cost of cut people is such or such and we should be over &#x2013; doesn't make sense.</p>
          <p>So, we are a real company. We are servicing customers. We are trying to do a decent business out of that. We have development plans, we have cost cutting, we are improving the operation &#x2013; the operating efficiency of the bank. And based on that, looking ahead, we'll get something. The cost-income, level of revenues and the return on equity the day we are ready, we say. We are not ready, we cannot comment this way.</p>
          <p>The fact is that with 9%, close to 9%, we have the best return on equity throughout Europe. In my opinion, the best way to have a decent return on equity, a decent level of equity is to go that way, building a business case based on customer needs, not trying to have a guess with minimum and threshold about cost of equity and that kind of stuff. There are too many banks in the past that moved that way and we saw the results. So this is not our philosophy.</p>
          <p>And again, it's very essential to understand the way we are looking at the situation. We are commercial operation serving customers; we have geographies, businesses; we are looking at each of these different situations; we look for two, three, four years depending on the situation; then we have an aggregate number. But we cannot have a guess if this job is not done seriously. This is very important for us.</p>
          <p>Second, for CIB, Georges is going to give an answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Concerning the revenues of CIB, I don't know if we have decreased more than the competitors. Sometimes it's difficult to compare because, let's say, the business model is not exactly the same. What is sure is that first, not to be a U.S. bank with &#x2013; to have, so, U.S. dollar native in term of fundings, let's say, is not a good thing. So we are compared to some American banks, we are, let's say, it was more difficult.</p>
          <p>On top of that, you have to keep in mind that we have achieved deleveraging. A lot of other banks have still the deleveraging in front of them and they say 'okay, we will sell a lot of things' so I will not comment about those points. So we have done so, we have reduced our balance sheet, and naturally, as I mentioned, the revenues have decreased because our balance sheet at the level of CIB have decreased.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we don't only look only at revenues, we look, as I mentioned, at cost-income ratio because as you know, specificity of CIB is that CIB is sometimes a volatile business, it depends on a lot of things, so we have to carefully manage the costs. On top of simple and efficient we always look carefully at the cost on the CIB and we will continue on top of simple and efficient. So, we look at revenues and we look at cost-income ratio, which for us is very important.</p>
          <p>And to come back to the past you can note looking at the level of CIB that the return on equity of the CIB business is not so bad, as I mentioned. I am not sure that a lot of banks have been &#x2013; have shown, last year, the same type of return on equity, which is just below 20% before tax. So, we manage revenues, cost, cost-income ratio, and return on equities. And naturally, as Philippe mentioned, funding, because also we have &#x2013; naturally the funding and all what we have done concerning the balance sheet, it has a cost, because naturally we have passed also a large part of the funding cost to the mid-tier because naturally is has a cost in the end. But it is behind us now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Anke here from RBC. Sorry to ask again about your capital. Clearly, you're quite clear that you exceeded your 9% target and looking at consensus and just assuming a 35% payout ratio you have next year like &#x20AC;4 billion of excess capital on top of this. So, I just wonder when you think about your organic and about investing your excess capital, firstly, I assume it's organic and how should we assume it's not going to be dilutive to your returns? So do your target Group return to be delivered over three, five years?</p>
          <p>And then maybe on that note, on Asia, you have given us some revenue target. But what's the profitability of the operation currently and what's your target?</p>
          <p>And then just lastly on IAS 19, am I right in assuming there is no impact? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shall I start with IAS 19? No, you're &#x2013; as you full well notice with the changes of IAS 19 and the corridor which will go away, there is an impact, which at the end of the this year stands at &#x20AC;570 million. So, meaning as of Q1, this &#x20AC;570 million, which is not an P&amp;L element, but will be an OCI element, which will come impacting the capital. The &#x20AC;570 million is pre-tax.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Asia, we have not given too many details. We have given our ambition to increase revenues by 50%. But you have seen that of course it involves increasing the loan book by 50% as well and deposits as well. And so it will create risk-weighted assets as well. So this is an example of organic growth. So, it's just one example. Asia is not the biggest part of the Group at the moment. But it's clear that if we &#x2013; well, the development plans we are going to adopt are going to be profitable, otherwise, we are not going to accept them. And they are going to be risk-weighted asset consuming, of course.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone, Nick Davey from UBS. Two questions, please, if I can. The first, could I just take you back to liquidity and you've talked a lot today about the 120% liquid assets to short-term funding and being essentially LCR compliant at a Group level. I wondered whether you think about liquidity from a currency-specific level as well? There's been some discussion in some regions about LCRs in each of the major currencies in which banks operate. Do you think about that in your various currency books?</p>
          <p>And the second question, please, on capital, you've mentioned the IAS 19 impact in Q1. Could you just talk us through any other impacts that are coming from the treatment of insurance before you move on to the Danish compromise? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question, the answer is yes. We are looking at the ratios currency per currency and even to a certain extent country per country, which is not always exactly the same. Because at the moment supervisors tend to have a very fragmented view of all this because they are a little bit panicked by all what happened. So yes, it's part of the management of the liquidity, so now we have to see how all these regulations are going to be translated in each country, but we are ready to be obliged to comply with kind of liquidity coverage ratios per currency and per country.</p>
          <p>About the insurance and contrary to the other French banks, we had already deducted &#x2013; we were already practicing the <mark type="ph" /> DMA (1:15:07) I mean some deductions from our capital base, due to our insurance investments. The new &#x2013; well, the Danish compromise is taking things another way. So, instead of deducting some things, they are weighting, risk-weighting their insurance investments. So for us, it's an additional cost to &#x2013; but smaller than our French competitors, that were not deducting anything up to now from the common equity Tier 1. They were deducting from the Tier 2 or whatever but not from the common equity Tier 1, contrary to us. And all this additional costs is of course included in the around 200-basis points that are the difference between Basel 2.5 and Basel 3 for us, roughly. It's already included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So as a complement, so indeed in our Basel 3 projections versus the current Basel 2.5, it is in. However, there is a slight amendment to the French regulation on the <mark type="ph" /> ACP (01:16:15) on behalf of Basel 2.5 which goes towards that Basel 3, which will lead to a little impact on our Basel 2.5. But as I said, it's a step towards Basel 3, so for Basel 3 it will not be impacted. But that step, is much larger for the other two French banks who are not in the model in which we are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andrew Lim from Espirito Santo. Just following on from that previous question, could you update us on the group funding for BNL, or perhaps for Italy is a whole as well? And also how much LTRO money you've paid back and how you see that developing going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not given the exact amount of LTRO we had drawn. And so we are not going to give figures for the reimbursement either. We have reimbursed a significant part of the LTRO, but nothing in Italy; we have kept all the LTRO we had drawn in Italy and that is playing a role in the fact that we were able to re-use the intragroup funding to BNL. Part of the intragroup funding was replaced by the Italian LTRO, and so that part has been kept and the intragroup funding has gone &#x2013; well it is remaining very low now at &#x20AC;7 billion or something like that. So, it's not an issue anymore.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Delphine Lee, JPMorgan. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Just two questions. First of all just on the topic of regulation. Now that you comply, you're well above the minimum on capital and also quite comfortable on LCR. What kind of topic is really &#x2013; could be a potential risk or issue for Group returns?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just coming back on the usage of excess capital for the Group, where do you stand on the remaining stake of Fortis which you don't own? Is that something that you would consider in the timeframe of your business plan? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second point, we are very much satisfied by the partnership we have with the Belgian state in Belgium, so fair enough. We are the largest bank in Belgium and they are pleased to be a minority shareholder in bank and this gives a lot of, I would say, fluidity in the way they are looking at the bank. First.</p>
          <p>And second, regulation, well, there is still a number of regulations to be decided, to be known. There will be details. Quite often details are costly. There will be a new regulation or at least implementation of recent regulation in the U.S., in the U.K., in Europe, in France, in &#x2013; all over the place. So all that is creating additional complexity. It's too early to understand what's going to be the additional cost of doing business, but there will be some additional cost of doing business; it's not going to be marginal.</p>
          <p>The good point is that in the end, not so many banks will be able to stay in those businesses, global businesses. It can grow from cash management, trade finance to capital markets or international retail or investment solution. This is not only fixed income. So it's going to be a different universe. It's too early to say. But all that is going &#x2013; all those different layers is creating every day an additional cost of doing business. So, progressively, we'll have to organize the bank, we'll have to prepare the bank. This is why right away we are entering in that simple and efficient program to be in any case ready to &#x2013; to be there in any case. Not all P&amp;Ls from any banks would allow those banks to be there in three, four, five years in all those businesses, so this is the nice point.</p>
          <p>It's going to be tougher but in the end, there will be more clarity in the business. This is about concentration, which is something very classical in the global industry. We're on the verge of some kind of simplification, less global actors. And this is the way it is, we have to be ready to enter in that phase. Obviously, the global economic scenario worldwide is not the best one to enter in that kind of an evolution, but this is the way it is.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Alex Koagne of Natixis. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Alex Koagne from Natixis. Just two quick questions from my side. The first one is on the French retail banking, one of your competitors said yesterday that the cost of risk would increase by 10% in 2013. Do you share this view or do you see a higher increase?</p>
          <p>Secondly is on BNL. We definitely saw a very good deposit gathering. I'm just wondering whether you are offering better price than the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On these two question with regards the risk in French retail banking, we had a lower level as you saw in 2012 with 22 basis points to asset which was probably the best performance in the market. We don't expect a significant increase this year. We will see with the economic context, but this our view today.</p>
          <p>Regarding BNL and deposits, we were able to deposit &#x2013; to develop, especially in the field of enterprises, local authorities, public authorities without entering a deposit war. If I look at the individuals, you have the development of a very specific product on the Italian market called <mark type="ph" /> Conto Deposito (1:23:35) with high interest rate for the first period. We were probably amongst the most reasonable and the most cautious developing this share of our deposits. So as an average, the cost of our deposits also for individuals is lower than the market. That's why we are especially pleased with this growth of more than 12%, 4.3%, because it has been at more moderate conditions than our competitors.</p>
          <p>We saw, let me say with a smile, we saw some strange camels sometimes in the field of Italian products and deposits, but we were able to remain out of this curse.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Pierre Chedeville, CM-CIC. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I have two question. First question is related to your plan in the CIB. It's clear that the plan seems ambition  if you focus on Asia. But if you look at globally, it means that it will be an increase of the revenues of above 3%, 5% compared to this year revenues, for instance, within four years. My question is, actually when we look at the evolution of the banking industry and as we say, originate-and-distribute, blah, blah, blah, fixed income, et cetera, don't you think that we need more global CIB banks in Europe and particularly in the Eurozone than we have to date <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:25:27) we can say? And don't you think that there is an opportunity for BNP to become now one of French, of course, but European global bank in Eurozone to counterattack, some may say, the Anglo-Saxon banks, and particularly American banks that have been reinforced in the crisis? So, my question is, within 5 to 10 years or even time, don't you think that BNP could become what we call a global CIB bank? And if not, in your opinion, what prevents you from becoming that?</p>
          <p>And a more specific question on Italy, don't you think there is a kind of contradiction? Because between the rise in the cost of risk and the development that you seem to have with corporates and small and medium businesses, because from an institutional point of view, we may see that when the cost of risk and the economic situation is deteriorating, you don't &#x2013; you refrain your business with SMEs, in my view. So why don't you think of that?</p>
          <p>And with a complementary question regarding the goodwill, it seems that you have increased your denominator, but you have done, it seems, nothing on your numerator, which is quite strange when in the framework of an impairment test on Italy. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are just a commercial operation, we are not a war vessel, so we never attack anyone, just to make &#x2013; to be very clear. So just to be clear. We are a commercial operation. So being said that, we're already in a number of dimensions the first bank in the Eurozone: cash management, trade finance, syndicated loans, fixed income bonds in euros, and so on. Globals reach in the Eurozone number of domestic markets, but we are already the &#x2013; one of the two global Eurozone banks. And so it's done, basically.</p>
          <p>The point is that the business is going to be modified, just because the economy is going to be modified in the way it's going to be financed. We will have to grab a better market share in that evolution from an economy financed through bank balance sheet down to capital markets, also this is part of the game.</p>
          <p>And it's too early to say for the Eurozone, we haven't disclosed anything for BNP Paribas in the Eurozone. The plan we have disclosed is only Asia Pacific. It doesn't say that we're only going to develop the bank in Asia Pacific. The only region in which the economic scenario is clear enough today to come to a conclusion, what are we going to do over this three, four years to come, is Asia Pacific, so we have disclosed the plan, because we are ready, we are in a position to disclose the plan. For the Eurozone, economic scenario is a bit early, as for the U.S.</p>
          <p>So, this is it, but obviously, one of the main goal, the main objective for BNP Paribas being a large corporate banking operation is to be one of the two top core banks for major companies, major corporate midcaps in the Eurozone. We are already there. But the business is moving, it's being transformed by the regulation. So, basically, this is it and we believe that this is going to be one of the key element of the plan to be delivered over the coming years. But it's too early to say, just because we don't know exactly what's going to be the banking law in France or in Europe, possibly <mark type="ph" /> canon (01:29:41). So, we have to take into account that kind of a situation. So, basically, this is it.</p>
          <p>But again, we never attack anyone. This is just a different universe.</p>
          <p>But the goodwill, to be honest, I haven't got the question.</p>
          <p>And on SMEs, I can tell you that you can perfectly develop the bank on the SMEs without taking additional risk, because today you have small companies that are multinationals. The situation is very different from 10 years ago. You can now have companies that are quite small that are full &#x2013; all over the place, in 9, 10, 12, 20 countries because of new technology, because of a number of factors. So it's not because you are developing the bank in SMEs that you are taking additional risks. There are very good and decent SMEs, especially you have the ones that are going to be the midcaps of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>The best way to develop the bank is to choose the right entrepreneurs that are going to make it in the long term. So, this is &#x2013; the best corporate clients we have within BNP Paribas are corporate clients we used to have already 30 years ago, just to be honest. This is the way it is. If in France we have an excellent portfolio, this is just because the former <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:31:08) used to have excellent corporates. And now, we can see the results. Those companies that used to be very small companies are large or midcap companies.</p>
          <p>So, well, growing in the SMEs market is also a way to prepare for the future, because the best companies that most often are recent companies, are the ones that are going to be the good midcaps of tomorrow. So, it's very important. SMEs doesn't mean taking additional risk. Just to make it very, very clear.</p>
          <p>On the goodwill, I don't know, but maybe Philippe knows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the impairment test for the goodwill, we &#x2013; I mean, of course, we adjusted the business plan of BNL for the current environment and we, well, increased the cost of risk especially for the next year, because, well, the circumstances are what they are, and we always update our business plan every year for each and every impairment test. If we say that the impairment is due to the fact that we are going to be obliged to increase the local equity of BNL, it's because had we kept the 7% capitalization of BNL that used to be &#x2013; and that is still the rule as of today, the impairment test would have been passed successfully. So, this is why we insist on this question that is a pure kind of regulatory question, and that is triggering the impairment.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. I would like to start with a number request, which is to have all the tables in your press release and especially the other domestic markets, which are badly lacking for the time being.</p>
          <p>And my question would be regarding &#x2013; actually two questions regarding CIB. The first one is whether you could quantify the investments in the capital market? It's quite unusual for the bank to have a 94% cost-income ratio in Q4 or even 91% if you exclude the adaptation cost. And also if you could mention the comp ratio, this would be helpful, for the full 2012?</p>
          <p>And the second question is to check whether you are worried by the possible ring-fencing of market making activities according to the new banking reform in France according to the latest amendments? Thank you.</p>

          <p>On the first part concerning the fourth quarter, there are some seasonal effect because we have just to adjust some cost, some global cost and to adjust as you mentioned some bonus fees, but globally we will maintain the fact that we will continue to run the CIB business, not at 90-something, but at little more than 60-something. So clearly no change globally, you have just to look that year-after-year.</p>
          <p>We don't want to disclose the comp ratio, but you just have just to think that probably we have one of the lowest one, because in 2009, when I disclosed that, a lot of people, say 'okay, we will &#x2013; all the staff will leave you' at the end all the staff is still there. As you can see the cost-income ratio the one is still one of the lowest of the &#x2013; compared to a lot of our competitors. So globally, you can think that we are serious concerning the compensation of the staff, serious for the shareholder, serious for the staff, because at the end I think it's a good compromise.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very quickly. So just in case, just to be sure. All the figures as we basically have them in the segment, they can be found in the spreadsheet, which is on the site where you find all the elements including the other domestic markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We try to find a balance between simplification and transparency but as domestic markets now are rarely run as one entity, I mean, we give less detail in that one. On the site, you have all the detail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final point was about the French banking law, well this law is still in preparation. Most probably what we can say is that only pure speculative businesses, prop trading businesses, are going to be ring-fenced. So it's a very marginal part of the total business model of the Group. So from that point of view we do not expect anything new basically.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Flora Benhakoun, Deutsche Bank. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three questions on my side, please. The first question is simply whether you could maybe give us some guidance for 2013 on how you see the loan loss provisions developing by business or by region?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the LTRO repayment. So, you don't communicate how much you have repaid, but could you maybe give us some guidance on how the repayment of the LTRO is going to impact the revenue run rate in the corporate center for the year 2013?</p>
          <p>And the last question is just coming back again on the solvency and the potential for acquisitions, you've talked about your dividend policy and you have mentioned, I think twice on this call, that you want to invest your excess of capital organically. So, am I right by saying that today, you formally rule out that you will do any acquisition over the next two years, for example? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Formally, maybe, it's too tough, but this is not part of the game. It's not part of our strategic, I would say, thinking. We are building an organic plan for the two, three years to come and we believe the best way for us, looking at the current situation, is to build up these businesses, to grow our own balance sheet, our own client franchise, and this is it. So, for external acquisition, this is the only thing we can say; we consider it's not part of our strategic thinking for the company for the two, three years to come.</p>
          <p>Second, about LTRO, we cannot comment, since we didn't disclose the figures initially. Basically, we kept the LTRO for the Italian operation to make it clear. So essentially, we maintained the LTRO in Italy. And third, well, it will ease the P&amp;L this year because it was not part of our budget process, so it's some kind of a plus. It's difficult to give a more detailed figure, but you can make assumption on your own, at your own cost. Then, there is a final figure that..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe as a complement, I think, for the question. Indeed, we do not give the LTRO. If I will give you the LTRO impact on the corporate center, you would of course calculate what the outstandings are. But nevertheless, the LTRO is not the only thing which is weighing on the corporate center. I mean as you've seen, we have a &#x20AC;69 billion excess in deposits, which are basically attracted long and are basically not reemployed at this stage because of the uncertainty in the regulation. And so this will continue to weigh on the corporate center. And so, at corporate center, had an impact of the <mark type="ph" /> PMB around (1:39:37) &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;225 million is what you probably can expect for at least the year to come, a-quarter, that is.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>About provisioning in 2013, basically in the U.S. we should see something, I would say &#x2013; so you have here for BancWest on page 11, so we are not expecting anything in the U.S. The economic situation is improving, so in the U.S. we should get a positive effect in terms of loan provisioning. Personal finance, we believe that we have reached some kind of a stable level so we do not expect that cost of risk will go down or should go down. Europe-Mediterranean there is no reasons to believe that this will be impacted by the current economic scenarios. Looking at domestic markets, well, the economic scenario for the Eurozone is not that brilliant so you can expect that cost of risk should slightly increase. And for CIB, financing businesses from CIB, progressively we entered in a more normal situation and we believe that for next year compared to the 36 basis points we have &#x2013; we got last year, we should see some kind of a moderate increase. So, basically, this is the situation we are looking at, we are contemplating for 2013.</p>

          <p>The next question is from S&#xE9;bastien Lemaire, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I just had two questions, please. The first, could you disclose the coverage ratio of non-performing loans at BNL? That will be my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one is what were the impacts of the increase in the ceiling of Livret A? In terms of Livret A outstandings, where did these new inflows come from? Transfer from market rate saving deposits, or life insurance? And in which proportion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't disclose the coverage ratio business-by-business so it closes the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And for the second question, Livret A, we have two effects regarding the evolution of the regulation and conditions Livret A in recent months. The first one you mentioned is an increase of ceiling in two steps:, one last fall and one at the beginning of this year. So we saw some &#x2013; it's still a bit too early to judge exactly what happened &#x2013; but we saw some transfers from normal regular saving accounts to Livret A but in moderate amounts. I remind you that only 10% of our Livret A are at the ceiling so it plays a role only for 10% of our account. And we have a market share for Livret A which is amongst the smallest in French banks.</p>
          <p>This is the first effect. The second effect is more favorable that we had a sharp decrease of the interest rate of Livret A by 50 basis points at the beginning of February, and this plays a role not only on Livret A but on the interest rates of all saving accounts which should help our interest income for French retail banking this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were in the end a very marginal actor in the Livret A business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no more questions.</p>
