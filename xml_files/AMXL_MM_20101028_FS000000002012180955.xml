        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. This is Andre Baggio, the JPMorgan Telecom and Media Analyst for Latin America. Today we are hosting America Movil's third quarter 2010 conference call. With us today we have America Movil's CEO, Mr. Daniel Hajj; America Movil Wireline Business Director, Oscar von Hosky; America Movil's CFO, Carlos Jose Garcia Moreno and America Movil IR Manager Daniela Lecuona. With that introduction, I will ask Daniel to begin his presentation, which will be followed by Q&amp;A. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andre. Good morning, everyone. Today we will be presenting you the results of America Movil for the third quarter of 2010. As you know, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the shares of Carso Global Telecom in June, which gave us the control of both Telmex and Telmex International.</p>
          <p>We are consolidating both companies in America Movil beginning July 1. The results are all presented under International Financial Reporting Standards. The new America Movil and integrated company is practically in all the countries where we operate, is growing well as expected, with broadband services, wireless and wireline, leading the way as regards revenues and access to funding very much across the board.</p>
          <p>Our integrated company is financially strong with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.8 times at the end of September and a free cash flow of 83 billion pesos in the nine months to September, even after capital expenditures that topped 50 billion pesos year-to-date. We are investing heavily and will continue to do so in the development of our new generation broadband networks both in the fixed and the mobile platforms.</p>
          <p>We will continue to expand our coverage and do our best to help drive higher broadband penetration levels in the region. In the first quarter in which we have been running all the new fixed line operation, we have focused on the integration of our mobile and fixed line networks, as well as the IT and putting together our commercial offerings. We have defined the new functional relationships and responsibilities among our employee and have established a roadmap that will lead us to the full integrations of the operations.</p>
          <p>I will now cede the floor to Carlos Jose Garcia Moreno, who will give you more details regarding our third quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. I would first like to thank JPMorgan for hosting this conference call. As Daniel pointed out, America Movil is firing on all cylinders with accesses expanding 11.5% year-on-year to 267 million practically at the same pace on both the mobile and the fixed line platform, with wireless subscribers reaching 217 million and fixed line accesses 50 million.</p>
          <p>Net subscriber additions were substantially higher at 37.6% in the third quarter compared to the year earlier quarter, resulting in 5.5 million new subscribers. Nearly a fourth of the net additions were postpaid subscriber.</p>
          <p>On the fixed line front we added 2.1 million accesses, mostly in broadband and pay TV. All together, accesses were up 7.6 million in the quarter. Consolidated third quarter revenues were up on a pro forma basis 5.3% from a year before which was 153.6 billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Wireless service revenues at 83.5 billion pesos represented approximately 60% of our service revenue. Except for fixed line voice, revenues were up in all business lines. The median rate of growth was 8.3% in wireless voice plus 7.8% in wireline data, 36.4% in wireless data and 46% in pay TV service. The share of data in wireless service revenue reached 22%. And in the fixed line space, broadband and pay TV services continue to exhibit a strong momentum.</p>
          <p>We generated 53 billion pesos in EBITDA in the quarter, 6% more than a year before. EBITDA margin, 41.1%, was slightly higher than it was <mark type="inaudible" /> on a pro forma basis.</p>
          <p>Operating profits were up 3.9% year-on-year to 41.1 billion pesos. As part of the expansion in EBITDA was offset by higher depreciation charge, they were up 10.3%. We are in the process of revising the depreciation schedule for various technical equipment to reflect the rates of technological obsolescence and the corresponding impact on the market value.</p>
          <p>Our financial cost reflect the net interest payments on our debt of 3.7 billion pesos as well as foreign exchange losses of 128 million on our underlying net debt provision and 3.7 billion of <mark type="inaudible" /> financial expense. The latter figure includes the changes in the market value for currency and interest rate <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as ongoing non-interest expenses such as information space <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>We are running a mostly balanced positions with most proficiency in European and Chilean pesos and have some <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>On the income tax side, we gave rise to a 4.1 billion peso tax credit corresponding to the booking of <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil associated with the tax losses we had in that country. We have been through a disaster, reflecting the likelihood that we will be able to compensate the tax losses against future taxable income.</p>
          <p>At 23.4 billion pesos, our third quarter net profits were 8.8% higher than those of a year before. They were equivalent to 58 pesos per share; that is 3.7% higher than a year before in pesos terms and 7.4% in dollar terms. Our consolidated net debt, pro forma, has come down by 33.3 billion pesos this year to 184.2 billion pesos, even after allowing for 22.3 billion pesos in distribution to shareholders and for a 29% billion pesos cash investment in Telmex Internacional stock.</p>
          <p>The capital expenditures in plant, equipment and spectrum totaled 50 billion pesos for the nine months to September. We have been <mark type="inaudible" /> early and will continue do to so through the end of this year. Most of our debt obligations with original maturity through 2013. We expect to close 2010 with a 9.4-year average life of debt.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to turn it to back to Andre so that we begin the question and answer session. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As we line up I will start with two questions. The first one, with regard the impressive growth of America Movil in the U.S., is it possible that the strong growth can go on for a while? And what do the net operators think about this success of America Movil? Do they feel threatened somehow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think TracFone is doing excellent. With the product Straight Talk we are growing very fast, higher revenues, good ARPUs. I think still these type of products are in low penetration in U.S. so I think we can still grow very good for some time. I don't think big operators feel threatened about TracFone because we are a reseller, we buy the minutes and it's part our their network. So I think they were happy that with some of them we run the prepaid businesses with TracFone. So I don't think they feel so threatened against TracFone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a second point, what is the impact of the 3G auction so far in Mexico? Do you see now that you have more spectrum to it so that you can offer more data products or better data products? And is there any impact so far of Telefonica into your strategy now that the city has more spectrum itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think more spectrum means I think it's very important. Because more spectrum means you have more capacity to do more products, more voice, but much more data products. I'm happy that everybody gets spectrum. I think my competitors are investing to do that the services more that the services to receive services. And we have the capacity to use that spectrum to do more and more speed and capacity. So I think spectrum should be auctioned in all Latin America in all the world so we can have more and better data services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I guess now we can go to the Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll now move to our first question from Tom&#xE1;s Lajous, UBS. Your line is open, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, Carlos, thank you. Thank you very much for the call. I guess my question is on the debt and capital structure. You have pointed out in the comments and in the press release that you will be taking out the maturities through 2013. I assume that this would be rolled over rather than just paid out. If you can confirm that that would be great. And does this mean on the one hand that you are wiping out the debt at Telmex and Carso Global Telecom? And on the other, given that you know debt is actually going to be reduced at the subsidiary, Telmex, why does it make sense to keep Telmex listed rather than folding it into AMX like has been done with the other subsidiaries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The cash position of the company, consolidated cash position is high. As you know we did a number of financings in the second quarter in particular, but <mark type="inaudible" /> very good terms for longer date of financing. That's why we intended to utilize all of those proceeds to take out some of the shorter fits. That is we pay up so we rather than wait until the last minute to refinance our year-end obligation that we refinanced a little bit in the past. And we have taken ten year and sometimes even longer dated money in very attractive terms. So the answer, quick answer is, yes, we will be paying down the debt with the existing profit and we have to pay cash and as you we are looking basically from the point of view of our consolidated position.</p>
          <p>Now on the other hand, I didn't get your last question, Tom&#xE1;s.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Whether that &#x2013; once you restructure the debt, why it makes sense to keep Telmex separately listed and leaking cash flow and dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean this is not something that we have even begun to discuss. I think there hasn't been any change or any discussion so far. Regarding dividend policies, I noted such things. So but as you now from a point of view of rate engagement fees and the debt markets all of these are now seen as a consolidated entity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Carlos. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Next question from Michel Morin with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning everyone. I just wanted to focus on Brazil, a few issues there. First there was a big discrepancy or big difference between your service revenue growth and your total revenue in that country, specifically on the mobile side. I was wondering if you could kind of explain kind of what has happened. Are equipment sales really down that significantly? And also you've had more success in the mobile space there with net additions and even postpaid net additions in recent months and certainly in the quarter, so I was wondering kind of what has changed. And it also seems like you were able to do that without having any impact on margins, so your mobile margin, I don't know if can give us a little bit of color as to where that was. And then I think also on Embratel, it seems that you've done very well margin front, but the growth rate there has slowed. So I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of a sense of what you think the outlook might me for the top line on the fixed line side in Brazil. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The structure of revenues, equipment revenue did come down year-on-year. That partly reflects the appreciation of the currency compared to what it was a year ago. And it partly reflects reductions in the <mark type="inaudible" /> concepts. So you factor everything together you see that net revenues in particular on the mobile side were growing 4.5%, basically driven by data revenues that were up 25%.</p>
          <p>And also what you say is true. I think the last months we have been growing faster. This quarter I think we grew market share and we changed some things in the company. We do some adjustments in the wireless side. And we think that Brazil has a very good economic situation; still penetrations are low. So we want to grow subscribers and revenues in Brazil. So that's mainly what we're doing. Oscar can explain also a little bit what's happening on Embratel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know in Embratel when we started long distance was 70% of the revenues. It's a market that is not growing; I mean it's even decreasing a little bit, 2% due to different factors, mobile institutions. But we are roaming pretty well in local telephony and data, in enterprise data and as well in pay TV with our product there in Brazil. So we were up growing at a pace of 9% and now we are at 6%. But we do believe that with local enterprise markets and the pay TV market we will increase our growth for the next month.</p>
          <p>I can tell you that we're very happy the way we're integrating the companies in Brazil. I think with the Embratel, Los Claro, the net services, the synergies that's we could do with net services, I think we are a very complete telecom player in Brazil and that is going to give us a good advantage in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on that topic Daniel how much have you accomplished already in terms of extracting synergies in that country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I think we're extracting synergies in the networks. The networks is very important what is coming. Okay? It's not what we have to date, but it's coming, because we are doing one network. We are saving a lot of traffic. We are expanding a lot of rings, local rings, long distance rings. So you could do a lot more with the same amount of money if you do things together. So that's mainly what we're doing, we're doing commercially, we're also integrating some plans, some things, and also in the &#x2013; in the fund &#x2013; financially it is also helping us. I'm very happy the way we're integrating. I think there's still a long run to finish that integration, but the first step, we're doing good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the network, we expanded the reach of the network. We are going to a single network, all IP, with a next generation network that will help us to handle all the data traffic for different accesses. It could be wireline, it could be wireless, but just to give a sense, we used to have 150 pops, data pops, and we are expanding to 3400 pops. That will increase our reach in mobile and that is very good in wireline and into also another segment of the market, not only enterprise, but we are going to be focused as well on the medium size enterprise. We did reach and we didn't <mark type="inaudible" />. Another thing is that this will allow us to reduce our third party leases and we will have a huge cost. We paid this line so with this expansion we have the opportunity to reduce this cost and will help us to increase profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Next question from Andy Campbell, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, good morning. My question is on mobile data growth. You still saw a very nice growth rate of 27% year-on-year but this was a bit of a slowdown to the rate you had in the second quarter. And I was wondering if you believe that you're approaching some level of market saturation, if there's a smaller market opportunity perhaps, or if there was anything in particular in the third quarter, perhaps some change in the promotional plans or less competition or greater competition that led to the slowdown in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Andy. As I pointed out in the summary at the beginning the median rate of growth of data revenues was 86%. Okay, so part of what you have when you look at the consolidated revenue, 27% increase, partly shows the appreciation of the peso vis-a-vis other currencies. If you look at the pace at which data <mark type="inaudible" /> are expanding locally the average has been 36%. And that is not significantly different from what we had before.</p>
          <p>I think that we are likely going to continue to see very strong growth in this segment of the market. Again remember that today most data is being consumed by a relatively smaller proportion of our subscriber base. This proportion will be increasing as more postpaids move over to 3G devices and smartphones. And eventually this will go all the way to the prepaid market. So I think that there's plenty of growth at data. I think data is just beginning. You could see much cheaper and better handsets and that will allow us that a big part of our base will jump to these type of handsets and then would start using data. So there's very small amount of our customers using data and I think it could grow really strong in the next quarters, years. Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys; congratulations on the results. I just wanted to get an update on your views on the mobile termination rate cuts likely in both Brazil and Mexico over the coming 12 months, whether anything has changed there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Brazil I think what is happening there, I think they are talking about the 10% reductions in two years, something like that, where we haven't had some thing clear but it's what everybody is talking there. And here in Mexico I think we are talking to the fixed lines and to other wireless operators too to decide what's going to be the interconnection rate. If we don't agree on that interconnection rate then the authority, Copitel, will come and put some rates, but at this time we are just having talks with all the other telecom companies. And the decision, maybe what you are reading in the press is something that it's only from Axtel and Telefonica; it's not something that is on Telcel. Okay. So that's the addition on the interconnection between Axtel and Telefonica.</p>
          <p>Let's see how does these talks are going to end. I am not sure what is going to happen. I am not sure if we can decide between us what would be the interconnection and if we don't decide between the companies then the regulator would come and decide what would be the rate. But one thing that is very important, I think the traffic between Telcel to Telcel has been growing very, very fast. So the amount of money in the interconnection rate has been coming down a lot since the last three or four years. So that's something that of course is a big amount of money, but I think that's something that has been reduced a lot from the last years, okay?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I don't know. But the interconnection contracts finish on end of December. So if we don't finish from here to December we are going to end with no contract. I don't know exactly; I have to check with my legal people what's going to happen if we don't have a contract but it's finished on December, okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Daniel and Carlos, thanks for taking my question. Judging from the added revenue growth and relatively flat in many regions it appears that voice carriers have continued to decline. And my question is if you expect this status to ever stabilize. And secondly you've stated that the main synergies as a result of recent transaction with Carso Telecom is in CapEx I wanted to see if you give me your expectation on a run rate CapEx of the combined companies. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>I think still voice in mobile is still growing in some countries more than in the other ones, but I think prices are going down, prices have been going down very fast. Even with that MOS had being growing; you could see that in almost all the countries, MOS has been up. So it's what you are going to see in the future is prices going down, MOS going up. Let's say our &#x2013; the prices in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru and the Caribbean, the prices kept being stable, in other countries has being down, but what you are going to see is that more competition, prices down, more minutes of use, but I don't think that the revenues in voice are going to be down; I think they're going to be more or less stable.</p>

          <p>In fact if you look at the aggregate to America Movil. The most views in the aggregate which is for the full company went up nearly 18%, but our prices per minutes came down practically the same amount. Okay. So that's going to be the same thing down the road. Let's say you are going to keep on expanding MOUs, which is about what we are paying. I think the traffic still is going to continue to grow significantly and it's going to be driven by continued price declines.</p>

          <p>But you could see that there is no reduction on revenues in mobile voice. Still we're growing because we have good growth in customers. I can tell you that the median in voice mobile and revenues is 8.3%, the median.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, good morning. I just wanted to have a quick recap really on the balance sheet. You've got &#x2013; there's been mentioned already $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I think you know even after Telmex minority dividends you can generate north of $9 billion of cash annually. I know you mentioned early debt redemptions, but I just wonder if you could update on your views on shareholder returns, your preference for dividends versus buybacks and what is sort of realistic level of leverage for the large businesses going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again we've always tried to return to our shareholders all that we can return on the even our &#x2013; without limitations &#x2013; we may not receive an earnest share of the profits that we have already paid taxes on in Mexico. Okay. So that's kind of the limitation that we have. Long-term if you look at the last three years in each one of those three year America Movil returned in excess of 50 billion pesos, which was basically the full amount that we had available. I think at present, we will continue to follow this. We have always had a mix of buybacks and dividends and sometimes extraordinary dividends that is very much determined by things like the price of the shares in the market. Sometimes we tend to accelerate distribution by way of buybacks, sometimes we cover sort of more extraordinary dividends.</p>
          <p>So I'd say that we haven't really had any change in provisions here, we have been growing our ordinary dividends alongside net income for some time. And we will continue to do so. Certainly the balance sheets have not been constraint as you rightly point out. We used to want to have a target leverage ratio of not more than one times net debt to EBITDA; we're now at 0.8. So the balance sheet is not a limitation. It's really on the side of what is what we may be starting to even profits that we are generating and paying taxes on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is regarding the CapEx. CapEx for the quarter and for so far this first three quarters has been running a little ahead of our forecast, so I'm just wondering if you could give us some guidance as to what the consolidated CapEx would be for this year. And second question is related to Embratel. Your revenues have slowed down but margins have increased. And should this be the &#x2013; I mean should we expect this kind of trend to continue? I mean is this a conscious decision to grow the business a little less and improve margins?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no it's a &#x2013; Embratel, as I mentioned, we've been investing for the growth in local and as well as in Embratel. We're probably always has the enterprise market but we have the opportunity to work in cost reductions and I think that we mentioned in the past that we pay a lot of lease lines to connect the enterprise market. So the expansion of the network that we've been having with Claro and we make analysis that if it's profitable it is better to be in them to lease, so we've been working on that cause, we will still working on trying to reduce the cost within Embratel.</p>
          <p>And on the CapEx I think our idea is to as data is growing very fast and we think we have a good opportunity on doing more household, pass more households to do more DTH, to do more covered apps and wireless and a lot more data in wireless and in broadband, I think we want to invest. I think the investment for this year is mainly around $6 billion is what we think all the total the three companies combined, maybe next year the same, and I think that will give us very strong capacity and capability to grow our business in the next year. I think there's still a lot of room on the broadband penetration, a lot of room on pay TV, a lot of room on wireless data services. So we want to be prepared to do all those services. That's our business and we want to be well prepared to do that; we want the best technologies and to be all around in all the countries.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Question about Telmex and Telcel. Telmex obviously continues to struggle, falling revenues and margins, and just given the antitrust restrictions on operational integration of Telmex and Telcel, which would prevent synergies, what's the opportunity for these assets? Can we expect that relationship to develop into something more than just pure financial consolidation that it is today? I appreciate Telmex generates good cash but on the flip side it's obviously a major drag on your growth. So any sort on that would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

          <p>I think we're doing a little bit more than, not a little bit, we are doing more than what we are doing. We have to be careful because there is a still -Telmex has a lot of minority investors, so we have to do the things in &#x2013; strength in as the market conditions. But even as market conditions we are doing investments together and we are doing a lot of things together so I don't think we are only doing financial integrations, we are doing also networks integrations. Of course different here than in other countries because we have to have the market prices and those things, but even with that it's very good for us to do that now.</p>

          <p>Hi, yes, good morning. I had a question regarding the businesses that used to make up the old Telmex Internacional. For the nine months you reported 11% revenue growth in those businesses, down from 15% first half. That would seem to imply a very sharp slowdown in the third quarter. You've shown that Embratel slowed slightly. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what happened in the other businesses excluding Embratel. Has that been a sharp slowdown there? Are there any one-off effects in the third quarter? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As you look at this integration, could you give us an idea over the next year of the cost of putting the two companies together? And then as you look at the combination over two years, could you give us an idea of lower capital expenditures that you might have over two years because you have the two companies together? And the savings of putting the two companies together over two years after the integration costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, one thing that I am sure we're going to do is we're not going to reduce the CapEx. I think with the same CapEx we're going to do lots more things than we used to do if we were alone. So we are not planning on reducing CapEx, what we are planning is with the same CapEx or a little bit more if we need it, we're going to do lots more thing in all the countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the question relative to the issue of synergies and like we have explained in some of the previous calls. Basically we do not see that there's much overlap on the operating expenses side or then as regards links and the rental of <mark type="inaudible" />. And there I think that we will be making important progress certainly into next year and we will be able to eliminate some of these links that will have to pay rent on today. And as regards capital expenditures, which we think is where we are going to have the more important synergy, as Daniel points out all things equal we've not been able to reduce capital expenditures by taking the two companies together as opposed to having them independent. But we do not intend to reduce the total level of CapEx. Because we think that we need to invest more in development of the network. So basically what you would say it's not an issue of two years. I think it's an issue of getting more done faster over a long period of time. That's where the new uses of the capital are going to be.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. I just want to come back to Michel's question on the integration of the three companies. I want to understand, I know it's hard to see how much of the integration has already been completed although I understand that it's just the beginning. But I wanted to know from Daniel or Carlos or Oscar whether there have been any additional &#x2013; any non-recurring cost associated with the integration of all the countries during this quarter. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think we have any non-recurring cost that we have been saving. The two companies have been working on a very efficient way, so we don't have anything. I think the important savings are going to be as we said on networks, on IT and selling more because our commercial operating, that's mainly where we see the big &#x2013; the boosting from the integration. I think the integration is starting. We have been already working as an integrated company, but all these things that I have been telling you are going to get all through the next two years. Let's say the next two years we're going to have a much better commercial offer. We're going to have a single network; we're going to have an IT solution for all the companies. So that's mainly what we're working and investing for.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have a kind of purely more of an accounting question. Looking at your Q2 2009 results that were reported on pro forma basis after Q2 2010, in other words the IAS results, and then the Q2 '09 results that were reported before the accounting change, the accounting change seems to have added about 80 to 90 basis points to EBITDA margin. Is that accurate? And if we were to think about just for reporting purposes about the Q3 numbers, had they been reported under the old accounting standards would there also been a similar magnitude there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that, representing here is now under the common standard of IFRS or the comparison that you can have. We are not doing the accounting anymore based on the old methodology; we haven't done that for two quarters already. So I don't know that I can give you that answer just yet, but I think the numbers in the report are all comparable because they are all on the IFRS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what you're saying is right because under this standard you reduce a little bit the revenues and that's why you increase the EBITDA, the margin of the EBITDA. I understand what you are saying is that our EBITDA grows 0.9 points and that's really because the revenues under this standard get reduced a little bit and that's mainly &#x2013; all of them are in the same standard, all the data that we present in the results are in the same standard.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what is happening is that you are comparing last quarter against this quarter of last year. And remember that last year we had a very bad economic situation and that's really &#x2013; but I think we can have around 1 million, I hope next quarter or fourth quarter we'll have more than 1 million net subscribers because there's Christmas and Christmas is very important. But I think the economic situation in Mexico is getting better and I will think that we could have good growth in the next quarter.</p>
          <p>We're focusing a lot on postpaid, postpaid has been growing very good. And it's also because we have the best network in Mexico. So people is preferring to be with the Telcel network than in other networks. Portability number, portability has been doing very good for us. We have been gaining a lot of customers in portability. So I think that's not only &#x2013; that means good network, good economic situation, good customer care, good branding. I think in Mexico we're doing a very good job.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the ARPUs are stable and when you have good growth of customers and your ARPUs are stable means I think there are good news there. Because all these new customers are going to start to consume in the future. So I think we're being careful on that. Even that prices in Mexico has been coming down really fast. We have let's say I don't have it last month but it's around $0.05 of a dollar, the prices that we have in Mexico, and those price are really competitive internationally, or one of the lowest prices internationally. Prices has been down maybe 10 to 15% around 10 to 15% so when you have ARPU stable in those conditions I think are good news.</p>

And we don't have the budget for the next year. I hope we could give you some numbers in our Investor Day that is going be in the 18 of November. I hope everybody would come. Let's see if we finish the budget, which numbers we can give you there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe yes, no, 120, 130, yes of course. We invest more in rural areas and get more that we can cover all the population of the countries of course. Handsets are going down, prices are going down, so there is no reason why we cannot get 100 plus companies. So it's devices like the iPads and all those devices you are going to have maybe two devices with you. So I'm sure you can get 130%; the broadband wireless is going to grow a lot in the next year.</p>

          <p>Hi, hey. Daniel you had mentioned you thought the economy was getting better in Mexico. I think that's probably an interesting statement given kind of the presence that you have with AMX and Telmex. Can you just expand on &#x2013; is that something you saw in the third quarter, is that something you see going forward? Why do you believe that is the first question. And then secondly in Mexico your postpaid is down year-over-year; it's still a decent number, I guess 300. Can you just talk about is that postpaid number a result of conversions of prepaid, is this new postpaid customers coming from your competitors? Just if you could talk about postpaid and then the last...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In postpaid is everything. In postpaid is some prepaid coming to postpaid, new customers, new devices, and of course some of the competitors, I don't know exactly which ones, but I'm sure that we have in our postpaid the new additions, we have a mix of everything. And on the economic situation the only thing that I can tell is when you get in Mexico at the third quarter of 2009 280,000 subscribers and you get this quarter more than a million subscribers, I'm sure the economy in our country is getting better. I think it's not from one month to the other one; I think through the year the economy is getting better and better. No?</p>

          <p>I think voice revenues are growing approximately 5% year-on-year, which is quite good. Data revenue is growing close to 30%, which is good. Certainly voice is very sensitive to GDP growth. We have been saying for quite some time that voice revenues tend to roll along at the pace or somewhat faster than the pace of GDP growth. So that's why we have that vantage point. And if you look at fixed lines revenue, even fixed lines revenue have been actually quite stable. The second quarter it was somewhat lower than in the third quarter. We are seeing some parts of our recovery and so we don't see &#x2013; from the vantage point that we have the economy in Mexico is improving.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, that's helpful info. Carlos, can you just also discuss whether with your cash you'd consider &#x2013; and this will be my last question &#x2013; any investments in these 2.5 or 3.5 gig or gigahertz networks, four broadband access, you've talked about with the Telmex integration. Obviously you had some wired assets there. But does it make sense to look for growth in broadband penetration by deploying networks on 2.5 or 3.5 gig spectrum? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Oscar can tell us a little bit about that. But I don't think that's the technology that's where we're going to use, Oscar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's right. I mean it is coming as well there. So we are using another spectrum to get into that. And I think &#x2013; what we are using now is wifi in the places that we could use to review the traffic on the spectrum. So I don't see that spectrum. We are working with another spectrum to reach LTV technologies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is one, I think that in the next year all the countries are going to start. I saw that all the governments in the countries where we operate really interested in developing broadband services. So I'm sure that in the next year there are going to be a lot more options on the LTV spectrum to allow us to get more data services to a lot more places. So that's I think where we're going to invest in wireless. And in the peaks we're getting households, we're doing DTH, we're doing...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're combining different technologies. Of course in Mexico we use <mark type="inaudible" /> fiber when the markets need it. But in the region we are using cable networks, flex networks, but it's a mix of HFC networks. With that we could deliver a very, very good bandwidth to the customer. So we are using now DOCSIS 2.1, but we have already the networks prepared to move to DOCSIS 3.0. With that we will have very good speeds for Internet broadband. We are in the right technology.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for taking my question. My question is on Mexico. In your results you mentioned that were some costs related to integration that impacted your margins. Can you just talk about whether that's just a one quarter thing or whether there may be more cost to come in the future quarters? The second is kind of a related question; it's on Brazil and again it's on the cost side. You saw about 17% growth in your EBITDA in Brazil and about a significant decline or about a 3% decline in cost in Brazil. Can you just talk about what those drivers were kind of due to the OpEx decline? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on Mexico we don't say that we have cost on the integrations. And if we say that we don't have any cost on the integrations of the companies. I think in Mexico if you see in wireless we're having the same &#x2013; more or less the same EBITDA as last month. And in fixed, you already have the release on the Telmex results. So you can't compare that. So we don't have any cost on the integration. And in Brazil, what we're doing is we're having &#x2013; we are saving costs, what the cost could be, a lot on SAC and the acquisition cost would be part of that. Other ones could be on the networks, other ones...third party line, leased lines. Leased lines that we used to pay and we are not paying anymore. So...</p>

          <p>Reduce the cost of termination as well, cost of access...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So those are the things that we have been doing for some time and will give us more cost reductions in the future. And I think we can get the last question please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I was wondering, we didn't really talk about Columbia and I was wondering if perhaps you could talk a little bit about what's going on there. There is a very good macro environment there. And I was a little bit, not disappointed, but it seems like perhaps I would have expected a little bit better out of Columbia. And we saw one of your competitors report good numbers there. So anything you can mention about the trends you're seeing there? And also margins were down a little bit, and I'm wondering if that's related to the Panama startup still, or if there's anything else going on there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think you are right. I think in Colombia we are doing good, I think we're growing. The economic situation is doing better and also in Colombia, government is pushing a lot the develop of telecommunication. I think this new government is trying to push a lot the develop of telecommunication. So a lot of, in the wireless side we are doing okay with EBITDA, we're growing, our revenue is 9.8% wireless revenues, fixed line revenues are growing 6.3%. So EBITDA is growing 7.2%.</p>
          <p>So numbers looks good even with the develop of the Panama that we're investing, it's money and it's costing us a little bit of money to grow the business there. Besides that I don't think there is anything in Colombia. The country is doing very good, the economic situation is excellent, the government is pushing a lot the telecommunication sector, they want us to invest. So we're in a very good mood in Colombia at this moment. And in Panama we've just launched also the DTH, we have wireless, and right now we have also the DTH satellite business there. So we started in September and we're doing good.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And if I may, just to clarify also one thing that you, that Carlos, I think you said in your prepared remarks, did you say that there was a tax related adjustment on the balance sheet? I think maybe a valuation allowance that was reversed or something like that? I didn't quite get the details of that.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I said- what we have been doing, I think this is &#x2013; we did a part at the end of '08, part at the end of '09 and now we are going to be doing the last part, which is basically recognizing that we had a deferred tax asset. In Brazil, we have some tax losses that for some time were not given any credit, if you will. At the time, there were &#x2013; so <mark type="inaudible" /> referring to some years back, probably five years back when things looked more uncertain in Brazil. But now in conjunction with our <mark type="inaudible" /> we decided that these tax losses had to be recognized from an accounting standpoint and that gave us right to defer tax credit, okay. And that's basically what we were booking. As I said, this is the third installment. We did one at the end of '08, one at the end of '09, which are detailed in our report in fact and we <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
