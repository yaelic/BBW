          <p>Okay. Everybody is on time Ren&#xE9; will put off his blackberry. Welcome to all of you also for those...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, boss.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's the first time he says it to me in five years time. Also welcome to those who are following us on the webcast. Ren&#xE9; and I will take you through the usual half year figures. We're going to try to do that in half an hour in two blocks of 15 minutes and afterwards we will take the questions from the floor and from the telephone.</p>
          <p>Results were posted this morning with 12% organic net profit growth, good result in those challenging to say the least economic times. Now three building blocks which explain these results, the one is definitely our choice to go for value over volume. What I mean by that is all the actions that we have undertake in all the markets where we operate to maintain our margins. That means taking price, but also to continue to support our brands, the Heineken brand in the first place but also the big blockbuster brands that we operate locally in one and each and single every market.</p>
          <p>This is the line of growing top line, a particular mention also to Africa and the Middle East, which has still been in a strong volume growth mode with 15% and also quite a good growth in some parts of Asia contributing to that top line growth. Now second building block has been concentrating on the execution on our TCM plan, TCM has delivered in the first half 50 million, on an annual base that is 120 million, if we would have started all it on the 1 of January. So that concerns all the company and I will leave to Ren&#xE9; to give more flavored detail on how our TCM program has been going, definitely also contributing to our margins in our growth so far.</p>
          <p>And the third block is that we have announced that we would have a very tight control on our cash flows. It's our intention to reduce our net debt from 3.5 EBITDA ratio which at the moment of the acquisition of S&amp;N we reached up the height of the acquisition. We have been able through the margin improvement progress but also the hunt for cash looking at our working capital together with an improved organic performance of the business. We have been able to reach an improvement of &#x20AC;500 million cash flow on a like-for-like basis. Hence, contributing to the reduction of our net debt from 3.3 at the beginning of the year to now end of June 3.1 times EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The last point of importance we have said that we would have a particular attention to our new acquisitions. We have been acquiring 11 new companies last year. And they all are on the integration path. They all have to deliver synergy programs both in revenues and in cost. And I'd like to announce there that we are on track in unlocking these synergies and improving our performance in all these acquisitions that we have made and I will have a particular dive in into the U.K. situation, of course since it's the most important one.</p>
          <p>That all said, we have given also the guidance for the full year of being able to post an organic net profit growth of at least in the high single-digits. That's in a nutshell our results, leading to these numbers here, I concentrate on the right part of the chart, you see that the 6.6 volume decrease led to the whole margin improvement program pricing, value of a volume led to a decline -- a slight decline of 0.54% of our revenues and our focus on cost led then to a EBITDA growth of 13%. And on the organic like-for-like, we had posted -- we have posted a 12% net profit increase organically.</p>
          <p>Now obviously Ren&#xE9; will take care of the middle column, but out of the numbers it is clear that still our new acquisitions are not contributing enough for their own financing costs at this moment in time, let be clear on that point but we are absolutely making progress.</p>
          <p>I will now take you to the usual short little tour across our businesses. It's always difficult to explain in such a short-term everything which is happening in Heineken, one has to realize that we have 67 different operating companies around the world. Not one single one is contributing more than 10% of our total EBIT, so we have a large spread. That's an advantage, but it's also disadvantage when we try to explain what's going on because it's really reaches the world.</p>
          <p>We operate also 25 partnerships and the Heineken brand is sold in 172 countries in the world. So it's a fairly complex business to read so allow me just to concentrate on the big building blocks in the regions and the most important operating companies that we operate.</p>
          <p>Now starting with Western Europe, the picture is strong organic profit growth. There also we have to do with volume declines nearing 7%. And in our existing business we have been able overall to post a good performance. The two elements of it are the value of a volume strategy, so pricing has been important in that and on the other side TCM has been forcefully started in Europe, in the continuation and in the line of what we have done previously with Fit to Fight.</p>
          <p>If we look at the key markets now Spain, which has been the hardest hit country in terms of economic downturn. Counterintuitively, the decline of the beer market has only been limited to 2.5%, which is quite counterintuitive, but the Spanish market has been able to withheld itself quite good.</p>
          <p>There also -- value over volume strategy has led us to accept some market share decline, but also all actions taken in TCM, the overflow of the previously taken action has led to a significant margin improvement and result in Spain. And the last action on the TCM in Spain has been the announcement of a closure, which is now effective, of the Arano brewery in the Northern part of Spain in the first half year.</p>
          <p>I will come back on the U.K., but just in a nutshell, we are turning the corner and the plans are well on their way to create value in the U.K. I will dedicate the specific chart to that. France is a good story, we grew in value, and both our market share in value and volume, so we posted really good results. The Heineken brand grew again in absolute terms in a declining market, but also the Telford brand which we -- which is an upper mainstream brand which we put some effort for now on number of years, have posted some good results.</p>
          <p>So we're very happy about the performance in France and that goes together with a relentless effort of the French organization to address it at cost base and there are more things to come in the second half for France with the announced closing of the Fischer brewery and an ongoing program to all the time restructure and our distribution platform France Boissons in France.</p>
          <p>The Netherlands, we had to cope with substantial price increase beginning of the year. We still cope a bit with the smoking ban was introduced last year. The crisis and the fall in the demand of beer hit Holland only in the first quarter of 2009. So it's &#x2013; the whole decline of the beer market was like a tsunami. It hit probably first the U.K. and Ireland and then it went on to Spain and Italy and then France and countries like Switzerland or the Netherlands were later in noticing and taking stock of that decline. So we had to cope this first quarter in Holland with a volume decline.</p>
          <p>Our brands are doing well, in the Netherlands it is so that we have a higher competition from the private labels on ones handed the off-trade and in the on-trade as we have a higher market share than our average and the on-trade being more affected automatically and mechanically our market share is going the slightly down and this year we also have the underlying profits are going slightly down in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Same story for Italy. We had a very tough first quarter. We have hold-up the value of our volume strategy, so that has led to quite some significant de-listings in that with some key customers in Italy. It took some time to cure that and to repair but we have been able to save the value if you will and we are now in the process of restoring our market share. But on a yearly basis, it might be clear that we have left some market on the table. EBIT is slightly lower, but I think we did a right thing for the future of Heineken in Italy.</p>
          <p>Let me now switch to the U.K., I call the chart turning the corner. When we took over it was at a worse moment. Remember the crisis hit, we just got the keys and the British government increased twice the excise duty in that year. A change of ownership of such a big company is always a big thing and it was a company's got a new customer but we have to cut into two pieces, one for Carlsberg, one for ourselves.</p>
          <p>So it's a huge reorganization. It's an important operation also for the people working in that and that together with the crisis which unfortunately started very heavy in this country.</p>
          <p>And now we have to look at S&amp;N as the market leader. He is the leader of the market here and what we are doing now is transforming this company from a leading company and very trade oriented company to a trade and brands oriented company. So that is what we would like to do with S&amp;N U.K., it's to introduce more effort behind the brands. And that's what we have been doing since we've taken over and in the first half year, the good news is that those effects are already to be seen. We have gained a 1.1% market share in the beer market which is declining that we've gained 1.1% share in the British market which is good news. And in the still growing side of market, we have been also able to increase our share by close to a full percent market share in the U.K.</p>
          <p>So, those are really good news items. So, essentially Fosters, Strongbow and Bulmers were made nice progress. We also concentrated again value over volume to enhancing our margins. It is that in the U.K. for quite a while in the previous years, I would say that margin restoration was not top on the agenda in the light of fast increase in input prices. Now, we have taken the lead in to that. It has been, it's not an easy process of course and certainly it's again counterintuitive to do that when you have a -- have a downturn in the your sales, but we haven't put lot of energy in improving our operating margins and we have seen the most of the industry players in the U.K. have been following that movement and installing better margins here.</p>
          <p>This is all contributing to the top line here in the U.K. And on the cost line, we're on track in realizing the synergies, certainly the cost synergies, the revenue synergy will take some more time, but the cost synergies are certainly on track. With the crisis which hit harder than we originally thought. You can imagine that there will be more synergies, but we are on track to close the Berkshire Brewery somewhere next year. So the brewery is now winding down.</p>
          <p>One has to realize and this is not new news, but we -- the head count of S&amp;N U.K. will diminish by 750 people. How -- and happy situation that is, but that is we have to adapt to the new market circumstances and stay a lean and mean organization.</p>
          <p>We have taken on Board a full review of the SKUs, cutting down on the non-profitable SKUs in Scottish &amp; Newcastle. We are addressing profitability issues Waverley TBS that's the largest U.K. distributor.</p>
          <p>The platform is too big for the shrinking volumes, so that has to be cope with. We have been addressing the globe issues, as you have been following through the press. So there are number of things and the U.K. team is absolutely on the deck to make work out of it. And let's say and take the cost base to a more lean and mean level whilst continuing investing new brands to enhance market share. That's what we do in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to Central and Eastern Europe. There the story is that efforts on pricing and again TCM were mitigating lower volume and ForEx. Now the first thing is, first observation volumes were hit harder in Central Eastern Europe. And they will -- were hit harder in the second quarter than in the first quarter, you see, it's a kind of delay. But practically all countries have been hit so the volume impact has been bigger. And then one has to realize that when in Western Europe, you got lack and market which is going down by a percent per year in the U.K. then you suddenly accelerate to 7% that's already quite a big thing. But when you take a markets in Central Europe which goes from plus six, 7% to suddenly minus eight. That's like a big change that you have to cope with. Now our organizations are lean mean and extremely reactive. So we have been able to compensate with TCM programs and pricing for that loss of volume in a very quick way. But what we are hurt with is the foreign exchange losses, both on translation and transaction, which hurt quite a bit in countries like Poland with Polish zloty where we have a big operation or in Romania with the Romanian leu or the ruble that has impacted our business quite a bit. We report in euro but we operate in Polish zloty. So there is something that bottom line in euro, we have to leave money on the table for that.</p>
          <p>Looking at the main countries, Austria very quickly, they could increase their profitability despite lower sales, but we see that the market is recovering already in quarter two. In Russia, we had a real, substantial profit increase also due to a change of strategy. We have a strategy which was more tuned to volume than value. We have turned that around, because when the market is increasing by seven to 10% a year, you can afford yourself to build market share to have such a strategy. When a market suddenly turns the other way around it becomes unsustainable.</p>
          <p>The market in Russia is overcrowded. We are a very strong leader. So, we have taken a another approach, yielding its first results and that together with again strong TCM, very strong TCM program in Russia to reduce our cost base to the new realties and was significant lower sales, I have to admit we posted much better results than last year.</p>
          <p>Poland, underling the business is performing well and Polish zloty will gain market share, however there is the country where devaluation of the Polish zloty hurt us as the most such the impacts in our Europe profits quite significantly.</p>
          <p>And then final Greece, Greece is also fully hit by the economic crisis and also plagued by social unrest and we have to say that in Greece we have been seen volume and profits going down a bit this year.</p>
          <p>Still not affecting our competitive position we have superb competitive position in Greece and the Heineken then even gained a bit market share that was to our own expense with Amstel, but there always better margin. So that's always in our internal competition good news.</p>
          <p>Let me go to Africa and the Middle East, star performance -- performer once again it's already for several periods that we have seen Africa booming. This time no exception plus 15 in terms of the volumes and the profits even more to -- there was one underlying trend which is not going away with the recession. That is the fact that overall better governance in Africa has led to a stronger economic development creation of the middle class. That underlying trend did not change and that was by and large what explains for several years now that these markets are on a growth spurt.</p>
          <p>We have strong brands, strong positions at a two one of -- we made progress in all countries in Africa during the first half year. So it's really a sterling performance. I take the two big markets out here, that's Nigeria was volumes up 9% and EBITDA plus 25% with all key brands growing, Heineken growing 44%. Nigerian breweries expanding in capacity, so it's a strong operation.</p>
          <p>And on the other hand we have South Africa, where Amstel and Heineken have been able to post growth in a slightly the Korean market was still in a double-digit growth mode with our brands. So that's a good sign to building up the brewery in Sedibeng, near Gauteng, Johannesburg is well on track, would be operational on the first &#x2013; last quarter of this year. And when we will take over the import volumes we will immediately turn what is now a little bit subsidize position because the imports come at very high price seeing that we sell for a returnable bottle price, something which is produce in non-returnable, we will be able to quickly turn this operation into a profit contributor.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I have to warn that Africa is not immune for the crisis, so we see also specifically on that continent that the growth will perhaps slowdown a bit in the second half on Africa beat that the growth will still be there.</p>
          <p>Then, I was &#x2013; no I don't &#x2013; I switch to the Americas. Strong EBIT growth, but a lot of work to do, particularly in the U.S. Strong EBIT growth because there again value over volume, we took price but also we did TCM programs. We've restructured a number of our business, including the U.S. in terms of structure quite a bit.</p>
          <p>So that's caters for a better financial results when we look at specifically at the USA and position of Heineken down 10% year-on-year that is availing development of course and there is a dual explanation to that. On the first hand, there is the market and the down trading. The down trading is quite heavy. And particularly, it affects our brands because it's already a very big brand in the USA. We are an establish brand. Our distribution reach is universal. You will find Heineken everywhere.</p>
          <p>Our target consumers and the ones which we're growing were the ones of the middle class and the lower middle class. Now this is the group which is particularly affected by the current crises. And this is the group, which is particularly sensitive to down trading and which we see especially in the convenience store, where we see a lot of trading done. Now that's part of the explanation, why our volumes are down.</p>
          <p>One has to realize that last year we took fashion in the U.S. So our price points are amongst the highest in the market. But I &#x2013; to the question would you reconsider that, I say nearly no, you would lower the price, you would not get any volume; you would only harm your brands. That's the situation into which we are towards down trading in the U.S. and that is for a big brand like us a quite significant development.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, and that's what to do, I have always said that we can do better where is the communication around our brand. Heineken usually has a superb organization, is a superb machine, working distributors. One has to realize that we have a portfolio of products, Dutch and Mexican with yield margins, which are twice as high as the once which they received, distributed from to domestic brands. We have superior cost customer relation management and quality relation with our customers. What we left specifically behind the Heineken brand is a little bit more traction in the Anglophone markets. That is also the reason why we have changed communication agency recently. We beefed up the marketing department last year. We have a very good communication line of Hispanic market. We can do better in the Anglo market and that's a reason why we have chosen to work with Euro RSCG in New York.</p>
          <p>Who we have a relation with already for the Dos Equis brand and it's an excellent relation and so our team down there has chosen to work with these people to add some more buzz to our brand there. As I said the Mexican portfolio gained share. Dos Equis posted again a sterling performance. When I go to South America I take the biggest one which is CCU our joint venture with Qui&#xF1;enco has been able to do a good job and the profit contribution increased slightly year-on-year. That's a good news and the Heineken brand within their portfolio did very well. It was an increase of 7% year-on-year if we add on Chile and Argentina.</p>
          <p>Now, I go down to the last region that's Asia-Pacific robust EBIT growth across the region. We operate through three platforms. First of all APB that's our oldest joint venture there, APB has been able to uphold its results despite some challenging conditions in some markets. But on specifically on Singapore and Vietnam is still seeing some good growth and overall the company has been able to maintain a very good performance and with the Tiger brand they are growing yet again.</p>
          <p>Then the second leg of our presence in Asia is a United Breweries in India, posted very good performance over the last period. They have been increasing over the first half year their market share, their volume, their profits. They are close to 50% market share. Kingfisher is a blockbuster brand in India. It's really going strong for United Breweries. So, we are very happy with our investment. And of course everybody has a question when do you start your collaboration and introducing the Heineken brand in one, have you? We are on track with our negotiations with the Dr. Malaya. It's well on track. I am very optimistic that we reach an agreement. It's a matter of time. These agreements to reach with all parties involved in India are quite complicated and along with there is lot of companies and stuff involved. But we are certainly definitely making progress and you will hear from us pretty soon where we land there.</p>
          <p>Another third leg in Asia Pacific is our direct operations that is Indonesia and New Caledonia an array of export operations and when we look with the &#x2013; perhaps with the exception of Hong Kong which was a bit under pressure, all the others have been posting excellent results in the region and contributing to the good growth.</p>
          <p>That concludes my tour le monde on our operations and I'll come back to the full year outlook. The underlying reasons why we put this outlook are put here on the slide. The recession will continue to affect the volumes. It is &#x2013; we have to be cautious on the volume outlook. It is only somewhere in October where we will see where we land and if we land and what level we land. So like to remain cautious about where we go. We continue our value of volume. We continue to invest in our brands. We continue to carry on with our TCM projects and having a first and concentration on generating a cash flow.</p>
          <p>But we will continue to have the impact instead of the little bit more in the second half of the weaker currencies, as I have depicted. Slightly perhaps the decline of the growth might be coming out of Africa and this all leads to the mid-high &#x2013; mid-single digit growth as we have been posting here for our outlook.</p>
          <p>I think I have done the tour. I have been a bit longer than I thought.</p>

          <p>As usual. Thank you Ren&#xE9; &#x2013; we started on time. So let me now show you a commercial as ever before handing over to Ren&#xE9; as a break and this time no commercials about Heineken. We are in the U.K., we show you Fosters ad as a proof of how we invest in Fosters. We have a series of ads and it's a mainstream brands, so it's not a premium thing, but you're going to see some of our or one of our new Fosters ads. So, thank you for your attention and....</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good afternoon. As usual, I will take you through the key figures. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois elaborated already on the organic change. I will on this slide look a little bit more to the new consolidations to currencies and the exceptional items.</p>
          <p>Looking at the reported net profit or the really bottom, bottom line, we grew that by 20% to 489 million and that's driven partly by the organic growth the 12% or 66 million that also influenced by 84 million book gain on the purchase of the globe notes and then part of this syndicated debt.</p>
          <p>As you know, we restructured parts of or we bought part of the debt of globe. We did that at a value below par it was at our books also note at par but we bought it far below that we made a book gain of 84 million which is reported on the other net financing costs.</p>
          <p>And looking at EBITDA that was up 7.4%, the 13% organic EBIT growth or the 117 million is partly offset by a currency effect, 30 million negative, mainly the naira and the zloty and the 36 negative contribution of the first time consolidations mostly related to the first four months of the former as for the new counsel companies.</p>
          <p>Net profit beia was 10% lower because of the finance cost related to these acquisitions. As you have seen our interest cost increased by 153 in the first half of this year. In the second half of the year, the affect of the fist time consolidations will be marginal because most of the new businesses will be more than one year in our hands and their results will be part obviously of the organic performance.</p>
          <p>Once more if we strip out first time consolidations currencies and exceptional items, the EBIT &#x2013; organic EBIT and net profit performance was very strong with 13 and 12% respectively. Looking at the revenues, revenues increased 11% to 7.1 billion, also there first time consolidations contributed obviously close to one billion or 15%. Currencies had a negative affect of over 200 million against zloty, naira, British pound and the Russian ruble.</p>
          <p>On an organic basis, revenues were 0.4% lower despite the 6.6% decrease in volumes. So, better pricing and the rationalization of lower margins SKUs improved the price mix by a 6.2% and that compensated almost for the full negative effect of the volumes. And I think it's very important to see that we're actually putting in place our value of volume strategy that the strengths of our portfolio allow us to play that game.</p>
          <p>For the second half of this year, we forecast the lower impact from price mix because especially in Central and Eastern Europe and also in the Americas the effect of the year-on-year price increases will gradually phase out.</p>
          <p>Profitability, as said EBIT beia up 7.4% to 993 million and we realized an organic growth of 117 million. That's improvement &#x2013; that organic improvement is a driven by number of elements, first of all, better prices across all regions, the Heineken brands outperforming the total portfolio, lower media rates and better efficiencies in marketing and sales which allows us to reduce marketing costs minus 6% on organic basis. And last but certainly not least, the continuous efforts on costs cutting. The cost savings had a significant leverage effect, you see in flat top-line and the strong growing a bottom-line and that is the effect of the cost savings.</p>
          <p>So, let's have a look at these cost savings, as you know very high on our agenda already for a number of years and after the completion of Fit to Fight we launched the new program TCM, Total Cost Management. It has a boarder scope as you know that Fit to Fight. We include the commercial cost, we include variable cost and in the six &#x2013; first six months we realized 50 million savings, which will be on an annualized basis 120 million.</p>
          <p>So, this clearly proves that the cost focus remains in the company. Cost cutting is something which is really engrained in the organization. Some concrete actions which we took, we reduced on the commercial sites head count in Russia. In USA we reduced further more head count in the USA we slashed SKUs. We have the restructuring in the USA bringing eight million of savings. We closed as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois indicated Arano brewery in Spain. In second half of the year we've got the Fischer brewery in France, we've got two breweries in Czech, but it is not only about brewery closures, it's also further reducing cost in the breweries, which remain operating.</p>
          <p>The regional splits pretty much in line with what also Fit to Fight that close to 50% is coming from Western Europe, a quarter is coming from Central and Eastern Europe. The Americas contributed more than they did in Fit to Fight with 15% in the first half of the year. But it is a big program, it's company wide, it's worldwide, it's all functions and the whole organization is geared up to make it work to deliver on our promises and as you can imagine given the economic circumstances you don't need much additional push to get it. Everybody knows that cost savings is of the essence in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Looking at the organic growth and the spilt of the regions, it's very good to see that all regions contributed to that despite the economic differences and challenges we have in the different regions. Africa was in absolute terms the biggest contributor contributed more than 40% clearly driven by the growth in the African region. But also Western Europe delivered an healthy organic EBIT growth, benefiting from the cost savings and the good price increases in the region.</p>
          <p>Scottish &amp; Newcastle Jean updated you on the turnaround of the U.K. On the synergies we are ahead of plan, 14 months after the acquisition we have achieved on an annualized basis 145 million of the synergies which is around 80% realized really in the P&amp;L in the first half of 2009 was 65 million.</p>
          <p>On the cost side all major initiatives have been completed like the closure of the international head office the integration of the U.K. organization, the Irish organization and the integration in USA we closed the Beamish brewery in Ireland. We have integrated IT and procurement although there are still some benefits to be gained.</p>
          <p>But also on the revenue, we're making progress as an end markets benefit from our innovation power and you see now that Sagres in Portugal, Maes in Belgium or Newcastle Brown Ale in the U.S. and Draught Keg. The Heineken brand is benefiting from the platforms as &#x2013; and is given us in the U.K., in Portugal, in Finland. We're starting to exploit stronger, successful, very successful year in the U.K., but launched now in the Netherlands early days we're doing very well, and in September we will launch Strongbow in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Next to cost, obviously cash flow high on the agenda. As you know, we relaunched the Hunt for Cash programme, therefore, we call out Hunt for Cash 2 and also there in the first six months clear results. The free operating cash flow compared or improved with 0.5 billion compared versus same period a year ago, thanks to improvements in working capital and lower capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>Main working capital as a percentage of revenue improved significantly and is now on the level of 8.7%, and that is reflected in the cash flow statement by 143 million improvements.</p>
          <p>CapEx was 345 million or 4.8% of revenues when we were normally spending something around 8%. For the full year, we keep the guidance of the 700 million, which you have to compare with the one billion &#x2013; 1.1 billion we had in previous years at the same time the company is considerably bigger.</p>
          <p>As a result of the focus on cash and cash generation, you see that net debt has decreased to 8.8 billion and the net debt EBITDA ratio has gone down from 3.3 at the end of last year to 3.1 times now. That is well below the incurrence covenants we have with the banks of 3.5 times.</p>
          <p>Next to debt, when you look at our maturity profile of the debt, it is sound and well balanced. In the last six months, we issued bonds, as well in euros as in pounds for 1.450 billion. We obtained committed financing facilities or credit facilities of over 500 million. And so we have a headroom now of over two billion, or largely enough to met future requirements, notably in the beginning of 2010 we have to repay 1.1 billion in that but with the headroom of over two billion we don't foresee any issue before March 2012.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude. Strong results in the challenging environment with EBIT organically up 13% and net profit organically up 12%. That proves the effectiveness of our value over volume strategy, and the focus we have on cost cutting in all areas of the business. We are committed to TCM, we are committed to Hunt for Cash and we have delivered on what we set we would do. We achieved 80% of the synergies out of the S&amp;N acquisition. And as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois already explained for the full year, we do expect an organic net profit growth of at least high single-digit. That is what, I wanted to share.</p>
          <p>Before we go into the Q&amp;A, you get, of course a commercial. And I think for the first time in the history of Heineken, it's not a beer commercial, but it is a cider commercial, it's a Strongbow commercial showing our commitments to develop that category. Probably, you all have seen here in the U.K. the new campaign of Strongbow with the warriors. You get to see one, which has not been on television, but only on the net. I must say, it's a bit a high risk for CFO to show it to you, but I can't on your sense of humor.</p>

          <p>I am Matthew Webb from Cazenove. Three questions, please. The first regarding the redundancies in the U.S. and Russia, I just wondering which particular job functions have been hardest hits and to what extent they are customer facing?</p>
          <p>And second question, in the U.K., well, you've realized more or less all of the synergies from the acquisition and for your prices up, and yeah, you're still actually losing money. In the first half, I wonder with your concern now this is just been a very, very unprofitable market that it's going to be very difficult to make any serious money.</p>
          <p>And then the third question, I wonder whether you would agree with me that there is a structure was one of cyclical issue with your brand in the U.S. with the craft beers not having faced anything like the same sort of trading down that you seem to have seen? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you want to take the U.K.? I'll take the redundancy in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Redundancy, no customer facing is not where we would typically cut, it's more in the organization. It's screening all jobs which are not directly adding to sales process that's what have been done, and the engineering that you from time-to-time find in wealthy companies, that is what has been addressed in both the organization. That is for the commercial organizations. So, it's not cutting the meat. And it is done with thought about it. For the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>U.K., clearly, as Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois showed, we have great confidence. And we see the results coming through. You're alluding to the negative part in the first time consolidations of the first four months. As you will remember traditionally the first four months for the former, for these new companies is always negative given the skew towards Q2, three and four and certainly four in the U.K. So that is not a surprise on like-for-like basis. Next we got a few things influencing these results like higher pension costs, like the fact that the Miller and the San Miguel brand has been taken out by the owners. At the same time, we increased marketing investments in these markets for the good cause. We saw the market share increasing here in the U.K. and brands being reinforced. So &#x2013; on the four months timeframe, that shows negative contribution, but that is not something how we look at the business at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's going to be definitely a challenge ahead. Yes, and one of the component that you have to add to is also margin improvement. One has to realize that three years ago when you looked at the average selling price in the U.K. for beer, it was one of the highest in Europe. Today, it's one of the lowest and that's partly to do that over that period, people seemingly forgot to increase their prices facing half the increase on their raw materials and packaging costs, and on the other hand, the pound did something there. So, that is what puts a pressure on doing the long-term job of margin restoration, you don't do that in one day. That would be too easy of course, but that is what you have to work and we're working that. That's the responsibility as market leader that we have to take.</p>
          <p>On the other side, this is a market which is indeed structurally in decline. I mean, I do not even after the downturn in many European markets you have to do with demographics. But it's about the value gain and increasing your share of the value. That is what we have to do.</p>
          <p>So, also reinvesting and building stronger brands. I think the early signs of what U.K team is doing are encouraging and that is what gives me together with the reengineering of the whole business platform. The number of breweries you need, how you organize your customer service center or what for your logistical prime and dime distribution is organized for much lower volumes.</p>
          <p>All this has to be tackled, it's a tough job, it's a tough job. But when you have the market leader, you are well-positioned to create value and out of the experience so far we have seen that in all countries where we took over existing companies and we have had these &#x2013; historically these difficult times in Italy and in Spain and even in France. At the end of the day we get there, even in a mature declining market we get there. So, what the crisis has been doing is putting a little bit of a delay on it. I mean this is clearly a setback. Without a crisis, I think you would have been two years faster than what we can say now, but definitely the perspectives are still there. Brands are good &#x2013; there is a good platform to build on. That is what I'd like to add on the U.K. side.</p>
          <p>And then on the U.S., I think I said at my introduction. Now the thing is, I said there is work to do. I recognize that on the brand equity of Heineken we have to move the needle. But there and again value goes about volume. Now, we are a brand having a large share in the U.S., large distribution we have everywhere.</p>
          <p>We have been growing in an extraordinarily way over the last decades. It is perhaps the first time that we have such a setback. I think there is a large part once more, which is due to down trading, specifically because you have to see where our customers are and where the growth came from. So that has not to be understated.</p>
          <p>Going to brutally adjust your price premium, price points will not help because you will totally destroy the premiumness of the product. What we have to, is add better value to the brand. There is clearly still going further a challenge to do better. But on the other hand, you have to look at that organization.</p>
          <p>We have done it for brands like Dos Equis, but when you grow, I take that example because when you take such a brand it's small, so you can profile it a little bit the way you want. You can have much more fantasy because you are very small. When you have a Heineken brand with six million hectolitres it's an institution.</p>
          <p>So think about doing Stay Thirsty My Friends, that kind of very funny, witty advertising, but you would do that for Heineken, it would not be credible, right. So you have a good creation that would not fit a brand, which is already established &#x2013; the brand is if I may say it's owned by the consumer, never forget that.</p>
          <p>So you have to stay relevant for them even when you grow yourself and when you have a long history with you, you have a solid DNA, and so you can't do everything you would like to be funny. So, that is a &#x2013; that's an important thing that you have to see in communication, you have to find the right tone. It's not always easy for a big brand like ours.</p>
          <p>Now, I am confident seeing the track record of Euro RSCG in building a brand like that they understand where beer is as a category and when Heineken is with all its history when we can grow again. And so we'll put definitely the accent on brand equity building over volume absolutely.</p>

          <p>Hi, Melissa Earlam from UBS. Three questions, please. The wholesaling division generated about 22% of your TCM savings. Can you just give a little bit more detail where that's coming from? Is it coming from head count reduction in that division? And can you talk a little bit more about what the peak profitability has been within your wholesaling division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. What the...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What the peak margins have been historically within your wholesaling division and whether you see any reason why profitability shouldn't return to those historic levels?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was just on 145 million run-rate of synergies from S&amp;N, could you split that between costs and revenue synergies? And finally, are you seeing any markets where those increased price competition at all across your footprint, perhaps specifically Poland? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we look at the cost reductions in wholesaling, it's clearly wholesaling is catering for the on-premise market. On-premise market is in declines, so there is a huge pressure to save costs in that wholesaling business. Where are the savings coming from? Partly, it is from head count reduction, but it is also from increasing the logistic efficiencies. We do concepts likely cross stocking which saves you warehousing handling and the lot of costs, but there is also an element in it, we handle quite some number of third-party products in wholesaling, thereby our wholesale operations had their own purchasing of these third party products. We have now begun to group that and get the purchasing power of the whole group in buying from third parties our products.</p>
          <p>On the S&amp;N, 145 annualized savings, the vast majority is on the costs side, that is where we are going very, very fast and where we will probably over deliver on the target we have at the same time you see that the revenue part as we always have said will take more time certainly in the current market environment, will take a little bit more time. But we see that Heineken brand is doing well on their platforms, we see that their brands are benefiting from our innovations. We are starting to rollout Strongbow in more markets. So there is absolutely also on that side benefits coming in, but when you look at 145 it's largely on the cost side.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is difference a bit market-by-market, but on the average it is low margin, very low margin business. But which we think is of strategic importance because it gives us direct access to the customer. And for instance when you look at Western Europe where in stable markets we play each time that mix gain that upgrading on from one brand to the other, from one package to the other, when you are in direct control of the distribution and you have that interface with the customer you can play that in a much more smarter way. So, yes it is a low margin business, but very important for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But also low capital as you can understand this is working capital which is your investment all things.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That with these low margins with sharply declining volumes you are very, very vulnerable for steep declines on a very short period of time. So you don't have the cushions that you have in the large industrial skill operation. So on the short-term, you got more over shock, but the restructuring of that, those quicker and is less costly than foreign industrial operations, that's how you will have to see it. For the rest, we don't give specific numbers on our margin, because we are kind of in a competitive environment. We are not the only wholesaler, but we are the largest wholesaler in Europe by and large in Europe. And as Ren&#xE9; was pointing out, we have to be efficient in running it but using it at our advantage to build market share for our own brands and make a decent commercial margins on the third party products that we carry. That's our strategy. Also, you had a last question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>At decreased prices, you mean. Well, I don't see a lot of people starting to widely promote the good brands they have. At least, we are not doing that and I don't think we have too much stupid people around in the industry but the real competition comes, it is the down trading phenomena. It is the cheaper product, which takes market share on the most expensive product, as opposed to a value equation. So we see in the Netherlands and I said it, we see of course the private label taking some share in a country like the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>We see that also happening in France, but on the other hand with the Heineken brand, we still also have an increase. So, seemingly, the consumer in France says or I go for the real stuff that's Heineken or perhaps I will take a private label and I will skip the guy who was in middle or between, right. In every market, you will have different reactions, but it is not promotional pressure increases that's for sure because the retailers face the same problems and we do have but it is not that you want to de-position your brands in terms of pricing level in the competitive world we live in.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Paul Hofman, Chevreux. Two questions on the input cost, sorry, on the input cost please, you said it was slightly up per hectolitre. I see that the drop as the percentage of sales that's 220 basis points and we also made calculation per hectolitre is also similarly drop so what's exactly the difference? How do you come to that slight increase per hectolitre? And secondly, on top of that input cost, yet so far you've been telling while you expect a flattish level. Do you see anything changing there in terms of full year guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Obviously we see the drop in volume. The total amount on input cost go down, but in the press release you see the organic development, which is minus 3.2%, and if you compare that with the volume drop, you'll see that there is a price mix effect upwards in the organic cost, that has to do to a great extent to do with the mix, so less draught and more cans for instance on an per hectolitre price, and on the input cost we set in euro terms, it is flattish. And that is what we also expect for the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Karel Zoete from Rabo Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen, Karel Zoete with Rabo Securities. Two questions, first one on pricing. Excluding any further price increase, what kind of pricing would you then expect into second half of the year?</p>
          <p>Second question more on Q2, albeit this is a half year event. In the first part you had organic EBIT growth of slightly negative, if I do the calculations right, am I right that in the second quarter we've seen close to 20% organic EBIT growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pricing second half, I think you will see less opportunities for price increase in the second half of the year, obviously, we're still in volume decline. The value over volume strategy was meant also to restore margins after a spurt in the rise of the input price. You always do that with a certain delay, so it is also an effort of restoration of the gross margins.</p>
          <p>Going forward it's difficult to see that overall I would say that we will be much more subdued in pricing than we have been up so far. And secondly, there might be exceptions in countries where you still have a high inflation or you come across a high inflation. There we, of course, have to continue to protect our margins.</p>
          <p>Then your question on the EBIT Q1 and Q2, and I didn't catch it completely, but let me say first of all, as we always say, Q1 is a very small quarter, so that the impact of that is limited in the total. And clearly what we have said at that moment in time, the EBIT &#x2013; underlying EBIT development was slightly negative. We are now at the plus 13% that as Q2 was absolutely better. But at the same time we said, in Q1 we had a number of exceptional things like Eastern was now in Q2 and not in Q1, a sort of rare number of shifts, we were out of business in a lot of the Italian retailers. So, as we have said during the Q1 presentation, that is not a good figure to rely on, and so I would suggest, look at the total of first half year in combination.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Chris Pitcher from Redburn. Just following up on the question on input cost. You talked about 2009, but we've now got reasonable visibility, I think on the European harvest, which looks to be pretty good. What sort of level of input cost deflation should we be expecting next year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, when you move to local production in South Africa, the net cost saving of being able to produce locally, is that being treated separate from total cost management? And if so, can you give us a feel for the sort of year-on-year benefit to gain from that?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, have you gone back to suppliers as a larger entity to start renegotiating the majority of your supplier, or is that a really next year's story?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting with your last question, with some we started immediately. And although it's less, it depends how global the supplier are. When you speak to the global supplier, it is obvious that we speak from a broader base, of course, think about cans or glasses &#x2013; glass work or &#x2013; So the bundling of the strategic material has been done immediately, that's already done, right.</p>
          <p>The input cost, yeah. If you refer to the harvest, the harvest this year was exceptionally good. That's fantastic. It just comes at the wrong moment; nobody needs it to put it in that perspective. Most of us, and we will not be an exception in this industry, we have overhang in our stocks from the previous periods. And so we will, of course, order less.</p>
          <p>Now typically, nobody is waiting for the harvest to be known and to be taken off the land to start buying. So, we also have forward contracts, and we contract typically a big part, a chunk, at least half in front of the &#x2013; before the harvest, and then we start to act during the growth period and after.</p>
          <p>The problem is that this year we see huge surpluses, so you see the barley market, the pricing drops really significantly, that's true. But you have to imagine what we have contracted are at pre-harvest prices. And thus, we have overhangs of surpluses from the previous one, which means that, if you push it down in 2010, you don't have to imagine that there will be massive cost savings coming from that. That it's a little bit spread out.</p>
          <p>Very much depends on what also the harvest the next year will do, and the harvest of this year has been really exceptional. And you don't see that every year. So I want to caution that that this is not also reflecting the real price level going forward.</p>
          <p>But it's true, you have that kind of discrepancy. It's a little bit like the oil price, we never bought a barrel of oil at 150 obviously, but we never buy one at 50 either. I mean, there is a lot of market speculation and the real commercial banding which you trade with the energy prices is smaller than what you read in the newspaper. Now that goes for the commodity prices like that.</p>
          <p>Third one, I would say is aluminum. Aluminum has come down quite significantly. There they might be for us some opportunities in the future, let me put that in the most vague terms. But nothing really, I would say of great spectacular, because often it's too easy to make the translation, you can buy a ton of wheat for 90 now, so you should, kind of &#x2013; that is not happening in the real world.</p>

          <p>But directionally it's right to think that the per unit cost &#x2013; input cost will be lower than it will this year, how much will &#x2013; trying to assess, but directionally it will be slightly lower.</p>

          <p>I caution for directionally and it's in the quantity if you make, and it has a lot to do with supply and demand. Directionally you're right, if demand stays depressed that is true, but don't forget that people who plant barley when they have lousy prices, next year they will plant less, right. So it is not that easy.</p>

          <p>South Africa, will that be in TCM. No, first of all, South Africa is a non-consolidated joint venture, and so all the cost savings we're making in our joint ventures, and because it doesn't mean that we work on the cost in APB or in CCU, but they are not in total cost management, because they are out of our accounts, and we only reap our share of net profits.</p>
          <p>And there you'll also see with the translation from exports to the local operation, the results of the local operation will only get into our accounts as income from associates as a percentage of the net profits, so the effect will be limited. And, yes, we're on an export mode having negative margins, so we will lose that. At the same time temporarily because we'll have to adjust ourselves and we take quite a bunch of volume out of Western Europe, which we have spread over different breweries. And that's the volume we are now producing in Europe will fall away.</p>

          <p>Anthony Garnett, Mundane Asset Management. You recently put out a press release, the time the departure of your President or CE, Chief Executive of Heineken USA. In that press release, he made a comment or it was attributed to him that there has been strategic differences between Heineken and his own view of the long-term strategy or strategy of the group in the U.S. Could you explain exactly what his strategy differences were from yours, and what the supporting arguments were for his strategy as against your strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, now you will allow that I will not response to that question. I think the statements are quite qualified, and they tell what they have to tell. I am not going to dwell in in what exactly the differences are. Well, the strategy that we pursue in the United States is a value over volume strategy based with our own brands on a good price premium, a reinvestment of solid part of that price premium into support for the brand, and an outstanding customer relation providing for superior brands or margins for the distributors to do the job, to support the distribution and the sales of our brands, right.</p>
          <p>Margin  times velocity we say. Well, that strategy has not changed. And I know you will try to dig in and dig in, I think it is a contractual matter between people, the company and people, now these things they happen.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's absolutely fine. But I'd just like to understand then, why you put out a statement saying there were strategy differences. When you had control of the press release, why would you actually put out on a press release that the reason he left was strategy differences, you could have left that out of the press release. So I didn't quite understand why you are inviting investors to inquire further when you could have left that invitation off the press release.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> Securities. I had a question that is related &#x2013; sorry, just looking up, with regards to the TCM saving space. You previously hinted that to be a gradual process over the next three years, do you kind of repeat that guidance now or has there been any &#x2013; yeah, I'd say initial ramping up, low hanging fruits that you have been able to quickly capture and now the saving space will slowdown a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as we've said, TCM is the follow-up of the Fit 2 Fight, we are as a company very much geared towards cost cutting, so it does not mobilize in a whole new organization. We are in running speed, we have enlarged the territory. We have taken new initiatives, obviously on Board, and good performance in the first half, and we are committed to continue to put a lot of focus on that.</p>
          <p>As we have said in February, we are not going to give a three-year target. We don't want to have a company where a big number translated in a number of jobs is hanging for three years above the organization, and everybody is busy and thinking, is it me or my neighbor instead of how can I sell more beer?</p>

          <p>Sorry, Ian Shackleton, Nomura. Just to fill the few questions on the TCM program. Firstly, I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you're saying around the 50 and the 120. I was saying the 120 is a full 12 months effect to the 50. So not all that will fall into this fiscal, some of it will fall...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...into FY10. Thank you. But obviously, presumably there is still scope for other measures to be introduced in H2, which could add to the quantum for FY09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So we continue, but if all the measures we have taken would be in place on the 1st of January of this year, then the effect of the full year would have been under 20. So, but we don't stop at the 30th of June. So we continue to work on new initiatives, other things, so there will be an ongoing flow of things, which fall in the P&amp;L obviously. And you can say what would be the annualized effect of that, and that is how we are going to report on it.</p>
          <p>Maybe because I think that was your note or somebody's note, writing about how do you see the marketing cost in relation to total cost management? Similar question you could ask for, the input cost is if we buy our malt cheaper, would that be saving in TCM? No, obviously not, because that is not how we look at it. It should be an sustainable saving, but if we reduce losses on our raw materials, that is in TCM.</p>
          <p>If we reduce the efficiency in our commercial reduce &#x2013; increase the efficiency of our commercial organization, that will be in TCM. If we negotiate different agencies' alignments, that will be in TCM. If we order the coasters worldwide centrally, that will be in TCM, but if we get 10% lower media rates, that is obviously not in TCM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just following up the move in A&amp;P in terms of net sales, if I remember rightly, it was 12.6 to &#x2013; 12.4 to 11.6, just under 100 basis points. None of that really is falling into TCM. That is purely being able to buying media?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a few elements in it, which falls in TCM, because in that percentage is not only media, but it is also POS materials, like my example of the cost for draught beer visibility in pubs, and there TCM can have an impact by harmonizing, centralizing your purchasing, et cetera. But it's not the biggest part. But it's certainly not a big part.</p>

          <p>Just I mean you quantified that's a three-year program, therefore we tend to think about Fit 2 Fight again. Should we look at Fit 2 Fight in the phasing in any way as a guide for what's happening here for TCM?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We all ask the question different ways.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say one thing different with Fit 2 Fight, we had to mobilize your organization, what we said when we moved from Fit 2 Fight to TCM, it is something which is engrained in the organization. It is not that you have to wake up to your organization and say, hey guys, let's talk about cost cutting. It is the ongoing motto of the company, and in that respect if you talk about phasing and et cetera it is different than Fit 2 Fight where you had to ramp-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me put this clear again, why we did it? Yes, we needed to do it for Fit 2 Fight because its not that we were insensitive to cost, but we really have to put the whole organization under a electroshock, if I can put it that way, so people had to read in the newspaper that we're goddamn serious about realizing this plan. The downside of it is that by and large this translates into job losses.</p>
          <p>And then you got the media, they concentrate on that sole part. They don't see it is for being competitive. They just see how many jobs are going &#x2013; you're going to cut. Our people who work hard everyday to make this company posting good results, aren't reading in the newspaper, whatever it takes, we're going to put again people out of their jobs. People are not stupid. They know what we are doing. But I think also a little bit out of respect, and to sustain the motivation of the people who work for this company, we do it like that, because we live in a world where &#x2013; and the senior management, but also the mid-management understands the world we live in, and we will carry the TCM program, but we didn't want to immediately say, that's going to translate in so many thousands of job cuts.</p>
          <p>We have a huge company covering 60 &#x2013; once more, 67 countries where we operate fully, and it is &#x2013; you have to manage that, and their expectation and so. That's why we have chosen not to publish the number, and saying a posteriori every six months. We're going to say, we did that, we did that, we did that. That is what the deals on the period. That is on an annual basis, and keep you posted with that. And pretty determined and the company knows that when we have these plans, and of course, we have these objectives internally. People know that that the determination to do it is internally strong enough that we can carry it out, where in the first period, I have to reckon we needed to go outside to wake up the company.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the final question really, you give us a very good split of both by function where the 50 million is also geographically. If we go forward over the next three years, we'll assume from a function point of view, the wholesale element will probably get smaller, it sounds like you've done that quicker. And I wonder from a geographical point of view, you seem to flag the Americas probably comes down and presuming Western Europe goes up, is that a fair comment?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Trevor Stirling, Sanford Bernstein. You'll be relieved to know I have just one question. When you announced you were closing Berkshire Brewery, Carlsberg announced intention to close Leeds, and Anheuser-Busch's Stag Brewery will probably go as well. Is that enough to get rid of the overcapacity in the UK market or are volumes falling so quickly that we're still left with significant overcapacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You ask me a question, which I would not be able to respond top of my mind exactly, because we have these kind of things but there is certainly a determination in the act, the market fell down quite a bit here. I think we take the point of view from our side is to say, well, take the worst case scenario, right, execute it at a timeframe, which is quicker than what you need to do. And what you will then be your shortfall in capacity because you still sell. You're going to have that through improved productivity. We do that a lot of times, and it worked quite well for us. And that is what you have to do in a mature market, which is in structural decline.</p>
          <p>It is true that UK had a bigger overcapacity, and also that the state of the industrial assets is pretty average, right. So that's why these things go so fast. But consider it's good news for the future of the industry.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. About the surprising EBITDA in the different regions, my question is how sustainable are the strong increases we've seen in the Americas? Also the higher level in the headquarter and in Asia, in the Americas there was quite a big improvement outside the U.S. of around 20 million on quite a relatively small sales level. Can you elaborate on that? And if can we translate the 130 million also to the second half?</p>
          <p>For the head quarter, it was quite a high number of 31 million, and that compares to a high level incidental high level last year of 33, which was because of malting fees. Was it again malting fees or was this something different in the headquarter, and can it also continue in the second half? And on Asia, it's also the big upturn we see outside the joint ventures, is that a sustainable level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say on the Americas jokingly, if we don't decrease our prices with 25%, it is sustainable, gave that advice to the Dutch press, but the good results or the part outside of the U.S. is CCU, where there is a good performance but also one or two more incidental things in the results. But the overall performance of CCU is very strong. In Asia, the growth is coming from, mainly from our own operations, Indonesia is doing extremely well. Then head office, that is always a bit on that level, I don't see any reason why that would be very much different.</p>
          <p>We have as an inflow in the head office, and the royalties from our brands, that will be slightly under pressure. On the other hand, we work very hard on the cost side. And so, I think, I don't have here fully in my head, because it is so many different things in the head office which makeup for the amount, but I don't expect much changes there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nikolaas Faes from Exane BNP Paribas. So I learned from you that you have in your mind, what your cost savings program is &#x2013; your TCM program is going to yield over the next two, three years. If any additional inflationary pressures on the cost side occur, would you then act and do more cost savings, equally if there is more price pressures on your products, like you did with Fit 2 Fight, where you had an initial target and afterwards came back with an additional saving because you had more contrarian market circumstances. And has is the figure that you have in your mind, is that improving the profitability of the company, or is that given partially away to consumers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now the inflation, let it be clear that nobody can fight inflation. If it's structural inflation, you have to pass it on. You cannot fight inflation just by cost cutting, you work yourself in the wrong corner. That is as a general point.</p>
          <p>The second thing is about the adaptability of the target. The target, yes, it evolves. And it evolves also based on insights on the volume. The volume component this time is very big, much bigger than in the previous Fit 2 Fight. As long as you don't know where you're going to land, you might face TCM chunks, which might be bigger if the volume losses would continue to grow. I'm not trying to suggest that that will be the case.</p>
          <p>But in the event it would be the case, we would have to react even more forcefully. So, to say that a target is a target, and it will stay, never be adapted. The principal thing that changes for the target that would increase the target is the volume, if it would go down or up on the overall. Hence, I mean it's about making a choice to close a brewery or to keep it in operation, has also to do with the volumes you can make. So there is a certain amount of flexibility there. But it's not an amount of complacency. It is flexibility to reality which would be embedded into that. And the last question you had was about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it is increasing, the target that you have in your mind is increasing profitability of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and the usage of that increase of the profitability. In the Fit 2 Fight program, it was very clear that we would let it flow all through the bottom line. I'm not saying that in the coming period of three years, all of that is going to flow to the bottom line. Part of it can also flow into building the brands. But for this year, since we have &#x2013; we live in a very kind of bumpy situation, and we navigate on sight, not on automatic pilot here. We take the view that we better keep that, the profitability to reimburse our debts, that is where we put the money. We put the money in the bank to bring it back, and to make sure that we are not vulnerable to whatever situation. That is what we do now on the short-term, right.</p>
          <p>But keeping an eye on the long-term, you are not going to make the company grow forever by just cutting the costs, right. So selectively we still invest, think about South Africa and the whole of the African continent, we invest a lot behind the brands, growing market share, blah, blah. It works very well. We do that in the UK, selectively UK is certainly a market where we are here not only to restructure the base, but to invest in the brands because we feel the need to do that. So it depends a bit after the markets, but we have to grow the business beyond the cost cutting, and that's very high on our radar screen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. You've been stressing this value over volume thing. Just with regard to that, you referred to a couple of markets in Europe, or two or three, in fact, where on label, product label is gaining share. Are we near to a situation in any of your big markets where that concerns you, and that your pricing that you've taken might not be sustainable? And related to that, it drops some very low price volume in Russia and Austria I think, are we going to see a continued effect from that in the second half? And are there other markets where that sort of approach might be taken by you in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>DOB volumes, thus it concern you certainly, and it's not something we like, but we have seen also in the past that it goes up and it goes down, has also very much to do with shopping behavior. If consumers are more going to higher discounters, where there are no branded goods, and that has an impact on the position of these brands. But our value of volume strategy is let's not try to beat these trends, which are cyclical trends by heavy discounting of our brands or lowering the prices, because as we have said before you can only give away your margins once. And once you get out of the crisis, you would be in a position where you don't want to be.</p>
          <p>And rationalizing SKUs, taking unprofitable or lower margin volume out, and that is certainly a thing we are screening in many markets, and that will have an impact like it has had in the first half and in markets where we did that in a big way, like Austria you will see that the effects for instance will fade away in the rest of the year. And again you have to realize in Russia we are number three, at a reasonable distance of the market leader. That's a totally different situation than Austria where we are the market leader. So the choice it might have the same effect that you lose market share, but the motivation to do it is quite different than the objective you want to reach is also quite different, so uncomparable these two as an example.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. I have got three questions overall. First is just on pricing and gross margins. Could you give us your pricing policy into 2010? Would you continue to try and price around inflation, i.e. flat real pricing? And can you give us a idea, would you like to restore gross margins to what they were in '06, '07, because your peers are certainly saying that they want to restore gross margins? That's the first question. I leave you to answer.</p>

I was saying previously, the possibilities to increase prices in the period to come are going to be more subdued, but very much depending on the environment and the level of inflation that you will find in the markets where we operate.</p>
          <p>So it's a very volatile thing. Let me put it that way. The opportunity now for taking price in the U.S. is not there, right. But it might be so that we have opportunity to take price, for instance, in Nigeria or South Africa. So it is a situation where we will see market-by-market and not on a worldwide basis. Previously in '07 and '08, there was a marching order in our group that across everywhere we have to do it because we had been submitted to the price hike on the raw materials and it affected everybody.</p>
          <p>Now, if these raw materials inflation is contained, and when it is contained, the immediate urge for pushing prices is less there. And then you have to look at market by market, where you have a solid position, a whole and an opportunity, that is how you approach the problem. And what I'm saying is that seeing the world in which we live, and going forward these opportunities might be a bit less present as they were in the past, certainly in the euro zone, if I may say.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand the difference between the pricing that you're getting in the first half is really rollover prices you took at the end of last year or beginning of the year. There is no more price increases in this year. So it's moderating. I'm more interested into '010, do you think beer price points in the food baskets are high and have to come down like other products like yogurt, et cetera? Or do you think beer price points in the food baskets is good enough and strong enough for the brands to go up with the food inflation in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There &#x2013; I don't think you will see a re-rate of branded beers in the food basket in terms of absolute price point. What you have is the down-trading going to the private labels, that is what you see or from a premium brand to a mainstream brand, but going to a massive repricing structural list price. No, I don't see that happening. What you then see is an increased promotional pressure, which is a request from, of course, the supermarkets who in many geographies use your brands as an appeal.</p>
          <p>In this country in particular, it is absolutely the case, where beer brands are really used as a traffic builder. They are not the only ones, but we have to deal with that, and you have to manage that situation, and you have to make from a problem an opportunity. So yes, it's more a promotion but then also more market share. That's how you have to engineer your thinking and your doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A follow-on, second question. In the first half how did you manage the Heineken brand to grow ahead of the volumes in general in Western Europe and in line in Central and Eastern Europe if you're talking about down-trading, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is because the &#x2013; there is the difference in the markets which we operate, Heineken is under 72. And the markets where we operate a full fledge portfolio, which we consolidate as 67. And we have a lot of markets in Europe, where we were hardly hit by the crisis. If you look at markets like big markets where you can build significant volume for the Heineken brand, I take Vietnam, I take China, I take South Africa, I take Nigeria, I take Brazil, I take Argentina.</p>
          <p>Those are significant markets where the brand is not as big as it is geographically in the United States. And where we from a lower base, still grow despite the pressure coming out of the economic crisis. So there you see that the down-trading, quote-unquote, is affecting us less than in other markets. So it's a mixed bag of things, and that explains why in a lot of geographies the Heineken brand is still growing, at least half of the geography were still growing. And then some even big time. Think about Nigeria plus 44%, that's quite, I think so.</p>
          <p>And that's if you aggregate all this, yes, on our total sales &#x2013; consolidated sales going down 6.6 and Heineken 4.7. But that indicates that the potential and the strength of the brand is absolutely superb.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you were referring to Western Europe where it clearly outperforms the total portfolio, and I think that's the sign of the strength and resilience of the brands in these markets when you compare that with Central and Eastern Europe where the brand is much younger, much smaller, and where the price sensitivity of these markets is much bigger. So there you see in a number of the markets that we are heavily affected. Market like Poland, you see that, but that is a very price sensitive market. But in Western Europe, as you say, it's a remarkable performance of the Heineken brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, is it possible to quantify, Ren&#xE9;, the size of the pension, the additional A&amp;P and the Miller, San Miguel effect in the first half, and would that flow over into the second half, so for us to rebase our UK numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a number of things. I don't know that out of my head but, so it's increased marketing in Miller, San Miguel, double &#x2013; the double work of keeping the Berkshire brewery still open for a number of things, but having translocated already a big part of the volumes. So there is double running costs, a number of things which probably will be still in the second half of the year, but a number of them like the Berkshire brewery, like the San Miguel and Miller will fade out completely in 2010.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Hi, Jason Derise, UBS. Two questions, hopefully quick questions. But maybe the first question if you can give an update on how July and August have gone trading maybe just globally? I know you don't want to probably get into the regions, but if you do want to get into the regions I'm happy to let you do that. And then, if you can just quickly say what your organic price mix was for the half in Western Europe, just want to double-check that number?</p>

          <p>June, July, August we don't &#x2013; are in a position to comment on that, as we don't have them in the press release. Luckily we have now quarterly updates where it was used, so you get it in time and you don't have to wait for February to see how the summer was. Your second question was about pricing.</p>

          <p>Thank you for correcting, because it's absolutely an opportunity. I think we're nearing, right, allow me to leave that in out in the blue here. In the sense those are complicated transactions and involving many parties as you can imagine. So that has a sequence of event, but we are progressing very well, so consider that positive note to come.</p>
          <p>I mean, the good news is that UB is developing well. One has to say when Heineken enters as an active partner what's going to be the added value of a partner like Heineken in UB? What's going to beat that? But in such a growing market, which has a perspective on growth, which is going strong for the next coming 20 years, the timing in which you start to do that is not that important. I mean it's not a matter of few months, which will change, move the needle on the strategic importance of how that will go for the long-term future for both our companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when are you going to probably sort of make a proper launch of the Heineken brand in the UK, so that the Brits can really enjoy a proper beer.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just be honest, because how much volume at the moment are you generating in the UK with the Heineken brand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we give that number, but it's a pretty good number so far. Years and years it has been increasing. What we see integrating Heineken is as an end, it makes us much better in picking out the right outlets to put the Heineken brand at the proper positioning. That works very well.</p>
          <p>And starting the on-trade we are gaining share. Now you have to realize we lost the Miller brand, we lost the San Miguel brand, and instead of that we have the Heineken brand, the Amstel brand and the Tiger brand. That is what we put in as weapons to in the premium and in the on-trade market to get traction again, and make up for the lost volumes of the two other brands. That's going pretty well. So we're very happy with the development around Heineken. There is clearly an opportunity for the brand in the UK.</p>
