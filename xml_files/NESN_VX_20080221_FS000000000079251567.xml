      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone, and welcome to our 2007 full year results conference call. I would like to start just by saying how happy I am to be hosting the call and I am looking forward to seeing many of you over the next couple of weeks in Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>In the Nestl&#xE9; tradition, I will take the disclaimer as read and move straight to the highlights. It certainly makes my job easier for the first time to be reporting on a set of really strong numbers, another year of delivery of the Nestl&#xE9; model. I hope that you recognize these as the continuation of momentum that has been built up over the last decade and which will serve the group well in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>This performance was despite a tough input cost environment and was achieved, whilst meeting and digesting some major acquisitions. It demonstrates the value of our organizational transformation, which has enhanced the agility of our different businesses and enabled them to react rapidly to their individual challenges. It also shows the value of our billionaire brands and the importance of innovation, which together enable us to price as necessary whilst driving &#x2013; also driving volume growth.</p>
          <p>Above all it shows the value of being a first mover in terms of anticipating the input cost pressures that we had already highlighted back in 2005 and 2006. As you will see, our anticipatory strategy enabled us to ensure that input cost pressures were effectively managed, thereby avoiding any material impact on our overall performance in 2007.</p>
          <p>Next the key financials. For the first time sales exceeded SFR100 billion. This is a significant achievement. Total sales were up 9.2% or SFR9.1 billion with organic growth of 7.4%.</p>
          <p>Earnings before interest and tax, EBIT, increased faster than sales, up 12.9% or SFR1.7 billion to SFR15 billion resulting in a 50-basis-point increase in the EBIT margin to 14% of sales.</p>
          <p>This is in itself a performance milestone. This was achieved despite a ten-basis-point negative impact from currencies, resulting from translation into Swiss francs. The net profit also advanced well, increasing by SFR1.4 billion to SFR10.6 billion, resulting in a 60-basis-point improvement in net profit margin to 9.9%.</p>
          <p>Working capital further improved in 2007 following the good performance in 2006, and there was an improvement also in return on invested capital of 100 basis points before goodwill and 50 basis points including goodwill. The difference reflects the recent acquisitions in nutrition during the year.</p>
          <p>The achievements in 2007 highlight the growth momentum of our brands, the leadership exercised by our people in the markets through timely actions and excellence in execution, enabling a strong performance in spite of the challenging business environment.</p>
          <p>Turning now to food and beverages, once again the groups' core businesses delivered the Nestl&#xE9; model, exceeding the group target for organic growth, whilst also achieving a significant improvement in its EBIT margin. Total sales growth was 9.2% or SFR8.4 billion to just over SFR100 billion with organic growth of 7.1%.</p>
          <p>The EBIT increased by SFR1.4 billion to SFR12.6 billion representing a 40-basis-point improvement in EBIT margin, again, despite a ten-basis-point currency impact.</p>
          <p>Turning now to sales, on the next slide you have the breakdown of both the groups and food and beverage sales. The differences between the two is our pharmaceutical group, primarily Alcon.</p>
          <p>I've already mentioned the organic growth, but what is noticeable both for the group and food and beverage &#x2013; and the food and beverage businesses is the combination of both relatively strong RIG and pricing, compared to recent years.</p>
          <p>The fact that our brands have been able to digest the pricing without any significant impact on the group's real internal growth is testament to the breadth and strength of our portfolio of brands.</p>
          <p>The 4.4% for the groups exceeds our old RIG target, always considered a stretch target, and demonstrates the continuity &#x2013; the continuing growth momentum in our business on top of the strong performance in 2006.</p>
          <p>The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is similar in both, about 1.5% positive, whilst foreign exchange added 0.4% to the group and 0.6% to food and beverage. Some of you would like know the breakdown for acquisitions, which was 2.6%, and divestitures, which was 1.2%. So businesses with well over SFR1 billion have been divested.</p>
          <p>Staying with sales and looking at the total food and beverage business by geography. The numbers are intended to give you a good benchmark for peer group comparisons. I'll go into the detail later in the presentation. All three areas accelerated in the final quarter, most noticeably Europe, from 3.8% to 4.2% organic growth with both RIG and pricing contributing to the improved growth rate.</p>
          <p>On our next slide, we have the organic growth by product group. I will start with powdered and liquid beverages. Organic growth was 10.3% and RIG, 7.6%. There were good performances in each of the categories. Let's start with soluble coffee. Nescaf&#xE9;'s growth continued at the same level as early in the year with double-digit growth in Americas and in key emerging markets such as Russia and China, and good growth relative to the market in Western Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>We enjoyed continued double-digit growth, with coffee mixes now about 20% of our soluble coffee business. The Dolce Gusto rollout continues to build momentum successfully, both in the original launch markets and in new markets. It is now in ten markets, including Japan, and we are planning further rollouts.</p>
          <p>Powdered beverages once again achieved double-digit growth in AOA, with Milo maintaining its strong momentum. There was positive growth also in Europe and in the Americas.</p>
          <p>Liquid beverages performed well. Nestea grew double-digit and was strong in Americas, its key zone. Juicy Juice did well in the U.S. as did Liquid Milo in Asia. Nespresso was, of course, the star performer, achieving about 40% organic growth. If it maintain that growth rate, its sales will exceed SFR2 billion in the current year.</p>
          <p>Nestl&#xE9; Waters, as you will recall, started the year well, but then fell victim to the rather dull summer and finished the year with organic growth of 6.6% of which pricing was 1.6%, was a positive development in 2007. Also notable in 2007 was the launched of our Eco-shape bottle, using considerably less PET than any other bottle on the market.</p>
          <p>By geography, Europe was flat, but the Americas and the rest of the world were double-digit. Nestl&#xE9; Pure Life, now present in more than 20 countries, continue to grow about 30% and there was good growth also from San Pellegrino.</p>
          <p>Next is Dairy, which includes ice cream and Cereal Partners worldwide, as well as shelf-stable dairy. This is the category where there has been most input cost pressure and it is perhaps not surprising that the pricing is somewhat high at 6.1% out of an organic growth of 7.8%.</p>
          <p>I'll start with shelf-stable dairy. This category has double-digit pricing in 2007 in Americas, with AOA slightly below double-digit. RIG was positive low single-digit. The category managers have done a great job of managing the cost challenge in our various markets. We have also continued to drive innovation, especially in growing up milks, other dairy products with branded active ingredients, and in nutritionally supportive &#x2013; superior affordable milk products.</p>
          <p>Our long-standing strategy of differentiation in this category and of offering consumers value-added, has been a terrific defense in an inflationary environment. Demand for our premium milks, enhanced with branded active benefits has proven to be quite resilient. The market for standard milks, effectively the commodity market, has seem some trading down, but our leadership in affordable milks priced even lower, such as Bear Brand and Nestl&#xE9; Ideal, means that we were a beneficiary of this trend. With cost pressures still a challenge in 2008, our markets continue to pursue a range of measures to compensate the negative effects.</p>
          <p>Our ice-cream business has continued to focus successfully on improving its profitability, even if this comes at a cost of faster growth. This was central to our performance in North America in 2007 where growth was slow, but margins improved. Growth in North America was also impacted by a program to discontinue partner brands. We exited private label manufacturer in Germany, we continued to rollout our slow churn technology for lower fat ice-creams, and have launched M&#xF6;venpick of Switzerland internationally as a super premium brand. In common with water, ice cream had a relatively slow summer in Western Europe. There was good growth during the year in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Next is Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition. Organic growth of 9.7% is an excellent performance, considering how close it was to its longer term target of 10%, in a year when the division was focused on making and integrating two major acquisitions, in only its second year of operating as a globally managed business. Those acquisitions, of course, are excluded from the organic growth numbers for 12 months from the acquisition completion dates.</p>
          <p>Infant and healthcare nutrition and Jenny Craig, the weight management business, were all around or above double-digit growth. Within infant nutrition, our Nestl&#xE9; NAN brand has annual sales in excess of SFR1 billion for the first time, promoting it to our billionaires' club. By geography there was double-digit growth in Americas and AOA and a good level of growth relative to the market in Europe.</p>
          <p>Next is prepared dishes and cooking aids. You will remember us saying last year that we were not satisfied with this product group's sales performance. The final quarter saw a continuation of the slight acceleration seen already in the second half of the year and it ended at 4% organic growth. Maggi continuous to perform well in Zone AOA and Latin America, the main issue in Europe is Buitoni in Italy and we have announced plans to dispose of the more commodity segments.</p>
          <p>Herta performed well in Europe with about 5% organic growth. In the U.S. the issue remains slow growth for Hot Pockets, but this reflects the lead time of new launches, which will hopefully lead to stronger performance numbers in 2008. Lean Cuisine &#x2013; Stouffer's Lean Cuisine continued its strong performance there as did Buitoni Chilled products.</p>
          <p>Confectionary is next. Organic growth was 5.3% with 3% pricing. The general theme here was that growth was strongest in dark and in tablets, particularly premium. In chocolate, the performance was strongest in Zones AOA and the Americas, in part because we continue to enjoy good growth in the BRIC countries. Britain achieved positive organic growth and had a strong performance in sugar following its introduction of real fruit juices to its product. In the UK, despite 60% fewer SKUs than in 2005, our share was maintained due to good growth from our magnificent seven brands. KitKat for example was up almost 10%. Biscuits <mark type="audio gap" /> (14.53) high single-digit growth in Latin America, its key market.</p>
          <p>Next is Petcare. Organic growth was 7% with 3.2% pricing. There were satisfactory performances in all three Zones, though Europe is somewhat slower than its strong performance in 2006. Globally, growth was driven by strategic brands, new product launches and continued improvements in product mix. Brands in the super-premium and high-premium segments performed particularly well. These include Fancy Feast, Pro Plan, ONE, Gourmet Gold and Beneful. Core premium brands such as Dog Chow and Cat Chow also generated excellent growth. Finally on the slide is Pharmaceutical products. All the constituents &#x2013; Alcon, Galderma and Inn&#xE9;ov achieved double-digit organic growth.</p>
          <p>On our next slide is the primary reporting. I will quickly cover the regional businesses.</p>
          <p>Zone Europe achieve 3% organic growth, Great Britain was the best performing of the major markets with double-digit growth continued in Eastern Europe. By product group all categories except ice cream achieved positive organic growth, with soluble coffee, chocolate and Petcare the strongest.</p>
          <p>In Zone Americas, Nestl&#xE9; USA performed well, and there was double-digit growth in Latin America, with all markets and regions contributing. By product category, shelf-stable dairy, soluble coffee and Petcare were the best performers. In Soluble coffee much of the growth in the U.S. is coming from the successful launch of Nescaf&#xE9; Classico imported from Latin America and selling into the Hispanic community.</p>
          <p>In Zone Asia, Oceana and Africa, we achieved double-digit organic growth in many of the emerging markets. Indonesia, South Asia, The Middle East and Central West Africa were particularly strong. Growth in Japan was negative due to the business model change. By product category, shelf-stable dairy, powdered beverages and culinary were the best performing.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have started measuring the performance of our popularly positioned products present primarily in Latin American and AOA. The sales were about SFR6 billion with growth in 2007 over 25%. I've already covered the other data in this slide. So let's move on to look at the billionaire brands.</p>
          <p>Buitoni and Hot Pockets are both negative to the left, or bottom of the curve. As I have mentioned before, we have launched several initiatives to improve their performance. Nestl&#xE9; brand in Ice cream is somewhat weak reflecting last year's poor summer in Europe. Otherwise our billionaire brands have performed very well from around 4% organic growth upwards.</p>
          <p>It is a great testament to the strength of these brands and the core competence of the Nestl&#xE9; organization that you have Nescaf&#xE9;, Stouffer's and Purina at about 8%, Milo at about 12%, Carnation at about 9%, Coffee-Mate about 20%. These are multi-decade brands that continue to benefit from innovation and renovation from opening new markets. New brands like Nestea, Lean Cuisine and NAN growing about 15% or more. Pure Life and Nespresso around 40%</p>
          <p>The great thing about this slide though, is that it is not just talking about history. It demonstrates the strength of our business and the momentum that we have. If you need to &#x2013; if you need a reason to believe in Nestl&#xE9;'s future, this slide is that reason. And this &#x2013; and that is true in difficult times too as this next slide demonstrates. Here you can see the cumulative trend in our pricing for food and beverage for 2007 rising from 1.8% in the first quarter to 3.1% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's enough on sales. Let's move to the EBIT progression from 2006 to 2007. On the next slide, you can see the key elements of the income statement in basis points. In total, our cost of goods sold increased by 10.6% to SFR45 billion. That increased our base to a 9.2% increase in sales and leads to a 60 basis points increase in cost of goods. This impact includes our efficiency program, Operational Excellence 2007, which saved us about SFR1 billion.</p>
          <p>This shows clearly the impact of input cost pressures on our business in 2007. It is also a significant change from the first half year and is inline with our statement then, that we expected about two-thirds of the 2007 impact on raw material inflation to hit us in the second half.</p>
          <p>Distribution costs increased by 10 basis points, mainly due to faster than average growth of some of the more distribution intensive businesses. This result is quite an improvement from the first half year number. This is a reminder on that, in the first half, we had impact for the first time of the inclusion of Jenny Craig, which is distribution intensive. For the second half we were lapping (20.49) Jenny Craig's inclusion in the second half of 2006.</p>
          <p>Our marketing costs increased about SFR1.5 billion or 5.5% of sales, sufficient to support strong volume growth. Media spend was maintained at approximately the same percentage of sales. There were continued improvements in the efficiency of our trade spend. Also it is clear that as we increase the percentage of our sales that are not going through major retail channels, well as a result of growth in PPP, Nespresso, foodservices, nutritional pharma, just to give some example, our total marketing spend will fall as a percentage of sales.</p>
          <p>Our administrative costs fell by 20 basis point. This included costs relating to Global Nestl&#xE9; Business Services, which we refer to as GNBS, which are establishing to further improve our efficiency in necessary, but non-value added services through shared service centers and outsourcing, as well as the creation of Nestl&#xE9; Centers of Excellence in particular areas. The fall in admin costs as a percentage of sales is inline with a commitment made at the half year.</p>
          <p>Finally, even though the R&amp;D spend was up about SFR150 million, it fell marginally as a percentage of sales by 10 basis points. The key point here is that we have invested SFR1.9 billion in R&amp;D in 2007, and that we have an exciting pipeline of innovations.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to securing our future growth through continued necessary investment in R&amp;D and marketing to support our brands. The outcome is a 50 basis point increase in EBIT margin to 14%, achieved, despite a 10 basis point negative impact from currency translation into Swiss francs, so 60 basis points constant currency.</p>
          <p>On this slide &#x2013; on the next slide, I have shown you how I would characterize Nestl&#xE9;'s EBIT performance in 2007. Effectively, these numbers are all about growth, the value of growth and of discipline in execution. We've had significant pressure, particularly from input costs, but also from currencies. We've compensated these to a large extent through efficiencies across the business and increased discipline in such areas as SKU rationalization.</p>
          <p>We've continued to invest in growth through an appropriate increase in brand support. We've continued to focus on long-term success through an increase in commitment to R&amp;D. And we have delivered 50 basis point improvement in EBIT margin, because we have been able to leverage our skill and realize the dividends of growth. This performance is proof of excellence in execution in our markets and of the strength of our people and brands.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the Zone EBIT performance. It is good to see Zone Europe conform to a trend of improvement with a 30 basis point increase in margin. Great Britain, Germany, and the regional Petcare business were the main contributors.</p>
          <p>In Zone America, both Latin America and North America contributed to the improvement. The drives focus of improving quality of sales was beneficial in North America as has been the focus on affordability in Latin America, as well as added value in several categories.</p>
          <p>In Zone AOA, there was a 30 basis point fall in EBIT margin. There were two quite specific reasons for this. First, in Australia, there were structural issues which were significantly disruptive to a market in which 80% of food and beverage sales go through to customers. This issue impacted all suppliers.</p>
          <p>Second, in Japan, as I mentioned earlier, we are redesigning our supply chain to increase our focus on freshness of product by moving to a demand driven business model. You might recall that we have done this in the last few years in some markets in Latin America. Japan is the final market that needed to go through this process. The longer term benefits will include reduce working capital and faster launches of innovations. Shorter term however, this has had an impact on profitability in the second half of 2007.This initiative is about making a strong business better.</p>
          <p>With all the talk of raw material costs inflation. I hope you will take note of the good news in AOA. We have been able to pass on the necessary pricing and achieve the necessary efficiencies to compensate the extreme inflation in raw materials particularly milk.</p>
          <p>This is reflected in the fact that excluding Oceana and Japan, the Zone's EBIT margin would not have fallen. The Australian and Japanese situations were one-off. Fluctuation in raw material costs are an ongoing business reality. Nestl&#xE9; has proven that it has the skill sets, the business models, the brands, and market positions to continue to deliver in tough raw material environments.</p>
          <p>Moving to Nestl&#xE9; Water, the margin decline of 50 basis point. The main issues here were poor growth in Europe, increased distribution and packaging costs. In Nestl&#xE9; Nutrition, there was an improvement in EBIT margin achieved despite the dilutive impact of the two acquisitions, Gerber and Medical Nutrition, and the related acquisition integration costs. This demonstrates that our base business is clearly performing very well and as further evidence of the benefits of the new globally managed business structure.</p>
          <p>A key element in the improvement in margins is the mix effect driven by innovation around premium brands and their strong growth. Both acquisitions were consolidated in the second half, so we will have a dilutive effect in the first half for the nutrition EBIT margin, but we nonetheless expect an excellent performance for the year as whole.</p>
          <p>Other food and beverages, which are a globally managed businesses, came in with an impressive 220 basis point improvement, basically a reflection of the performance of Nespresso.</p>
          <p>On this next slide you have the product group EBIT margins and generally a good picture. I'm not going to go through each one, but just want to draw your attention to two product groups, first dairy, including ice cream.</p>
          <p>The EBIT margin improved by 90 basis points despite input costs pressure. We've achieved a margin improvement both in dairy and in ice cream. This was a tremendous achievement by our people around the world. We talk about excellence in execution &#x2013; this is an example of just that especially in dairy business, where the cost pressures were most extreme.</p>
          <p>Our people have had to judge their pricing individually based on their own market dynamics, and also to work on managing cost from supplier to customer as well as reviewing their marketing strategies countries, where changed conditions meant that existing strategies are no longer relevant.</p>
          <p>The other product group I wanted to highlight is prepared dishes and cooking aids. The main reason for the margin decline here is the Buitoni business as was the case, but the growth &#x2013; clearly, too, we would expect that improved growth from Hot Pockets to be reflected in improved profitability.</p>
          <p>Moving back to the group numbers and on the next slide you can see the strong growth in earnings per share, which has enabled us to propose to shareholders an increase in dividend of 17.3% to SFR12.2 per share.</p>
          <p>Also of course, we launched the new share buyback program in the final quarter of 2007 and we'll be proposing to cancel shares to the value of SFR4.4 billion at this year's annual meeting &#x2013; more than the two previous share buybacks combined.</p>
          <p>The working capital performance was not as dramatic as in 2006, but still improved by 10 basis points. This is an impressive performance in a year when growth was over 9% and there was significant inflation in raw materials. Both factors put pressure on working capital and addition &#x2013; and in addition we also reduced our SKUs by 10%. Working capital management remains a focus area for the company.</p>
          <p>There was strong growth performance in terms of cash flow generation as you can see in this next slide. Operating cash flow increased by SFR1.7 billion from 11.7 billion to SFR13.4 billion, whilst free cash flow increased from SFR7 billion to SFR8.2 billion. While this is basically the reflection of the strength of our business, the divestment over the last three years of about SFR700 million of excess or idle real estate assets also contributed. This concludes my presentation</p>
          <p>To summarize, 2007 was a great year for Nestl&#xE9; with over 9% growth driven by organic growth of 7.4%. That growth created economies of scale, which together with our efficiency programs and pricing enable us to shrug off both the raw material challenge and the currency impact to deliver 50 basis point improvement in EBIT margin, 60 constant currency. That good performance was reflected also in the significant improvement in our cash flow generation, with operating cash flow up 1.7 billion to SFR13.4 billion.</p>
          <p>I want just to highlight one key point that is very relevant to our future performance. Nestl&#xE9; benefited in 2007 from first mover advantage, having already identified raw material issue before the start of the year and put in place the necessary strategies to respond to it, including early pricing action and further increasing our efficiency drives.</p>
          <p>More fundamental to Nestl&#xE9;'s ability to deliver strong results in this environment however, is the impact of the strategic transformation that has taken place over the last few years and which has created the world's leading nutrition, health and wellness company.</p>
          <p>At the same time Nestl&#xE9;'s structure has evolved from that of the classic multinational laden by its size, to a grouping of agile, focused businesses able to respond rapidly to their individual opportunities and challenges, whilst also to leverage the scale of the group for efficiencies. Nestl&#xE9; today, with the right portfolio and the structure, is unique in its industry. Differentiated from and competitively advantaged over its peers.</p>
          <p>As such its performance is more the result of delivering against its strategy and executing with discipline, and less the hard stage of raw material volatility and economic trends. Nestl&#xE9; combines the ability to be an engine for profitable growth in good times with the defensive qualities to perform in more difficult periods, as demonstrated in 2007. For 2008, the opportunities that Nestl&#xE9; has, the momentum in its business, and the strategies it is pursuing outweigh the cost pressures and the economic challenges it is likely to face.</p>
          <p>The group is therefore again well placed to deliver an improvement in EBIT margin constant currency, and to achieve organic growth in line with its target of 5 to 6% making 2008 another year of delivery of the Nestl&#xE9; model.</p>
          <p>We believe that delivery of the Nestl&#xE9; model, as well as the impact of the 25 billion share buyback program will deliver strong earnings per share in 2008, and contribute to the creation of outperforming long-term shareholder value.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your patience. Let's go to Q&amp;A and Roddy is here too.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning, all. Congratulations first on the excellent results. Two questions if I may. Could you give us a bit more guidance on the outlook with respect to the splits in your outlook statement of 5 to 6% sales guidance? What is your feeling with respect to real internal growth versus pricing in '08? What kind of pricing actions have you already taken in '08? And the second point is on input pressures for '08. We saw a 60-basis-points impact in '07. What are your expectations specifically for the first half of '08 or for the full year? And my last question is on the nonallocated spending. I've witnessed that you were able to improve that year-on-year by ten basis points to 160 basis points through sales in '07. Do you foresee further improvements in the nonallocated side for '08? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the question of pricing and organic growth, we have provided guidance with respect to organic growth of 5 to 6% and we would not provide any change in the mix, but just to tell you we are highly confident that we can continue to deliver against our commitment. Just to remind you however that the pricing we introduced during the course of last year and you've seen on the chart the quarterly buildup. The last quarter effects would likely flow into 2008.</p>
          <p>With respect to input cost, we basically expect that the same impact for 2007 will continue into 2008. And it is our expectation, as we had done in 2007, to continue to manage the impact with a bundle of initiatives including of course the continuation of our Operational Excellence program.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question on unallocated spending, these are fixed costs that are not allocated to the business. And as we clearly demonstrated in our 2006 &#x2013; 2007 performance, and as you rightly referred to it, previous years, we continue to get the benefit of economies of scale and to implement measures to increase the productivity of our people.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; good morning. Just following up what you just said there, Roddy. The same increase in Swiss franc terms: does that mean a lower percentage increase in terms &#x2013; in raw material costs would be my first question. And secondly you indicated Project Excellence had delivered, I think you said, in excess of SFR1 billion savings in '07. With GLOBE running through &#x2013; the impact of GLOBE running through the business, do you expect a higher level of cost savings in 2008 from comparable programs, and are you able to give any sort of quantification of what we might expect from cost savings in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would answer the last question first. We continued our Operation Excellence program, and every year you would have experienced or you would have noticed that we continue to achieve more and more relative to our topline evolution. We &#x2013; our target next year is not lower than what we have experienced this year. On the commodity cost issues, we are focus &#x2013; as we are guiding 5 to 6% increase in topline sales. So I would say the same basic impact relative to 2007 or relative to sales in 2008 is what we are expecting and what we are managing to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you able to quantify that at all in terms of overall commodity cost increases in '07 and as a percentage or in Swiss franc terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say that the &#x2013; when you look at the commodity costs, the agriculture commodities and packaging, we &#x2013; the impact in 2007 was about 2.2% of sales, but we have been able to offset that basically by two areas. One is the change in the mix as a business and secondly, our savings in the Operational Excellence program.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I have one final question? You see the performance in Nespresso seems to grow more strongly the bigger it gets. I mean, do you expect any sort of blip in that performance as we go through &#x2013; I think the patent on the capsule is due to expire in 2011. Is that something that we should be concerned about at all?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we continue to invest &#x2013; to grow in Nespresso and you have seen the results continue to build month-after-month, year-after-year, and we don't expect to see any material change from its direction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could you just talk a little bit about ice cream? I am particularly interested in how things went in Europe. I mean, clearly the weather wasn't great and you obviously had some strong input price inflation. So maybe you could talk about sort of the combination of volume and value evolution within Europe, and ditto in North America. And market shares &#x2013; market share development in both regions. That would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I'll start with North America. Basically, what we have been doing is a continuation of the strategy that we've been talking about now for the last, I suppose, two years, 18 months. We have &#x2013; you'll remember that in the old days Dryers was always a terrific performer in terms of topline, and rather less exciting in terms of bottom line. We've been trying to improve the balance between the two, which has effectively meant that we have focused on improving our quality of sales and thus our return on those sales. Part of that strategy has also been to cease the distribution of what we call partner brands, brands that are owned &#x2013; that are not owned by us. And clearly, as you do that, that has a quite negative impact on the volume, albeit that it again also helps the profitability. I haven't got a share number for you in North America, but the shares are going up &#x2013; or have gone up. I hope they will continue to go up.</p>
          <p>In Europe, clearly we had a weather issue. The good news is that we have launched M&#xF6;venpick Switzerland internationally and that's going well, though it's early days. We continue to benefit from the rollouts of some of the innovations that we've launched in North America, and we are seeing good growth in the emerging markets. The innovation in Europe is very successful and effectively you could think of it as North America being the world's biggest test market, because we launched innovations there, they're successful. We launched in them Europe and they were also successful. So, I mean despite the weather, we achieved a good improvement in the ice cream margin and I think that hoods well (43.25) for performance in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the profitability of the ice cream businesses in aggregate is something that was flagged as an issue over the medium to long haul going back a few years. Could you give us some indication of how that's doing now in Europe versus where you were pre the U.S. acquisitions?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Better than it was. Just coming back to the pricing. I mean, Dairy is not as &#x2013; or milk is not as big a ingredient in ice cream as perhaps you imagine that it is, but then we had positive pricing; we didn't have anything like double digit pricing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes; good morning. My &#x2013; congrats as well, with the result looks better than expected. Basically I just have a couple of questions. The polling you did of the analysts ahead of the result came in at a 30-basis-point improvement in the margin for 2008 expected. Are you comfortable with that consensus expectation? That's my first question. Second question is on the potential split of those improvements &#x2013; any margin improvements we see this year, should we just assume again some slight pressure on the gross margin, i.e., nothing coming out of that line and continued saving at the marketing line? And as a follow-up, how long can you keep cutting into trade spend? Obviously you are still a long way from being overwhelmingly non-trade-driven. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I just want to deal with the issue you raised on trade spending. First of all, as we noted here, our total marketing investment increased by SFR1.5 billion last year. So in other words if you take the bundle of our marketing cost, which includes trade spend advertising and marketing support, we have increased by SFR1.5 billion. Our trade spending is &#x2013; the result of trade spending is a combination of channel mix and efficiency of negotiations for the various product categories. I would say that what we experienced in 2007 was more benefits in the efficiency of trade spending, whereas we maintained, virtually as a percentage of sales, our fixed marketing investment in support of our brands. It is not our intention to starve our brands; it is our intention to invest to grow our brands, not only in marketing but also in R&amp;D. But we will continue to drive for efficiency in our trade spending dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the consensus for 2008, yeah, we are broadly happy with the consensus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are happy &#x2013; I will refine that. We're happy with the consensus. In case you wonder what broadly means, we are happy with the consensus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I wonder if I could just &#x2013; so is my assumption correct then that there won't be any improvements at the gross profit line? It would be more improvements continued going on in marketing or &#x2013; all I am trying to do is get a feel for this, the input cost pressures because we saw Peter Brabeck a few weeks ago saying we are not so fussed any more. But you seem to saying actually, we still &#x2013; we expect a similar impact, you mentioned, 2.2% of sales this year as well. But it just seems &#x2013; it doesn't quite seem to ring with what Peter Brabeck was saying a couple of weeks ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what I can is that the way we approach the management of the evolution of the business is taking a total approach, total performance approach. So if there are impacts on commodities or packaging, we find ways through leveraging scale and through centers of scale and skill to find ways to eke out increasing efficiencies in the operation as a whole rather than focus on one or two lines in the P&amp;L. Because as you say &#x2013; as you see in 2007, our cost of goods went up, but overall managing the business as a &#x2013; with a total performance mindset, we were able to deliver 50 basis points improvement in margin, or 60 basis points in constant currency. So that's the way we manage the company.</p>

Jim, I know you've only been in the job a few months now, but I'm just wondering if you'd thought any more about that, maybe reverting to a &#x2013; getting rid of that with regards to reporting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Jim, good morning Roddy. It's Warren Ackerman here at Dresdner. Couple of things. On the cash flow, first of all, there was a very nice improvement in both the operating cash flow and also the free cash flow, I just wondering whether you could perhaps walk us through the key drivers of that improvement &#x2013; I know you have touched on working capital, but perhaps a bit more sort of where &#x2013; what happened to CapEx, et cetera. And then secondly, just going back to commodity cost issue, I mean, Jim, would you be able to maybe walk us through in a bit more detail, some of your key commodities, the trends that you are seeing, I'm thinking about dairy costs for example, I know that Nestl&#xE9; has said in the past, that you'd expected a SFR1.5 billion increment in dairy costs in '08, up to SFR7.5 billion. I think that's what you've said on record. Could you actually tell us whether that's still the case and perhaps walk us through some of the other key commodity changes? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me focus on the commodities. On dairy we are about, I would say, just over a billion cost impact. And then...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And for '08, I mean, the 1.5 billion increment in dairy that you've been flagging in the past, given lower skimmed milk powder prices, does that look a bit &#x2013; a bit conservative now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that we expect dairy to stabilize, but the total commodity mix as you are noticing is changing, but &#x2013; and therefore the overall impact will be much in line with what we have experienced in 2007.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>And the cash flow in '08 fundamentally just reflects the increase in the profitability. The only thing that is in there that is sort of, I suppose, sort of one off is the HADM (53.11) payment from the first half of the year that you already know about. That's a non-cash impact, but it's just effectively reflecting a good operating performance.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Sure, okay. Just perhaps one other, I think Jim you said on the call that your SKUs were &#x2013; I think you said down 10% in the year. Can you perhaps just clarify that, and I think also in the past you've talked about a sort of big drive to reduce your legal entities across the group just in terms of how that's going and whether we should expect to see any further improvement in both SKUs and legal entities into '08?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I would say simplification through the ongoing reduction of legal entities remains one of our priority. We've had &#x2013; we made good progress in 2007. On SKU, yes, we did reduce our SKUs by 10%. And we will continue to drive that further in 2008. Working capital remains a focus for the company.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Can I just come back to the trade spending efficiencies as you, I think to be also made reference in your comments to structural changes to the mix of the business which will bring down the cost of trade &#x2013; effective cost of trade spend as a percentage of sales going forward. Was that a material factor which contributed in '07? And should we expect that to be a meaningful factor, as we think about 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I could tell you &#x2013; as I said in the conference call in the first part of our discussion. The growth in PPP, which is &#x2013; the business today is about 6 billion, 25% growth rate experience. Nespresso growing at 40%, food services now a major focus, nutrition and pharma are examples of businesses that are done outside of the traditional channels. So, yes, there is a change in the mix of the business. So, that in itself will reduce your trade spending. At the same time, we are trying to &#x2013; based on different product categories, in terms of the mix, the different levels of trade spending, but &#x2013; so &#x2013; essentially, the focus is how do we get better value for trade spending, given the growth rates that we have experienced. So, yes, the focus on trade spending efficiency remains as a priority for our business people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any sense of how much of the 90 basis points just represents structural change in your business as against sort of literally better negotiating of &#x2013; towards your trade spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say a significant part of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, just in terms of the wider environment as you putting price increases through, I mean, you made a couple of references to trading down to the commodity end, versus &#x2013; that your premium businesses are still performing very well, are there any areas of your business where you seeing any significant impact from trading down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Other than moving to &#x2013; in some regions to &#x2013; Nestl&#xE9; Ideal in the dairy area, we have not experienced any trading down. As a matter of fact, what we have been able to do over the years is to built our PPP business, which allows us to deliver nutritionally enhanced products in convenient packaging at a price points that are affordable to the population at large.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just add something. This &#x2013; on this marketing spend issue that people keep referring to &#x2013; can I just remind you there is a significant fixed cost element in there, so clearly if our top-line is growing 9%, you're going to have significant efficiencies coming through in that line. This should be good news. We are managing our fixed costs, they are fixed.</p>
          <p>On the &#x2013; just on this &#x2013; the PPP thing, we told you that there is 25% growth in PPPs in affordable products this year. It's the first year we've measured it and of course, what we don't know, and to Julian's point, maybe there is trading down from other products into our PPP products and so the 25% number is being helped by inflation in agricultural costs. We don't know that, because as I said, it's the first year we've measured it. The other thing that we are seeing and we talked about this before, in milk, as you know these are powdered milk products, they are not fresh milk products and you do see consumers at the low end either using less milk in their glass of milk or giving their children milk only at weekends as treats or whatever, as a way of saving money. So you do &#x2013; we do see a slowing in consumption in that category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks &#x2013; thanks, Roddy. . I wasn't trying to suggest bad news by the way.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you refer to the category you will notice in 2007 in spite of the price increase we still experienced very good RIG relative to the previous year and in some markets it's a lot more significant too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank very much. Our next question comes from the line of Arnaud Langlois from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning gentlemen and congratulation for the numbers. Just a few quick questions. The first one on the pet food business, I was really impressed by the margin expansion you reported this year given what's happening in the grains market. Could you tell us basically how you manage the inflation in costs, which must be pretty substantial given what we see as far as wheat and corn price are concerned. And how you expect consumers to react given the inflation that we need to see from the &#x2013; in the categories?</p>
          <p>The second question is related to your tax rate. We have seen I think substantial decline in the second half tax rate. Could you give us some guidance for 2008 since that you ended the year with tax rate close to 25%. I think your long-term guidance was around 27, but clearly was it just a one-off we had in 2007? And maybe just a last point, I mean, given the turbulence we have in the financial markets and given the rising cost of credit &#x2013; have your views have changed concerning cash returned to shareholders? I mean you obviously reconfirmed this morning your target. But I know you had in mind to basically return SFR25 billion in the rest of short timeframe and probably ahead of a schedule. I mean is there any change to &#x2013; in terms of your thinking due to the turbulence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just deal with financial markets issues. No, we have no plans to change our share buyback program. We've said at the time of the announcement that it would be done evenly over a three year period and we're sticking with that program. As you will notice, we started a bit earlier. We already started in 2007. With respect to the overall financial markets, I must say that we do not have any exposure to any of the credit risks that are being announced frequently. We &#x2013; today we are able to fund our operations at rates that are no less favorable than we were able to do when we were AAA. So we are &#x2013; we have a good experience in that area as lenders move to high quality borrowers and surely Nestl&#xE9; is a high-quality borrower and we are getting the benefits of that. So, in spite of the credit crisis and some of the issues with particular assets in the industry, our experience has been very good to date and we don't see any particular exposure. And therefore we have no intention of adjusting our share buyback program at this time.</p>
          <p>On the tax rate, the tax rate was done, because of primarily two reasons. The mix &#x2013; the changing mix of our business and also some creative tax measures by Alcon in order to further improve its position. I would say in a longer term our guidance would be around 27%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Petcare, the margin improvement in Petcare is really driven by mix improvement. And particularly in Europe, you will remember that we &#x2013; we are coming from a somewhat low base in Europe. We were primarily a wet business. We have moved that business increasingly into the dry area and very much into single serve premium and high premium brands. So, we're seeing a terrific improvement in the European business. The North American business as you know is already profitable at a very high level. And we are not expecting to see that necessarily grow much more intensive profitability. It will continue to grow obviously in terms of topline. And there is also an improvement in the emerging markets. In terms of the actual commodity effect, we did take pricing quite early in '07 and we've taking some more pricing in '08. So, we are managing that too.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Zuricher Kantonalbank. Good morning Jim, good morning Roddy. Could you share your expectations for Latin America and Asia for 2008 bearing in mind the slowdown of the U.S. economy? Do you expect a slowdown from Nestl&#xE9; in these regions? And secondly, could you share your views on the chocolate price fixing probe in several countries? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Patrik. First of all, we just told you that we continue to drive towards achieving the Nestl&#xE9; model, 5 to 6% organic growth and continuing improvement in our EBITDA margin. We don't see any reason at this time to change that, so we remain committed to delivering the Nestl&#xE9; Model. On the price fixing issues, it's a matter we cannot discuss. All I must say that &#x2013; all I would say is that we are cooperating with the various authorities that have raised the issue. And our &#x2013; as a company, our commitment is to be compliant with the rules and regulations and laws around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, I mean, in Latin America, specifically, I mean I think what we say about that the group applies there too. We do have a fantastic business in Latin America. We are pursuing our own strategies, whether as PPP, Nutrition, Health and Wellness, increasing our distribution &#x2013; our owned distribution to get close to the consumers. We are seeing terrific growth in that part of the world. And we don't see any reason for that to be impacted by what may happen in the U.S. And in fact, Peter this morning &#x2013; Peter Brabeck this morning on &#x2013; I think it was on Bloomberg was saying that he didn't believe there would be a U.S. recession. But even if there was, we would continue to perform well because of the strategies that we are pursuing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Question for Jim. In the press release, there is a comment that says the strategic re-orientation of the business is largely complete. Can you just give us any color that you can on where you think you still need to build the business through M&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the reference was to the strategic transformation of the group towards a Nutrition, Health and Wellness company. I think we have all the elements of the framework of that transformation in place. Our challenge now or the opportunity is to build on the businesses that we have acquired, and also to continue to drive the transformation through R&amp;D and value added. So we don't see any need for any major acquisition to add to what we've already have done in the recent times &#x2013; in recent years, more particularly last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi; morning. I just had a question on your admin cost line. I think you said &#x2013; or Jim, your predecessor said, at the H1 stage, it was underperforming the group's expectations. It looks like there has been quite a lot of efficiency improvement in the second half. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether there is still quite a bit more to come there. And if I can I just have a second question on your ongoing sales growth target of 5 to 6%, I mean, you just commented that the transformation is complete in terms of your migration of the portfolio to Health, Wellness, Nutrition products and how those should accelerate topline growth. And I guess given the outperformance of that range over the last few years, should you not perhaps think about nudging that target up? I appreciate your &#x2013; it's early for you in that role, but I was just wondering where you stood on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question &#x2013; admin cost -not only admin, but all our fixed cost structures and the way we operate the business, as I said, we continue to drive for operational efficiencies. Now with GLOBE in place, we can now create centers of excellence to capture on the skill set and the scale economies. So we will continue to see efficiencies in our &#x2013; particularly in our fixed cost structures. On the guidance on sales, we have &#x2013; over the last ten years, we are now operating towards the top end of our range and therefore we don't see any need to change that at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Can I just ask one last question on Hot Pockets? It's one of your few recent acquisitions which doesn't appear to be performing as well as you might have hoped. Is that an issue of execution? Is it the business is somewhat misaligned to the consumer health trends or &#x2013; I mean what's going on over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've introduced some new products, some reformulations, to reposition the products. It's too early to tell, but we are encouraged and we are quite confident with the renovation that has taken place in the product segment will be positive. But we still have some time to go.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sure those of you on the previous calls will remember, Paul Polman saying that he enjoyed having an underperformer in terms of sales growth. As you know Paul is now running Zone Americas. So I'm sure he will also enjoy sorting out the underperformer that we have in terms of sales growth. Just &#x2013; on the Nestl&#xE9; Model, can I just remind you, I mean, it's 5 to 6% organic growth every year combined with the sustainable improvement in EBIT margin. It's not just about delivering 5, 6% organic growth. It's about combining it with the annual improvement in the EBIT margin. Doing the organic growth by itself is easy and lots of companies maybe can do that, doing both together is what makes it special and then, of course, also improving our capital efficiency at the same time. Okay, I think we only have time for one more question. I am sorry about that, but we thought with such good numbers there'd be fewer questions than there are, but let's just take one last question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim. Good morning, Roddy. Alain Oberhuber with MainFirst Bank. Thank you for having the last question. About &#x2013; when we talk about private labels, do you see any threats currently in Europe, I remember three sessions 2002 we had these threats. Have we seen it in the second half of 2007 or isn't it an impact on that side? Secondly, could you elaborate a little bit on the water business, different brand shares, San Pellegrino and Perrier, but also on the North American and on the volume water business (1.12.30)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On private label, no, we don't see any threat of private label, so that's our response to that question. On the water business, in our brands, our international brands like San Pellegrino continue to do very well. The problem, the challenge we had in the water business last year was primarily a European one and we're continuing to work hard to fix it. Our focus this year is to try and find a solution to our HOD business in Europe.</p>
