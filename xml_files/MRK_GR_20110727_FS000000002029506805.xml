        <plist>
          <p>Good day, and welcome to the presentation results Merck KGaA Q2 2011 conference call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joshua Young, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to Merck's second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. My name is Joshua Young, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations for Merck. Joining me on today's call are Karl Kley, Chairman of the Executive Board; and Matthias Zachert, Chief Financial Officer of Merck. Additionally, Bernhard Kirschbaum, Head of Research and Development for Merck Serono, will be available to participate during the Q&amp;A session of the call.</p>
          <p>I'd like to begin on the first slide by reminding you that we will be making forward-looking statements on the conference call today. Please review our disclaimer about the risks and uncertainties of such statements on Slide Number 2.</p>
          <p>Also note that our guidance is related to current business conditions and our outlook as of today July 27, 2011. We undertake no obligation to update this guidance prior to our Q3 earnings conference call on October 26, 2011.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide. As part of the agenda for today's call, Karl will provide a broad overview of our second quarter performance, while Matthias will summarize the details of our financial results, and update our guidance for 2011. After our formal remarks we will conduct a Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn the call over to Karl.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us here this afternoon. I'm happy that today Matthias, sitting next to me, as you know he joined Merck as the Chief Financial Officer on June 1, and this is Matthias' first conference call as the CFO. With this last appointment on our board, the new Merck management team has now officially and completely come together.</p>
          <p>Our ambition is clear: drive change and create value. Over the past weeks and months, we have begun the process of defining opportunities to deliver on this ambition.</p>
          <p>The first outcome of this assessment has led to changes in our Pharmaceuticals business. We have implemented a new R&amp;D structure, and in addition, created the role of a Chief Commercial Officer in Merck Serono. Consumer Health Care, we have announced today a new CEO to improve value creation in this division as well.</p>
          <p>I believe that these management changes demonstrate that we are truly committed to change. It needs to be understood, however, this change process is not a question of days or weeks or months, but rather a few years.</p>
          <p>This is not only about changes at the executive management ranks. The change process will be cascaded down to the next levels of management. This is also not only about the changing the organization and changing processes. We are looking at our effectiveness. We are looking at our cost structure, and we are committed to make a difference. We will keep you informed in our change process as we go on.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to move to Slide Number 4 to the quarterly numbers. From a top line perspective we generated revenues of &#x20AC;2.56 billion in Q2, an increase of 16% over last year. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestments and changes in foreign exchange, we reported organic revenue growth of 5.1% in the quarter. All four divisions contribution to this performance.</p>
          <p>From an operational perspective, we generated modest performance during the quarter. In Q1, we benefited positively from changes in forex. We saw this trend reverse in Q2. Changes in exchange rates had a negative effect on our profitability, and reduced our revenue growth by 3.1%.</p>
          <p>The quarter was also highlighted by &#x20AC;368 million of one-time charges, which reduced our reported number and resulted in a reported loss for the Merck group during Q2. Matthias will talk about these one-time costs later on in more detail. Stripping out these mostly cash neutral items, the group generated an underlying core operating result of &#x20AC;548 million, an increase of 9%.</p>
          <p>To Slide 5. Performance Materials reported organic revenue growth of 1.4%. We experienced solid volume growth for Liquid Crystals. Market share gains in VA and IPS technologies were the primary drivers of this volume growth.</p>
          <p>As expected and communicated in Q1, we began to see increasing competition in the PS-VA portion of our LC business, resulting in our market share gradually moving lower in this technology. Despite this change in product mix, our overall margin of the Liquid Crystals business remains very healthy.</p>
          <p>Turning to Pigments. The earthquake in Japan damaged our plant in Onahama, and affected production of Xirallic pigments for automotive coatings. However, the resulting volume loss was balanced by higher prices, and our ability to sell existing inventory of the product. Our Pigments business has stabilized now as we resumed producing Xirallic in June.</p>
          <p>Adjusted for one-time charges, the division's underlying operating profit in Q2 declined 10% to &#x20AC;152 million, representing profit margin of approximately 41%. This is down only slightly from the margin in Q2 '10. This was a very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>Merck Millipore delivered solid organic revenue growth of 4% in the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. As a reminder, this organic revenue growth only reflects legacy Merck assets. The division experienced slowing demand from academic customers for both Lab Solutions and Bioscience products, and this was mainly due to the diminishing effects from the stimulus packages that were put in place by governments over the past few years.</p>
          <p>In Process Solutions, we continued to see healthy levels of monoclonal antibody and vaccine production. The integration of Merck and Millipore continues to progress positively. However, any time that you spend on integration work you do not spend with the customer, which of course has led to a more modest performance in some of our businesses. Having said that, I'm confident that Merck Millipore will remain an exciting growth story over the next several years, despite a slightly softer Q2 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to Slide 6. Merck Serono delivered organic revenue growth of 6.4% driven by good performance in most key franchises. This organic revenue growth is a bit inflated by &#x20AC;50 million of sales that are pulled from the second quarter into the first quarter of 2010 due to the ERP conversion of our U.S subsidiary in Serono. Of this amount, the &#x20AC;50 million, &#x20AC;42 million were related to Rebif.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for this effect, Rebif was roughly flat in the second quarter, and was in line with our expectations. Erbitux, though, faced competitive headwinds and reported unsatisfactory results in Q2. Emerging markets were the division's growth driver, delivering healthy double digits top line growth. Adjusted for the one-time charges, Merck's Serono's underlying core operating result came in at &#x20AC;310 million or roughly flat with Q2 of last year.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health Care reported solid organic top line growth of 4.2% driven by good performance of our power brands in Europe. The division suffered from operation distribution problems in last year's second quarter, which creates a favorable year-over-year comparison. As a result, growth of the underlying core operating results of &#x20AC;9 million in Q2 is a nice improvement.</p>
          <p>On Slide 7 I'd like to provide some additional details about our Merck Serono performance, beginning this Rebif. The key message on Rebif is that we are actively defending this franchise. We have confidence that our revenue streams will be resilient this year, despite the growth challenges the product will inevitably continue to face. We expect Europe to perform well in 2011 based on solid underlying volume growth.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. business will benefit from a 9.6% price increase implemented in June. Emerging markets will remain solid. Overall, we expect Rebif to generate less organic sales for the full year 2011.</p>
          <p>In order to actively defend this strong franchise against increasing competition, we are pursuing a series of initiatives. As announced the end of June, we submitted an application for an indication extension of Rebif in Europe to treat patients with clinically isolated syndrome. This submission was based on the results of the REFLEX trial showing that Rebif significantly delayed the progression of the disease in this group of patients, which represent about 10% of the overall MS patient community.</p>
          <p>In parallel, we continue to focus on bringing new device and formulations to a broader market. On the interferon products, we have a differentiated position with our devices which should help us to sustain market since these devices have a compelling value proposition for patients.</p>
          <p>I would like to move on to Slide 8, and to Erbitux. Organic sales were down 2% primarily driven by a weaker business in Japan. Ongoing strong competition in this geography, as well as a slowdown from a label change of Erbitux in Japan, and requiring KRAS testing of patients prior to treatment with Erbitux based on revenues.</p>
          <p>In addition, cost containment measures had an impact on the European market, leading to generally challenging market conditions. Taking all this into consideration, we now expect low single digit organic sales growth for Erbitux in 2011.</p>
          <p>We presented further prospectively captured and post-calculated data from REFLEX trial in July showing that addition of Erbitux to a combination of Cisplatin and Vinorelbine in first-line chemotherapy improved overall survival by 2.4 months in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with high EGFR expression compared to chemotherapy alone.</p>
          <p>While this promising data further confirmed the role of EGFR expression with a new predictive biomarker in the treatment of this cancer, a high risk still remains, of course, regarding the outcome of the decision process from EMA on our submission to get marketing authorization for Erbitux in this indication.</p>
          <p>To summarize on Slide 9, we took further actions to sharpen the focus in Merck Serono's pipeline. Based on the feedback we received at the end of review meeting with the FDA in May, we discontinued the global regulatory process for Cladribine tablets, since additional data from three ongoing clinical trials, ORACLE MS, CLARITY EXTENSION and ONWARD, are unlikely to address the regulator's requirement.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we decided to discontinue the clinical development program for IMO-2055 following a re-evaluation that was triggered by an increase of side effects observed in a Phase Ib trial assessing the clinical benefits of a combination of IMO/Erbitux in chemotherapy. Finally, we discontinued the development program for Erbitux in metastatic triple negative breast cancer. The data released from the Phase II study BALI-1 at end of last year didn't meet the primary endpoint.</p>
          <p>I would like finally to move to Slide Number 10. And as mentioned at the beginning, we have started to cascade management changes really down from the executive board level, and here are a few of the most recent changes: Bel&#xE9;n Garijo joining us from Sanofi. He'll continue to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of Merck Serono's commercial organization; Annalisa Jenkins coming from Bristol-Myers to focus on building a high-class development organization and strengthening our partner; Jim Hoyes, up to now Head of Sales and Marketing in EMD Serono has become the new President; Udit Batra joins us from Novartis, and he will ensure that our Consumer Health Care business is profitably and sustainably growing. Finally, Piotr Bednarczuk, coming from Aon Hewitt will be in charged with improving the efficiency of the HR organization, and helping to drive cultural change.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, I'm quite happy as the new team now has gathered and has started for the change process. More results will follow.</p>
          <p>And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matthias. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome from my side as well. And I will start with Slide Number 12. Please understand that we will focus on the following key pages on the key elements, and will not read line by line the P&amp;L for you, so this might be a slight change to the past.</p>
          <p>On Page Number 12, I would like to convey the two key points that you should take note of. The first one is currency. We have seen in the second quarter a quite substantial impact on the P&amp;L on the top line on royalties, but also in the gross margin driven by currencies. And we've assessed that in the last three weeks in detail, and for the first time I understand we provide currency sensitivities to you that should help you analyzing especially the volatilities in the business Merck Serono and Liquid Crystals or Performance Materials that are notably impacted by currency sensitivities.</p>
          <p>So on Page 27, please reconsider the data that we provide here, and the implication that a &#x20AC;0.01 change will have on P&amp;L bottom line and the same for the Swiss franc.</p>
          <p>The second point I would like to comment on are the special costs or one-time charges that we took in the second quarter. And here I would like to go to Chart Number 13 to explain them in further detail.</p>
          <p>Please take note of the fact that we've even given a further level of granularity in the appendix so that you can further look up for transparency and modeling reasons these four categories P&amp;L line by P&amp;L line.</p>
          <p>Let's come to the first one-time costs, the impairments. All-in-all we talk about &#x20AC;285 million of costs non-cash related; &#x20AC;161 relates to the Vevey plants or also known under the name Large Scale Biotech plants. Like many other biotech biological producers, Genentech and others, in 2007, a quite aggressive plan was put in place with capacities that's today due to also changes in the development program have led to overcapacities.</p>
          <p>And in the second quarter, the construction was finalized. In 2012, the plant will go on stream. But already today we know that after the construction has been finalized that basically one line that is in there will be completely idle for at least the next two to three years. This caused the triggering events that, of course, then has to &#x2013; leads to correction in the asset base and &#x20AC;161 million therefore had to be impaired.</p>
          <p>The second element is a impairment for Safinamide; which has already been addressed in 2010. Here the remaining book value of Safinamide was taken off due to slight adjustments on the market expectations, but notably on the development program, and I think it's only fair to look at it with a more realistic assessment.</p>
          <p>The additional &#x20AC;35 million Karl alluded to that's related to the project IMO that was in license from Idera in 2007 and that has now shown that it cannot work in the combination with chemotherapy, so it has been taken off. And the other element that is noteworthy is that we've adjusted in light of the developments in the multiple sclerosis area over the last six to 12 months, we've adjusted the amortization period for Rebif from ten to eight years for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This led to a incremental amortization of &#x20AC;17 million. Later on you will see that this translates into round about &#x20AC;58 million for the entire year, which translates the delta between &#x20AC;285 million impairment for second quarter to &#x20AC;320 million for the entire year.</p>
          <p>As far as point two is concerned, please understand that I looked into the balance sheet as well. We have quite high inventories, and Merck does have quite high working capital, to put it mildly. So of course, a special interest was also on the duration times that we have on slow movers and corrective measures have been taken.</p>
          <p>Normally this is, of course, undergoing normal operational business, but in order to make it easier for you to understand the true operational performance, we gave the tier as a figure, as an amount taken in the second quarter books. Normally this is, of course, not an item that you adjust for.</p>
          <p>Cladribine was known since, I think, April, May, so that should not come as a surprise, and the &#x20AC;11 million leading to &#x20AC;368 million. The &#x20AC;11 million is basically for positions on businesses that have been divested in the past with simply the risk adjustments have been considered and with this, however, I think discontinued operations are dealt with. More on the details to these one-time charges can be seen on Page 25.</p>
          <p>With this, I move on to Page Number 14, and here you more see the operational developments. And in order to make it easier for you to reconcile numbers and to understand numbers, for this very quarter we are sticking to these interesting indicators called OR and Core, and then there's also ROS. And in order to make it more comparable for you, we have introduced now the like-for-like or underlying.</p>
          <p>I would like to allude to the statements that the indicators that I've just mentioned that were used in the past are likely to change because instead of having OR, Core and ROS and everything with and without exceptional, we are currently thinking about introducing one indicator and then with clarity on this. So this is something that I would like to indicate upfront. Let's now move to the business, Page Number 15.</p>
          <p>Here you do see that Merck Serono operated a healthy organic growth. We will come to the breakdown on products in a second. Of course, this underlying organic growth needs to be adjusted for this stocking that we had in March 2010 that led all-in-all to a lower base of round about &#x20AC;50 million. That's point number one.</p>
          <p>Point number two. You have to look at the royalties, and here we do have a big impact coming from currencies because most of the royalties are being paid in U.S. dollars, and I think you understand that U.S. dollar last year was round about 1.26, 1.27 and we are currently reporting U.S. dollar in the area of 1.20 &#x2013; sorry, 1.42 to 1.44 for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Third element I would like to state which impacted gross margin next to currencies is LSB. LSB will lead to one-time charges by quarter, LSB being this large scale biotech plant, leading to one-time hits for startup costs round about &#x20AC;10 million every quarter. And of course then from mid 2012 onwards, the business or the plant will then gradually scale up and relief on the gross margin you should see in 2013 when we basically start producing the Erbitux product in a reasonable utilization rate so that this will support gross margin slightly.</p>
          <p>With this, I move to Page Number 16 and come to the products. On Rebif, the key points please restate the development of Rebif here on the sales. The percentage numbers that you see are reported on an organic basis. I think in the past this has not been provided for, so this organic 11% is, of course, overstated due to this round about $42 million coming from the stocking effects, and the lower base in 2010.</p>
          <p>Noteworthy is that Erbitux all-in-all, except Japan, continued growing by round about 5%, whilst the organic decline stemming from Japan, and Karl has clarified that positive elements that you can read in this upgrade in labor from third line to first line, of course, leads to the mandatory KRAS testing. But of course we've also indicated that exactly in the spirit of time the competition is stepping in, taking market share, so this is a positive and a negative information at the same point in time.</p>
          <p>The other products, Gonal-f, Concor, Glucophage are doing very well in the emerging markets and has contributed very nicely in second quarter where I would say, of course, the business has had nice growth rates already in the past few years.</p>
          <p>I now turn to Page Numbers 17, and I take the liberty as a CFO to look more broader on a small business, Consumer Health Care, somewhat the step-child of Merck. The good thing that I find here is the gross margin. It's around 69%, let's say 70 percentage points. This is very healthy, and a shame that the business is operating at single digit profitability margin.</p>
          <p>I think there is room for improvement that we will now look at to yield results, improved results, as we go ahead in the next one to two years to come. The currently reported numbers are simply reflecting the change versus the utterly low base 2010 where one-time charges were lowering the base. I think you are aware of the U.K. issue with the burned warehouse and the China stocking that were reported in second quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's then move to Page Number 18. Organic-wise, the business Merck Millipore has grown by round about 4%. There is a slowdown in the academia business, and I guess the other life science technology company, tools company have already alluded to that, including Thermo Fisher yesterday, Qiagen and Germany, Netherlands has adjusted its expectations for third and fourth quarter. And also good company giving indications are the Waters company in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Other points I would like to mention on this slide are that there have been slight incremental costs for materials, raw materials, leading to burdening on the gross margin in the area of &#x20AC;3 million to &#x20AC;4 million.</p>
          <p>With this I move over to Page Number 19 and Performance Materials. And whilst the business organically increased by 1.4%, I would like to give you indication that the P&amp;L was predominantly burdened by these one-time charges, i.e. the inventory write-offs here predominantly, point one.</p>
          <p>And point two, we impaired OLED for one of the purchase patents we had because OLED simply doesn't take off as originally expected a few years ago. So this one-time impairment on OLED naturally translates also into a positive twist for Liquid Crystals because if OLED is delayed, Liquid Crystals remain in the markets.</p>
          <p>And if you blend out the one-time charges here, and if you take into consideration that in the second quarter we absorbed the divestiture of the high margin business, CropScience, we were penalized by currencies because this business is heavily impacted by currencies. We digested a gradual reduction in PS-VA, which was expected. And on top of that, the situation in Japan, I think you see that this business, this specialty chemical innovative business, is able to digest hits in the markets, currencies and others. So that was for me a positive that I took out of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Slide Number 20. People that know me know that I like good balance sheets, and the balance sheet has further strengthened in the last three months, six months notably versus December 2010.</p>
          <p>So overall, the de-leveraging of the company continues, and of course, this is an element that should be part of our equity story in the next 12 months to further deleverage the balance sheet, and therefore minimize the cost of carry as the bonds that are out there in 2012 will naturally mature and then we can pay them back in early next year and end of next year. And therefore, the cost of carry automatically will less burden the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Page 21 gives you an overview on the cash generation, and that is one thing that is healthy and we consider this to remain healthy as we go ahead. And we've adjusted here the underlying free cash flow for the proceeds that we received in notably the first quarter from the Th&#xE9;ramex and CropBioScience divestiture.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Page Number 22. I would like to comment on the guidance in the following way with the four statements. Please take note of the fact that the previous guidance that you had on the Street that was given in February this year was a guidance with a euro/dollar cross rate of 1.26. Currencies have changed. U.S. dollars has changed. Swiss franc has changed, further strengthened and therefore it's natural that we adjust the guidance for simply business development, technical reasons, currencies.</p>
          <p>And the growth ratios that you see here for the divisions are indications. This is for your modeling the guidance we provide on Merck Group. So let me comment on the growth rates.</p>
          <p>Merck Serono, the 1% to 2% I think is the current run rate that the business should have in the &#x2013; for the entire year. For Consumer Health Care, I'm personally more leaning towards the 6% than the 9%. The old guidance was 7% to 12% so you see a level of adjustments, but I would rather guide here towards the lower end than the higher end.</p>
          <p>The same holds true for Performance Materials. Currently, the business Performance Materials is softer in the third quarter. You have most likely heard about the panel producers that they currently destock, sorry, that they &#x2013; yes, they destock in the third quarter and market momentum gets softer with a slight improvement forecasted by panel research also for the fourth quarter. But there will be softness in Q3 in Performance Materials. Overall, however, that doesn't mean that Performance Material will do badly. They will continue a reasonable performance, as you've seen over the several last years.</p>
          <p>On Merck Millipore, the number is around 50%. I'm a little bit here guiding you or indicating that this is &#x2013; it can also be 49% or 48%, but we are shooting right now business-wise for the 50%, and now I come to the group numbers, and that is we will guide in the future on the group and try to give you indications for your modeling on the divisions.</p>
          <p>So group total revenues should increase beyond the &#x20AC;10 billion, round about in this range of &#x20AC;10 million to &#x20AC;10.4 million. Operating results, including all one-time hits, being at roughly &#x20AC;1 billion, and the Core OR being around &#x20AC;2.25 billion, of course, on an adjusted basis for the elements we have taken into second quarter.</p>
          <p>Third element, seasonality-wise, third quarter in general should be softer, and we should have an improvement versus the fourth quarter, so please do understand for the remainder of the year this is the way we would like you to think about the development for the entire divisions. And this holds true notably for Merck for Performance Materials and also for Merck Serono where always you have some kind of softening in Q3, and then normally a strengthening in Q4.</p>
          <p>Last element, again, I apologize for OR, Core and underlying. We kept that for the purpose of making numbers comparable. So on Page Number 23, you see the operating result that was previously used for the guidance setting. So we've made numbers comparable so that you can better understand where changes come from, but I clearly allude to the fact we will think about the KPIs in order to make it more clear and to somewhat come to numbers that can be understood at your end easier, at analyst level, at investor level. But I have to also say, I think it would do the company well to simplify, and that's also one target the new management team is going to pursue.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Thanks for taking the call. First of all for Mr. Zachert, clearly you've been hired as an agent of change, and when do you anticipate being able to discuss specific plans for change with the market? I think we all know you're going to do something, but when you're going to tell us is obviously unclear. And then secondly, Merck is a conglomerate with different businesses, with different growth profiles and cost of capital, investment requirements. What do you see as being the clear strategic growth drivers that you're willing to invest in versus which bits you think should be run more to maximize cash flow rather than growth? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Let me just start with the overall change plan. It is not only Matthias Zachert <mark type="ph" /> who is charged as a change driver (37:06). The same holds true, of course, for Stefan Oschmann in Merck Serono. The same holds true for <mark type="ph" /> Karl Beckman (37:15) when it comes to cultural changes and HR driven changes, but it's a management team.</p>

          <p>Apologies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, nothing to apologize. I just wanted to make it clear that what Matthias is doing he is doing in full alignment with the management board, which is driving ambitious changes going forward. And when it comes to some of the ethic I will pass on in a minute to Matthias. For the strategy process, I would like to ask you to give us some time as a board really to get together to work on the strategy and to develop our plans to give &#x2013; to communicate that thereafter. We are already in there. We have started on 1st June with an offsite meeting to set the agenda and we will communicate this concern. The more specific part I would like to pass on to Matthias' side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Andy, I think the &#x2013; I could not add anything in terms of what Karl already stated. It's always &#x2013; it has to be a team. It has to be an entire organization, and we have to ignite the willingness to change the company everywhere in the organization. And if you see the amount of announcements that the organization has now taken in the respective several divisions, not only in Merck Serono, but also at Consumer Health level, long needed, but also at corporate level, you see there is clearly the commitment to change. But it's a very traditional culture that Merck has. So it will not be a sudden revolution. It will take time, but the willingness to adjust and to make change happen, I think you see not only from the change in the management board, but basically from the sequence of announcement that followed in a very short period of time.</p>
          <p>So that's the one element. Now let's come to the strategic growth drivers. I think it would be only fair for this team now to make a really assessment where we are, where we would like to go. I know that a lot of people in the markets, including sell side, but also from the buy side now consider that we have to come out immediately with a big package and big plans. I don't think that would be serious to do, and therefore, my humble view is there are opportunities here. Of course, we need to assess them. We need to develop the conceptual approach.</p>
          <p>And then we need to have the buy-in in the organization. So I do assume that in the third quarter, from third quarter onwards up to the end of the year, we will give you more color on where Merck Serono could be in terms of organizational setup in the commercial area, organizational setup in terms of more details on how R&amp;D is going to work and potentially where we are with regard to pipeline review. So this is something that definitely Stefan will address either with Q3 or until the end of the year. We will schedule that's respectively with the capital market, and then either with full-year results or latest with Q1 we would then like to come out with where we see exactly the growth drivers and value creation businesswise one by one by the segments. And that should give you I think the answer to you and also other questions. But just bringing out a number that would be not serious, and I think this is something that the company should clearly embark on in terms of communication to the capital market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Jack Scannell, Sanford Bernstein. Two questions. First, there was talk either the last quarter or the quarter before about changing compensations scheme to the senior management moving to something that is going to be based on stock performances or shareholder return. Could you tell us when that is likely to start? That's the first question. And the second question, which has been partly answered. Clearly, you've had a look in the pipeline to the extent and written down some assets. Does that reflect the early part of a pipeline review? Or is that simply the new business as usual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack, I was talking about changing the &#x2013; or adding an element to our compensation which would be linked to the top performance. And our non-executive board is discussing models and has planned to introduce such a scheme as of January 1, 2012, which then would also be brought down to the organization so that we also have not only a link there between management compensation &#x2013; executive board compensation, management conversation there, but also linked to the stock price throughout the management levels in the organization.</p>
          <p>Second, buy plan, of course Stefan and the team is taking a very fresh look. And I think you should really take for granted that these decisions were also part of a thorough analysis and part of the buy plan review, which has started.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. A couple, if I can. You've clearly set out the dynamics for Erbitux and particularly the weakness in Japan. Could you actually give us some indication of how the revenue splits for Erbitux geographically, so we can actually understand how significant the Japanese business is and where we should see threats over time? Secondly on write-downs. I think the key question lots of people have is, are you now done? So clearly there are going to be start-up costs at Vevey, but do we anticipate that there could be further asset write-downs at that facility going forward? And then a more general question on the exceptional charges. Can you please give us some idea of the tax impact? As I understand it, you've shown us the tax impact based on the old Merck core operating result definition, but you haven't given us the tax impact on the new underlying core operating definition. And then finally a question on dividend. Clearly, Merck's dividend policy is up in the air anyway, and certainty may be not as clear to investors as they would like it to be. You've had a great deal of exceptional charges in Q2 which are going to affect reported income going forward. How is that going to impact the dividend policy? And what should its investors expect when it comes to the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matthew, fair enough. Let me take all these questions one by one. As far as Erbitux is concerned, I would not truly like to give the split on market-by-market in terms of absolute numbers. I think you have a kind of grip that Japan is an important market to us, so what we tried to provide you with is, a, that the decline that you see in the second quarter is predominantly stemming from Japan. Or it is stemming from Japan. So here we have an organic decline of 36%, which is heavy. The rest of the world grew by 5%, so with the exception of Japan, the business or the products continued to do reasonably well, but Japan did hurt.</p>
          <p>On the write-downs for the Large Scale Biotech plant, I would not expect at this point in time for all data that I'm currently looking at that the LSB would take another hit on write-downs because we have two lines there that would go online. And there is one further line for process development, but that's not the game-changer. So let me concentrate on these two lines that have been constructed for biological drugs. And one line will be used for Erbitux production as we go ahead. We so far have a kind of tolling agreements that will &#x2013; where we will reduce tolling notably from 2013 onwards. So it will lead to capacity utilization for Erbitux in this line.</p>
          <p>The other line, having the same kind of asset value of round about &#x20AC;161 million, this one we totally impaired. So as of today, I would not assume a further asset impairment for Vevey/LSB. This doesn't mean that there will be no further impairments coming. And why do I say that? We are at the start of looking at pipelines, and Karl has alluded to that. We will change and transform further the organization in the years to come, so I think we should not step away from taking non-cash charges when underlying-wise the business will improve. So one day we will most likely come out with a reduction on fixed cost structures that will lead to one-time charges. We will &#x2013; when we think about products in the pipeline, assets that are underutilized, we should not shy away from one-time charges in order to structurally improve the company. So that's what I would like to say on one-time charges.</p>
          <p>Now let's go to the underlying tax rates. The implications that you have on this particular number are high single digit euros. So we will have a certain deferred tax credit coming from this. It's in the area of &#x20AC;8 million to &#x20AC;10 million, but it's not a game changer. So that's basically the implication that you are going to see from LSB in Switzerland. The last element on divi. I think this is a little early in the process, and therefore let us work on that as we go ahead. The only point I would like to make today is through the one-time charges that we have taken in Q2, I don't think that this will lead to a lower dividend compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Merck has a, let me put it that way, interesting dividend policy that is one that we will look at in the future definitely, and it might be something that we would clarify further when we come with the overall analysis on growth drivers for the company. But let me put it like that. Merck had always a kind of humble and moderate divi policy, so this will not change completely. And I hope with this all your three questions were answered.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thank you, and good afternoon. Four questions for me, please. Firstly, would you just discuss your view on the cost base supporting Erbitux and Rebif? Clearly the competitive landscape appears to be changing for both products at a time when promotional support is arguably very, very important. So how flexible are your efforts behind these key products? Have you been increasing support behind Erbitux and/or Rebif? And are the costs therefore largely fixed at this point? Secondly, can you help us understand a little bit more about Vectibix's impact on Erbitux in Japan? Just curious if this is purely a function of price competition or there are other factors at work? Thirdly, a quick question on the pipeline. I appreciate that the start trial for Stimuvax is event driven, but curious if you would be kind enough to share with us your estimate for the timing around the second interim look? And then finally quickly on Millipore. Just curious if we could tease out the impact from the lost contract versus the slowdown from the U.S. academia customers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will just &#x2013; I just would like to make one statement on the Vectibix issues and on the Japan issue. We have to look very carefully on what has happened in Japan, and Stefan, while we speak, Stefan Oschmann is on his way and looks at the situation. But of course, Vectibix came in Japan at a time when we had the transition, also maybe when we have some operational issues. We will analyze this, and look at it as Japan.</p>
          <p>But for me, it's a Japan-specific issue. I don't see any of that spilling over. For example, Europe we have a completely different environment here. We can play with different competitors' advantage as we are in the market. We are the gold standard of Phase III data or better. So we really have a Japan issue, and not an Erbitux issue. Then I would like to ask Matthias to &#x2013; and a few words on the support issues and the Millipore <mark type="ph" /> one event (51:58).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me come to Rebif and Erbitux. Let me put it like that. I think for, a, Rebif and, b, Erbitux, we are currently on Rebif, as guided before, on a stable path. And for Erbitux worldwide we are still on a growing path, except Japan. So that's the reason why currently the cost structure here is not the one that we have on immediate eye or under the microscope at this point in time. Having said that, we are well aware that for Rebif the competitive pressure will advance, and because of that, of course, we have to consider plans. What do we do when in '12, '13, '14 changes in the market occur? Of course, this has to depend on competitive products succeeding. If they don't succeed, the situation is not that eminent, and I think the competitive oral that &#x2013; or the oral that is currently in the market is currently not taking off that well. And therefore, we clearly with have that on our radar, and will consider looking at the cost structure when we see that we need to protect the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>So I think that is the point on the cost structure for both Rebif and Erbitux. As far as the question on Merck Millipore is concerned, my guidance here would be it will impact bottom line by round about &#x20AC;10 million OP wise. We generated round about give and take &#x20AC;40 million sales in the first six months of the year. So for the remainder of the year, round about &#x20AC;10 million OP will come off.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take back for the Stimuvax question. I may be extremely short on that. I noticed there have been rumors in the market. I noticed there have been report issues using recruitment data and all these kind of things for analysis. We are really committed to wait for the data, to look at the data and once we have the data and we are ready for communication we will communicate the results. Everything else I would like to ask you to understand that I will refrain on contributing any oil to any kind of speculations as far as Stimuvax is concerned.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Just a couple of questions. First on Millipore. Could you just provide some color as to what visibility you have in that turnaround in that market that you see over the next 12 or 18 months given budget pressures seem likely to persist? And then any levers you have to offset the raw material cost increases that you are seeing? And then second just on the change agenda. I understand very clearly that the external communication will be this year, early into next year, but I wonder if you provide some visibility on whether the internal agenda is also on a similar timeframe, i.e. you need sign off from the entire management team on everything for things to start? Or given that some members have been there earlier, some parts of the business can move ahead of the communication to the market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start, Sachin, let me start with the third one and work the list of questions upward. On the business I think we have to -we should not piecemeal that. The one element that definitely we have to give some further clarity on because the team will now be complete on 1st of September will be Merck Serono. It's the biggest ship in the organization. And that is one element that we will try to give more clarity on, not in terms of costs, et cetera, but in terms of how we want to run this business and potentially the heart of the business, the R&amp;D organization and the projects that we're currently revisiting.</p>
          <p>So these elements I think you should be aware of as we go into 2012, but then in 2012, I think, as I indicated before, we will have to give you further guidance on what we want to do with our four divisions. So that will not be a piece-mealing business by business, but rather giving you heads up on pharma business in Q3 conference call or until the end of the year, and then come with a more holistic approach for the company. If it's for Q4 or with a special capital market day, I will discuss with Karl and Joshua, and then we will announce respective dates. But basically this is the targets for ourselves as we go ahead. So that's &#x2013; the third question.</p>
          <p>On the raw materials, well life science technology industries, I guess, in the room the key expert is Joshua, and he will definitely provide in the coming weeks all of you with more color on that. Let me give you my view that I have today on raw materials, and also on the business as we go ahead. For the products that are truly innovative, I think it should be clearly feasible to move under raw material cost, but we are speaking here for the quarter of round about &#x20AC;3 million to &#x20AC;4 million so that it's not too big of a number. For the pure consumables that we, for instance, have in the Lab Solutions business, sometimes you cannot move pricing that fast. So you can only gradually adjust your catalog prices and then get them passed on, but again, the magnitude we are talking about is not that huge. Bigger of a topic is definitely the academia industry.</p>
          <p>And here I think long term the academia industry, the life science technologies industry, this is the business where process-wise, so many things happen in advantage of Life Science technologies. If we go to just a simple example, which was quite interesting for me to understand. I was two days in Billerica at Merck Millipore and looked into the division Process Solutions. Process Solutions is all about biological, and not only for the prescription drugs, but equally for bio-similars on which you know they will get more momentum in the years 2017, '20 and beyond. Process Solution will fully benefit from that. So that's the reason why I would say definitely there is softness in the U.S. right now on the academia side, but generally life science technologies industry should be set for growth, and that's how we look at Merck Millipore from today. With this I think all your question, Sachin, have been answered.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Three question, if I may. The first, on the restructuring. My interpretation of this impairment is that the new management has the full commitment of the Merck family, and therefore is my view correct that the split of pharma and chemical division, which was never an option for the Merck family is still? Or is not anymore and never have an option for the first question? The second question. You said, Mr. Zachert, a further deleveraging of the balance sheet that is one of your goals. Will this be done by cash flow or by divestments as well? And the third question on the Liquid Crystals. According to several market sources, inventories of liquid crystal producers increased just recently due to a weak demand in Q3. What are your outlook for the second half demand-wise for the different Liquid Crystal products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just answer the question on the Merck family. I know that there are conceptions and interpretations out there in the market, and we will need to address this over the next months and years we go forward. But there's a management board and an executive board running this company. And we have owners, and there is a majority owner which happens to be family, and there are 30% owners which are shareholders. And we are there to run the company as a normal executive board does, and have to look for approval of our respective boards, so all investment and strategic decisions which go beyond a certain scale.</p>
          <p>So there's no family in the backyard maneuvering us. You can believe me that I would not have been able to ask Matthias Zachert to come on board if there would be any hidden agenda. But we will try to work this out over the next months here to really have you understand how this is working.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So wait for the strategic discussion. With this I pass on to Matthias.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So then, Mr. Mayer, I'm going to address questions b and c, deleveraging, clearly operational cash. Any divestiture of any of the current business from my humble vantage points would be value destruction. So definitely I think the beauty of Merck is we have a portfolio that is healthy, that is in a way diversified so that P&amp;L and cash flow should be balanced, which I think today is a value compared to the view 10 years, 15 years ago. So now we should use this portfolio to get it somewhat more energetic, streamlined, refocused, on being in the market, be competitive, drive change, drive value. It will take time. It will be bumpy. It will be rocky, but we have the stamina to go for the long-haul, and not just for the short-haul. So that's the point on deleveraging.</p>
          <p>And then for the Liquid Crystals side, I would like to clearly confirm what you have said. There was in June already clear signal, especially from Korea, not so much from Japan, but notably from Korea that the two big companies here, Samsung and LG, started stocking &#x2013; I mean, destocking their inventories that they already had. They were quite high. And that is an element that we will all also see in course of the third quarter. That's the reason why I alluded to softness in the markets on the third quarter, which however, should then marginally, gradually improve according to our current assumptions for the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the gross margin at Merck Serono, the gross margin. Can you please give us some color regarding the evolution of that line? Q2 was quite weak, at the level of the Q4 '10. Can we expect any improvement on that front? And also regarding the OLED. To what extent did you change your view on that technology? Any view regarding the sales potential? And then also the threat for the Liquid Crystals division? And also can you come back please on how &#x2013; what are the incentives for the new management, especially looking at the share price, and the fact that you cannot offer new management members any shares. So how can you really incentivize them? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take two questions coming from the back. I alluded already to my earlier statements that currently the non-executive directors <mark type="ph" /> have a committee of directors (1:05:28) are just looking at various alternatives how to design a share-linked program for the executive board. And I expect an introduction will happen as of January 2012. And we will then roll that into the management ranks of the companies so that all management has a link to the share price as an incentive as we go forward. Second, short comment to OLED. Some two, three years ago there was a real hype about OLED, and a possible threat if it even would move into what business which Liquid Crystal has been dominating.</p>
          <p>Further development has not kept pace with the hopes which were at this technology some two, three years ago. Why we still think it is possible that OLED could make its way into the display industry, it will be much later than we assumed at that time. We will continue to work on OLED, but we will not see it happening as soon as was hoped three years ago. This is true for the display industry. Of course there's an arm for OLED in lighting. We are working on that, but the current sales for the lighting are still <mark type="ph" /> Iniscula (1:06:53), and also there the lighting industry has indicated very clearly that they need further advancement on the technology side to make OLED really a breakthrough technology.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Bonjour, Vincent. I come to gross margin on Merck Serono. So here I would basically like to allude to the fact that the gross margin of Merck Serono was always somewhat in the area between 80%, especially in Q4, but normally in the area of 81% to 84%. If you now look at the annual comparison, Q2 last year versus Q2 this year, you should basically look at, a, royalties that make round about 1% of change if you adjust the royalties, as I indicated before. And the second element you need to back out is the LSB, roughly &#x20AC;10 million of it that we now have on a quarterly basis. And the remaining element is predominantly the currency implications that I tried to allude to earlier in the conference call, and please look into the assessments on Page 27 in the IR presentation, where we also give you a sensitivity on the Swiss franc.</p>
          <p>And I would like to make this a little bit more transparent. Please do understand that in Merck Serono, we have in Switzerland S&amp;A. We have R&amp;D. We have production. So we do produce Rebif, among others in Switzerland in Swiss franc. Whilst we sell Rebif in the U.S. and invoice it to the U.S., so automatically when the Swiss franc strengthens, as it has done, and the U.S. dollar weakens, we get an automatically kick, and not a positive one. And that answers you the difference on gross margin.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Peter Verdult, Morgan Stanley. Mr. Zachert, just could you remind us of the &#x20AC;1.4 billion R&amp;D budget in 2010, what was the rough split between discovery and development? And maybe could you quantify the number of R&amp;D sites Merck Serono currently has? Then just a question about your thoughts on working capital. I realize there are capital intensive businesses within the Merck group, but just as the newcomer, I'd like to get your insight as to the opportunities you see to improve rate ratios, cash flow and potential shareholder returns? And then lastly, a clarification. I think we've worked on the assumption that Erbitux in Japan is about 20% of the franchise &#x2013; of the Erbitux franchise. Is that the right sort of ballpark to be in? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me come to the two questions. On the third one, you mostly likely have to come back again because acoustically didn't get it quite well, so let me start with overall R&amp;D. The major parts in the R&amp;D costs are predominantly the R&amp;D costs of Merck Serono, which in the past has been roughly 20% on sales. So it goes without saying that this is something we will look at, and I think this is something that we have to consider as we go ahead in the future years when competition and royalties will put more pressure, of course, on ourselves. So R&amp;D is one element that we will answer.</p>
          <p>As far as sites are concerned, you might grasp from our Internet that we have basically a variety of sites. All-in-all, I've counted eight, whilst among these eight, three are bigger and that is the U.S. research site and the German research site and also the Geneva research sites. So that is what I would like to say as far as R&amp;D is concerned.</p>
          <p>On the working capital, I can clearly confirm we have a lot of working capital, and now we have to see if these ratios are justified or not. I personally am rather of the view that it offers room of improvement. But now let's take things step by step. If you go for working capital, and you have not understood the business first of all, I think you've done the wrong spin. You should first of all look at the business, understand the business drivers, business model, then the cost structure, afterwards cash flow and therefore these are elements we are looking at. There's room for improvement, but how much or if any, please give us the time to analyze that before we answer your question with numbers. And that would basically be the second question. The third one, you need to please repeat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The third one was a simple clarification. Erbitux Japan, is that about 20% of the Erbitux franchise? And just coming back to your R&amp;D question, could you give us any sense as to the split of Merck's annual R&amp;D between discovery and development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I reiterate the comment I have made before. We will not break out the oncology franchise country by country, and therefore the only feedback I can provide to you is the data that we have given before. Now on the R&amp;D setup, the clear feedback I would like to give to you is from the analysis that I have done, and of course I've not cross-checked that in detail with everybody in the organization.</p>
          <p>But we have roughly, on the R&amp;D bill in Merck Serono, roughly two-thirds in R and one-third in D. I think the precise number is 65% to 35%, and that is something that we have to address because I think in the future we have to put quite emphasis on developments, executing and on the R to basically increase the productivity that was not that very high in the past five, 10, 20 years.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions, please, for Mr. Zachert, and then one for Mr. Kirschbaum. So the first question is on Vevey. Why are you so positive that one of the two product lines will be idle for at least two to three years? Because we're going to get Erbitux gastric cancer data probably sometime late this year, and also the Stimuvax interim analysis. So I was just a little bit surprised at the timing, and why you didn't actually wait for these events to occur before impairing Vevey. Or asked a different way, will you actually write off Vevey if either Erbitux in gastric cancer or Stimuvax are positive? And my second financial question is on the group underlying core operating profit guidance you're obviously around &#x20AC;150 million below consensus in 2011. And I guess if forex rates stay unchanged, this basically implies a bit north of &#x20AC;100 million downside to consensus forecasts from 2012 onwards. Is that a fair assessment? Or would you say based on a very preliminary view of the business of the restructuring potential, and also of other underlying business dynamics, do you think that the downgrade to consensus for the coming years could be relatively minimal? And then I just want to quickly clarify on Stimuvax. The interim analysis, is this the second interim analysis? And when did the first one actually take place? And also there was some talk about ancillary studies to start that are still recruiting. And I was just wondering exactly what those studies are and what the relevance to the overall filing package is? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me take the first two, and I think Mr. Kirschbaum, should give some color on studies running right now. So on the fixed cost structure, I would like to come again back to Peter. I answered on the R&amp;D on the fixed cost structure, so of course, the variable you have to adjust for, so the answer was on fixed cost 65%, 35%. Now let's come back to the question that you have raised, Marietta, on the product and Vevey. The two lines that I've talked about, the one that has been impaired, is basically one that we don't see will be filled in the next three years to come. The remaining years afterwards we have to reconsider. Stimuvax is not a biological drug, so that will not be a game-changer. And the remaining line that we have will be fully fit to suit the demand for Erbitux if it's Erbitux with gastric, Erbitux with lung, whatever, but the point that we tried to convey to you in the conference call is that both of these products, and potential future indications, are not without risk. So this is what we clearly would like to transport, especially on lung. You know that this is old data that is being used, so we are currently clearly looking at the marketed products of Erbitux that should fill this respective line of Vevey that is still with full asset base unimpaired.</p>
          <p>Then as far as 2012 is concerned, that is a tricky question, so I would have to somewhat give you a guidance on 2012 profits in order to answer your question, which I'm not going to do. Normally, I give the next year's guidance with first quarter financials, and therefore I'm not going to provide a guidance for 2012. The only thing that we tried to do is for the first time in I understand the last several years we give you clear indications on the currency sensitivity. This is a first shot on currency sensitivity because normally I need to collect the local currency exposure worldwide by all legal entities. In the short period of time that I'm here, I could only make a rough analysis by the biggest legal entity, and based on that we came up with the assessment that you have in front of you. And I think it should help you on your assumptions that you take on the dollar, the Swiss franc to model out the implications for our P&amp;L. And with this, I hand over to our dear Mr. Kirschbaum on Stimuvax.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. A few remaining on Merck Millipore, if I may. Taking into account that you might be able to pass on the raw material price impact would bring you to a gross margin of around 57%, 57.3%. Is that a reasonable level assuming going forward, taking into account the lower sales in Process Solutions? And then also on the non-renewal of the instrument contract just for classification. Did I get it right in the call that the negative impact on the top line would be &#x20AC;40 million in 2011 and for the remainder of 2011 minus &#x20AC;10 million impact on the operating profit side?</p>
          <p>And finally, assuming that you are able to pass on the raw material price impact on the operating result side, potentially then 18% margin. Is that a good starting level for the next one or two years? Or do you expect to reach 20% anytime soon there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me come to the contract question. What I indicated earlier was I made two comments. One for the first half on sales, and I indicated roughly &#x20AC;40 million had been taken in Q1, Q2. More in Q1, less in Q2, so we basically had here a current set up where the supplier made use &#x2013; supplier to Millipore made use of a change of control product, sorry, change of control clause in the contracts, and now he is selling the insulin himself.</p>
          <p>So that is one effect that was very strong still in first quarter 2011 because a lot of customers of ours still ordered the product from our selves because they wanted to have the product in their hands. It was lowering off in the second quarter, and we'll finish now in the second quarter. So we will not have the round about &#x20AC;40 million of sales in Q3, Q4 going on. And we will lose that completely in first 2012 versus the base, especially Q1. So that's point number one.</p>
          <p>And point number two for the profitability in Q3 and Q4 I indicated earlier it would be therefore &#x20AC;10 million lower from Merck Millipore, which we had in the base in the first six months of the year. So that's question number two. Now let's come to the gross margin of Merck Millipore. I think the comparable data that we so far had for third quarter 2010 and fourth quarter 2010 were roughly in the neighborhood of 51% to 53%.</p>
          <p>So the 57% that you've mentioned is potentially somewhat taking too much a look at Q1 data, which for obvious reasons, as I explained, currency, but also the incremental sales that we had in the first quarter. So the first quarter reference is possibly not the right one. So rather look into the third and fourth quarter of 2010. Your third question on the 80% I have not understood. There is no...</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a number that I do recognize. On a Core OR or ROS basis, I think this is the number that the business in the past has generated round about 18%. We are currently I think at 17.5%. So this is, as you can see, a good business with good profitability, and I think this is a reasonable assumption, even though I wouldn't like to say this is a guidance by the company. This is for you definitely a reasonable element to use in your modeling.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is just a follow-up on the Millipore and what you see in terms of the fiscal pressures. Does your guidance include any contingency for further fiscal pressures in the U.S. due to the debt reform and the pressure on academia or government organizations from that? And what are you seeing in terms of contracts with, other contracts with customers in the pharma industry? Are those contracts also potentially at risk as they restructure their businesses? And then the second question. Just back to the management changes you've announced today. I think you've alluded to that there's a lot of change going on. I was just wondering how long you think it would take the new management teams to bed down and become effective within the relative organizations? And secondly, you highlight changes below the senior management level. Just wondering how deep those changes are going, and what sort of levels of management are you envisaging changes? Is it right through the organization? Or are we just &#x2013; or is it just the top level of management? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with answering your second question. Actually, I have to admit that I expect a manager who is joining Merck becomes effective on day one. And I believe if you listen to today's call you can at least recognize that effectiveness is taking place. That having said, I would like to allude to earlier statement. We have taken some quick decisions on the Merck Serono pipeline. We will take more decisions. We will work out complete packages, look at things, but this all takes <mark type="ph" /> a longer breath (1:26:15).</p>
          <p>So don't expect us now with every announcement the day after something is happening, but effectiveness starts right from the first hour somebody is here. How deep will changes be? Let me say very clearly that Merck is a company full of talent. And I get this confirmed from every possible angle, but we have to make sure as a management that this talent really reaches at the end of the day the profit numbers. So we have to do some improvements in executive management to really get the term done, but we have a rich pool of excellent people, so don't expect us to change the whole company. This company is a rich and good company, and will excel based on the existing talent as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Richard, you see how the CEO puts everybody under immediate pressure. That's life with CEOs, but let me make the humble point. Anybody, of course, needs some time to understand things, and if you would change from one company to the other, trying to understand a company that you've never analyzed before, it takes you also some months to fully understand everything. So I think it's good that we are being put under pressure by our CEO. This is as it has to be. But of course, everybody here is running as fast as they can. That's the reason for joining because I think everybody joins and is already here, and the organization that is here, they try to move Merck in the next five to 10 years to a position where it should be.</p>
          <p>Now let's come to the nitty-gritty questions that address more the financial side. On the contracts by pharma, the pharma industry, as you know, is I don't need to explain that is of course under pressure. So there might be pressure from one and the other pharmaceutical companies on Merck Millipore in terms of pricing, in terms of volumes. Competitiveness in the life science technologies industry does exist. But on the other side of this competitive pressure, you see that the pharmaceutical industries also have the pressure to optimize their costs, and this is what Merck Millipore offers. If you go to the business, especially Process Solutions that services the biotechnology industry, pharma industry, they do help with their instruments and process support to lower the costs of the pharmaceutical production.</p>
          <p>And therefore, the challenge that you've indicated at the same point in time is a advantage. On the fiscal pressure, honestly, Richard, I cannot factor that in, so the indebtedness that is in Europe out there and the U.S. out there is something that you cannot factor into your forecast. So we have done the forecasting the numbers that we've guided today, we have not done that factoring in now whatever adjustments decided in Spain, Italy, Ireland or Greece or the U.S. That's something that you have &#x2013; that would be guessing, and we at least try from now on not to guess numbers, but do hard work and then come up with realistic forecasts for you, and then of course report on them hopefully on target when we do our next conference call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I don't know if you could give a bit more clarification on Merck Serono R&amp;D cost, slowing termination of multiple programs? Should we expect a further reduction of R&amp;D cost through the rest of the year? I understood that you will give us an update regarding R&amp;D cost as of 2012, but I was just talking about 2011? And then I still don't fully understand the &#x20AC;63 million impairment that you booked for Safinamide and you said related to change in development. I think we should get the data from the MOTION and the SETTLE study by the end of the year or early next year. So I was just also wondering why you'd even wait for the data results before booking this? And finally, my last question is regarding your guidance. Assuming the lowest end of the guidance range even for the respective divisions imply total sales of &#x20AC;10.25 billion, which is in the middle of the &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;10.4 billion. Does that mean that you're actually guiding &#x2013; really guiding to the lowest end of this range, even potentially lower than that for the rest of the division? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yeah. This is similar to the question just asked. If you could give some suggestion on the various steps taken in Merck Serono today on write-off, the extent to which this will change the running operating costs going forward based upon those decisions for the say balance of the year? Then I had a question following on from the Millipore discussion. I mean, assuming if there were to be further pressure in academic and issue with the fiscal, can you give a sense as to what flexibility you have on the cost side to manage that sort of variability? And then the last question was on Erbitux, just the estimate on Erbitux's better second half, if you could just remind us what the drivers are of that, please?</p>

          <p>Well, let me take the questions one and one. As far as R&amp;D is concerned, the budget here or the amount of costs that you are envisioning or that you would like to get clarification on for 2012, I would basically use the data that you currently have on Merck Serono, which is basically in the ballpark of the 20%. Please understand that for 2011 we will have to absorb the immediate costs that we triggered through canceling Cladribine. The &#x20AC;20 million are one-time costs that have nothing to do with the clinical studies that are running, but in this year we basically have to accrue for all outstanding costs on R&amp;D on the clinical trials for Cladribine. The same holds true for the study that's for the product IMO that we've cancelled. So also that is round about &#x20AC;5 million of extra charges that have to accrue for in course of 2011. So I would basically advise that you keep the round about 20% that you currently have on Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>Now on Safinamide, hey, I'm looking at this product. I've looked at the data for 2010 where things were changing, and as a CFO, I'm not challenging the Safinamide product per se. But I've seen the timeline slip last year, and the development program right now was looked at and MOTION study is considered. And I clearly would here like to stress I'm a little bit more cautious, and potentially also not blue-eyed so that we've taken from basically from the finance side here a corrective action. The business and the R&amp;D folks are definitely continuing on MOTION study, and will most likely reveal data in the course of first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>And as far as your guidance question is concerned, it's clearly the &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;10.4 billion, depending on currencies. If the dollar deteriorates further, of course, we get a hit. And this flexibility I would like to have, and therefore we will most likely move somewhere in this corridor, but I wouldn't like to precise that further.</p>
          <p>Then I come to Peter's question on the Millipore costs. Of course, we are looking now at the costs, not meaning that Millipore is a business where we consider this is a restructuring game. Definitely not. It's a growth business, but of course if the top line slows then you have to also look at your underlying costs in order to make the numbers that you have in the forecast. So if there should be less momentum on academia as we go ahead or from whatever further decisions that will be taken by governmental health institutions, of course, we have to revisit our marketing and sales expenses in order to keep the healthy margin for which this business was acquired. And I think with this I've answered all questions.</p>

          <p>There was the Erbitux question, if you could just help us, remind us what the drivers are to the better second half in Erbitux, please?</p>

          <p>Well, here I think on Japan we have falling further than 36% organically. I mean this I don't consider. I think we will stabilize now in the third quarter, and then hopefully work our way up again, whilst of course our competitor here, Takeda, the Japanese company is giving pressure. As far as the European landscape is concerned, the clear message is we are the golden standard in Europe, and whilst of course Vectibix has now been upgraded also to first-line, I think the clear point is on Erbitux.</p>
          <p>We have proven overall survival in all our trials. We are the recognized standard here, and therefore competition is out there. We will have to deal with this, but we don't see that now the rest of the world, rest of the world being defined everything but Japan, we are going to have a dramatic change. Erbitux, in general, we have adjusted guidance to low single digit growth, and this is pretty much what we are fighting for, but of course, we have to fight for that.</p>
