          <p>Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Full-Year Report. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And I'd like to remind you that this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Nils Vinge, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin your meeting and I'll be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's full year results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen is with me today and will be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Before we start with the fourth quarter, we are pleased to see that the New Year has started well. In December, sales increased 13% in local currencies and, in comparable units, sales were up 4%.</p>
          <p>From the 1 to the 24 of January, sales increased by 12% compared to the same period last year. Our early spring collections have been well-received, and our customers appreciate our strong offering.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, fourth quarter 2011. Conditions were challenging for the retail sector in the fourth quarter, with consumer sentiment affected by economic worries in many of our markets. In addition, the weather was unusually warm throughout the autumn. Despite all this, we increased sales, including VAT, by 6% in local currencies and we continued taking market share.</p>
          <p>Sales in comparable units decreased 3% against high like-for-like of plus 7% in the fourth quarter last year. Net sales were SEK 31 billion compared to SEK 29.7 billion last year. Gross profit for the quarter was SEK19.2 billion corresponding to a gross margin of 61.9%, down from 63.2% last year, but still at a good level.</p>
          <p>The main explanation to the decrease is the high sourcing cost inflation, particularly the increase in cotton prices, combined with our chosen strategy to further strengthen the customer offering and the market position relative to competitors. We are convinced that this will gradually become even more evident to our customers.</p>
          <p>Just to illustrate, if you please turn to the chart, cotton prices, for a moment. At the time of sourcing for the fourth quarter of 2011, cotton spot prices were at historically high levels, around $2 per pound. Spot prices peaked in the spring of 2011, but they remained higher than the year before all the way on through the autumn.</p>
          <p>Now please return to the slide, fourth quarter 2011. The unusually warm autumn led to increased markdowns on weather-related garments. Therefore, markdowns in relation to sales increased compared to Q4 2010. The effect on the gross margin was 60 basis points negative year on year.</p>
          <p>The negative effects on the gross margin were partly offset by a positive effect from the weaker dollar against the euro during the time of sourcing for the fourth quarter compared to the corresponding period the previous year.</p>
          <p>Looking at OpEx, we kept our strong control on costs across the group. Costs in comparable stores decreased compared to the fourth quarter 2010.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A was SEK12.5 billion in the quarter, up 6% in SEK and 8% in local currencies. The increase is explained mainly by the expansion and by continued long-term investments, primarily in IT and online.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was 21.5% and net financial items totaled SEK137 million compared to SEK118 million and profit after financial items was SEK6.8 billion compared to SEK7.2 billion year ago.</p>
          <p>Tax was lower than last year mainly due to adjustments from previous years. Estimated tax rate for the group for 2012 is between 25% and 26%. Net profit was SEK5.4 billion corresponding to earnings per share of 3.24 kroner.</p>
          <p>Looking at the full year, please turn to the slide, full year 2011. Sales, including VAT, increased 8% in local currencies. Sales in comparable units decreased by 1%. Converted to SEK, net sales amounted to SEK110 billion. Gross profit was SEK66.1 billion corresponding to a gross margin of 60.1% against 62.9% the year before.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A were SEK45.8 billion compared to SEK43.6 billion, and that all related to the store expansion, but also to our investments in marketing, IT and online in order to further strengthen H&amp;M's position in the long term and to secure future expansion.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was 18.5% and net financial items amounted to SEK563 million and profit after financial items was SEK20.9 billion compared to SEK25 billion in 2010. After a tax rate of 24.5%, net profit was SEK15.8 billion. That corresponds to earnings per share of 9.56 kroner compared to 11.29 kroner.</p>
          <p>And now some words on our markets and their sales in 2011. Please turn to the slide, Sales Per Market.</p>
          <p>Germany is still by far the largest market for H&amp;M with around 23% of the revenue. But sales today are spread across more markets than ever. We are growing in all our markets and we see great potential for further growth in all of them. The U.S., France and the U.K. compete for second place in the group, and the U. S. and the U.K. were among our best selling markets in 2011 with increases of around 20% each in local currencies.</p>
          <p>China is where we expanded the fastest, and we have more than 80 stores already. Russia, too, is performing very well. We had 19 stores and sales of more than SEK1.5 billion already last year and our rapid expansion continues. We have 70 stores operated by our franchise today and sales develop well.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, expansion 2011. We opened 266 stores net in 2011, which was 16 more than originally planned, and we had a total of 2,472 stores at the end of the financial year, franchise and our other brands included.</p>
          <p>We opened five new markets, Romania, Croatia, Singapore and, via franchise, Morocco and Jordan. Singapore has started very well. We opened in the best location in Orchard Road in September. It was our first store in Southeast Asia, a region with great potential where we are looking forward to open more stores. The other new markets also had successful starts.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we expanded with our other brands, COS, Monki, Weekday and Cheap Monday as well as with H&amp;M Home. COS in particular has performed very well above our own current expectations. COS has nearly 50 stores today in nine markets.</p>
          <p>Shop online began for COS and Monki in 18 European markets in the autumn and have been well-received. The other brands also increased sales and will see more store openings this year after less expansive 2011.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M offers fashion in 43 markets today and our expansion continues. Please turn to the slide, expansion 2012.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we plan to open around 275 stores net within our growth target of 10% to 15% new stores per annum. We will open in five new markets adding to last year; that is 10 new markets in only two years. Bulgaria will become a new H&amp;M market this spring with the first opening in Sofia in March. This autumn, H&amp;M opens in Latvia, Malaysia and Mexico. We are very much looking forward to our first step into Latin America.</p>
          <p>Two new franchise markets are coming up, Thailand this autumn, followed by Indonesia in 2013. COS is opening in four new markets this year with stores planned in Hong Kong, Italy, Finland and, via franchise, in Kuwait.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M is also expanding online. This autumn, we will launch H&amp;M shop online in the U. S., the world's largest retail market, where demand for H&amp;M is high and our brand is strong.</p>
          <p>Those were a few comments on our expansion and now looking at some key figures for 2011, please turn to the slide, key data. Stock-in-trade was SEK13.8 billion, an increase of 20% compared to the same time the previous year. The increase is mainly due to the expansion but also to higher purchasing costs and the effect from the warm autumn on sales of winter garments. This stock-in-trade, as of the 30 of November, includes more winter garments than previous year and is, therefore, slightly higher than planned.</p>
          <p>Our view is that this will likely lead to somewhat increased markdowns in relation to sales in the first quarter of 2012 compared to Q1 last year. Apart from this, the level and the composition of the stock-in-trade are viewed as satisfactory.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide, in relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 12.6% compared to 10.6% last year but still within the range we have seen over the past number of years.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations was 17.4 billion kronor, a decrease of 4.4 billion kroner as explained mainly by the lower sales and higher stock-in-trade.</p>
          <p>Investments reached 5.2 billion kroner and are expected to amount to between 5.5 billion kroner and 6 billion kroner in 2012.</p>
          <p>Our finances remain strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to SEK21.3 billion. The board will propose to the annual general meeting, a dividend of 9.50 kronor per share corresponding to 99% of the net profit for the year. Return on equity was 35.8% compared to 44.1%.</p>
          <p>Before we start Q&amp;A session, a few comments on the year ahead.</p>
          <p>We have many exciting news to look forward to. Next week, we are launching David Beckham body-wear in around 1,800 H&amp;M stores in all our markets and online. This new underwear collection starts selling on the 2 of February and will be followed by new launches seasonally.</p>
          <p>Already on the 8 of March, we have another new and very exciting collaboration, this time with Marni of Italy. Marni is one of the world's most-loved fashion brands. The collection, which is created by Consuelo Castiglioni, is for both women and men and will be offered in around 260 H&amp;M stores around the world and online.</p>
          <p>The campaign film for Marni at H&amp;M has been directed by Sofia Coppola, the world famous filmmaker. All in all, the response so far from customers and media ahead of the launch is very positive.</p>
          <p>But what's most important is that our own designers have created many inspiring collections for the spring. Our customer offering is attractive and the year has started well. Around us, most indicators suggest that the macroeconomic conditions will remain tough in many markets in 2012. We strongly believe in our offering and are convinced that H&amp;M will maintain its strong position as the year goes on.</p>
          <p>We are growing in all our markets and with all our brands, and we are expanding to new countries. We're looking forward to another exciting year full of opportunities.</p>
          <p>We're now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Company name is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:34) based in Frankfurt, Germany. Can you give a little more extra information, I mean Germany is the most important market, on the German market, like, do you have like-for-like figures and also you did not &#x2013; I mean, the other formats like Monki, Weekday and so on did not really develop well in Germany. So what can we expect in 2012 for these products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I agree with what you just say and, I did say on the call from Germany, it remains our most important market with about 23% of the volume. But it has been even higher share of the total because now sales are spread in more markets than ever and there are a lot of other countries that are catching up so to speak. But the German development, we are very happy. We believe that we have taken market share also in 2011 in Germany, and we are very proud of our colleagues, the organization who, I think, do a very good job in Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what was like-for-like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give out the like-for-like per market but, as I said, our view is that we have taken market share in Germany as well and very happy with the sales development as well in the stores as online in Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about the other formats, Monki, Weekday and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Monki, Weekday, in total, we are happy they are developing in the right direction but still in an early stage as you know. But this year, we plan to increase the growth in general. I don't know about Germany in particular but, overall, we plan to increase the expansion again for those brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask one more question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Primark is opening one store after the other, especially in Germany and, as always, they gain market share. How will you face this tough competition especially in terms of prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the fashion industry is, in general, perhaps, one of the most competitive industries in the world. And we hadn't &#x2013; I mean, there are lots of different competitors, very strong competitors in each market. But they might vary from market to market and from concept to concept. And the ones you just mentioned, we know them from many years in the U.K and the U.K. was. this year. one of the strongest performing, developing countries for us. We grew sales with 21% in the U.K. last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon, gents. Company name is BoA Merrill Lynch.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, there.</p>

          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions, please, one, more so on numbers you won and then maybe a sort of a bigger picture one. The numbers that you won is on gross margin. I think in the statement, you've written about, you saw a positive dollar effect in the fourth quarter relative to when you source the product, and I wonder if you expect the similar positive effect in Q1 if exchange rates stay at their current levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's true that when we source most of the garments that we sell now in Q1 that there was still a positive dollar effect. But you're aware that today when we place new orders, there is a negative dollar effect going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. Thank you. And then just on your -- interesting how you're going into Latin America for the first time later this year, by the sounds of it, starting off with Mexico. And I just wondered if you have to make some changes to your infrastructure, logistics, planning processes to be able to supply in markets like that with different weather conditions, different seasons and so on to be able to supply sort of in-season product to those sort of markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. I mean, as I mentioned, we plan to enter five new markets this year and we entered five last year so that's 10 new markets all in all in two years. And of course, each market creates new challenges, but we have pretty good processes going on and of course we do always need to make some adaptions, but hopefully not so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So somewhere like Mexico, would you be able to supply in-season product to the same extent as to other markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from the line of Caroline Gulliver. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Caroline Gulliver from Esp&#xED;rito Santo. I had another question on the gross margin outlook. And you've helpfully, obviously talked about direction of <mark type="ph" /> cost (20:42) and the dollar. Are you able to tell us what you're seeing in terms of labor cost? We've heard other retailers talking about 10% labor inflation in sourcing countries. Is that something you're also seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. There, as you know, a lot of moving parts in the gross margin and the cost of goods sold. And, of course, labor cost is one very important factor. And yes, I think long-term, there will be increased cost. But last year at this time, we saw very sharply rising labor cost as a result of the lack of supply, if you remember. So compared to last year, I would say, it's pretty flat as of right now. But in the long term, I expect them to continue to increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And just one other question, if I may. I think you said in the third quarter that the step-up in IT and marketing expenses had annualized. But they also seemed to have increased in the fourth quarter, and I was wondering if you expect these to increase again in the first half of the coming year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When it comes to our operating expenses, we have increased the investments in IT online and that goes also for the fourth quarter this year compared to last year. And, in general, we are looking at the operating expenses on the year-on-year increase and we have a really good cost control in comparable stores. We decreased the operating expenses in the fourth quarter as we did also on the full year.</p>
          <p>And when we are talking about OpEx increasing, the main explanations are the expansion but also these long-term IT and online investments. And maybe just to give an example, when we're talking about the expansion, we have never had such a strong expansion as we have today into new markets. As Nils just said, we opened five new markets in 2011 and plan to open additional five in 2012.</p>
          <p>And of course, when we are entering a new market, maybe open up one or two stores in the first season or seasons. Of course the cost share will be quite high compared to our mature markets where we already have the infrastructure when it comes to logistics.</p>
          <p>Also when we open a new market, we start, directly, the brand building with marketing and that is what we mean when we're talking that these are long-term investments and we are building a much, much stronger platform for future expansion and making each of them much stronger for the future. I think it's really important to understand what kind of things will affect the cost share. But, as I said, looking at our normal operations, we have a really good cost control where we decrease. So, we are happy with our cost control.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Nils. How are you? Wondering if you could touch base quickly on the like-for-likes that you saw in December and January; obviously nice positive trend there. How much of that was full price versus driven by the increased promotions that you saw?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The like-for-like sales were up 4% in December. We haven't commented on January yet, but we don't split up how much was promotional driven and we would like to come back to the discount levels in connection to the first quarter. But as we stated in the report, the somewhat higher part of winter garments, we think it's likely to drive markdowns so they will be somewhat higher than, compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the increased markdowns from promotion, do you expect it to be at a similar magnitude to what you saw in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I can't tell you any more than what we've said. And I mean, that's &#x2013; I'm talking about Q1 compared to Q1 last year. It's nothing to do with Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I understand that. But obviously, you had an impact on the margins in the fourth quarter as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that was 60 basis points in the Q4 compared to Q4 last year, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then maybe I can ask one more that, hopefully I can get an answer from. The inventory, I know it was up 20% at the end of November. Given that we're now at the end of January, how do you feel about the inventory currently? Have you cleared through that increase or has it remained high now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are in the middle of the first quarter, and what we are saying, we have a bigger share of winter garments when we are going out the outgoing stock as per in November. And as we also state in the report, there is likely a risk that the markdowns in relation to sales will be higher in Q1 this year compared to last year's first quarter. But still it's five, six weeks left for the quarter, so I'm sorry, we have to come back to the absolute level in connection with the Q1 report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But presumably most of the sales happened in December and January because those are the peak trading periods. So you must have a pretty good view on what your inventory looks like now, don't you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have a pretty good view of our inventories right now. But as we are talking about the effect from the gross margin as a relation to the turnover, that will be really dependent on how this turnover will develop for the next five weeks. Of course, we are not just looking at the absolute figure but, as a relation how does it affect the gross margin in Q1 this year compared to last year, and that relation is depending very much on the turnover, and that we don't know for the coming five weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can ask a different way. For the past eight weeks, do you feel good about where the inventory ended up compared to the sales that you've had for the past eight weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Citigroup. This is really a quick question on the refurb activity; you talked about running at still a high level in 2011. Can you just give us some sense of how many refurbs you did in the year? And then parallel with that, in terms of the CapEx spend, what proportion of the CapEx spend in the year was related to those refurbs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and, please, one question at a time. But as you start with the first question, it was 100-plus big makeovers, refurbs. But on top of that, of course, we do a lot of smaller facelifts, so to speak, and it's a higher level compared to historically. But we stepped up the level couple of years ago. We kept that level pretty high and intend to keep it high also going into 2012.</p>
          <p>And regarding the total, your second question regarding how we &#x2013; for the CapEx, we don't break out what is for new stores or refurbs, but of course the vast majority is for new stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just going back to the refurbs, can you be a bit more specific on how many major refurbs you did and how many smaller facelifts you did?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said 100-plus major.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And smaller ones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have the exact amount, but we are doing a lot of <mark type="ph" /> reshaping (29:28), changing floor stands, building up new A areas. It's an ongoing process. So we are doing it on a continuous basis, and that happens every time we feel that we need to lift up the customer experience, we are doing those investments. But these refurbs, these plus 100, these are really big rebuilds where we start with the flooring, the ceiling and making a total makeover of the store.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the smaller refit cycle, is that sort of once every five or six years? Is that what you've got to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it can be much &#x2013; in depends. If it's a city location, a flagship for instance, and it's dependent also the footfall, and so the maintenance is totally different in a small store on the countryside compared to, let's say, Fifth Avenue, so it can be much more often than every fifth year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. I changed my name. Hi, guys. I just had another question on supply chain. So I won't go near the gross margin, but on supply chain, a number of retailers in the U.K. certainly talking about dollar price as being flat or possibly even down as the year progresses. Would you be seeing anything different from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you rephrase please, again. Do you mean the purchasing cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the actual purchasing cost. So nothing to do with what prices are but your supplier prices. Others are saying that prices are flat to down. Is there any reason why you shouldn't see the same trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't confirm that. Of course, it looks &#x2013; I mean, the development is much better today than a year ago when everything was really going in the wrong direction. But we refrain from giving exact levels. And of course, the most important thing, how will we use it? I mean, what will we do with the customer offering because that's really where we start. And we always strive to have the best customer offering, best combination of fashion, quality and price. But sorry, I prefer not to be more specific. And so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the question you just asked about what you do with it, what will you be doing with it? I mean, do you think you've made the largest part of the adjustment in terms of your relative offer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As we've said several times, the gross margin has never been and is not a goal for, in itself for us. And I just want to be really clear, for us at H&amp;M, there is no, how do you say, an automatic link between, for instance, decreasing sourcing cost that it will automatically lead to a higher gross margin and vice versa because that will be totally dependent on those decisions we will make when it comes to our customer offering. I think that is really important to be clear on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Okay, well, just one last definitional point. And you use this word somewhat higher for markdowns in Q1. Does somewhat mean anything different in Swedish than it does in English?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in Swedish, we say [foreign language] (33:37). Does that ring a bell?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll look that up and see whether that means anything different than somewhat. All right. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question from your segment reporting you announced today. I see that your rest-of-the-world operating margin went up, I'd call it 190 basis points, which is obviously very different from what's happened to the group overall margin. And I was wondering how you manage to get such positive improvements in the operating margin in the rest of the world despite the gross margin investment that I assume we saw in those countries as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As we have mentioned some quarters ago, we are using an OECD model for our transfer pricing. And the idea within the OECD model is to provide a legal framework for, not only for the companies, but for the governments to have their fair share of taxes and for us as an enterprise to avoid double taxation. And we are operating in more than 30 different countries, and the local regulations will also affect this level. But when looking at the development in the operating margin from last year compared to this year, it shows that the rest of the world has had a better development compared, for instance, with the Euro Zone and the Nordic countries. So that is reflected in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you charge the same price to each country from  &#x2013; I mean, I understand there's tax benefits to have most of the profits in the group functions line. But do you charge the same transfer price for the same item to different countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we are having operations in more than 30 countries and the local regulations. We have the same fundamental, the same base for the transfer pricing. But some countries, they don't, maybe, accept the OECD model and also local regulations will affect the price that we can invoice. So there are differences.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. And then if I could just follow-up with a completely different question. I think my understanding is your official dividend payout policy is 50%, which is clearly a very long way from the level of payout you actually gave this year. Have you any intention of changing your official dividend policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess really it's up to the board to answer that question. I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Anne Critchlow from SG. I've got a question &#x2013; Hi, there. I've got a question on the dividend as well. Obviously, the payout ratio has gone up to 99% and, as the earnings have fallen and the dividend's been maintained, but how should we be thinking about this in our model? Should we assume that that might become embedded with the 99% payout ratio and that the dividend should rise in line with earnings in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Nils said, in the end this is the question for the Board of Directors and finally for the Annual General Meeting. And the Board of Directors, they've made their assessments that the proposed event, it's justifiable, taking consideration our strong financial position and our expansion and also our continued freedom of taking actions as a company. So we, after this dividend, we still have a very strong financial position. But as I said, this is ultimately a question for the Board of Directors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just one other question on the cost of impact on the gross margin. Will that be negative in Q1? We're assuming it is. I'm just wondering if that's the right assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, all things equal, yes, of course, when we source most of the garments that we sell in Q1, cotton prices were still much higher than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And for Q2, will it still be negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on how long the lead times is which is very difficult to say because we don't source cotton directly. We buy &#x2013; we source garments and our suppliers who buys the fabrics, who buys the yarn, et cetera. So it's difficult to say but probably still negative, but maybe not as negative as for Q4 and Q1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. The company is Stifel Nicolaus and, I guess, a more mundane question. Hi. Last time, we had spoken about the U. S. online business being postponed till the infrastructure was in place to your satisfaction and, then likely 2012, we'll see a much more aggressive implementation. I'm wondering where you stand on the U. S. online initiative and then, more broadly, how you feel about country-by-country or region-by-region the chance to expand your online presence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look very much forward to finally launch online sales in the U. S. and we plan for a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:39). And there's a lot of activity going on and I hope we have great expectations and a lot of customers who are waiting for us to launch it. So very exciting. And of course, when it comes to online for the rest of the group, the plan is, of course, to continue the roll out in all our markets, but we haven't communicated any specific plans yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I'll try one more question. As you enter some of these markets and, you entered numerous new markets last year and anticipate next year, will you seek to have a more simultaneous online and bricks-and-mortar presence or will you follow the patterns of the past where stores first, online to follow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is never a very pragmatic view on that, and we're open to everything. If you take the launch we did with online for COS and Monki, we have actually launched that site for 18 countries even in countries where we don't have brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's really a region or country-by-country and brand-by brand, you'll make that decision accordingly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, there is now, how should I put it? Of course, the channels are very much integrated into each other. And the idea is to have all the channels in each market.  But we'd want to do it by quality and we do it step by step, so to speak. And that's why we are, at the present, investing a lot especially into the IT and online in order to make this happen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, any chance of COS entering United States in 2012?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Just actually one question. In your statement this morning, you see, it says, you're convinced that your investments will gradually become more evident to customers. Why do you think, as a company, that customers didn't appear to respond to your relative investment in 2011?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if I agree to that because it has been a really tough environment in most of our sales countries. And what we have seen, we have taken market shares more or less on each market and even increased our market positions towards the peers or competitors. So it has been good investments already now, and we are convinced that it will be even more obvious for the customers in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add, in the U.K., for example, in a very tough environment, as you know, we're very happy with the development. We increased sales in the U.K. with 21% in such a tough year. So we see that as a proof that the customers really appreciate our customer offering and the improvements that we are doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But you do so you think it'll gradually become more evident to customers so you think your &#x2013; because I read from that that you think your sales, for example, will improve this year on a same-store basis?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Credit Suisse in London. Afternoon, gentlemen. It was really a follow-on question to Fraser's one, actually, with regard to the level of investment that you're making in the products. You made a comment about utilizing gross margins, perhaps putting it back into the product. I mean, presumably, the pricing is all, in terms of spring/summer, it's all been fixed. Can you quantify whether you are still making investment into product positioning and pricing that in spring/summer 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are a lot of people and competitors very interested to hear that. And again, I can only say that we always try to have the best customer offering, but I can't give you more details and so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I can add to that. Of course, we are continuously following what's happening on the different markets and also adjusting us to prevailing circumstances. So it's an ongoing work to work with our customer offering. Of course, it differs from quarter to quarter from year to year and so on. But as Nils said, for us it's always important to have the best customer offering on each market. That is what the main goal is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, so if we looked at the negative impacts on the gross margin coming through in the first quarter, you'd have one, in terms of the cotton import prices. But you'd still have a negative impact from the investment in product. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not necessarily. We're not giving any forecasts. We're just saying that, again, I'll repeat what Jyrki said, the gross margin for us is not the target. It's always the customer offering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I, perhaps, just ask a question on Q4 then? In terms of the investment that you made in product pricing in Q4, was that at a lower level than, say, in Q1 and Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the investments we've done in Q4 is obvious because you see it in the gross margin hit, so to speak. But again, going forward, we do not give any guidance on the gross margin. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>SEB Enskilda in Stockholm. I'd just like to continue with a question on the SG&amp;A development and, in particular, I'm very impressed to the negative like-for-like development in cost. And I've asked this question before, but I'll do it again. And I'll ask you, how come it is possible, what is the main drivers behind the negative development in like-for-like costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in comparable stores, I mean, that we succeeded to decrease the operating expense in comparable stores. Was that the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's the question, indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said, we have a good cost control. We have a flexible system, and cost consciousness is really a core value within H&amp;M. So it's everything from small things in the consuming goods and, but of course, the biggest cost is how we succeed to adapt the staff planning. That is the most important when controlling the efficiency and cost level for comparable stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you very much. If I may, a second question. You, earlier today, said that 240 out of the 275 new stores built in this year will be H&amp;M stores and the rest will be split between COS and the Weekday brands. And I was just wondering, as a consequence of that, will the store or the space conversion rate in any way change, you think, compared to in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, that figure that our CEO gave, it's still very approximate and very early in the year. And even the 275, as you know, is a proxy and a lot of things can happen during the year. But the space conversion is very difficult to say. So I mean, the best guidance we can give is that it's roughly the same as last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe we should be a little bit clear that, as Nils said, 275 stores, that's our best estimate. And it's a moving target in a way because there are a lot of negotiations still to be done before we are there. So that's also the reason why the CapEx can differ what we estimate when we are going into a new year. We don't have contracts for all those 275 stores when we enter a new year. It's still a lot of negotiations, so there are uncertainty and also the final mix between the different stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clear. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But that said, the case in every year when we do all this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Frank Walding. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, it's Frank Walding from Goldman Sachs. I've just got two questions. The first one is just relating to &#x2013; hi, there. Just relating to the CapEx, if I take your guidance and look at that against the kind of the run rate of new store openings this coming year versus just reported, it looks like, on an underlying basis, your CapEx is going up per store. I appreciate the comments you just made about contracts not being signed. But I was just wondering why you were guiding to effectively an increase in CapEx to stores. That was the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I said, we are guiding for CapEx from 5.5 billion Swedish krones to 6 billion Swedish krones. Last year, we had a CapEx which rounded approx to 5.2 billion Swedish kronor. And this as I said, this is the best estimate we can give. And when we are heading towards the end of this year, it can differ because there might be new decisions made by us. And as you also mentioned, still a lot of negotiations where we're talking about the final details. So this is our best estimate that the CapEx increase will be in this magnitude and, also, there might be new possibilities during the year which also will affect the final CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But maybe it's clear to say that last year, in 2011, the CapEx per store was actually down compared to the previous year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Yeah and I appreciate that. I just &#x2013; you made comments earlier about investing, making long-term investments to go into new markets, which I think most people would agree is a very, very sensible sure long-term strategy. I guess what I'm asking is is there an accelerated, not just an operating cost, but an investment cost associated with that that we're seeing in that guidance you're giving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, those &#x2013; just the shape of the store openings this year appears to be more weighted towards your rest-of-world segment. And I guess also within that towards what we might consider kind of non-European international emerging countries. I just wondered whether we should expect that trend to continue and kind of where you felt in terms of, as a percentage of new space opening in two years' time, where you felt the rest-of- the-world segment would be doing given all of these new country entrants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's important to state that we still grow a lot in Europe and the U.S. and the, so to speak, old countries because we still have huge potential to grow in each market. But of course, over time, new countries like China, Russia and Asia, et cetera, they became a bigger and bigger part of the base.</p>
          <p>And China, already in this year was the largest, by far, the largest expansion market with 35 new stores net. And the plan for 2012 is to increase that even further. So I think by definition, the rest of the world will become a bigger part of the expansion scheme.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, but still, I think it's very important, again, to state that we're still &#x2013; I think we're prudent in the report, we still see huge potential and great potential also in countries like Germany, U.K., Italy, et cetera, in Europe and the U.S., of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. A couple of quick follow-ups for you on costs. You've made the statement that you've cut costs in comparable stores in the fourth quarter. And I just wondered how you see the outlook for continuing to be able do that without affecting service standards going forward and then which areas would you look to make further improvements for these?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we, as I said, we have a flexible model, but we will never cut cost in a short-term way to make the store operations worse, never. That would never happen. Of course, we understand that to have a good level, visual level in the stores, then, of course, we have to invest in the staff and the hours used in the stores.</p>
          <p>But we are confident with our way of working. We have a good planning tool. The way we plan is really flexible, so we think that we can have a good cost control in the future as well. But of course, in the long run, when looking at the cost share to turnover, of course we need like-for-like development, a positive one, and that's one of the reasons, of course, why we are planning for it every year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And just as a follow-up then on costs, just remind me what your policy is on catalog development in markets where you're selling online. Do all countries have a hard copy catalog now where you're selling online to all customers who order from H&amp;M, and is that adding to cost? It does sound like it added a bit to cost in Q4, and could well add again in this year. What's your policy on catalog offering in online markets, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we see it as an important complement. We talk about the multi-channels. So it's stores, it's the catalog and online together. So yes, they play still an important part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you offer a catalog in all online markets now, do you, to regular customers, okay.</p>
