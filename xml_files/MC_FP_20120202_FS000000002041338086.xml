        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the traditional annual meeting presenting the performance for the year 2011. And I apologize; I'm going to be a bit repetitive, but 2011 was an outstanding year, just was 2010 and just as will be 2012; at least let us hope so.</p>
          <p>The revenue was up 14%. The profit from recurring operations was up 22% with a record level of more than &#x20AC;5 billion and we have an improvement in the current operating margin. The interesting thing here is to discuss the present year, but of course you are interested about future outlook, but let's first take a look at the performance for 2011.</p>
          <p>2011 for LVMH was very eventful because of course we were able &#x2013; throughout our lines of business we were able to generate growth in every single line of business. As you know, there were all sorts of developments in 2011 and of course the main event in terms of business is a rapprochement with Bulgari. Mr. Trapani here is now running our business for Watches and Jewelry. I mean, we've known him for about 10 years and for the past 10 years we've been trying to finalize this merger, and of course this occurred in 2011. And it is a major development because first of all Bulgari is a remarkable brand, and of course it is for LVMH a new stage in watches, and development and we can be a challenger for the number one in the industry. And of course, this is extremely exciting indeed all the more so because we have very fine teams in all the brands of Watches and Jewelry, and the fact that we are able to make such significant strides especially in 2011 with Tag Heuer, Hublot, Chaumet. We were able to make great strides and these brands still have more potential in the present environment.</p>
          <p>And of course, our strategy and &#x2013; I mean, this may be a bit disappointing, but we are continuing this still same strategy. Our strategy is based, as you know, on creating iconic items, original items, and of course the expectation is for our workshops to produce these items in very high quality standards. And of course, the Bulgari team which Mr. Trapani had trained and set up for a number of years is of course an excellent asset, because now we have not just the quality of our products but the know-how both for jewelers and watchmakers. So this is a tremendous development in this line of business, and of course the outlook is extremely promising as well.</p>
          <p>2011, as you know, outside Europe was a year of prosperity around the globe. It sounds a bit paradoxical to note that even in 2012, global growth is expected to stand at about 3%, even though we are expecting no growth at all in Europe. But we are fortunate enough to export most of our output and so therefore we &#x2013; most of the export countries are not just the emerging economies, but such counties as the United States, driving most of our business. And this also applies to fashion and leather goods, because as you know, we were very successful there as well. We have been very successful for a number of years, especially with the Vuitton teams. Yves Carcelle's team have made of Louis Vuitton a global leader in luxury.</p>
          <p>And of course the outlook is just as exciting as always, even though this may be surprising to some, because when we took up the business early in the 1990s, at the end of the 1980s, we were told, well, Vuitton is already saturated over the planet so the prospects for growth are somewhat limited because there is already too much of it. And ever since then, the revenue has multiplied by a factor of 10, even though the purpose is not to grow indefinitely, but we multiplied more than 10-fold, Mr. Carcelle can give you more details about that.</p>
          <p>But in any case, the reason we were so successful in 2011 and the reason why we have such a positive outlook for 2012 is that Vuitton is capable of reconciling on the one hand high revenue and very high and elite-quality products. And of course some of the items are manufactured in very small numbers with very high demand, and this means that of course the waiting lists keep growing around the globe. But reconciling these two high-quality and high-revenue objectives has made us successful.</p>
          <p>And of course, as analysts &#x2013; maybe you don't buy all our stuff, but you certainly are familiar with our catalog, and there may be a few surprises. Indeed we have something of a surprise in the store with a new artist that we will be displaying shortly. A number of iconic stores were opened in 2011, especially the store in Milan, but also the store in Singapore, which we'll be visiting next week. That store is built on an island in a complex known as Marina Bay, and of course, this is one of the most exclusive luxury goods store in the world, and it is of course iconic for the entire Asia region, iconic of our brand.</p>
          <p>But it is not just Louis Vuitton in fashion and leather goods. And as you know, for a number of years, you analysts have been asking questions and have been turning to our team saying, well, Vuitton is a fine brand and so is Dior, but what about the smaller names, the smaller lines of business? And let me tell you that we are very pleased to note that all of them are doing well. Indeed they are doing extremely well. And when I was asked, I was repeatedly asked, how fast this could develop and we said that, well, surely this can't happen overnight, and of course if that could happen overnight, we would be overtaken by events. And of course this is an ongoing, long-term process requiring lots of effort to get the small names growing and going. We need to find the right combination of good management and good products, and of course we were able to do just that with Yves Roussel's teams in a number of areas. I will give you just two examples, but there are many, many others.</p>
          <p>The first example is the Spanish brand, Loewe, which we bought a number of years ago which was somewhat problematic in the beginning, but of course with the right combination of creativeness, a new design, new concept stores, and of course top-quality management, we were able to develop around the world, especially in the Asian markets.</p>
          <p>And the other striking development, that is something that we took up back in the 1980s. So you have to be patient indeed. This takes us back 30 years. This was a business that was doing so-so but now has taken off dramatically. That's called C&#xE9;line. Everybody knows C&#xE9;line now, and thanks to the talent of the creative woman in charge of this business, we are generating remarkable growth numbers. And so when the shops are sitting next to a competitor that is supposed to be very successful, we will find it that C&#xE9;line stores are generating more revenues, of course in terms of per square meter, but also in absolute numbers that C&#xE9;line is doing better than its biggest competitors. And even though we have about 100 stores or so under that brand, it's doing extremely well. I am not saying that there will be more Louis Vuitton in the future, but at least we are certainly expecting new businesses of the same elk, and so we are extremely well positioned, even though of course we can't rule out the possibility of there being ups and downs that is in the international economic climate. But of course it may sound paradoxical seen from here in France or indeed from Europe, but this is a very promising outlook.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we were all very pleased with our performances, especially in Perfumes and Cosmetics. Dior perfumes in 2011, once again, of course the first time was in 2010, but J'adore is the number-one perfume in France, ahead of all the other names. This is quite remarkable. It was launched in the 1990s. It's an emblematic perfume. The whole concept was born out of the history of the Dior company, Mr. Christian Dior, when he did the &#x2013; his initial store in the shape of the number eight. It's a very exciting and convoluted story, but the very development of the bottle and the perfume itself is very much emblematic of that name.</p>
          <p>And so Dior J'adore did extremely well, but that likewise, Shalimar by Guerlain has been extremely successful. And by and large our perfume business, even though in a very competitive environment, has been doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>I mentioned Watches and Jewelry. Let me also mentioned Selective Retailing. Of course Selective Retailing includes basically GFS and Sephora. Sephora, as you know, is a rather unique brand. It is undoubtedly the largest retailer of Perfumes and Cosmetics. Christopher de Lapuente is now running that company. I don't know if he is fully in control because he has only been around for a short while, but the performances are extremely satisfactory. And what makes this concept unique is that on a number of markets, whether in mature markets such the United States where we are leaders in the retail &#x2013; Selective Retailing of Perfumes and Cosmetics, but likewise China. New emerging markets we are doing just as well. And we are &#x2013; these are great markets that we are constantly innovating, and that is one of the features of that name. We are constantly innovating. We opened a new store in the Meatpacking District in New York. It looks almost like an Apple store. Of course we are not buying computers there; people buy Perfumes and Cosmetics, but when it comes to paying, there are no checkout counters. You pay with a small terminal carried in the hands of all the salespeople, and it was very effective and it's doing extremely well.</p>
          <p>Now, DFS. DFS, as you know, well, what can we say? DFS is just completely submerged with Chinese customers when looking back to 1997, because I'm getting some experience in this business. Back in 1997, I do not know if you recall the situation with Hong Kong and China. At the time, the only Asian clientele was Japanese. So there we were in 1997, the handing over of Hong Kong. No more Japanese customers because they are afraid Hong Kong is turning back to China, and so we may need to close down the DFS stores in Hong Kong. No more customers. That's the end of the story.</p>
          <p>And the same was said about Sephora in the United States, by the way. Any case, this was DFS. And at that time I thought, well, it seems a bit unfortunate to close down these stores, especially when they are well positioned, but let's renegotiate the rents. And as you know, the economic situation in Hong Kong has ups and downs, and so we were able to renegotiate the rents downwards, down 50% or 60%, and we kept them that way. And so now these shops are just splendid in terms of customership, in terms of the quality of the products sold there, because of course our Chinese customers are very much interested in high-end articles. They're of course &#x2013; the performance of the company is extremely good. So this company has had its ups and downs, but now it's definitely &#x2013; look, it's on a very positive trend.</p>
          <p>And now Wines and Spirits. I see Mr. Navarre a bit concerned. Usually we start with Wines and Spirits, and Christophe Navarre is a bit concerned now. The nice thing about Wines and Spirits is we do not need to innovate every week. With Wines and Spirits, we're dealing with traditional products. These are splendid products. They are not exactly the same, but of course there are some small innovations. But we &#x2013; there are no revolutions. It's not every day you come up with a new Cognac or a new Sauternes. And so of course we have to sell our wines and spirits. They have to be the stuff dreams are made of, but that's all very well, but we have to manage &#x2013; we have to produce this stuff. And when I see Mr. Navarre, he says well, we haven't got enough bottles, and he is right. We could generate better numbers with our Cognac, our champagne or indeed with other brands, but we simply haven't got enough inventory, especially in Asia with the Cognac, where the demand is greater than supply.</p>
          <p>But we have a fine strategy; we have a fine team. In the year 2000 we were able to renew all our sales forces around Asia. These are very promising, very strong markets, but unfortunately there is only so much we can do, only so much we can produce. And so we have these technical limitations and that is why in 2012 we could only stick to a moderate growth in volumes, which is out of our control, as some of the market was left to our competitors who were able to step in. I mean, we don't like it but what can we do? There is only so much Cognac we can we make.</p>
          <p>So the performance in 2011, outstanding; the outlook for 2012 is extremely positive for Wines and Spirits. I mean, we are dealing here with a very solid business, and looking at other lines of business which require more creativeness, across the board, we can be extremely pleased.</p>
          <p>We have to remember that the group-wide strategy is to create fine products, ensure that the products meet very demanding quality standards. We want the products to be delivered in a timely fashion. In terms of perfection, these products have got to be as good as they can possibly be and they have to be sold in a satisfactorily pleasant way, sometimes a playful way as well. We can see that in some of the stores, and this has been our guiding spirit over and beyond the numbers of course. The numbers for our auditors, for our accountants, and all these are essential. We need these people, otherwise our share price wouldn't go up unless we provided you with all the very detailed numbers of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange hedges are very &#x2013; I mean, I don't understand the first thing about it. I don't know if you understand anything about what Mr. Guiony says, but this I understand is to do with developments that you only find out after the fact. I mean, our auditors can usually work it out, but it's &#x2013; thank God these hedging operations do not involve large sums of money, but all the same, you have all sorts of complicated accounting going on. But that is in a way part of the story. Our strategy consists in producing fine products for fine customers, but of course when the financial results &#x2013; well, the financial results of course are a consequence of that, and we have to be as explicit as possible about our financial performance.</p>
          <p>Now talking to Bulgari, we asked, would you engage in external growth in acquisitions. The usual answer is no; we normally are happy to grow organically, but you have the occasion acquisition, the occasional opportunity, for our external growth. We &#x2013; even though Bulgari was an expensive acquisition, we survived all right. Our debt ratio is still at 20% so we are quite all right, but the acquisition of Bulgari is an exception rather than the rule, but in any case, there are very few names as beautiful as Bulgari. That could well have been the last of its kind that was up for grabs, as it were.</p>
          <p>So our strategy, our methods have not changed, and we have been very successful. There is no reason to change our strategy or our methods in 2012, bearing major disasters, and in spite indeed of the difficulties encountered in Europe, and they are very much to do with the situations that everybody knows about because issues of public debt, monetary issues, budget and balances, et cetera. Nonetheless, the globe is growing in terms of what the global economy is growing, and of course we want to make the most of that. And indeed the trends are &#x2013; haven't changed since the end of last year so we are on the same trend, and so we are reasonably confident for the year 2012.</p>
          <p>And now, without further due, Mr. Guiony will give you details about the numbers for 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Good evening. So a few words on the key financials for 2011, starting with revenue and then I'll move to the financial statements. First slide on revenue, the details quarter-after-quarter, how things progressed. Starting on the right of the slide, you can see that we had sales growth at &#x20AC;23.6 billion; 14% on organic, 4% linked to scope in Q2, linked to the consolidation of Bulgari and Ile de Beaute, and a negative currency effect of 2% throughout the year. If you look quarter-after-quarter, you see the currency effect was fairly erratic. We went from positive to negative quarter-after-quarter. Scope effect appeared in the second half of the year and organic growth, which is far in a way the most important point, you can see it fairly flat between 12% and 15% across the various quarters.</p>
          <p>The 12% in Q4 seems to mark a slowdown. In fact, that's not the case. I'll return to that later. But there is a one-off effect that I'll detail which accounts for this relative &#x2013; many people would be happy with 12% organic growth in the current context &#x2013; this relative slowdown in growth in Q4.</p>
          <p>The split of sales by geography, I will go through this quickly because this split doesn't change very much year-after-year. We can note an increase in Asia two points, Europe and Japan down one point each, but aside from that it's pretty flat. And the three-quarters balance between the three major areas respective.</p>
          <p>Sales by region, interesting given the current turbulence. We can start with two areas that prompt no particular comment; U.S. and Asia. I've highlighted the Q4 trend to detect any slowdown in these two areas. That's not the case. U.S. growth flat, high growth 18% for Asia deterred an even a higher level because across the year, we've booked 27% growth rate. A word on Japan; you can see favorable uptick, favorable versus the dramatic events in the first half that I won't return to, but at the end of June we were down 6%; Q3, up 3%; and Q4, 2%. We end the year, given seasonality, close to balance. We'd anticipated this. We're happy to see that this was achieved and the rebound capacity of Japan, well, always surprised us, but displayed itself vigorously.</p>
          <p>Europe, lastly. Average growth of 7% across the year. Not that bad, given the current climate. 8% at the end of September; 3% in Q4. And in fact what you need to realize is Q4 was affected by sales that took place in Q4 as the previous year, 2010, in November, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:25) we sold ships that had been built for our own account, and that had a heavy impact on quarterly growth in Europe. If we eliminate that growth effect, we are at 7%. So in fact there is no slowdown in Q4 in Europe. We're on a 7% trend as for the rest of year because the average is about 7% or 8% if it's restated for that. In fact, restated for that at Group level, the 14% &#x2013; rather, the 12% that I mentioned earlier for Q4 would become almost 14%. So you see here, there hasn't been any manifest slowdown in trend. Same thing. So that's the split of sales by division.</p>
          <p>I'll say a word about organic growth. You see that we had organic growth levels double-digit across the board, pretty much. Wines and Spirits, volume growth up 6% with the mix and price effect led to organic growth of 10%; very strong growth in Fashion and Leather Goods, 16%; Perfumes and Cosmetics, almost double digits; Watches and Jewelry, the highest figure in the Group at 23%; also a very sustained number in terms of organic growth; in Selective Retailing, 19%. So that's how we see the split of the 14% that I mentioned on the first slide.</p>
          <p>Same assessment, but highlighting Q4 this time, which shows you how the end of the year unfolded. As on the geographies, no manifest slowdown in Q4. You see Wines and Spirit are exactly pretty much precisely on the annual trend. Fashion and Leather Goods acceleration 18 in Q4, whereas only 15 at the end of September. A slight slowdown in Perfumes and Cosmetics. That's the case notably in Europe. And prudent inventories in the U.S. such that the numbers there &#x2013; growth, rather, is relatively down in Perfumes and Cosmetics in the U.S. But starting the year on a sustained note, Watches and Jewelry, high level of success. Selective Retailing, organic growth 99% throughout the year. Very remarkable. Other activities that I don't show, minus 15%. That's the Royal van Lent impact that I mentioned earlier that accounts for the 12% organic growth in Q4, which is closer to 14% if it's restated for that effect, as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the income statement, I won't comment sales. We've said that growth margin up 19%, whereas sales 16%. Gross margin is up to 56%. That is 1% increased, both to the discount reductions, the share of sales in Fashion and Leather Goods. The share of sales is down. C&#xE9;line, for instance that Mr. Arnault mentioned sold pretty much 100% to achieve 100% of its revenue without in sales. That has an impact on gross margin.</p>
          <p>Selling, marketing expenses, trending with revenues. If we remove the currency impact in that, marketing expenses within the selling expenses in this presentation grew by 16%. Commercial, the cost of our distribution networks, stores, wholesales, up 16%, and admin, up 12%. So this trends slower than gross margin, boosted 22% of gross operating profit. There again the margin is up 1% to reach 22%, which is a record in the history of the Group.</p>
          <p>Other income and costs that are intangible there, we had a cost of $100 million. We plan a future reduction under this site and I won't detail the financial income. That changes a lot. That's because we booked income on the Hermes equity swap. More about that. Corporate tax flat, 30% tax rate as against 31%. Minorities up because of the strong increase in Mo&#xEB;t Hennessy and DFS.</p>
          <p>Net income, which looked flat, but up 1%. But in fact if we remove the &#x20AC;745 million net profit booked last year on Hermes, it's up 34% if it's restated from that effect, which is of course a one-off.</p>
          <p>A word on the split of profit from recurring operations by business group. You can see that all business groups are posting double digits and the growth of profit from recurring operation outstrips revenues in euros. Take Wines and Spirits; revenue is up 10% for profit from recurring ops, which is up 18%. That's a margin improvement of 2.7% in Wines and Spirits. That's a record for the Group. Fashion is the same. 15% in euros, 20% in growth profit from recurring operations. Watches and Jewelry, there is the consolidation of Bulgari. Retailing sales were up 20%, sees its profit up 34%, so that's a very favorable trend.</p>
          <p>A word also on how this profit from recurring ops with the currency and scope effects to distinguish it from organic growth, currency impact, the reason that we have &#x20AC;7 million upside in currency effect for the year, currencies trended negatively. Dollar was down 5% to what it was in 2010, but currency hedges that are perhaps rather fuzzy for some, if I understand it well, gave us a strong offset because the currency impact is neutral for the full year. As to the scope, it's the consolidation of Bulgari which brought in &#x20AC;87 million in the second half of the year and total organic growth allows our profit to grow by &#x20AC;848 million.</p>
          <p>A word on financial income. You're familiar with these four items. Cost of financial debt is flat, involves several developments. Average debt is sharply off following the acquisition of Bulgari in particular. 40% increase in average debt. Rate decrease both on gross debt, we go from 3.2 to 2.7 linked to the rates and spread decrease, but also a higher return on cash. That was one of the problems in 2009 and 2010, where cash yielded nothing. That situation is improving slightly. The effective portion of currency hedges, we expect it to be down but in fact it's flat. Sorry to bring grist to Mr. Arnault's mill. He is not wrong. I mean, this item is totally unpredictable. What happened is that the dollar grew sharply, the euro was down at the end of the year. So that accelerated the booking of our currency hedges so fast that we booked more than we'd actually spend, which is rather absurd. I hope that one day IFRS will have a logical way of treating this but we booked a cost expensive higher than that incurred in putting in place the currency hedges. So I think we can be confident that in 2012, this item should decline.</p>
          <p>Financial investments, the result there is sharply up. Last year, there was &#x20AC;1 billion gain on the unwinding of the Hermes equity swap. That hasn't changed. The item Others is up because of the booking of dividends linked to the stake in Hermes that are booked here. So in total, quite a strong development in financial income.</p>
          <p>As to the balance sheet, while it hasn't &#x2013; it's changed quite considerably. We've had major transactions. There was the Bulgari transaction which led to an increase in equity. We had &#x20AC;2 billion capital increase. The shareholders' equity was favorably impacted by the increase in the Hermes share price, whereas we no longer book anything in the P&amp;L. In the Hermes' stake, all the shareholdings in Hermes are reflected in the change in shareholders' equity. So there was an increase of &#x20AC;1.4 billion linked to the value increase in Hermes that was directly booked at shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>Net debt increased. More about that in a moment. Also high increase in inventories. Two things: we had to rebuild, as Mr. Arnault mentioned earlier, rebuild inventories linked to the growth in operations. And of course, the consolidation of Bulgari Jewelry activities are quite intensive in terms of inventories, but our financial structure is very healthy. Balance sheet, you can see shareholders' equity, 50% total balance sheet, which places us in a very favorable situation.</p>
          <p>Cash flow is detailed on the traditional chart. The cash from operations, &#x20AC;639 million, 17%. It's up slightly less than the profit from recurring operations because of taxes paid, not booked. We had major reimbursements in 2010 which didn't reoccur in 2011. So we dispersed far more taxes in 2011 than in 2010. Nevertheless, it does exceed $4 billion. That's a 17% increase. Not bad. And then of course changes in working capital requirements, significant. Last year we had an abnormal figure. To have such a figure in working capital was abnormal. We have a consolidation in a year of high growth. We have to build up inventories and be able to fund our receivables. So that figure of &#x20AC;534 million isn't too surprising. And then of course the CapEx investment sharply up, more than what I indicated to some of you last year. In fact, we booked with these investments a number of real estate transactions. We had some opportunities this year that we wanted to seize; about &#x20AC;500 million in transactions that are one-offs. So if you restate available cash, that is down &#x20AC;2.2 billion from this trend. That's rather exceptional. We end up level. That's not too different from the 2010 number, which was quite exceptional.</p>
          <p>Debt shown on the slide, it's increased sharply, going from &#x20AC;2.7 billion to &#x20AC;4.72 billion debt increase linked essentially to the increase in dividend and also with the Bulgari transaction, which led us to disburse &#x20AC;2.2 billion, so that's a normal trend. But as Mr. Arnault said earlier, 20% of shareholders' equity sharply up a 23.5, so this debt, 20% of our shareholders' equity, leaving us with a satisfactory financial situation. EBITDA higher than &#x20AC;6 billion. The debt-to-EBITDA, that's just under one year, which is very favorable.</p>
          <p>Final point. The dividend we are going to propose to the shareholders' meeting to agree 24% increase at &#x20AC;2.60. We've paid an interim at &#x20AC;0.80 in December. Over five years, as you can see, the annual growth on average is 13%. This number including two years, 2008 and 2009, or 2009 and 2010, of the stagnation because of the crisis. This is a favorable trend reflecting our policy in terms of shareholder return.</p>
          <p>Thank you for listening.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="ph" /> Bertrand Pinault, op&#xE9;ration financi&#xE8;re (38:47). I'd like to discuss this &#x20AC;2.2 billion operation on Bulgari Mr. Guiony mentioned. Was that the price of the equity allocated for this acquisition or is there, on top of that, Bulgari's debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was hardly any debt. It was a bond on Bulgari, convertible bond, but it was converted prior to the acquisition. So we bought a company which had hardly no debt, no cash, so the total price was &#x20AC;4.2 billion in equity and &#x20AC;2 billion in &#x2013; well, by issuing bonds on the market at the time on the takeover bid. So &#x20AC;4.4 billion, and the debt &#x2013; the bond is about 2 &#x2013; no, it's &#x20AC;4.2 billion and &#x20AC;2 billion in debt. The cost of the debt on this acquisition, it is fungible. That is, we have 3.2%, but there is no reason to believe that Bulgari's specific debt should be more expensive than the average debt. And you said there was no cash in Bulgari. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Good evening. Antoine Belge, HSBC. I have three questions. Number one, regarding Bulgari, can you expect a new strategy regarding watches? I mean, you remember that you overperformed the industry. And are you endorsing the strategy that was conducted in Accessories in Bulgari over the past two years?</p>
          <p>And then in Wines and Spirits, you mentioned the fact that it was difficult to generate additional volume. Will there be an issue in terms of capacity for watches, because I believe that Swatch is going to reduce some of its deliveries, and Bulgari and Tag Heuer are big customers for the Swatch timepieces. And then you have underscored the quality of management, at LVMH. Is it not surprising to see that the success to Mr. Yves Carcelle is not from LVMH?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Regarding the first question on strategy, of course the strategy was confirmed in all types, in all categories, of products. Of course, we instead &#x2013; we insist on producing high-end articles and the strategy is going to remain the same. Regarding the relationship with Swatch and suppliers, well, we are looking to a significant increase in business in watches. Now of course there is less supply coming from Swatch and that's the reason we've been investing aggressively in our own in-house production of timepieces, and of course we are balancing of course external supplies and our own supplies.</p>
          <p>Regarding Mr. Carcelle's success, the only criterion that guided us was of course to find the best possible manager for the job, and then of course &#x2013; well, there are in the company some extremely competent people who can take over such a business as Vuitton. But they already have very successful activities and they are in a very &#x2013; on a growing trend. And so we need somebody who was available to take over the business, even if that person doesn't come from the Group. It was &#x2013; we felt it best to have somebody who just could do the job. Just like creators, we ask why not choose French artists and people working for your companies? The answer is always the same: we need to find the best. And getting somebody who seems to have the necessary skills to generate business, somebody indeed, somebody outside can bring also fresh blood to the business. You have to remember that Vuitton is a complex business. It was run for about 20 years by Yves Carcelle, and Yves Carcelle will be training his successor for long period of time. So I am quite pleased with this new acquisition, this new manager.</p>
          <p>Are there further questions? Yes, sir?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc Willaume, Raymond James. I have three questions. Number one, regarding the pricing policy for 2011, these price increases were responsible for part of the growth. What are you expecting for 2012 in terms of investments in shopping malls? $300 million I believe. Some of the new stores were opened by your Group, Groupe Arnault in Shanghai and some in the United States. Are these things that were taken over by LVMH? And then on Louis Vuitton, you mentioned a number of new products for 2012. Can we have details, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on pricing, as you know it's always rather difficult to generalize. The year was marked, as was the end of 2010, by strong demand and some tension on supplies, so obviously that's a favorable background to increase prices. But we can't generalize. I mean, some markets are convalescing. We mentioned the brilliant results of Wines and Spirits. They're already at the beginning their ability to hike prices. They benefited from a volume effect, not so much from the price effect that will take over in a second stage, but for a business like Vuitton, the price effect was more significant. So it's a favorable context, but I don't think we can generalize on that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shopping centers, these locations where we have stores, for example, we acquired the building in which we have the Louis Vuitton store on Bond Street so as to secure this location long-term, which was one of the finest in London. That's what the investment consists and essentially, I mean, they're not shopping centers that are developed in another structure. As to Vuitton in 2012, I believe the outlook is excellent. Perhaps Yves Carcelle could say a few words on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, there is no change in strategy for several years now. We'd reduced the number of net openings, but however we increased the quality, the size and the appeal of our stores. A few days ago, with Mr. Arnault, we opened the store in Rome, spectacular, in a former cinemas, the oldest cinema in Rome that opened in 1907, closed in 1991. It took us six years to negotiate with the city to build something absolutely outstanding. One of the major initiatives of the year will be the opening of the Place Vend&#xF4;me store. Not just a jewelry store, but also in the same building, there will be a workshop for high-end jewelry securing knowhow, going upmarket and contributing, participating in a very small club of the leading jewelers of the Place Vend&#xF4;me.</p>
          <p>A few months ago, as you know, we acquired the Fabrique du Temps. That's a watch factory in Geneva. We announced a few weeks ago that we plan within the next year or so to combine in Geneva all the watchmaking activities of Louis Vuitton, the assembly unit that's at La Chaux-de-Fonds, and the Fabrique du Temps that's making the movements. That illustrates once again controlling our knowhow and it's in full coordination with our friends from the Watches and Jewelry division. It's the continued strategy. So rather store re-openings, bigger, more spacious, consistent with the growth of our various businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:44) from SocGen. I also have three questions. Could you perhaps explain why margin in Selective Retailing for the second half is down? Okay, we had an improvement that was quite spectacular in the first half. Second question, across the year, we see Perfumes and Cosmetics' margin doesn't improve, even if there's good organic growth. I mean, what's happening? I mean, the campaign with Charlize Theron didn't generate the expected result. You said Bulgari's probably the last opportunity. That's rather surprising. Have you given up on Hermes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before Jean-Jacques gives any answers, the first point, the campaign with Charlize Theron is an amazing success. You probably saw the spot. I don't know what you think, but we are going to win an advertising accolade. I mean, it doesn't mean anything, but nevertheless, I mean, since we launched this advertising campaign, we've boosted sales spectacularly. We are well ahead in France. I mean, last year we were just a few &#x2013; &#x20AC;100,000 ahead on number two. Well, it's another &#x2013; now, it's what, not another number, but now we're streets ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:13).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. That's for other reasons. Jean-Jacques will explain, another campaign. Well, it costs, but no more than any other. But it does I think have an impact. I am sure it has quite a spectacular impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Selective Retailing, yes, margins are down. I think it's 0.2% in the second half. I mean, it's not very considerable. If we remove the impact of the consolidation of Ile de Beaute, which is far less profitable at least for the time being than the rest of the business, well, margins are up slightly less than the first half, but they are up significantly.</p>
          <p>As regards Perfumes and Cosmetics, there you have the detail; by half margins are down in the first half but up in the second half. Across the year, if we remove the effect of deconsolidation of LBD, we have margins pretty flat or slightly up. You'll recall that in 2010, we had 70% growth in earnings linked to the fact that we benefited from a favorable environment at a time we hadn't resumed the commercial investments. We were just coming out of the crisis. So this effect impacted on margins in the first half. But the second half, with the investments that generated revenue and didn't cost, we found a more normal situation, a marked margin increase. So there were two separate situations in the year in terms of comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:07).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think this strategy &#x2013; we've always said with strategy was to have growth ideally above market growth. This year with organic growth of 9%, we've done that. We also have CapEx to drive that growth, but also more one-off CapEx such as the launch of a perfume such as Fendi or expanding certain brands in Asia that are weighing on the P&amp;L. Okay, increase is slight, I agree, but it's always in the right direction.</p>
          <p>On Hermes, nothing has changed. We've never had the intention of assuming control of Hermes. How could we pretend to take control of a company that is 70% owned by the family? It would be something of an illusion. I mean, Hermes is a friendly stake shareholding that is done for reasons that are purely financial at the outset that have become more strategic, in which &#x2013; and in that shareholding, we have no will to be &#x2013; to show hegemony. I mean, if one day the light emerges and we're asked to provide assistance, help or advice, or just synergy, we're prepared to do that. But if not, we're a minority shareholder, relatively satisfied to see the way the share price is increasing. We don't quite understand why it's rising so sharply, but it's better that it's in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're happy with the situation for the mid to long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I could &#x2013; so if there is no opportunity left in the group, irresistible, that was your &#x2013; that was the term you used last year, so we've understood that Bulgari was irresistible. What are you going to do? I mean, the Group is generating &#x2013; has never been in such good shape. It's never generated so much cash. What are you going to do with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, okay, these are rich people's problems. We're going to think about that in three, four years. I mean, take the example, I mean, certain firms. Take Apple. I mean, they still have far more cash than we have, so we still have some room to catch up. And they don't seem them to be overly worried about it. I mean, cash is not a major concern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you want to increase the dividend, have a one-off dividend, share buyback?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I mean, we have cash, so you're an embarrassment to riches. Yes, it's better to have too much cash than too much debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Nicole Vulser from Le Monde. Earlier on, you were referring to numbers that were unfathomable, but I do believe that there was some &#x2013; well, some equity swaps were unfathomable. But you have other equity swaps in other businesses like Hermes in other companies which may or may not be explained, well, what is unfathomable to me may be not to you. Financial analysts conduct very lucrative investment operations. These equity swaps were &#x2013; at the time were nothing more than the financial operations and nothing more than a financial operation. And I must confess that I have plenty of admiration for Mr. Guiony and maybe he has similar operations up his sleeves. He may not tell you about this, because if he tells you, then this might upset the share price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have to disappoint you. We have no other equity swap than on the LVMH share, and we have a few of these for purely hedging purposes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding <mark type="ph" /> Le Jabit (56:20) which is very topical indeed, is that a new law for your subcontractors to come and step in and help industrialists who are encountering difficulties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, <mark type="ph" /> Le Jabit (56:34) is an operation where we &#x2013; I mean, and I explained this earlier &#x2013; where our intention was to increase our capacity. Now it turns out, it happens that every year we hire a number of craftsmen in France, either directly in our own workshops in Louis Vuitton or through our supplies or subcontractors. And indeed, the company is one of our suppliers. Now, when the opportunity arose and that supplier told us, well, look, I am in a position to increase my capacity by saving jobs, well, I felt it was the right thing to do. It was indeed our own interest to give the go-ahead.</p>
          <p>Now, what I have found, indeed the idea was nothing more than that. I mean, I have read funny things here and there, but the purpose was to invest. It was an opportunity to help one of our partners and increase our capacity. The one positive development in the whole business is that when we open a splendid workshop in the Dr&#xF4;me in Marsaz like we did in 2010 and we invite our journalist friends to come and have a look and we show them that the project is splendid, usually nothing &#x2013; we see nothing in the newspapers, neither on the daily newspapers or indeed on the breakfast show in the morning. And for this business, for once, the papers have been looking at this investment of LVMH that has &#x2013; that is saving jobs. Well, I suppose that's one of the positive side effects of this capital expenditure, is that we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:40), we are delighted that we were able to save 90 jobs in the area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yves, I believe I think there was something about Marsaz. We did right something about Marsaz, but was it the supplier who came knocking on the door for this operation to suggest that you should buy up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's what happened. I mean, this is a supplier we have been working with for a number of years, yes.</p>

      <speaker type="a">

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can't really give you too much detail, but as you know, we manufactured the parts of the timepieces, the movements, the bracelets, the boxes and lids, and we are working on other components as well. So this is something we are developing. The other aspect is we have &#x2013; we are announcing new products. That's one thing. And we need to make part of the own production because of some of our suppliers are falling short.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>William Hutchings from Goldman Sachs. Thank you for accommodating me at the end here. Just one question on a smaller part of your capital spends, which is in L Capital. And I wonder if you could give us an update on the strategy of the kind of businesses you are looking to buy. There seems to be lots of headlines at the moment of L Capital's activity.</p>
          <p>And the second question was just a little bit about the trends.  You've had a fantastic year in the U.S. as well as in Asia. I wonder what your outlook is. Can you &#x2013; at least sustainable levels of growth that you're seeing in the U.S. at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>You don't mind I speaking French?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I &#x2013; you have the translation. I will answer in French. Regarding our capital, our capital is an investment fund with a number of partners. It's a private equity fund where we have a number of partners. And a strategy of L Capital ever since its inception, I think this is the fourth or fifth fund run by Daniel Piette. I don't know if he is room. Maybe not. That was not the purpose of this meeting. But the whole purpose of this, these funds rather, is to invest in companies that cannot be part of LVMH because these are brands of a different standard, looking more at general public, the mass market, looking at brands that are more mid-range than high-end. And so we can invest in these brands through that funding with other partners. In fact, we are only a minority partner in L Capital and we of course support some of these investors, general family funds and others that we can &#x2013; well, that can grow. And so these are standard private equity funds operations.</p>
          <p>Regarding the American market, as you know, we find that this is a dynamic market right now. The market has been picking up. Now, we do not know whether this will be a sustained trend throughout 2012. We don't know about this. But needless to say, in the U.S., there is of course a presidential campaign going, and usually that's not when the most drastic fiscal measures are taken, as a rule, so we have reason to believe that the market will be buoyant in 2012 as well. And in fact, January has been excellent, in January.</p>
