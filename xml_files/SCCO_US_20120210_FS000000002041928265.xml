      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Kurt. And good morning to everyone and welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>Participating in today's conference call is also Mr. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, Southern Copper's CEO, and Mr. Daniel Muniz, Group Mexico's CFO.</p>
          <p>In today's conference call we will begin with an update of our view on the metal markets. We will then talk about Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and capital spending program. After that we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on the metal market and prices. During the fourth quarter metal markets continued to be effected by the negative macroeconomic events such as the European recession and the debt crisis. Copper as you know is our main product with 77% of total sales in the fourth quarter of last year. Even though we believe copper demand is negatively influenced by the indicated macro outlook, fundamentals for the base metals improved in recent months due to the end of European destocking, a rebound in Chinese consumption and the structural underperformance of supply.</p>
          <p>Several resources as well as our own commercial intelligence estimates that the copper destocking process finished in both Europe and Asia as I said and the recent growth in Chinese copper imports to about 1 million tons for the past quarter half of it in December, shows the recovery of visible consumption in this country.</p>
          <p>Demand from emerging economies is also growing at a good pace, offsetting weaker consumption from the European and American markets. According to CRU total demand growth is estimated at 2.2% for 2012. If we consider global copper demand at about 19.6 million metric tons, this represents approximately 430,000 tons of additional copper tonnage required in 2012.</p>
          <p>On the supply side production has underperformed badly in 2011 and particularly in the last quarter of the year due to labor unrest, power shortages, adverse weather condition and ore grade declines. We consider that these events are likely to continue in 2012, maintaining tightness in the copper market. Currently CRU estimates supply growth of 2.2% for 2012. It also estimates a market deficit of approximately 400,000 tons for the year.</p>
          <p>Focusing on silver, which <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:50) in the fourth quarter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (3:52). It represented 7% of our sales and is currently our, is currently as I say our main metal. Silver price is average, $31.81 per ounce in the fourth quarter of last year, 18% less than its price in the third quarter of 2011. We believe that silver prices will have a strong support in 2012 due to its industrial uses as well as being perceived as a value shelter in times of economic uncertainty.</p>
          <p>In the case of molybdenum its sales also are presented 7% of the total company sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. Even though we saw a 5% molybdenum demand recovery in 2011, we are still in a surplus market in this metal. As a consequence the average market price decreased from $14.44 per pound in the third quarter of 2011 to $13.20 per pound in the fourth quarter, an 8.6% price decline. At current price levels we're seeing some production cuts particularly from high cost Asian producers. We expect that in 2011 that this will help to balance the market and decrease the current market surplus thereby improving market prices in the near future.</p>
          <p>And focusing now our production and starting by our main product which is copper, our copper mine production in the year 2011 increased by 22.8% compared to a year ago. This increase was mainly the result of higher production at our Buenavista mine which is currently operating at 100% of its installed capacity. Refined copper and gold production in 2011 increased significantly too compared to 2010, allowing the Company to earn copper premiums over spot prices. Total copper production for 2011 was 638,810 tons, of those 8%, about 51,000 tons, were from third party copper concentrates.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we completed all the repairs to the Buenavista property at a total cost of $212 million, thus allowing for restoration of copper production in this operation. Of the total repair cost, $81.1 million were charged to operating costs and of those $81 million, $45.2 million were charged in 2011. For 2012, we are expecting production of copper of about 640,000 tons, of which about 5% will be from third party copper concentrates.</p>
          <p>Looking into Molybdenum, molybdenum production decreased by 9.5% in 2011 due to lower production at Cuajone mine, as a result of changes in grade and recoveries, this lower production was partially offset by higher contribution of our La Caridad and Toquepala mines. For 2011 our guidance on molybdenum production is about 17,200 tons for the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding Silver, silver mine production slightly increased in 2011, as a result of 1.5 million ounces of higher production at the Buenavista mine.  This better or higher production from Buenavista was offset by lower production from the other mines. In 2011, we sold 14.2 million ounces of silver and we expect to sell a similar amount in 2012.</p>
          <p>Going into our financial results and before we review these &#x2013; the details on our financial performance, let me say that 2011 was a remarkable year for Southern Copper. A reflection of this is a record levels achieved by the company in sales, EBIDTA, and net income.</p>
          <p>2011 sales were a record, as I just said, of $6.8 billion or 32.4% higher than the $5.1 billion that we had in 2010. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper sales volume from Buenavista production and higher copper, silver, and zinc prices for the year 2011.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of the year, of last year, sales were $1.7 billion, 11.4% higher than the $1.5 billion that we had in the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase was mainly the result of higher copper sales volumes from Buenavista, which more than offset the effect of lower prices for copper and molybdenum in the quarter. When comparing third quarter 2011 sales volume to prior quarter, copper sales volumes increased by 4%, molybdenum by 4.8%, silver by 5.8%, zinc by 12.8% and sulfuric acid sales by 18.7%.</p>
          <p>Our total operating cost and expenses have decreased for the third consecutive quarter including the company's profitability. For the fourth quarter of 2011, we had a cost reduction of 2% or $16.5 million when compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Basically higher Leachable material capitalization and lower worker participation, allow us to offset higher inventory consumption and cost inflation in fuel, repair materials and contractor services.</p>
          <p>Our EBITDA in 2011 was also a record of $3.9 billion, compared to $2.9 billion in 2010, an increase of $1 billion or 36.4% higher with a margin of 57.3% in 2011 that compares to 55.6% in 2010. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $965 million, 5.3% higher than the $916 million that we had in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.66 per pound in 2011, and this was compared with $1.52 per pound in 2010. Operating cash per pound in 2011 net of by-products was $0.41, making Southern Copper one of the lowest cost producers in the industry.</p>
          <p>Looking at the fourth quarter, Southern Copper's operating cash cost including the benefit of by-product credits was 52.5 cents per pound. This cash cost was $4.01 higher was 4.1 cents higher than the 48.4 cents of cash cost that we had in the third quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Operating cash cost per pound of copper before by-product credits was $1.64 per pound in the fourth quarter of last year. This compares to $1.65 per pound in the third quarter of 2011. The $0.01 per pound decrease in operating cost before any credit is a result of the positive production increase from our Buenavista operation that managed to absorb cost inflation coming from higher fuel, repair materials, and contractors.</p>
          <p>Regarding byproducts, we had a total credit of $382.7 million or $1.11 per pound in the fourth quarter of last year. These figures compared with a credit of $392 million or $1.17 per pound in the third quarter of 2011. As previously mentioned, most of our byproduct sales volumes increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 when compared to the third. And consequently, the $0.06 reduction in per-pound credit that we had in the last quarter were the result of lower byproduct prices.</p>
          <p>Net income for the year 2011 was an all-time high of $2.3 billion, 50% higher than the $1.6 billion that we had in 2010. Net income for the fourth quarter was $537 million, 9.1% higher than the $492 million that we have in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Diluted earnings per share were $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011. This figure compares with diluted earnings per share of $0.58, a 10% increase. For the year 2011, earnings per share were $2.76, 51% higher than the $1.83 of earnings per share obtained for the year 2010.</p>
          <p>Discussing our expansion in capital projects, in the year 2011, capital expenditures were a record of $612.9 million, which represent 26.2% of our net income. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $275.9 million compared to a $127.6 million in the same period of 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Buenavista expansion, after obtaining the necessary environmental permit, construction has started at the SXEW III plant at the Buenavista mine. Some of the equipment was originally purchased for the Tia Maria project will be used for the SXEW plant. This will allow us to increase the annual SXEW plant capacity from 88,000 tons to 120,000 tons. The new plant should begin operating in the second half of 2013, and the project has been adjusted to $444 million.</p>
          <p>Associated with the SXEW III project, we are also building a Quebalix facility at Buenavista. This investment consists of a crushing, conveying and spreading system that improves the SXEW copper production by increasing recovery and reducing the required time to extract copper from mineral. Overall progress is 88%, and this facility is expected to begin operating in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>The Quebalix project has a total budget cost of $70 million, of which $48.7 million has been spent through December 31 of last year.</p>
          <p>The 2,000 ton per year new Buenavista molybdenum circuit is in the equipment-purchasing stage under an EPCM contract. Environmental permits will be obtained shortly, and we expect to begin construction in the next quarter with production beginning in the second quarter of 2013. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:53) a total cost of $38.6 million.</p>
          <p>The new Buenavista concentrator, with a milling capacity of 100,000 tons per day, is in process. Basic and in detail engineering are moving forward at this scale. Environmental permits have been obtained and we are evaluating several suppliers' proposals for the main equipment. Purchase orders for crushers, primary and secondary gold mills and orders have been placed.</p>
          <p>The new concentrator will have an estimated annual production of 188,000 tons of copper and 2,600 tons of molybdenum. It is expected to begin operation by 2015. The total budget of this project is $1.4 billion. Required infrastructure for this project including power, water, loads, shops, laboratory, town site, et cetera are included in the master plan. A preliminary study has been completed for this project.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Pilares project, on October 27, the Board of Directors approved the developing of the second stage of the Pilares mine with a budget of $136.3 million. In 2008 we acquired 100% ownership of Pilares with the intention of operating it as an open pit facility. Current mineral resources are estimated at 43.4 million tons with 0.789% of copper sulfide content and 0.077% copper oxide. We expect to increase copper production by 40,000 tons per year by sending mineral from the Pilares site to our La Caridad concentrator. Pilares should begin operations by the third quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>Also in October the Board of Directors approved an expenditure of a $131 million for the development of the Angangueo mine. This mine is located in Michoacan, Mexico and it's a poly metallic deposit with an annual production potential of 36,000 tons of copper, 4.5 million ounces of silver and 41,000 tons of zinc. The project is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2014.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Toquepala expansion, we have begun the expansion to increase the current milling capacity to 120,000 tons, which should increase annual production of copper by 100,000 tons and the molybdenum production by 3,100 tons of additional molybdenum production. Through December 31st of last year, we have spent 33% of the $600 million approved and project completion is scheduled for the first quarter of 2014.</p>
          <p>In the case of the Cuajone operation, a first stage of this expansion plans that we have for this mine includes the increase in milling capacity and a change to a variable cut-off grade methodology. The project completion of this stage is scheduled for the third quarter of 2012 and it is expected to add 22,000 tons of copper production per year. Through December 31st of last year, the company has spent 27% of the $300 million budget that this project has.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Tia Maria project, we have initiated a bidding process to prepare a new environmental impact assessment study for the project that will address recent government guidance on this site as well as the concerns expressed by the neighboring communities. We're confident that this initiative will allow us to obtain approval for the developing of the 120,000 tons annual production copper project. Assuming the newer EIA studies are approved during 2012 we are rescheduling the project to start to 2015.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, as you know it is a company policy to review at each board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly as disclosed to the market on January 27th of this year, the Board of Directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.19 per share of common stock and a stock dividend of 0.0107 shares of common stock per share of common stock. The stock dividend will be paid with shares of common stock held in SCC's treasury.</p>
          <p>Please keep in mind that shares held in treasury on the record date will be not entitled to either the cash or stock dividend. Tentatively, the dividends will provide stockholders a return on their investment while the company maintains a strong cash position. The cash and stock dividends are payable on February 28, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2012. The mechanics regarding the announced stock dividend will be consistent with market practice for stock dividends and the treatment of fractional shares. In consultation with SCC's transfer paying agent, BCC, and its participant including among others the Peruvian <mark type="ph" /> allies (21:43). The Investor Relations department of SCC is available to address further questions on this matter.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, ladies and gentleman, thank you very much for joining us today. And we would like to open up the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Raul <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:20), thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on your results.</p>
          <p>So Raul, for instance as you have mentioned in the Southern Copper Corporation's meeting with community and authorities, in order to discover Tia Maria project in the next 15 days, what outcome could we expect of this meeting?</p>
          <p>And also could you give more color on your Angangueo project? Will it be like concentrate or will it contain any processing facilities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. How are you, Santiago? On the first question was on the Tia Maria project? I couldn't copy you well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was regarding the Tia Maria project. There has been several papers mentioning that Southern Copper would meet with authorities in the following 15 days, in order to discuss it with local communities. Is there anything we could expect from this meeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically, the company has been in talks with the governmental authority, in order to understand their concerns. And we do know what are the concerns of the local communities, and we plan to address these questions and these concerns through our &#x2013; the new environmental impact assessment that the company is preparing.</p>
          <p>Regarding Angangueo, which was your second question, this is a project that will produce a concentrate that will yield approximately the production mentioned. I will repeat it just for reminding it. It's 36,000 tons of copper, 4.5 million ounces of silver and 41,000 tons of zinc. This is a polymetallic deposit, and it's located in Michoacan, Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot, Raul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Andre Pinheiro from Ita&#xFA; BBA. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Raul and everyone. Well, I just have two quick questions, the first being that I would like to know if you could provide a little bit of guidance on the company's copper hedging strategy for 2012?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if you can tell us what you are expecting in terms of ore grade levels impacts on production this year, that would be great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me focus on the last part. Our production for the year will be approximately 610,000 tons of copper from our own operations. On top of that, the company will process about 30,000 tons of copper from third parties. So the total production for 2012 from copper is 640,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Basically, in terms of ores, ore grades, the company is seeing a regular <mark type="ph" /> deal (25:30) with important variances. We are seeing some recovery from Cuajone production in our current plans. I mentioned already that we have an initiative to improve production at the Cuajone operation.</p>
          <p>Regarding the hedging, would you like to address that, Daniel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First of all, to remind you all that we've hedged for the first quarter 2012 7,000 monthly metric tons at zero-cost collars. We did that &#x2013; I mean long time ago. And it was 350 the put and 518 the call. That gives us <mark type="ph" /> 3.14% (26:12) of our estimated production hedged.</p>
          <p>We haven't addressed that in the board. And as you know, our hedging policy depends on what are the capital needs, what are the capital requirements, how are we looking at stocks and copper fundamentals. And we've done it on a quarter-over-quarter basis with &#x2013; I mean deliberation at our board meetings.</p>
          <p>So at this point, I mean we've only hedged for the first quarter 2012, as I said. And nothing else have been hedged or addressed at the past board meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Raul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rene Kleyweg from UBS. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, and thanks for the presentation. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments in terms of the dividend outlook.</p>
          <p>Given the CapEx programs now up to $1.5 billion, could you give us &#x2013; I presume the intention is still not to use the balance sheet to pay dividends. So if we look at how 2012 will unfold in terms of CapEx intensity, can you confirm that the first half of the year is a bit lighter in terms of CapEx intensity? And therefore, the dividend yield or the dividend payments could be higher in the first half of the year? Or will you be managing the cash balance for even dividend distribution through the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're basically &#x2013; it's a first time that we have given our mix &#x2013; cash and stock dividends.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have acquired an important amount of buybacks in the past. So our board, as you know, every quarter we meet, and we deliberate, what is it the dividend should be based on, as you just pointed out, on the capital requirements going forward.</p>
          <p>And the idea here was to capitalize on the profitable stock buybacks and saving cash for these CapEx programs. I mean of course we haven't been able to expand as fast as we wanted in the past, but we did every year that we could. And that's <mark type="ph" /> part of the ratio now (28:20) for dividends.</p>
          <p>For the next quarter, it's going to be stock and cash? We still don't know. We have to talk about that at the board meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I look at the stock component this time has taken you back up to $8.50. Is there a possibility that you will continue to pay stock dividends beyond that or is that depends on the stock that you buy back in the market or is there -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think again it will depend on how efficient we are at pushing the gap of projects and expenditures. As you know, sometimes there is a lot of purchases <mark type="ph" /> to do before (29:00) and you allocate commitments. And you give &#x2013; I mean anticipated payments for lead time improvements, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So that's how we're going to go in to the second quarter or end of the first quarter board meeting and analyze that. At this point, to be honest, as we mentioned, we don't have any particular view on that. And that will be discussed at the board meeting &#x2013; at the next board meeting.</p>

          <p>Thank you, and if I may, just a quick. We've touched on Tia Maria, but is there any update that you can provide in terms of timetable on progress at Toquepala, and how things are expected to unfold during the rest of this year?</p>
          <p>I believe you've got about $200 million of CapEx on the expansion of the concentrated capacity in Toquepala earmarked for this year. What does that assume in terms of your ability to start moving forward on CapEx spent at Toquepala, in terms of which quarter does that imply spending starting?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for the full year, Rene, we're expecting to spend close to $75 million regarding &#x2013; relating directly to the Toquepala expansion. Beside those, we have a different &#x2013; some other projects that will increase the expenses, specifically at the Toquepala operation.</p>
          <p>But it's strictly related to expansion. And this is a project that relates to an improvement in costs. We have $75 million.</p>
          <p>I wonder if Mr. Gonzalez Rocha would like to make a comment on this.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the only thing that we're having that we're going to a spend in the expansion, after we get the approval of the environmental impact study, as we seeing, as we've taken at least maybe 3 months more.</p>
          <p>In the second half of the year, we are going to spend in the projects, spending around $60 million. And in the operation CapEx, we've planned to spend on the order of $150 million. That will be for Toquepala.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for the call. I just want to clarify what you were saying about funding your CapEx plan. Did I hear correctly that you are planning to fund that out of cash flow or do you have any plans to perhaps tap the debt markets for funding this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well. At this point, we are going to use our cash position as well as cash generated by the operation in order to fund our projects.</p>
          <p>As we move on with the projects and they will start operating, we'll probably consider going back to the debt markets for issuing more funds to develop other stages of our capital plan.</p>

          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, just to clarify the short-term investments, the $522 million on your balance sheet, that's fairly liquid, if I remember correctly. Is that something you could sell to also fund your CapEx plan?</p>

          <p>Basically, that's correct, Jamie. It's &#x2013; they are short-term investments. Considering U.S. GAAP rules, we have &#x2013; at certain point of time, we have to clarify them as short-term investments and not as a cash position.

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hold on one second please. I'll tell you right away.</p>

          <p>Currently the copper average is about 0.5% in our reserve base, that's the average for the open pit mine, it's 0.46%, this includes for Cuajone 0.59%, for Toquepala 0.56% for Buenavista 0.56%, for Caridad which has a very high molybdenum content, it is 0.26%. The average of those, the weighted average is 0.47% and IMMSA's ore grade is also 0.5%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, question please. The trend you stated is on average of 0.5% okay. Say five years ago what was the average ore grade? What I'm getting at is just the overall trend over the last five years sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has decreased a little bit from five years ago and the reason for that we are also considering a higher price of copper for our long-term plans. So that makes that certain parts of the mine that in the past were not profitable now they are. And that's one of the sources for having the reserve base that we have. So, I don't have the number right here, but if I get it through the call I will mention it &#x2013; it was close to 0.6%, if my recollection of this is correct. I will tell you in a few minutes.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically it's a matter of being prudent. We, at the end of the day, are in a very volatile market. And the company has an aggressive portfolio of projects to develop. So cash management for us is important.</p>

          <p>We're &#x2013; we have been very prudent on this since day one and we have this stock position in our hands and we want to provide our shareholders with the value that will come though the shares rather than a cash out from the company that will be applied to our...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I certainly understand the cash preservation logic behind that, but what's the purpose of any in-kind stock dividend at all. I mean there is no economic content; I mean aren't you just cutting the same pie into smaller pieces.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's really the cash preservation that you're pointing out, for this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. All right, and then I apologize I had to jump on late, so if you addressed this question I'm sorry, but I didn't see you had cash cost numbers for the fourth quarter in the release, I did see the full year numbers. But could you share those numbers before and after byproducts if you haven't already?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hold on a second. Okay, in the fourth quarter cash cost including the benefit of byproducts was $0.525 cents per pound before constructing the credit was $1.54 per pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, looks like it's before credits, it's come down a little bit from second quarter and third quarter, is that truly attributable to the full ramp up of one of these or there some other benefits you guys are realizing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, it's mainly the Buenavista operation increase. I mentioned at the beginning of the conference that the company has managed to reduce its operating cost of sales in the last &#x2013; in the second quarter. Each quarter has been lower cost compared to prior one in absolute terms or in dollar terms. But we have basically some cost inflation coming from higher fuel, repair materials and contractors that were more than absorbed by the higher production of Buenavista.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my call and for your various explanations. The mine output rose by 109,000 tons in 2011. Buenavista's capacity is larger I believe 288,000 tons or so. Did other mines experience declines or did Buenavista run at low capacity utilization in the first half of 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the second option. Buenavista was producing under capacity in the first quarter of 2011. In the second quarter it was a full capacity quarter from there on. We had a lower contribution from our Cuajone operation. Cuajone was about 25,000 tons less through 2011, you compare that to 2010. And then, you have a little bit less production in Toquepala and Caridad, but that's basically the source of the difference that you indicated was mainly a difference between the contribution of Buenavista, less slightly lower production in Toquepala and Caridad, and a much slower production in Cuajone that will be fixed in the next few quarters. I'd like to comment also that Buenavista has a capacity of 180,000 tons of copper equivalent considering its milling capacity as well as the SXEW plant capacity as expected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could ask a second question and forgive my high level of interest. Is the current capacity roughly 0.6 million metric tons adjusted for grade fluctuations and the capacity additions about 0.5 million metric tons, to yield a 2015 capacity projected of about 1.1 million tons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Long-term that will be our goal in production to be over a million tons, that will certainly vary based on all grades variances, but once we develop all the projects that we mentioned through the call, our production should be in terms of capacity over 1 million tons close to 1.1 million tons.</p>

It sounds like you guys are not expecting to come back to the bond market until you have some EBITDA coming online from some of your additional projects. So, I am just wondering if you guys have a leverage target in mind and as where you already have quite low leverage ratios, so wondering a long-term target.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as we pointed out, I mean feel that no tapping of markets is needed for this phase of CapEx and for our projects. Of course we recognize that I mean these are good conditions out there and you've probably seen one or two companies in copper production went to the market yesterday. I mean there are great conditions to be achieved. I mean we don't need that and we could just analyze it. We want to tap the markets in the near future. But at the moment we are looking at funding the projects with cash flow.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean we do understand that our balance sheet is underutilized, however, we've been conservative in using our balance sheet, given the cyclicality and the uncertainty that macroeconomic events have developed in the near past. So I mean we'll just &#x2013; I mean we don't have a specific target in mind. We look at how macroeconomic things happen and what happens with the copper prices and the speed of our projects and probably analyze it and take it one step at a time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough and final one for me, just wondering if you have a level of cash that you're comfortable on the downside, so, what's the limit that you're willing to let your cash get down to and sort of this is similar to the prior question, do you have somewhat of cash target for your balance sheet? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Basically, we believe that we can operate with a very low cash position. It's hard to say, but in general terms about $200 million will be a very low limit to have &#x2013; of cash position to maintain our operations with no inconveniences at all.</p>

          <p>Thank you for the follow-up opportunity. I was just wondering what you could tell us on Angangueo and Pilares in terms of a gross cash cost estimates there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Pilares it's going to be at low, very low cost similar to the one that we have for Caridad on a per pound basis. Basically, let me explain and thank you for your question Rene because it will allow us to explain a little bit on this. What we're doing here, it's using a deposit that has been exploited in the past as an underground mine. We will exploit it at the beginning as an open pit and we'll send about 15,000 tons of minerals per day with the ore grades that I mentioned, much higher than our Caridad ore grade and replace this at very beginning of this project, replace a portion of our mineral in the Caridad by Pilares mineral which is over three times richer than Caridad's.</p>
          <p>That will allow us to produce more copper by just replacing a higher content of copper mineral at the concentrator. And in the case of Angangueo, well, it is also very competitive, depending on the mineral that you're looking at if you think of this as a zinc mine or a copper mine, the cash cost is different. At this point, we don't disclose the cash cost for Angangueo because we're still doing some more work on that matter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Basically for El Arco we are acquiring some properties and let me, just for illustrating our audience, let me explain a little bit on it. The El Arco is a copper deposit located in the state of Baja California in Mexico. The exploration work at the site indicates that we have about 1.2 billion tons of mineralized sulfide material with an average copper content of 0.5% and 0.205 grams of gold per ton, and also we have 219 million metric tons of copper oxide with 0.35% of copper grade. These are very ore grades by industry standards now-a-days.</p>
          <p>In 2010 a big drilling program of about 1214 meters indicated that we have another or additional 390 million tons of mineralized material with 0.62% of copper content. That means that we will basically have more mineral than what we thought. So the program for developing these properties has been moving forward.</p>
          <p>In 2009 we identified a water source for the leaching operation of this project, and in 2010 we found four wells &#x2013; we developed four wells to have underground water for the project. The feasibility study was finished in 2010 and we're basically evaluating the next step for these projects. If developed as indicated in the feasibility study, we will produce in this project 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold per year. We are still investing in land acquisition, energy, facilities, and other required ancillary facilities for this project.</p>
