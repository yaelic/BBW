      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for attending this conference call. I will be presenting the results for 2007 before, with my colleagues, answering your questions.</p>
          <p>Let me just say that before starting and for legal and compliance reason, I would like to point out that I will not and we will not be discussing the capital increase, neither answer any questions related to this capital increase, which the trade period of the preferential subscription right stopped, as you know, today.</p>
          <p>So we will focus on the presentation of our 2007 results, which has been audited by our statutory auditors and approved by the Board of Directors, yesterday, on February the 20th. I will not go through the whole presentation, of course, and some of you might have read the whole presentation. I will just comment on the first two slides, and then we'll answer your questions.</p>
          <p>If I turn to slide four, brief highlights of 2007. As you know, we have very good performances in Retail Banking, Financial Services, Private Banking, and Securities Services.</p>
          <p>We had two businesses, which suffered from the crisis -- Corporate and Investment Banking, with write-downs of &#x20AC;2.6 billion in 2007; and to an extent, Asset Management, which suffered from the liquidity crisis, with write-downs and final losses of &#x20AC;276 million for 2007.</p>
          <p>We had, of course, the impact of the operating loss of &#x20AC;4.9 billion, following the exceptional fraud you, of course, know about.</p>
          <p>An important decision in 2007, the decision to exercise the call on the Rosbank. You know also that this acquisition was effectively completed a few days ago. We have now the control of Rosbank with 50% of bank share, and there will be a second step. We'll own 57.8% in the second quarter, it will be completed.</p>
          <p>Despite these two different negatives -- these different negative elements, you've seen that the net income is positive and is &#x20AC;947 million. So let me just say that there is absolutely no change between the communication we made previously on the results -- in particular, the 11th of February communication -- and the results which were audited and approved by the Board.</p>
          <p>I will go quickly through slide five, because you might have already seen this slide in our presentation on the 11th of February. The NBI is down by 2.8% on a like-for-like basis and at current exchange rate, 2.2 if we look at current parameter. And if we were to reincorporate the write-downs related to the U.S. residential mortgage crisis, the NBI would have increased by 8.9% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rate. That illustrates I think the good underlying development of the businesses putting aside these exceptional write-downs.</p>
          <p>Regarding the cost income ratio it stands at 55.3%, operating expenses are up 4%. We've a good monitoring of operational efficiency as you will see for the businesses. Just one word on cost of risk, we'll come back to that, but it remains stable and low at 25 basis points for the Group.</p>
          <p>You see that we booked 4.9 in a separate line and the net income again is &#x20AC;947 million, down 81.9%. If we were making the calculation neutralizing excluding the impact of the fraud, the net income -- the reduction of the net income would have been limited to 20%.</p>
          <p>If I turn to slide six, brief overview of the growth of NBI for the different businesses, it's 3.3% for the French network but that includes the effect of the P&amp;L new provisioning of the PEL/CEL. If we exclude these accounting effects and look at the real performance of the business, the NBI has grown by 4.8% in 2007 and we might come back to that, but it's a performance which is above our expectations.</p>
          <p>We had a very strong growth of international retail at 17.1%; that's on a like-for-like basis and at current exchange rate. On a current basis, it's 23% increase and the fourth quarter was particularly strong with an increase of 19% on a like-for-like basis and at current exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Financial services did also well with an increase of 15.1% on a like-for-like basis and at current exchange rate of the NBI with in particular consumer credit and the life insurance business doing well.</p>
          <p>Regarding Global Investment Management Services, overall a good growth of the income &#x2013; net management banking income. But as I've already mentioned one business, which suffered from the crisis, the asset management while on the contrary we have very strong performance of the Private Banking business as well as these services to investors on a brokerage and Future derivative listed products.</p>
          <p>Finally, Corporate and Investment Banking, again of course, you have the impact and we've tried to illustrate the impact of the -- this 2.6 billion U.S. residential mortgage crisis write-downs minus 32.8% on a like-for-like basis and at current exchange rate.</p>
          <p>We have one good news, which is the increase of the client driven revenues by 14.5% during this year. Again, we might come back to this element later on in your question.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, a look at income ratio. As I've said clearly two businesses have seen their cost income ratio increasing last year because of the reduction of revenues. It's Corporate and Investment Banking and Asset Management while the other businesses carried on with improvement of their operating efficiency. In particular, the French Networks with cost income ratio, which is down by 1.4 point, it is above for again our medium and average objective -- yearly objective, which is a decrease by 1 point a year. And International Retail, which is also decreasing; it's got income ratio by more than 1 point.</p>
          <p>Private Banking also as you can see, all these business are improving their cost income ratio while at the same time, happy investors. In the cost increase there is a significant proportion of investment, in particular in International Retail. The costs have increased by 14% on a like-for-like basis and at constant exchange rate and 6 points out of the 14 points are related to these investments.</p>
          <p>If I look at the cost of risk; 25 basis point, it is stable versus 2006. Stability for the cost of risk for the French Networks; 28 basis points versus 27 basis points. Low cost of risk in the International Retail 44 basis points versus 56 basis points in 2006, 46 basis points for the fourth quarter in this business again low cost of risk.</p>
          <p>Financial services 89 basis points for the full year with as you know the -- particularly strong development of consumer credit, which means that in proportion of the total outstanding in this division, there is more consumer credit every quarter. The consumer credit business has the higher costs of risks than the leasing business, so there is a product mix issue. And within the consumer credit business, it is the component in the emerging markets, which is the most dynamic.</p>
          <p>And eventually, Corporate and Investment Banking, very low provision globally as you can see, again a negative cost of risk in credit custom risks, and limited reversal -- limited reversals going forward. Clearly, we are now at the end of the process.</p>
          <p>Just one word on the fourth quarter results; clearly most of the impact of the U.S. residential crisis has been accounted in the fourth quarter of 2007 as well as the loss are related to the fraud, so we have a net income, which is minus &#x20AC;3.3 billion because of these two impacts.</p>
          <p>If I just look at the extent of the revenues you can see that the trends are very similar to the ones I've just described for the full year, for all the retail banking activities 3.4 for the French network and 4.8 again in line with the year -- the full year when we exclude the PEL/CEL provisioning effect, 19.24 international retail strong and dynamic fourth quarter, 15.6 again totally in line with the full year result.</p>
          <p>In Global Investment Management most of the write-downs in asset management has been accounted in the fourth quarter. So there is minus 7.3 and in Corporate Investment Banking clearly negative revenues, because of the bulk of the write-downs related to the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>If we turn to page 11 the cost of risk as you can see is very similar for the quarter. Also we've -- the trends for the full year.</p>
          <p>That's what I wanted to say as an introduction and we will again with my colleagues now answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have the first question from Mr. Kimon Kalamboussis from Citigroup. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi. Two questions if I may, first there was a question asked this morning on the French call on your deputy CFO, Mrs. Rucar which have now no banking background, did this position exist previously please. And the second is on SGAM please the bank provided liquidity for the client of its money market, money market funds incurring some loses. Can you explain the business rationale and the economic rationale of this decision vis-&#xE0;-vis your shareholders please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask <mark type="Inaudible" /> regarding my deputy and let me just say that I have recruited Mrs. Rucar as part of the operational program in operational efficiency program because I felt that recruiting someone from the industry having a new look on how the finance function can work and improve was a good idea and there is nothing more behind this recruitment. I am very happy to have Sylvie Rucar on board and there is again nothing more to say. When there are talents available I don't see why we would not recruit these talents. Regarding the asset management you know that in the summer, there has been a crisis, which was triggered on generally all the monetary dynamic funds in France. Knowing that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale had monetary dynamic funds is a leader in this market, not invested in any U.S. sub prime asset so in the summer there was no particular problem and we did not have to close accounts. But as you know this crisis the liquidity crises carried on and we saw during the second half, withdrawal from clients, which preferred to put their money in other categories of asset. And for example and let me just mentioned that we had absolutely no problem with our regulatory monitory funds.</p>
          <p>So we saw withdrawals and there was basically two options, again either potentially to decide also to close the fund because again it was not possible to sell the asset in the market. But with the risk, that you can imagine, returns of reputation for the bank, the risk to just also accelerate the process at the end of the day or to decide effectively to provide liquidity. And we felt that, we had, it was better to provide the liquidity, knowing that it meant effectively taking asset on our balance sheet, these assets of our very high quality. Again as I said no U.S. sub prime, we talk about European credit related asset. With of course the risk of certain depreciation but not -- not necessarily losses, depreciation. And we felt that it was better in the long-term to maintain our franchise and quality relationship with our clients.</p>
          <p>So as we've said, we had to take assets on board. We were able to sell some of these assets on the market, but not all of them. And we have communicated that we have in asset management still &#x20AC;4.4 billion assets the end of 2007. We had again two mark downs these assets, and to the level of depreciation, with limited, limited final losses. And we have also like in the third quarter to mark down that the figure is small. The seed money which has been invested in our hedge fund activities in the fourth quarter. So, that's the rational again in the long-term we think it will pay with our client franchise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Thank you very much, very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no question at the moment. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have a question from Mr. Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse. Sir please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm Guillaume Tiberghien. I'm sorry; I missed actually the beginning of this call. So, I hope the question hasn't been asked. But I just wanted to understand why some of the money that you brought or you took out of mutual fund at SGAM ended up in the corporate center 908 million I think, and the rest in SGAM? Can you just remind me, why that is? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the idea was to say -- we left, in SGAM the assets we were considering to be able to sell relatively quickly and with a relatively short maturity. And we decided on the contrary to buy. And here we don't talk about assets -- the states in the mutual funds in the corporate center because it will take longer and we might keep that for a long period of time. So, that was the rational between -- behind the states.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have a question from Mr. Guillaume Tiberghien from Credit Suisse. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Corporate and Investment banking could give us a little bit of a flavor as to how you will compensate the employees in 2008 not so much for '09 and 2010 because you've a given a guidance of 60% cost income ratio, but have you got an ideas as to how the cost base will evolve in '08 in the CIB division? I understand you said there will be 50 million of cost due to the fraud. But should we expect any other impact and also do you consider appropriate or not at all to actually give some guarantees to some of the people in derivative to prevent them from picking up the phone to headhunters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We pay our staff on performance and on market level. So we will put the staff on how much they perform in each of the activities. We, I think that there are depending on the various activities afterwards, we have a deferred compensation, which protect us like for any other bank in terms of being able to keep the staff. And we don't have specific issue in the equity divestive side. As far as picking up the phone, as you said, we feel that the team has a very strong dynamic; sees that it's a client and product franchise are completely intact. And that they expect it to be able to have a year, which will depend of course on the market environment, but to have a year were they can perform as much than what they could do in any other bank and probably more because we feel our franchise is still very strong. So we'll -- if there is anything to do at one stage, we'll do what we have to do. But we have no sign at this stage, that there's no strong dynamic in the team and that there is any reason why we should do anything now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We now have a question from Mr. Cyril Meilland from Lehman Brothers. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Actually, two very small questions. I just wanted to clarify your write-downs on your LBOs. I seem to remember that you said you wrote down &#x20AC;98 million in Q3, and I think the figure you provided for the full year was a bit lower. But I might be mistaken. So can you just tell us what the figure is? And the second question is actually related to the write-downs. Again, it's a very small one. But your -- the addition doesn't seem to be corresponding to the total on your spend where you detail the different write-downs on slide 37. You had CDOs at 1.25 billion, RMBS at 325, monoline at 900. Even if I add 47 million write-down on ACA, I don't get to the 2.57 billion. There is probably something else that I'm missing here, so could you just tell us what it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Pierre, person on the LBOs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the LBOs, when we give the depreciation in fact in Q3, we spoke about the total amount of depreciation and we had reserved and not taken as well the fees on the transaction we depreciated. So basically in Q4, while we maintain the 5% depreciation that we have communicated we basically put back the fees basically on this contraction. The level of LBOs or the total amount which was depreciated was &#x20AC;2 billion out of which LBOs represented &#x20AC;1.4 billion. And we are now on the LBO side. So from the 1.4, which have been depreciated, we are back to a level of around 1 billion, so the 1.5 billion went down to -- at the end of September, went down to 1 billion at the end of December and now total underwriting at the end of December of LBO is 1.2 billion, meaning that we put down on the books a new transaction for 200 million. So total LBO 1.2 billion at the end of December out of which 1 billion is an amount which was depreciated in September and for which we have reserved 5% of the nominal. Afterwards on your second question is how to get to the 2.6 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>2.57?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2.575, I think that we have &#x2013; I need to the do the math in a real time basically. We have 1.25 of CDOs, 325 of RMBS and 900 of monolines, plus to 50 -- 47 on write-down on ACA and Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric with much better <mark type="Inaudible" /> than me can comment for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably 2.522 and there was an additional 50 million, which was written on additional assets in the third quarter, it was included in the &#x20AC;230 million, that was related to the CDO we had structured. So, I think with that you will end up with &#x20AC;2.572 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have another question from Mr. Cyril Meilland from Lehman Brothers. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that will be my last one. I'm just trying to reconcile what your underlying CID revenues were in 2007, just trying to exclude all the one-offs. And so I would like to be comprehensive. I obviously have the 2.572, the 41 on LBOs, to which I have to add -- to which I have to deduct sorry, the value adjustment on your own debt, which is I think 242 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you have the 2.572 plus the impact of pace also &#x20AC;49 million, which is not included in the calculation. You have on the other hand; I think 242 positive benefit from the revaluation of the debt and then mark-to-market of the CDS that we disclosed which is 224. You have -- we disclosed the in the others -- basically, the others which represent 400 and something million, represent the additional benefits if you wish. So it's 400, exactly 499, which is again all the guarantee elements which are not if you wish directly related to the performance of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think after that, if you wish what is impossible to quantify, it is the fact that for example, in a difficult environment we have reduced our risk in certain activities. And I would like just to point out, for example, the evolution of the value at risk that you can find on page -- in the appendix, page 71. We can see clearly here, that we've been able to monitor and avoid the increase of the value at risk in the second half as you can see the value at risk has even decreased compared with the third quarter. And for example in particular on the equity side, clearly, you can see the decrease of the value at risk. But here again, it's difficult to quantify that element, I admit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. So we roughly get to &#x20AC;6.7 billion plus I mean the lack of trading from your lower risks in trading positions, but is that a fair amount? Is that something that you have in mind as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's a bit arbitrary, because there's a -- I mean if we take everything which you did, then we get only everything which makes money. If you -- the full impact of the crisis you see we reduced position on some portfolios you see we had lower revenues on some others and net-net -- the cost of the difficult market environment could be bigger than that, okay.</p>
          <p>But one could say that net-net, if you just take out the write-downs your assumption is correct, and that -- and we present let's say a fair representation of what has been the P&amp;L for the year if we did not have those position. But in a mid-cycle type of average year scenario, I think that there are probably some other adjustment maybe by 3 or &#x20AC;400 million, which should be taken into account. But once again, if you take everything, which fizzes then you end up with only positive things. So I don't know far you want to go in terms of precision or average and mid-cycle scenario.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. I apologize, if this question is already have been asked, I've just joined the conference call basically, two questions. Firstly, can you provide us with any detail on your Basel II guidance? And a second question is on the fixed income currencies and commodities business, if you were to strip out the markdowns that you've announced for the fourth quarter out of the reported number. It would imply that you only made 155 million in the fourth quarter actually, which is clearly somewhat weaker than what we may have seen this time, last year actually? So again, apologies if these questions have already been asked.</p>

          <p>Kinner, hi. Basel II guidance, we -- will communicate on the first quarter with our figures. And as we've mentioned in previous conference calls, we have to now take into account and discuss with the regulators, the impact the fraud on the operational risks and that's something which has to be done in the next few weeks. It is something, which probably will impact the whole industry actually as you know in the operational risk. Banks do not have enough losses -- we have -- when they have selected the advanced methodology, enough losses to have a statistical robust model. And so they have to look at scenarios or external losses and basically, clearly, this event will have to be factored in the calculation. So again, that's the reason why we will be able to do, give a figure but potentially in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the fixed income in currency, I mean you were making -- if I'm not wrong, you tried to make in your calculation reincorporating the write-downs in the fourth quarter, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, through the fixed income line, so adding back to 2.254 to the 2099 loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. From a pure arithmetical point of view, you're right. Afterward, you know, as I said, we have taken a certain number of adjustments in terms of price adjustments in some of our books in Q4 on the fixed income side with widening of the spreads in some of the activities, hedging of some of the books, which we put in place. And additional, you know, potential negative P&amp;L that I was mentioning to Cyril Meilland [earlier if we want to take into account the full impact of the crisis basically. But from a pure arithmetical point of view your calculation makes sense. You know, we have done other things, which are outside of [Inaudible] U.S. residential mortgage area on some of our books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of a follow-up, given that we've seen spread widening year-to-date, do you feel comfortable or do you think there could be further similar type of hits coming through in the first quarter? When you accounted for at the end of year, did you take into account the spread widening that we've seen year-to-date?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we have put a certain number of hedges on our portfolio, macro hedges, or reduced a certain number of portfolio in Q4, which had a credit elements basically and not only linked to U.S. residential mortgage. So the impact, if any, should be much lower in Q1 than what we had in Q4 on these businesses, basically.</p>
