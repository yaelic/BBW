          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the Financial Results for the First Quarter 2012. For your information, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Oliver Schmidt, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Patina. Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call for the results of the first quarter 2012. As always, Oliver will present the key facts and figures to you.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, I hand over directly to him.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good afternoon, everybody. We had a good quarter. I'm going to lead you through the Q1 numbers and I will enjoy them as long as they are great, given the environment, we have some tough times ahead. But let's talk about the things that went well in the first quarter, and I will try to hit some of the questions I have seen in the early commentary that came out right up front.</p>
          <p>The second comment I'd like to make, I'm trying to be brief, but I'd also like the questions to be pointed on the explanations and the economic drivers. We have provided a lot of technical answers in the appendix, particularly on the internal model changes, which we have implemented in Q1. Oliver Schmidt will, after this call, be very happy to address any technical items around like, how come this number moves, this and that, because I think that's a better use of our time here on this call.</p>
          <p>So let's dive into the deck. I'm going to start on page three with the main highlights. Revenues &#x20AC;30.1 billion, while Life is down but still is the second best quarter we've had. Operating profit 40% up, &#x20AC;2.3 billion. Lower NatCat losses have helped, but also a very strong performance in Asset Management, Life/Health. Net income at &#x20AC;1.4 billion and capital position continues to be very strong while we are doing everything we can to further derisk it in parallel.</p>
          <p>Page four gives you the usual overview over the last nine quarters, gives you a nice feel for the Q1 results and page five gives you the equity developments and the growth in the book capital to &#x20AC;48.2 billion, 7.4 billion (sic) [7.4%] (2:35) up. Net income plays a role. FX was actually slightly negative. It was minus 200. Unrealized gains and losses significantly up, &#x20AC;2.1 billion, and a few other items that add up to this number. The stress impact on the right hand side are as usual, so I will not spend a lot of time on it.</p>
          <p>Page number six, therefore, the next at least two years relevant conglomerate solvency rules show that we have very strong solvency 183%, going up further. Now we all know it's not sensitive to interest rates. So it's a partially interesting perspective from an economic standpoint, but in terms of regulatory capital we are and will remain extremely strong.</p>
          <p>Page number seven give you our economic solvency at Solvency II calibration. I spent a lot of time last year to prepare you for the changes we have done in Q1. A couple of comments on that. Number one, we have implemented a whole slew of changes that are aimed at trying to bring us as much as possible in line with the current Solvency II discussion. We're taking a very close look at just what is in the text that has gone through the <mark type="ph" /> econ (3:47) and have abided.</p>
          <p>Second, we did it in the first quarter in order to not create uncertainty about our Q4 numbers, so we have lumped them together in order to prepare ourselves. Last comment, however, we will only know what the real deal is once we have gotten an internal model approval, which is a year after the trial log has ended. We're currently planning our approval process to start for the internal model application in the middle of 2013, and that's when we will exactly know what the regulators will approve of or not, until then sorry guys there is still some insecurity.</p>
          <p>Now second comment is a lot of people have said, that looks great, but the markets have been terrible in the second quarter, will that number not have suffered dramatically. I cannot tell you the number as of today, where we are getting better on the system side every week. As of May 7, that solvency number still stands at 195%, which is really strong.</p>
          <p>Last comment before I go into the number, the most important sensitivity remains the combination of low interest rates and equity markets. But with the bonds kissing 1.5%, we're already in a very, very difficult situation.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move to page number eight where we have provided you with the transparency around what makes the numbers move between year-end and now. There are two components. The right hand side shows you the Q1 movements, which is typically benign market IFRS earnings, and on the risk capital side increasing risk exposure and decreasing valuation rates due to lower liquidity premium. I would also like to point out that liquidity premium have come down significantly and therefore those of you that hated this thing in the first place will know that this more reflects what you always thought were the true economics. Factually we had 96 basis points liquidity premium in Q4 and has come down to 59 basis points as of now, so it's almost halved.</p>
          <p>Now the left hand side shows the major movements both on AFR and risk capital, and I've seen some comments that said we're taking a lot of positives but no negatives, that's obviously nonsense. On page number 69, we have provided you and I think we're leading disclosure here in the industry with what has really moved the impact and what have been the various model changes. All the ratios are as of the end of last year, so you can really go through the numbers and I'd like to point out that we've done three major items to be on the more conservative side.</p>
          <p>The first one is, we have introduced transferability restrictions for the value of in-force of Life portfolios and also where we have minorities limited that to the risk-bearing capacity. The second one is we have become a lot more conservative given what we're seeing with the Fed rates and with the bonds on interest rate modeling, the external calibrations we've &#x2013; which were too benign, we've used &#x2013; now use our own statistical time series again, which are stressing interest rates a lot more than the official data. And the third one is we have introduced Life non-market risk modeling in line with Solvency II requirements explicitly modeling even more conservatively longevity risk.</p>
          <p>So we are trying to buffer up and make sure that particularly on the life insurance side, we are not just taking the gains in particular from yield curve anchoring at year 20 and then &#x2013; of the swap curve and then moving to the ultimate rate at year 60 or, for example, by the full integration of operational risk model that we're so far based on an approach that's more like the S&amp;P standard formulas but does not reflect the things we are doing to improve and run operational risk.</p>
          <p>The Asset Management side last comment, we've also had a charge on that that was not reflecting our true bottom up model, I can only applaud our colleagues. I think we have a much better understanding of what it is and we are not just having one of the best asset management shops, but we also have one of the best risk management shops in asset management and that is reflected here.</p>
          <p>So let me move back to page number eight, and then say what is it? So we had a net decline in interest rate risk modeling, Life non-market risk, operational risk integration, and revised Asset Management modeling bringing the number from &#x20AC;26.7 billion to &#x20AC;24.2 billion. And at the same time, we also had a net negative effect out of the decrease to non-transferability and partially offsetting by the euro swap extrapolation from 20 years onwards.</p>
          <p>Now while before people get too excited and say this is fantastic, now we'll get a lot more dividends out of Allianz, let me please remind you that we have other capital regimes we also need to pay attention to. In particular, the credit agencies have the desire to constantly downgrade European sovereigns and the banks, sometimes, by the way arguing that you need to downgrade the one, because you just downgraded the other one. And that is putting obviously pressure on ratings since we are exposed to both financial sector ratings and government ratings.</p>
          <p>We have had our risk capital relief that we've produced by derisking about &#x20AC;1 billion in the first quarter, seen offset by charges through higher charges from Standard &amp; Poor's and others due to the downgrade. So we are net neutral despite significant risk reduction and that will remain somewhat of a boundary condition going forward. So before you get too excited about dividend increases, let's get through the year and see how the euro crisis continues to unfold.</p>
          <p>Now, page 10 please, revenues development, a couple of comments here. On an internal growth basis, P&amp;C are both from prices and volume, Life/Health down 5%, I'll talk about it, particularly due to the situation in Italy where we had very, very slow sales and on the bancassurance side and Asset Management continues to power ahead with 8.4% on an internal basis. Notionally it's actually 13% and very strong net inflows after outflows in the first quarter, which also differs from the industry.</p>
          <p>Page number 11 shows you that all the business segments are doing well. We have one issue that the Corporate segment, I need to explain that to you, that's on page number 12. Two declines, one in the banking side, not Germany banking, it's <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:00) where we had a guarantee we provided for the life insurance side on Greek government debt after the exchange, we've taken the net hit to the P&amp;L so that the non-recurring item and on the Holding/Treasury side, we have about &#x20AC;18 million non-investment income, typically dividend income from our financial investments, and &#x20AC;29 million in technology investments in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to non-operating items, a couple of comments on the realized gains and loss position, net number minus &#x20AC;7 million for the quarter. The right hand side shows you the various components. To comment here on the equity side, last year we still had ICBC gains in that we don't have this year, and we had some debt changes and realizations in the first quarter, particularly to derisk, on the impairment side there is a &#x20AC;125 million charge on equities. The vast majority of that &#x20AC;75 million, to be precise, is the write-down on our Spanish bank participation, Banco Popular, we've taken in time and through the market. In difference to all other strategic positions, that position we could not hedge due to the illiquidity in the market or other positions, UCI, Commerzbank and others, we are hedging and making sure to reduce them.</p>
          <p>Now the other component that I'd like to mention is the income from financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the second to last line. A part of vast majority of that is &#x20AC;180 million gain on the sale of the Hartford warrants. Let me remind you, the debentures will come in the second quarter and we haven't decided yet, just to preempt the question, what we do with the shares. We're evaluating our options as the year unfolds.</p>
          <p>I'd like to close the comments on this page by pointing out that our unrealized gains, both on equity and fixed income have gone up substantially and we have refrained as always from taking extra gains just to make produce some earnings.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move on to the sovereigns. I think this is now the eighth quarter where I have the pleasure to talk about this. Greece is basically irrelevant, Ireland is irrelevant, Portugal is irrelevant. For those that have a question, we've been also continuously selling down whatever we have, &#x20AC;300 million, &#x20AC;400 million on Portugal and Ireland. We've sold Spain further down with the appropriate position. We continue to derisk where there is market liquidity and we will continue to do so going forward. The unrealized gains position has obviously improved in the first quarter. The second quarter, we'll see the reversal of the trend, but it's still significantly better than in Q3 and Q4.</p>
          <p>Page 15, net income development. There's still always a question why the effective tax rate is so high. Two comments, we had again lower tax exempt income in Q1 and we have trade taxes and prior year taxes that you need to keep in mind. So, for example, on the Hartford warrants, we not just had to pay tax on the Hartford sale, but also on the dilution payment that we received I think in 2009, &#x20AC;200 million we needed to pay extra taxes on, because at that time we were assumed to hold and then convert the warrants. Now that we've sold, that had to be unwound. That tax rate is expected to trend down over the year. We have a plan of around 33.5% for the full year. So these would have been my comments for the group section.</p>
          <p>Let's please move on to P&amp;C. And there were a couple of questions in particular around the accident year loss ratio, which I'm going to address in a second. To start with page 18, you see I think overall a nice picture. Except for Eastern Europe and for Spain, we're growing everywhere obviously at different rates. In Spain, we all need to acknowledge that there's a very severe recession, but I can tell you we have the strongest balance sheet there and the strongest franchise and we will continue to make significant profit in this market. And given our low fixed cost base, we can actually afford to let top-line grow &#x2013; go and protect the margin.</p>
          <p>Now, in France, we are flat on the quarter. We expect slight growth this year, as for Germany. In both cases, however, we're still growing through prices. We also now need to make sure that we grow through on the unit side. A number of other places are growing very nicely, just to explain, AGC&amp;S is somewhat of a one-off through our ART unit. This is not something you can prorate over the year, it will normalize over the year. And we have a number of markets where we are catching up due to very strong price increases, for example, in Australia.</p>
          <p>And we have one comment I have to make on credit insurance. We've actually decreased prices, I mentioned that in the year-end call, and it's actually enlarging the market space and attracting customer volume. So I sometimes see a little bit, how do I say, simplistic analysis that say if the prices don't go up, volume doesn't go up. It's not true. In the number of markets where we've taken prices down, we see significantly more growth. And that's wherever we have good margins, that's actually the right thing to do.</p>
          <p>Now operating profit, page number 19, the huge improvement to underwriting, and that is obviously driven by very low NatCat. We had &#x20AC;700 million less NatCat than last year, which was terrible. And we have some profitability gains in the number of large markets which we really like, particularly in Italy and France.</p>
          <p>Now, partially is that offset by negative run-off from higher NatCat. It was in the footnotes. We have about &#x20AC;80 million additional negative run-off from Thailand. It just took a very, very, very long time to have business disruption claims coming from third-party reinsurance business to the corporate center and that's reflected in the numbers that you see here, that also suppresses the run-off numbers to what you saw in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, let me move on page 20. Overall, a very, very good picture, except for the United States where we're still running at around 106%. For the year, the question always is is the U.S. going to be better? I told you at the end of the year, 2012 is the year of restructuring, so the Fireman's Fund numbers will not dramatically improve throughout the year. We've taken significant reserving action, we will continue to do so. The market continues to be tough, particularly in workers' compensation and property, so that's it.</p>
          <p>On in a number of other places, Germany, France, Italy, particularly Italy, we have fantastic profitability. If you compare that to our competitors, we're probably 5 points to 6 points at least better than everybody else. Spain, outstanding results, as we have them in AGC&amp;S, the UK credit insurance. And Australia is still not as good as I think it's going to be once the price increases come through. So the underlying momentum is good.</p>
          <p>Now, some people scratch their head and say, Oliver, I can't believe that, because on page 21 your underlying accident year loss ratio has trended up. So can you give me an explanation how I get to reconcile these two items? It's very simple. We have a statistical outlier in here because the accident year loss ratio for the first quarter is heavily impacted by weather-related claims in France and in Germany, a total of about 85 million to 90 million that comes through tap water. Last year, we also had that, but in Germany it was in the second quarter not in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On top of that we have effects from the U.S. you saw, and that lifts this number by more than 1 percentage point relative to what we've seen before. So the underlying, at least from my personal point of view, is actually much better than the number looks on this page, and we expect some further improvements throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Page number 22, expense ratio stable, that's what it is. Actually the underlying trend is favorable, particularly in our largest four market. We've taken about 30 basis points to 40 basis points trend improvements, but, again, it's the first quarter and before people relax too much on the expenses I better shut up and move on to the next slide.</p>
          <p>Now average assets base is up to &#x20AC;99 billion, helps us to support the investment income in the low-yield environment. Our <mark type="ph" /> employees (20:08) are doing a great job to get the right yield despite the challenges in the market and you also see that on page 24 when you look at the interest and similar income. Now for those just talking expenses that the investments expenses are up, that's also a glitch, because we've changed some classifications on the investment expenses in Australia. So, no worries about that, that's a transfer.</p>
          <p>Now, page 25 is changed because we want to give you an appropriate picture on what the price effects have been. Now in the past we always used to have two common actual rate change on renewals and then planned pricing, we've eliminated the second also for compliance reasons and cyclically going forward, you need to bear with us we've indicated it with a price trend arrow on the market.</p>
          <p>Now we've had about 2% on average and some commentators have said that's actually a very low number. I don't know what statistics you look at but I can tell you ours do fully reflect all discounts and more importantly the impact of bonus/malus in motor insurance. Many of our competitors publish gross numbers that is before bonus and malus. So, before you get excited about people that tell you they're increasing price by 5%, please read the footnotes.</p>
          <p>Second comment that while the pricing momentum is positive, we are balancing two items. One is the exposure units i.e. one is the wording and the other one is the price. We will work this year both on getting further pricing throughout the year but also optimizing our risk profile. For example, the experience in Germany with our new product show that we're not just getting better pricing but better risk selection which will also affect the claims ratio going forward. So the selection items and tariffing remains hugely important for us and we're pushing that as well.</p>
          <p>Last comment, that even though it's my own slide, page 25, I would like to comment on the arrow in Italy. If I really listen to what I'm hearing from the marketplace, there is pressure building on the pricing so we might see less pricing strength than this arrow here indicated. It's probably more going to be flattening out, as you see in the text on the right hand side. And in non-motor, we still have fierce competition. I actually don't know why people do that particularly in commercial lines. We don't have the rates we need to have, so we will continue to cover risks that are inappropriately priced.</p>
          <p>Again, in many other places, prices are improving. Now let me continue to comment on the credit side. We have some weakening in rates but we are operating, if I may remind you, at combined ratios below 80%. So, we are very comfortable to expand the marketplace and you see that in our gross numbers.</p>
          <p>This would be my comments for P&amp;C. In the interest of time, let me move on to Life and Health, &#x20AC;13.7 billion on the revenue side, operating asset base growing further, operating profit at a solid &#x20AC;800 million value of new business currently standing at &#x20AC;200 million and a new business margin of 1.9%. Now, the revenue side is depicted on page 28 and there are a couple of comments. Number one, you see the significant reduction in Italy and that is reflecting lower sales particularly on the bancassurance side.</p>
          <p>Now, we had a very, very bad start in January and as of the end of February, the numbers have been continuously improving, so the trend will revert itself. While we were about 45% below plan in the end of the quarter, we're catching up with 30% below plan and we expect to get towards plan through the remainder of the year as the funding situation of the banking partners is actually improving and we're getting a better grip on the right products to sell.</p>
          <p>Asia-Pacific is the other area where I need to comment. With the closure of our Japanese business, significant top-line disappears, that's one item, and we have almost irrational competition in Taiwan in the bancassurance side and, therefore, we are very cautious to underwrite. This makes a lot of products with back-end incentives that are problematic I think from a customer value standpoint, do we have remained on the sideline.</p>
          <p>Then somebody wrote we had strong growth in the U.S. It's not what my numbers say. In the U.S., we're basically flat slightly up on VA, but that's a last call before re-pricing on our old product, it was plus &#x20AC;54 million on the VA side and we have FIA minus &#x20AC;64 million. Now &#x2013; and we're really trying to monitor margins and re-price and I will comment to that in a second.</p>
          <p>If you look at the overall structure, the capital strength that we have plays positive on the traditional business side, which we carefully grow but we're moving particularly from single premium to recurring premium to increase persistency which helps new business margins despite the fact of lower spread earnings. On the investment-oriented products, that's more difficult to do and we'd rather let top-line go than sell as a negative margin.</p>
          <p>So, with that, I'd like you to move to 29, where you see the development of the present value of new business premiums, which is at a good level of &#x20AC;11.5 billion and the lower new business margin.</p>
          <p>Now on the margin for full transparency, you also know I don't want to kid anybody, this is beginning of period numbers with the decline of interest rates, the new business margin will also be compressed in the second quarter and that we need to really watch and we have a number of measures into place to make sure we sell only profitable product.</p>
          <p>When you look at page 30, you see the mix of the various markets and the new business margins that we were having in the various segments. You see the lowest number in the United States that actually is the mix between VA that has been trending before re-pricing at about zero and good margins on the FIA.</p>
          <p>After re-pricing, we will get to new business margins for the U.S. segment of 1% to 125% and we are targeting overall to grow the Life business more &#x2013; the traditional Life business, which has 2% to 3% margins. So we are also adapting the product mix.</p>
          <p>In terms of the low interest rates, obviously Germany will be trending down in the second quarter and we'll have to see where that ends up, and a number of measures are in place to improve the profitability there further. Again, Germany has been the market where we move more strongly from single premium to recurring premium business.</p>
          <p>Page 31 gives you the flows. I mentioned Italy I think with that most of the things are set, I expect better net flow numbers for the total year than the first quarter would indicate in particular because we expect the Italian situation to improve throughout the year, the same should be expected for Asia.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, page 32. Here you see the real improvement particularly on the investments side and I would like to comment quickly on the expenses and technical, both look negative. They stem from &#x2013; particularly from adjustments we've done in Germany Life, &#x20AC;10 million from changes in the policyholder allocation for the technical side and Germany another &#x20AC;7 million negative true-up like in France. These are one-off effects that I don't expect to come back throughout the year.</p>
          <p>So, then the question is what should we expect for the technical result over the year? We remain with a target of &#x20AC;800 million to &#x20AC;900 million throughout this year, assuming we don't see major changes in lapse behavior which will affect this and the expense result. Expenses, I expect to be flat over the year at zero.</p>
          <p>Now the asset base grows further and the current yield stays at a good level in terms of the equity that you see here as we have already a positive contribution from our investment in infrastructure. As you may remember, we are investing significant amounts and the first large one we did into Gassled, that's the Norwegian gas pipe, is already contributing upon arrival, I really love that, with &#x20AC;60 million and that has had a positive effect in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 34 gives you the overview of the operating investment income and there were some questions around what happened here. It is, as you can see, in the harvesting side and we had higher realized gain of around &#x20AC;360 million particularly on the equity side and I've to actually compliment our investment managers because at the end of the first quarter we locked in gains through the hedges that we have implemented, both particularly in the U.S. and especially in Germany and made sure that we keep the gain for our policyholders and shareholders and don't lose them with the next market dive. So that is behind the number not an unusual one-off time that somebody would normally expect.</p>
          <p>MCEV development on page 35, nothing unusual this quarter, nothing to write home about. The net free surplus number is significantly down and we need to move on to the Asset Management section, because I expect there will be some technical items on MCEV anyway so why spend a lot of time on it, let's talk about Asset Management.</p>
          <p>Now Asset Management very important, we have implemented the organizational change to Allianz Asset Management and are now reporting PIMCO and AGI. We've also used the opportunity to be honest to clean up some of the reporting because as we duck-in, we found a few assets under management that were actually assets under administration that's about &#x20AC;50 billion that we have sorted out and that's important for you to understand as you interpret the historical development.</p>
          <p>You see the movement on page 38, and I've provided you with quite a few backups in the back to understand what it is. Most important message, no impact on P&amp;L, therefore no restatement of historic AuM figures as shown. It also has no effect on the Asset Management from shifts due to the new structure. Internal growth of total AuM versus end of period December is therefore in adjusted numbers around 5%.</p>
          <p>Now, if we move on to the net flow numbers on page 39, you see a very strong &#x20AC;23.5 billion in the first quarter and page 40, does reflect very high earnings despite a low level of performance fees at this point in time out of other net fee and commission income. I'd also like to point out whatever people say you get bigger, your margins get smaller that's not true, the margins have also improved now to a record of 41.7 basis points on the third party assets. Thank you, very much.</p>
          <p>Now moving to operating profit in page 41, shows you the driver directly into earnings. The operating expenses reflect again the management expenses and the compensation that is fully valuable against the earnings.</p>
          <p>Now the interesting facts come beyond that on page 42 and 43, where you see the numbers for PIMCO and for AGI. We've highlighted with light blue, the new set of numbers that include the total AuMs, the total net flows and the operating profit. Now for those of you that think that the decline in service we have provided you in the appendix all the data you need on the third party flows, I'll give you some example when we go to AGI. So, you see both in the details of the numbers on total AuM on net third party flows. We however believe the total picture is the right one to look.</p>
          <p>Now let me from PIMCO which has stellar numbers to AGI. And just to give you an example on how you can recalculate if you want the third party number, the total net flows look at a minus &#x20AC;800 million, the third party number is &#x20AC;1.6 billion, a positive. So, we have a very strong quarter despite some issues and the Allianz flows that we have had in the segment turned it into negative. So, the third party flows were actually positive. Right hand side, the operating profit, we are targeting after restructuring a cost income ratio of below 17% and the number in the first quarter is reflecting some restructuring costs that will go away over time. So Asset Management overall, a very good story, good development in both pillars despite the restructuring.</p>
          <p>With that being said, I would like to summarize the numbers for the first quarter, a very good start. Total revenues, operating profit up supported of course by lower NatCat, net income &#x20AC;1.4 billion, up almost 60% strong balance sheet. So, we maintain our outlook at &#x20AC;8.2 billion plus or minus &#x20AC;0.5 billion. And with that, I am ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic, thank you so much. Just a couple of questions. The first one, can you talk a little bit about pricing in German motor? You've got these wonderful rate divers for Germany as a whole, but I'd be really interested. And the other question is the &#x2013; can you give an idea of what is the underlying run rate for Life as a whole? I know you explained there's about &#x20AC;300 million of gains, but I am never quite sure how much of that is suited to policyholders. I am coming to number about &#x20AC;600 million but I don't know? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, these were the couple, right with the capital fee, Michael good afternoon. The pricing in Germany we have motor up on the retail side 3.7% and on the commercial side 3.2% and various other items. And as the year-to-date rate on renewals, we will see further effect throughout the year as we hiked up the rate in the beginning of the year. So, it's bringing the combined ratios significantly down. It will, however, remain above 100% significantly this year still because we are coming from a very high level.</p>
          <p>However, overall that will have a very significant positive impact on our combined ratio. Now, I am not quite sure I understood the question on the life insurance side. I would like to remind you of the operating profit outlook that we have provided that by and large gives anywhere between &#x20AC;600 million and &#x20AC;700 million operating profit per quarter. So, this one was a rather high level which we believe will we'll revert to the numbers that I mentioned to you earlier, which I think in this interest rate environment is actually very strong.</p>

          <p>We will now take a question from Andy Broadfield of Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions, please. One, I think Italy was &#x2013; there was a few questions asked about the stages of the distress there on the P&amp;C side, what your strategy would be there? And I think you felt that there was good opportunity for organic growth there, which doesn't yet seem to be happening, is that just a consequence of what you talked a little bit about earlier on the price challenges there? Could you just give bit more color as to why you haven't made more progress there yet, whether that's to come or whether it's unlikely in the current climate?</p>
          <p>And the second question just on the VAs, it would just be helpful to understand a little bit better your &#x2013; the practical implications when you say that you've been writing VAs at a margin of zero I think for a couple of quarters it was dragging down the U.S. new business margins for a while now. Just why that takes so long to turn that slew and what the practical implications are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andy, now let me start with Italy. We are really pushing hard now to grow the units, and after we've really achieved the position where we have the best reserve position and the best profitability in the marketplace. Since we have been fairly aggressive in addressing the agencies that were underperforming, it takes quite a while to re-motivate them, particularly in the present environment, to give us more top line, but I expect units to improve through the course of this year. The distribution forces do not react as quickly as management would often like it to be.</p>
          <p>The second thing is there's also been a lot of insecurity in the marketplace and amongst clients on what to do given the distress was <mark type="ph" /> Bonsai (39:08) which I hope will also clear up over the course of the year. So we remain optimistic around growing the top line in Italy in P&amp;C this year.</p>
          <p>Now on the VA side, as we said, we very carefully looked at the results, particularly of the fourth quarter, where not only the in-force business was producing the expected loses, but even the business that we wrote after 2009 recorded a loss. And then, very quickly moved to re-price a number of features, get write-up fees up, reduce fund choices and so on. And the issue is that, as you may know, all of these changes need to be filed with regulators in the U.S., that takes about eight weeks to ten weeks at a minimum. So the re-pricing will happen effective in May, and that's why we had some of the last call effect in March that you see here in the numbers. The market will remain extremely tough given the very, very low level particularly on the long end and significant volatility and, therefore, the high cost of hedging the riders.</p>
          <p>Now, we are looking at this extremely carefully and trying to write only the volumes we need to write to support our franchise, but there will be no gross driver here. I personally expect, however, over the course of the year, and that's somewhat of a bet, the situation to improve significantly. So the 1% to 1.2% new business margin is what we absolutely have to see. Now, by the way, also for economic reasons, our cost of capital is at around 90 basis points to 1 percentage points. So that's the margins we have to see across the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's no other operational techniques to slow the distribution down in that interim period where you're seeking to file changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's very difficult to do because you typically have last call effects through your distributors in every channel, particularly in broker dealers. But if you compare what we do relative to what others do, we are actually &#x2013; let me choose words carefully, strongly advanced in managing the distribution down. There's another thing that we are doing in addition that is actually supporting the changes that are happening on the FIA side, if you have another minute, even though I wanted to give you a short answer, because we are &#x2013; with the necessity to register FIAs with registered reps, we are successfully convincing the more sophisticated sales forces to sell FIA and traditional Life products in addition to VA. This takes a while and we support that transition to the minimum needed with VA.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Hocking of Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Could I ask a few questions on Solvency II, please? What is the ultimate forward rate you're using for the curve in Germany on the Life side? And can you just comment a little bit on what the most uncertain areas are from your point of view that are outstanding based on standard forming also in your negotiations above the internal model? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't received &#x2013; to be honest, I haven't really fully understood the second part of your question. Well, the only thing I understood what the ultimate forward rate, which is 4.2%, so that much I can answer off the cuff. You...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the second part was about where do you think the most uncertain areas are in the current draft.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, the most uncertain area is what, if any, will be the substitutions for the liquidity premium that was introduced with QIS4 and QIS5 as a counter effect to the high volatility and as a reflection of the illiquidity of our liabilities. Remember, the purpose that insurance has in society is not just to transfer risk from an individual into a community of risks, but also provide illiquid liabilities that you can then invest for the long run and ignore short-term volatility. Unfortunately, Solvency II, because it's modeled on stupid Basel II principles has failed to get that appropriately in. The industry tried to do that with the liquidity premium that has been not so successful. And now the question what will be the substitute, because our liabilities, just to take P&amp;C as an example, are indeed illiquid and, therefore, a full mark-to-market modeling of the liabilities is not appropriate.</p>
          <p>We, at this point, do not know whether and how there will be a CCP. We have a joint industry position. We have particularly said we need predictability, i.e., it needs to be formula-based and not based on some whim of some bureaucrat sitting in some agency somewhere. And the second thing is we need to appropriately reflect, and that's in the matching adjustment and that's not an add-on but an either/or, the illiquidity of our liabilities that again is most easy to answer for all P&amp;C liabilities.</p>
          <p>You might remember that very few clients burned their houses on purpose in order to get cash from an insurer or drive their cars into the wall. And on the life insurance side, we have large amounts of products that have <mark type="ph" /> factor load (45:07) prevention of surrenders and therefore do not need to be worried much about spread movements. This is unclear what's going to happen and this is the most important thing that needs to get reconciled. To be honest, even though I'm trying to see it perform, I can't tell you where this is going to come out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify, on slide 69, one of the reconciling items had mentioned the mitigating effect of the counter-cyclical premium. So you are giving yourself the benefit of CCP even though it's contingent at the moment?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Oliver. A few questions, please. On the U.S. non-Life business, you talked about further reserve additions in the quarter. Could you quantify how large they were? And I guess it's the usual suspects in terms of lines of business, but maybe you'd give us some detail on that? And the expense reduction program, I think is the core part of the improvement plans over the long-term, how is that going? And on the pricing, thank you for making that important point about the pricing that you get being net of Bonus/Malus. What will be interesting will be to give the figure gross of that effect so we can see what the difference is and then perhaps compare you more easily with some competitors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Number one, we don't disclose individual line of business reserve additions. What I can tell you is that worker's compensation in the U.S. remains an issue because medical inflation, particularly in the state of California is trending significantly above long-term averages. We haven't done dramatic reserve increases in the first quarter. We are just bringing the accident year loss ratio up as we're taking higher loss picks, as expected. And I cannot exclude that further reserve reviews throughout the year might require reserve additions. However, no firm numbers have been determined.</p>
          <p>We need to look at the reserve reviews in the second quarter and the third quarter to look at that. My overall point is some have been betting on the U.S. numbers to be dramatically improving throughout 2012. I'd like to remind you of what I said at the end of 2011, the U.S. will remain a challenge for all of 2012.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of the gross of Bonus/Malus, I actually do not know. We'll try to look that up and I will get back to you on that because we have different Bonus/Malus crediting rates across the various countries and we have made it a good, I think, practice to exclude them for quite a while. I just happened to find that out because we have new colleagues on the board and some of them coming from other companies where they have other practices.</p>

          <p>We will now take a question from Brian Shea of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. First of all, on your net price increase of 2%, I'm just wondering how that compares to claim inflation? In other words, as we look out a year or two years, can we hope that the price increases are enough that they alone should be driving a better combined ratio, or is it the case that you are really just kind of breaking even with respect to claim inflation?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, PIMCO had a very good quarter. Nevertheless, the incentive payments were also low in the quarter. There we hoped that we're getting towards the end of the unit expenses being high. Maybe you can just tell us what the schedule is for incentive payments going forward over the next year or so? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in order to understand the net effect of claims inflation and pricing, if you take the dynamics over the last four quarters, we had about 10 basis points to 20 basis points net productivity gain of prices over that. Only this quarter because of the tap water claims and a few others, this number is somewhat distorted. So, if you'd take the average. The second thing is while you <mark type="inaudible" /> (50:04) compute when we set the results and the prices were 3%, we are also structurally changing the portfolio. In my estimates, we have about a continuation of this 10 basis points to 20 basis points productivity improvement over the next four quarters to five quarters, however with oscillation around that number. So to summarize, we should see a positive effect of prices net of claims movement. That's at least what is in our plans, let's see that our operators deliver that.</p>
          <p>Now on the B-units, we have about &#x20AC;200 million remaining costs to come and the cash outflow because we have been reserving for some of them already is around &#x20AC;700 million. So, Brian, that's a small number relative to the cash earnings that we're getting. So it's really true, we are coming to the end of the story. Now, the programs launch in 2016 but the numbers are going to get less and less and less relevant.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends &#x2013; let me just remind you what the driver is, the operating profit growth, which in the first quarter was below what we historically had, that's why we had a lower multiple. Remember we have two types of multiples that kick in. So I don't know what the number is, but somebody will soon tell me.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, good afternoon. Two questions, first on Fireman's Fund, I would like to get a better understanding on what's going on. You mentioned there are some reserve additions, should we expect that this reserve additions coming through every quarter, why don't you do it in one hit if they are expected anyway. And can you give us also restructuring &#x2013; an update on the restructuring measures that you have taken how do they work? How do they perform?</p>
          <p>Second, on the risk result in Life/Health insurance, which has come under pressure in this first quarter, can you give us the reasons for this, of course, I understand that you have a huge portfolio here. But maybe there is &#x2013; there are some reasons? And also, do recently written contracts offer higher risk results or is there competition which drags down the risk result going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the first thing I'd like to mention is that we &#x2013; this is statistical noise. Sorry to disappoint you, but there is no extrapolation of the first quarter that makes any sense for the annual result. There are a number of true-ups we've done in Germany and one or two countries that had a negative effect here. I expect more positive development throughout the year. As mentioned earlier, we should get to the &#x20AC;800 million, &#x20AC;850 million minimum risk results for the year. So that's what you should bear in mind and there's going to be volatility around that, as we do update and the risk results are not coming down.</p>
          <p>We're actually incentivizing, taking better risk results going forward and there would be more incentives in the portfolio and for our sales forces to sell risk product. However, let's be very careful in the 25 years that I've seen in the industry, whenever interest rates were low, people were piling into disability and other health products to &#x2013; just five years later wake up and be settled with huge losses. So what looks like a good new business margin now turns out to be a significant headache later.</p>
          <p>Now, second comment I have on the Firemen's Fund. We have already done a huge reserve addition exercise last year. I was personally involved with Oskar Buchauer, our new Chief Actuary. We've done everything that the data at that point in time indicated. Now in the meantime, the U.S. market in some areas has actually further deteriorated and we are doing our reviews as we speak and in the second quarter, you'll have more information to come. How is the restructuring proceeding? We have two items; number one is addressing the cost base.</p>
          <p>Our loss ratio in the U.S. is actually fairly good, but the issue is scale and a very significant cost base. The costs have come down significantly already in the first quarter and we have cost reduction plans in place for the remainder of the year. So far they are working as planned. The other one we must take rate particularly on the property side in commercial lines and where we can't take rate we need to let the risk go.</p>
          <p>The U.S. market is still not where it needs to be, but they're first signs of rate strengthening in property. The liability lines are more of a problem still, not just workers' compensation and there we are separating ourselves with the number of segments that are not producing the appropriate returns. I'm very confident I met with my colleague Gary Bhojwani yesterday, that Gary and team doing exactly the right things to fix the ship.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, hello. Two questions please. First one, my favorite one on slide 35 where you got your MCEV, could you tell us how much of the MCEV is not recognized on the IFRS balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wanted to please you, Oliver. And then secondly, while I got my nerd hat on, on slide 42, I'm just interested when you're showing your three-year outperformance as you flag, there has been an adjustment how you calculate it and that kind of implies the three-year outperformance in PIMCO has improved to that 96%.</p>
          <p>At the end of last year the data on a like-for-like basis is showing a deterioration. And so, I'm just wondering, is there a genuine improvement going on, or is it just the numbers have changed and could you just try and give us like-for-like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There is a genuine improvement because we had &#x2013; VA was down and then come back up because of our Master, Bill Gross, really found the recipe again. So it's back up and it's a genuine improvement.</p>
          <p>Second, the number of the shareholder value not accounted for IFRS equity &#x2013; sorry, for the last call, I just didn't understand the question, but that was my fault, has moved from &#x20AC;1.677 billion in the first quarter of 2011 to &#x20AC;2.645 billion in the first quarter of 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. First of all, on the Life business, earlier during your comment Oliver to a number of initiatives you are taking to protect new business margins in the second quarter, something in the call you talked about what you are doing on your U.S. VA book. Is there anything else that you are doing to prevent this sort of pressure on the new business margin? And then a second question on the P&amp;C business. So you recorded price increases of 3.8% in the quarter in France, one of the markets with the strongest rate momentum. How sustainable do you think these rate movements are going to be in the French market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the second, I don't know. I only know what the facts are and that we are trying to take rates particularly on the commercial line side. We will have to see how the market reacts. Currently it has been supportive. So from what I know for the second quarter, we have some more positive momentum, but I cannot predict anything for three and four.</p>
          <p>Second on the Life business, the laws of physics will hold, gentlemen, right. So people that tell you that this interest rate environment, new business margins can be protected in a way that they will not come down, that's unrealistic. With the record low interest rates, particularly in Germany and the U.S., we will see some further decline.</p>
          <p>Now what are we doing? The first one is in Germany to give you a couple of examples to make sure that we have the right mix between single premium and recurring premium. We have been deemphasizing single premiums particularly in the corporate side and moving to recurring premiums also because competitors are willing to price risks at different prices than we priced at.</p>
          <p>Now the corporate clients are more sensitive to the lock-in bonuses that gives me the second point. In Germany, you can decide whether your lock-in bonuses on an annual basis or you move it to the final bonus account.</p>
          <p>Moving it to the final bonus account has two advantages, you can claim them back and secondly the account is risk capital that is not highly appreciated by large corporate clients, but makes huge impact in terms of profitability. We're rather for going price elastic corporate money and protecting our capital and our margin, that gives you as two examples of what we do.</p>
          <p>In France, for example, we are pushing very hard, the Health side on the businesses that we do understand their relative to plain vanilla business, so we are doing a number of things across markets to protect the margin as much as possible. But again, you know me, I don't give you the loony thing, the margins will come down in the second quarter relative to what we have seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take a question from <mark type="ph" /> Arnold Karenosk of Schafer (1:01:02). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon to everybody. I have just one follow-up question, the Life business. My question was very similar to the former one. I saw the sensitivity table of your live TV at the end of 2011 and your German new business spread. You should go down by 84% in the case of 50 basis point decline of interest rates. Now my question is is it possible that you will gear up to some premiums in order to defend your margin in the future, so likely to reducing materially your single premium?</p>
          <p>The second question is on dividends. You mentioned at the early before in the presentation that it's too early to pay and to increase the dividend given the uncertainty. But let's assume that the Solvency II final framework will be quite favorable for the industry, do you think that you could revise upward your payout ratio of roughly 40%, as you used in the past? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would like to reiterate a couple of points on the dividends. Let's start with that. Number one, in normal years, we have always said we have about a 40% distribution because we believe we can invest the money profitably. That might change between segments, i.e., more in P&amp;C and Asset Management versus <mark type="ph" /> less and Life (1:02:40) depending on what the interest rate environment is in more end markets where we can take strong margins, like Eastern Europe, for example, than mature markets. And people have every incentive to produce positive margins. We don't give any credit. And actually if people want to sell business at business margins of zero or below, they need explicit permission from the corporate center to actually do sell, just to be very clear, right. They may have severe consequences if people are selling at negative margins. I think this is really important.</p>
          <p>The other thing is that is always a beginning of period number. You need to think through what that means as it moves over the quarter. That's why I said some of those numbers will go down. And yes, as you see in our top line, we are prepared to let top-line go in order to protect the bottom line. We'd rather be fully transparent as opposed to having super optimistic assumptions.</p>
          <p>Now, the other thing I'd also like to say in terms of new business margins, just to put a little bit of salt on the whole cake here, I see a lot of new business margins that are consistent with the MCEV framework but have very interesting policyholder behavior assumptions baked into that you as an investor cannot really challenge. So whether that's lapse assumptions and all kinds of other things, we try to be extremely conservative on those and don't try to have businesses that look good, having high new business margin, but assume 40% to 50% lapse ratios that either create a problem if they don't come for shareholders and, if they come, create a issue from a regulatory standpoint. So just as an industry observer, I would like to say that we need to strike the right balance between customer benefits and shareholder benefits and we do not want to sell products that are ripping off clients, just to pull it bluntly.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move &#x2013; and then you had another question, I think dividends. I think we've addressed for now. Again, let's see how the year goes through and a final reminder, in Germany, we have the Supervisory Board deciding what the dividend proposal is.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thank you very much. I just had a couple of questions. First is, coming back to U.S. Life and the big decrease in the margin. I wondered, can you tell us how much is due to the variable annuities and how much to other products? And can you also say again what exactly it is that you've changed in the re-pricing of the products?</p>
          <p>And then a second question is looking at economic solvency, I wondered whether the rather high sensitivity to interest rates excludes the use of the RfB? And I ask the question just because I would have thought the RfB as a capital buffer would be much more effective in neutralizing interest rate risk. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the guys are looking up the details for what the re-pricing measures are. I think this was a host of things, Nick, that was done on VA, so for example increasing rider fees, limiting fund choices, I think there's a whole...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...slew of things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you take your guarantee rates down, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we have done some adjustments in terms of rollout rates and so and so forth. I'll give you the details in a second while the team is looking at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you can compare to what others have done, I think that's the background. I'm more comfortable with the choices because, again, I don't want to bank on behavioral assumptions being more benign than really hedging results and others.</p>
          <p>Now on the RfB use in Germany, RfB generally is an accounting construct, and the interest rate sensitivity is based on an economic view. Now, we do have the ability to use the fee &#x2013; policyholder funds to, of course, support times of low interest rates. And by the way, it also supports new business stream as this is available for funding. Now &#x2013; and it's really, really important to understand that this gives us a huge competitive advantage in the industry.</p>
          <p>The second thing that is also coming in on local GAAP accounting is the additional low interest rate reserve, which is hitting a lot of competitors with huge amounts as the numbers come down, because we can fund them not just through superior investment income, but also the way the reserves are being used and allocated to policyholder funds. So it's not just a general observation on interest rate risk, but, in particular, it helps us to produce more attractive returns to our policyholders relative to what the competition can do.</p>
          <p>On your specific question on the U.S., what the new business margins have been in comparison separated out between VA and the fixed index annuity, which are the two largest lines, the fourth quarter numbers, as a reminder, were 84 basis points on the VA and 1.9% of the fixed index annuity for a total of 1.6%. In the first quarter, the VA number, as said earlier, trended towards zero, the FIA had 1.08%, for a total of 80 basis points. And that's why we instituted the re-pricing to bring the total back to 1.25% as of May.</p>
          <p>We have two or three major items that were implemented to limit the choice to less volatile funds, to increase the rider fees and to, in particular, increase the guarantee fees. And by the way, not just on new business, but also on the in-force. I hope that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's very helpful. Just very quickly on the RfB just to clarify, it is not used as a risk mitigant in your interest rate sensitivity, in your economic solvency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is indeed used.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is indeed, okay. So it is used, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. But the sensitivity does seem to be very high considering that you've all of that RfB, &#x20AC;14 billion or whatever it is, but that's how the numbers work out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and the business, given the duration gap that we've historically had, that's how the numbers move because of the very high convexity. Now, just to address that, we have put a program into place to lengthen the duration, a part of by the way of the increase we had on the Italian Govies is coming from that duration lengthening program that will reduce the mathematical sensitivity of the number.</p>
          <p>Now some people will say, well, you're taking more credit risk on that. We're taking more credit spread risk, I don't think default risk. And because of our strong RfB position, this is by the way another aspect we can afford to take that risk without having to worry and still get the economic benefit of slowly but surely closing the duration gap.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, now, by the way, were you referring to the shock, Nick? Because I'm really trying to answer your question precisely. Were you referring to the shock scenarios? If you were referring to the shock scenarios, I'd just like you to be reminded of the fact that we don't anchor the rates in the shock scenarios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking of, the interest rates moving down by 100 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we don't really anchor it, so the anchoring effect is not in there because we want to provide a more honest perspective. Thank you for asking that and, Tom, thank you for making that point. We would understate the risk effect if we were then sort of in parallel, then it would not be a stress, right. Doesn't make any sense. So whether you believe me or not, we're really trying to provide a fairly pure economic view on what the stress scenarios are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the full effect then of capital cushion is not really included, not fully included?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the question is do you have a short-term shock or do you have a longer term decline? What most people are worried about is not the short-term shock, but the longer term decline in the Japanese scenario. And then the question is whether rates will come back. And we had the argument in the past and I'd like to reiterate that we need to worry about the next 10 years to 15 years and what happens to interest rates, maybe 20 years, but worrying about cash flow that will happen once on long dead and my children will be retired, I personally believe from how I managed the book is in terms &#x2013; at least in terms of modeling less relevant to make sure that we have the cash flow to support the guarantees and maybe let me reiterate that I have everybody on board.</p>
          <p>And despite trying to give short answers, the key thing is in a 1.5% interest rate scenario that we're in, do we ever have a problem in Germany to honor our guarantees, and the answer is, never, okay.</p>

          <p>We would now like to take a question from Christian Muschick of Silvia Quandt Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's Chris Muschick from Silvia Quandt Research. Thank you for letting me ask the question. This quite nicely melts into the previous question. So what's &#x2013; yeah, how do you rate to the current low interest rate environment, especially in German life? So would it be fair to assume that you further increase your loan portfolio, loan investments, mortgage investments, and so what to model as an &#x2013; yeah, a new investment yield kind of &#x2013; yeah, that would be really great to know? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're doing quite a few things, and you might have observed that. Number one, the first thing that is very important is what do we not do, that is buying bonds by and large, because we really believe that a bubble has been built there quite significantly like in the U.S. And then it is very important to understand what are we investing at, what are the yields that we are earning on new money and they are significantly above what we need for the guarantees. On the Life side, that's 3.5% and that is what we are looking for.</p>
          <p>And the second thing is, we are trying to find the right mix. We are really looking at expanding the covered bonds in the corporate side and then some by some <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:14:28). We're expanding the real estate side and in particular like to do more on infrastructure. And on the lending side, we confine ourselves by and large to real estate lending, which by the way we have about 40 years in history of doing.</p>
          <p>Now, people are saying, why haven't we done it in the last 10 years, now why are you back? Let me give you may be an interesting answer. When we were doing the lending, the bank had about the same leverage in their balance sheet as we had, 1 to 10, and then they moved from a leverage of 1 to 10, where they still are today, to 1 to 30 and because of spreads seemingly disappearing they had applied very low cost of capital. Even then they lower prices on the lending even further, because some of the large banks will let cross-subsidize the lending and make the money on the investment banking fees.</p>
          <p>Now, that was before 2008. What we now see is deleveraging the cost of capital from the capital amounts going up, cost of capital for banks going up dramatically and that's a very, very important, no more cross subsidies of credit businesses. Now, clients don't find that to be very attractive, but at the same time we need to acknowledge that credit pricing was far below where it needed to be. And where now rates are appropriate relative to the risk and the equity capital that we economically need to apply, we go back in and find more rational competition today than we saw in the past.</p>
          <p>On top of that, you have deleveraging even of some good assets in the banking side as banks have to repair the balance sheet and not just get more capital and get more liquidity since we are ideally positioned with our long-duration liabilities particularly on the Life side, we are very happy to do long-term lending if the appropriate returns are there and the appropriate securities.</p>
          <p>Sorry for the longer winded answer, but that's why we are looking at it, again, not because it's new, but we now find more appropriate conditions to do the lending. I actually expect more to come, because initially we've now seen over the last year lot of higher sale assets with problematic risk return profiles and we're not in the, how do I say that, voucher fund business, that's for others to do. We want really good assets at the appropriate prices with nice duration and we haven't seen too much of that yet. I believe with further deleveraging on the banking side having to happen, there will be more supply of good assets for us to take a look at. I hope that answers your question.</p>

          <p>Yes. One short after what &#x2013; so you wouldn't rule out or you look at portfolios which are on the market let's say, for example, from Eurohypo or stuff like that and if pricing would be correct you would consider buying that?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure. Just was an example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We constantly look at portfolios. To be honest, again, we haven't found appropriately priced risks on the in-force, because the in-force book of banks often is mispriced and it's very tough for a bank to sell a mispriced credit book, because they would then have to give us money on top. It hasn't happened yet, might happen. We rather look for new business that is appropriately fast.</p>

          <p>More common sense than brilliant, but &#x2013; all right. Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Thomas Seidl of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. Two questions on the non-Life side again. I think you let us through the premium and the rate change country and I think it looks like in Germany and France, Allianz continues to lose market share and I think I heard you saying that you expect some change there. I wonder what type of actions you have planned and sort of what time table you're looking at here. And the other question on non-Life was, on the assets backing the liability, slide 23, given the short duration, or the shorter duration compared to Life side, shouldn't we expect that bit of more of a decline on the fixed interest income? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me answer the last question. The current yield on the P&amp;C side indeed is around 3% i.e., lower than what we see on the Life side, and that's the first question. And again, we are being impacted here by what we see. I personally believe we should go longer in the duration because of the stability of the cash flow that's not quite consistent with what Solvency II says, but is more consistent with economic thinking, because of the stability that we indeed have. And we have done some of duration lengthening there in order to get some yield pickup.</p>
          <p>Now to the most specific question, what do we do in Germany and France in order to avoid losing market share? Now the one view is on the customer i.e., the number of risk units and there you are correct. We are taking positive pricing momentum to be precise. In the first quarter, we had around &#x20AC;130 million price benefit in Germany and &#x2013; don't know exactly the number, &#x20AC;80 million to &#x20AC;90 million customer volume loss. I think it's &#x20AC;99 million that's the volume impact. So we have the price effect outperforming the volume effect and we need to do two things.</p>
          <p>Number one, and we have been successfully doing that, we need to diversify the channel architecture. We're now growing very strongly in the direct <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:20:23) and through our online agency business, which is called AAOS, it's both doing very well, in addition to bringing up productivity on the agency side. And what we are currently seeing is the productivity on P&amp;C overall is picking up. On top of that also in commercial lines through the broker channel. And it's by and large what we have to do in France too, even though there the online market is much more in infant stage than it is in Germany.</p>
          <p>On top of that, I'd like you to understand that we are strongly working on strengthening our automotive distribution. We have formed the global automotive unit, significant part of the new business in Germany, the fewer new car sales are going through car dealers. Allianz is the leading provider there and we've been very strong in improving not just volumes, but also profitability by restructuring the portfolios.</p>
          <p>For example, the few retail business is fairly profitable. We have been losing money in the past on the car dealer coverages that we have either re-priced or discontinued. So pushing that through and we are doing that also in France with international corporations, Germany by the way not just Volkswagen, it's Daimler and a number of other brands, we're doing the same thing across other markets.</p>
          <p>The last item is product redesign. In Germany, we've done <mark type="ph" /> mine auto, our car, (1:21:57) which is a modular product that is fairly consistent, by the way can over time be consistently replicated between and across different technology platforms that allows clients together with their advisors or by themselves to plug and play. So the base cover is fully competitive with a low price competition and the modular approach allows clients to pick and choose their additional coverages, which by the way also reduces admin cost for us and brings more margin for the carrier.</p>
          <p>So that's what I'd like to say, I'm fairly comfortable that we will succeed here given the overall poor state, however, in terms of profitability in motor in Germany to really come through, we need to see again more rational competition. Now, with late rates &#x2013; interest rates that is being at a ultra low level, I hope some rational behavior finally also makes it into the German market and the signs are positive. The same for France where we've seen significant pricing action as discussed. So that would be my answer.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's 25 minutes passed, we have time to take one more question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question today will come from Giulia Raffo of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Julia, how nice to hear from you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have few questions. First on capital, am I right that is impossible to get your economic solvency based on the old 99.97% confidence level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, it's impossible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a follow-up just on capital. Based on your 99.5%, is it possible to have a sense for how much is the impact on the &#x2013; of the liquidity premium in the solvency ratio? Then my second question is on your..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's &#x2013; we have &#x2013; if we take the worst case, we take out the liquidity premium and the yield curve anchoring the lesser, which by the way makes no sense whatsoever. It would be around 150 basis points. By the way, the liquidity premium, Giulia I mentioned at the beginning has come down very significantly from 96-point-something to 50-something, so that means almost half. So the benefit of that is actually very less significant than it was in the past. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, is it possible to have that in isolation, so from 202 basis points instead of going all the way to 150 basis points to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and Ollie Schmidt will give that number to you, if you may, after the call. I'm always using the worst case and say...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, I know that's fine. I am not trying...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:24:43) off the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fine. My second question is your &#x2013; on your banking exposure. If I read your interim statement correctly, you slightly reduced your banking debt exposure, but within that you increased by about &#x20AC;1 billion your Tier 1 exposure. Can you just confirm that and can you give us a sense of what type of Tier 1 geography wise did you buy? And then, my final question is on the pricing slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I answer...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not an investment but a fair value increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's just simply a mark-to-market movement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No additional investment in bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Otherwise I would be panicking a lot here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's why I found the two a bit in contrast, so I just wanted to get clarification. And my final question is on your pricing slide. In the footnote you seem to saying that the 2% exclude the AGCS and I think before you used to include your AGCS. You...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we never had that in. I'm actually trying to get &#x2013; we actually didn't have the actual rate change on renewals in the past and that's why we always showed it on the right-hand side. We had both the credit insurance side, Giulia, and AGC&amp;S next to the table. We now because we have comparable data on the actual rate change and renewals moved it in here. And that's really important because that explains the comparison to the old numbers. So actually &#x2013; the quality of the numbers has improved, not decreased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's a more conservative you can argue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. And I just wanted to clarify because the full year slide was basically saying that the price renewal impact was including credit. So I didn't appreciate that AGCS was excluded. So that's all clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And it's very important because again the credit is negative. So it brings the averages down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in AGC&amp;S, we have a very heterogeneous picture across the globe, that's why we've provided you with additional information. The total, if you exclude AGC&amp;S and credit, is 2.4%. And let me differentiate even retail from commercial, the retail side is trending more towards 3% and less strong &#x2013; less than 2% of commercial. This is by the way where we need to see the biggest pickup. I'm always amazed how slowly commercial markets move, but they have to move. Okay?</p>
