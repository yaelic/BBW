          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our First Half 2010 Results. We are going to start this presentation with Mr. Fulvio Conti, our CEO and Mr. Luigi Ferraris, our CFO, and then we will have the usual question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>So let me hand over to Mr. Fulvio Conti for the first part of our presentation. Thank you again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our result presentation. My introduction would be just to quickly review a few very important points, at least important to us, to Enel, like general microeconomic trends of the areas in which we operate. Let me dwell on the presentation that has been appended in the Web right now. I guess you should be having this in front of you to follow.</p>
          <p>This is the chart number two where we say that we have shown in the first quarter, demand of the &#x2013; in the first quarter, in March presentation, a demand growth of 2.4% for the next five years. The assumption that we use in the plan, an average of all the geographies where we're present.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we have recorded &#x2013; a recovery from the minimal level of 2009 and this positive trend has continued during the second quarter. The first half of the year then closes with an average demand growth of 3.7%, confirming positive trends in Italy, 1.9% up, Spain about 4% up, Russia, 5% up and Slovak Republic with 6% up among others.</p>
          <p>The 3.3% average demand growth in Latin America during quarter one, which has been affected negatively by the declining demand in Chile, caused by the earthquake, it's been more than over-past by the behavior in the second quarter, demand in Chile, for instance, grew at the tune of 3.8% and other economic positive trends in other Latin America countries is bringing the total of the first half demand to a growth of 4.2%. I think this is to prove the point that we continue to be conservative in our assumption and the reality is moving in our favor.</p>
          <p>The second point I'll like to make relates to the disposals, and this will be the slide number three that you have in front of you. As you know, we have announced all the stats necessary to maintain the solidity of our balance sheet. The good news have been received after the closing of June 30, like in July, we have sign the agreement for the sale of Endesa's high tension grid to Red Electrica. This agreement as you have seen, include both  assets and service and assets under construction right now, and expected to be operational by 2010. The overall consideration for this transaction is 1.5 billion. I am glad to report to you that this morning, as part of this agreement we already cashed in &#x20AC;1 billion into our bank account.</p>
          <p>We are continuing with the disposal of the majority stake 80% of Endesa's regulated gas activities in Spain, as well as we are progressing towards the end on the asset disposal of our Bulgarian generation capacity, both of them will be finalized by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Other minor portfolio translation activities, including the successful sale of the stake in Endesa Hellas to our then partner, Mr. Mytilineos for a total consideration 140 million. This has been agreed in March and has been effectively closed on July 1, with the first upfront payment of 60 million and the rest will be cashed in, in four installments of 20 million each, beginning on January 2011.</p>
          <p>Than we disposed the 1% stake in Red Electrica, and the disposals of the stakes in our regasification terminals, both in Sagunto and Reganosa. This is part of our portfolio optimization and will obviously add to our overall disposal program. Now, the final point is related to the Green Power. As far as Green Power is concerned we will be announcing today the group of banks who will be supporting us in the flotation process. And I'm continue to be confident on the ability to effectively dispose of a minority stake of Enel Green Power at a value that we consider appealing an attractive to reach the overall disposal program of &#x20AC;10 billion altogether that is shown on page three.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude on the following slide which refers to our net debt evolution. Let me hand over to you, our belief that we continue to perform on a strong net operating cash flow during the period and we'll continue to do so in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Our net debt, the way I calculated, the way I see it, the way effectively I should be concerned about it is, 51.5 billion. Excluding the effect of foreign exchanges translation. Luigi will be, of course, more specific on this presentation, on the reason why there is an apparent increase of 2.4 due to foreign exchange effect.</p>
          <p>As you can see on this chart, on page four, the cash flow from operations in the period has allowed us to cover all our CapEx, serving our debt, paying our taxes, leaving us with a strong net operating cash flow, higher than 1 billion, which is being used to be paying dividend to all of you shareholders.</p>
          <p>We do expect for the entire 2010, including the interim dividend being paid in -- as usual in November in the second part of the year, and even though we will be of course, honoring our dividend payment in November, we should be able to achieve &#x20AC;500 million of excess cash that will be used again &#x2013; together with disposal in the debt reduction.</p>
          <p>So, I think as I already mentioned to you several times, I feel very confident on the ability to meet before the Forex -- foreign exchange translation effect -- to meet our 2010 target of &#x20AC;45 billion of net debt. And this obviously will be also compelled by the results of all of our efficiency action that Luigi will be presenting to you later on, and on the basis of the fact that we will be sourcing more cash than anticipated. We'll be reaching an EBITDA level in excess of &#x20AC;16 billion as we have already commented and we feel confident that this in our hands right now.</p>
          <p>Now let me hand it over to Luigi for the analysis of the first semester. Luigi, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio, and good afternoon everybody. Let me start with the main financial highlights featured on slide number five. Group EBITDA increased by approximately 12% driven mainly by our international division and the full consolidation of Endesa. Group net ordinary income totaled &#x20AC;2.4 billion or about 11% higher than last year. Let me recall you that our current dividend policy is to pay out 60% or the full year growth net ordinary income.</p>
          <p>Net debt decreased by &#x20AC;3 billion -- increased by &#x20AC;3 billion to &#x20AC;53.9 billion. This is basically due to the accounting translation effects of non-euro subsidiaries for &#x20AC;1 billion, and valuation of foreign currency debt held by euro subsidiaries for &#x20AC;1.4 billion, which have produced a foreign exchange difference equal to in total &#x20AC;2.4 billion by applying the end of June exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Let me underline that both amounts do not represent an increase in Enel's debt, likely to generate future financial cash-outs. Indeed, the former relates to pure accounting differences that arise during the consolidation process. The latter relates to differences that are offset through specific cross currency hedging instruments. Therefore, net of the above mentioned foreign exchange effect, group net debt stands at &#x20AC;51.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide number six. EBIT increased by approximately 9% due to higher EBITDA partially offset by higher D&amp;A for changes in the consolidation of Endesa. Our net financial charges amounted to &#x20AC;1.8 billion. This is the net effect of the following. First, a decrease of &#x20AC;970 million in financial income due to Acciona put option recorded in 2009. Second, higher interest charges of &#x20AC;230 million, mainly due to the full consolidation of Endesa, and third, an increase of &#x20AC;357 million of other interest charges, which I will explain more in detail in the following chart.</p>
          <p>As far as tax rate is concerned, the increase from 24.7% in first half '09 to 29.3% in first half 2010 is mainly attributable to the positive contribution in 2009 or the valuation of Acciona put option and the capital gain from the high voltage grid disposal. On a normalized basis, our annualized tax rate is 30 to 33%.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a deeper sight into the net financial charges on chart number seven. In addition to what I already said on the previous slide, during the first half 2010, net financial charges increased mainly as a results of the following. A one-off regularization effect of the accrual in financial revenues from previous years related to the Spanish tariff deficit and lower financial revenues in 2010, a negative impact from the authorization of post employment benefits and other provision of &#x20AC;100 million, and other charges of &#x20AC;56 million, which last year have been almost completely offset by higher financial income. Finally, let me remind you that our annual average cost of net debt is equal to about 5%.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with an update on forward sales activities on slide number eight. In Italy, we have hedged 100% of our 2010 production and 55% of 2011 production at an average base load price equal to &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour for 2010 and 73 for 2011.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we are 100% hedged for 2010 and 55-60% for 2011 at an average base load price of 50-&#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour when it comes to 2010 and higher than the Spanish forward curve when it comes to 2011.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, as usual, we are 70-75% hedged both for 2010 and 2011. In Slovakia, 2010 production is fully hedged and we are already 90% hedged for 2011 at an average base load price of &#x20AC;52 per megawatt hour and 53 for 2011.</p>
          <p>Before illustrating our EBITDA evolution in detail, let me run through our main efficiency action starting with Enel Endesa's synergy program on slide number nine.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we continue to deliver upon our targets. As of first half 2010, we have already recorded about &#x20AC;300 million synergies, inline with the target. Among the identified areas of improvements I will like to mention, the rationalization investment in distribution, improvements in the availability of thermal plants and optimization of the fuel mix in generation, operational efficiency at the IT level, the improvement of the joint Enel Endesa tendering processes and procurement. All of this represents an outstanding example of how best practices are applied at the group level.</p>
          <p>On the operational excellence side, as you can see the slide number 10, Enel is making continues progress on optimizing its cash flow. As of first half 2010, we reduced our cumulative working capital and CapEx of &#x20AC;700 million or &#x20AC;100 million more versus the number posted at the end of 2009. Also, we have achieved so far a total EBITDA improvement of about &#x20AC;540 million, of which 265 is recurring.</p>
          <p>This cumulates at about &#x20AC;1 billion by 2011. Endesa is also developing its own <mark type="inaudible" /> program, which has delivered &#x20AC;42 million in the first half of 2010 and will deliver above &#x20AC;240 million of available cash by the end of 2012. All of this will have to explain our EBITDA evolution on slide number 11, which provides an overview of all of our operations.</p>
          <p>I will now go through the EBITDA of each of our division in detail starting with the Generation and Energy Management Italy on slide number 12. The overall division EBITDA declined by &#x20AC;648 million. This was the result of the following. A slight decline in the generation margin of &#x20AC;33 million, mainly caused by lower hydro production, partially offset by better thermal generation margins; a reduction of &#x20AC;268 million in the trading margin due to favorable gas sourcing, which positively affected first half 2009; a &#x20AC;339 million decline mainly due to the change in fair value of commodities; the termination of Nigerian gas stranding cost and other minor items. Furthermore, during the second quarter, Torrevaldaliga Nord coal power plant has been partially unavailable, therefore reducing its contribution to our output of 1 terawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Having said all of this, in light of our current hydro reserves, the pick-up in electricity demands and the full availability of Torrevaldaliga Nord, we expect full year EBITDA of this division in the region of &#x20AC;2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the fuel cost evolution on slide number 13. Net of ancillary services, the unit margin in domestic thermal generation increased to &#x20AC;26 per megawatt hour in 2010 from 23 in 2009 without considering the contribution of the Nigerian stranding cost in 2009.</p>
          <p>The overall generation unit margin, net of ancillary services, is about &#x20AC;45 per megawatt hour in 2010 versus 48 in 2009, mainly due to lower hydro production.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis for the Market division on slide number 14. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;193 million versus 160 in 2009. This is the cumulative effect of the following.</p>
          <p>The increase in the contribution of the three markets of &#x20AC;43 million, thanks to a margin improvement in our electricity and gas; the decrease in the electricity regulated market mainly due to higher charges for services which will be entirely covered through the tariff in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 15 on the Domestic Infrastructure and Network division. EBITDA amounted to &#x20AC;1,845 million. Bear in mind that last year the infrastructure and network EBITDA included a &#x20AC;308 million capital gain on the disposal of the high-voltage grid to Terna.</p>
          <p>Therefore, on a like-for-like basis, EBITDA increased by 8% versus last year. This is the net effect of the following. First, the improvement of &#x20AC;107 million in the energy margin, mainly thanks to positive price components on the tariff and higher volumes distributed. Second, higher connection fees of &#x20AC;13 million, and third, minus &#x20AC;291 million, mainly due to the above-mentioned capital gain recorded in 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 16 on international operations. Well, EBITDA increased &#x20AC;143 million versus last year. And this is the cumulative effects of the following. In the Central Region, Slovenske Elektrarne contributed &#x20AC;17 million, mainly thanks to the volume effect and the non recurring items which more than balanced the decline in prices. First half EBITDA of this company is equal to about &#x20AC;0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Romania and Bulgaria performed well with an increase of &#x20AC;57 million in the period, in particular, I would like to highlight that Bulgaria recorded EBITDA of &#x20AC;59 million, up 18% versus last year, mainly thanks to higher volumes.</p>
          <p>France recorded a reduction of &#x20AC;14 million due to lower prices, which were partially offset by higher volumes. Russia contributed with an increase of &#x20AC;84 million, was split between the generation and supply activities which accounted for &#x20AC;44 million and &#x20AC;28 million respectively.</p>
          <p>But before analyzing the remaining division, I would like to quickly address your attention on Russian activities on slide number 17. OGK-5 reported first half of 2010 EBITDA of about &#x20AC;135 million, which represents 39% increase versus last year on a like-for-like basis. This was the result of the following; an increase of 20% in total production, high availability ratio of our plants, and our power saves and efficiency.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, Russia recorded a 12% increase in unitary price, mainly driven by the day ahead markets.</p>
          <p>And let's focus on Endesa results on slide number 18. First, let me remind you, the numbers we report in this slide are the result of the application of Enel Group's accounting principle, which might be different then the Endesa one's due to difference in local standards.</p>
          <p>In Iberia, the generation sales business recorded an increase of about &#x20AC;200 million, mainly due to the hedging strategy with customers, which supported the unitary revenues of about &#x20AC;55 per mega watt hour despite the declining trend in pool price this year.</p>
          <p>Also, Endesa has benefited from a reduction of fuel cost, the removal of CO2 claw back, competitive energy purchase costs, as well as higher volume sold in the free market. Renewables recorded a negative impact of about &#x20AC;114 million due to the change in the perimeter of the assets sold to Acciona last year and to Enel Green Power this year.</p>
          <p>The distribution business recorded an increase of &#x20AC;275 million, mainly due to the implementation of the international accounting principle related to new connection fees for &#x20AC; 247 million.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the generation business reported a unit margin &#x2013; a unitary margin decrease in Chile, mainly due to lower selling prices. This effect was partially offset by higher unitary margins in Brazil. Altogether EBITDA for the generation business decreased by about 10% versus last year. In the distribution business, the unitary margin increased in Brazil, thanks to higher demand growth, has been partially balanced by a one-off tariff adjustment and higher fixed cost in Chile. On top of this, positive foreign exchange effect evolution has been equal to about &#x20AC;145 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now review Enel Green Power on slide number 19. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;651 million, representing a 5% increase on first half '09. Taking into account the one-off effect of a tax partnership in North America for an amount of &#x20AC;31 million recorded in 2009, only Enel's consolidated group numbers, EBITDA is substantially in line with last year.</p>
          <p>This is mainly due to the following. A decline of &#x20AC;19 million in Italy in Europe, mainly driven by lower unit margins, partially compensated by better performance in the rest of the area; an increase of &#x20AC;7 million in Iberia and Latin America, mainly attributable to the consolidation of ECyR in the second quarter 2010, which has offset the lower hydro production in Panama due to a linear effect and the decrease in Spanish power prices; an increase of &#x20AC;32 million in North America, mainly due to the above-mentioned one-off tax partnership impact; an increase of &#x20AC;11 million in Enel.si, our franchising business unit on higher margins on photovoltaic solar panels.</p>
          <p>I will continue with a quick look on Enel Green Power capacity evolution on slide 20. Enel Green Power has grown by 1,270 megawatts in the last 12 months, increasing its installed capacity from 4,544 to 5,761 megawatts. Growth has been pursued, both thanks to the acquisition EcyR, now remained Enel Green Power Espana, which accounts for 900 megawatts, and thanks to organic development, totally 313 megawatts.</p>
          <p>As you can see, during the first half '10 the company has managed the complex integration of Enel Green Power Espana and delivered organic growth. Looking forward, we expect the integration to start to deliver real benefits and the growth to continue. Incidentally, I remind you, the second semester of a typical year delivers the majority of new installations.</p>
          <p>Enel Green Power is working on 1,085 megawatts of projects in execution, of which 560 megawatts are currently under construction and 525 are ready to build. More than half of the megawatts under construction are expected to come into operation by year-end.</p>
          <p>Before concluding, a quick review of our group's liquidity position. During the second quarter 2010, we have successfully negotiated a five-year revolving credit facility for &#x20AC;10 billion to replace a &#x20AC;5 billion syndicated loan that was to expire in November 2010.</p>
          <p>The new credit line offers the group further financial flexibility for its day-to-day cash requirements. Therefore, considering also the contribution of Endesa, the group can rely on committee credit lines and cash and cash equivalents for about &#x20AC;21 billion.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And let's now open the floor to the Q&amp;A session.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I understand that the fist one is Mr. Javier Garrido, JPMorgan. So, please, Mr. Garrido?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Two questions. Firstly, if you could clarify the guidance given on free cash flow thus far as the goal. If I understood correctly, you said that the free cash flow post dividends and before disposals will be &#x20AC;0.5 billion at the end of 2010? That will be your first question. And the second question is on the EBITDA guidance. You are talking of exceeding the &#x20AC;16 billion initial target. But would that target still be exceeded excluding the accounting changes in the contribution from Endesa implemented earlier this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm answering that question. By the way, not a joke, do you have a brother that plays in Lancia next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, he is more fortunate, because he is probably wealthier than me, I'm sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because I heard that Garrido has been enrolled by my team, Lancia, today. So, I thought he was your brother. No. Besides a joke. The answer for the first question is 500 million of excess ordinary cash flow, net, net after dividends, after everything else, we'll be adding to the disposal program to get the $45 billion down -- level of debt. The second question is, of course, the 16 billion exceeding target -- exceeded target will be on recurring items, nothing to do with the accounting tricks.. This will be true genuine incremental EBITDA coming from pricing, coming from the operational excellences and cost reduction program. Altogether with the synergies program enacted, we will be, let me say, closer to the 17 than closer to the 16 billion, all right?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just I have a few quick questions. First of all, if you can comment on the outlook in Italy for 2012? You have started to sell some of the electricity and which are the relevant prices in the market?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the CapEx, the CapEx level was relatively low in H1. So can you confirm your guidance for 2010, or you think there will be lower CapEx by then? And then if you can repeat how much was the IFRIC impact on the H1?</p>

          <p>For the 2012, to be honest with you, it will be unfair to give you a number right now. As you know, we have sales moving into 2012 in some markets. But definitely, it will be still, let's say, 15% of the total, and it will not be possible to move any further beyond that. I mean as you would expect this is a number of today, but in the second half of the year, you might be seeing more contracts being arranged on a longer term. This is not a revolving basis. Today, I think it's only about 15% of the total that we might consider to be already committed to 2012, based on today's prices. I missed one question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you are right. We are -- if you look at the first half of the year, we might assume that by the end of the year the &#x20AC;7 billion plus target or amount that we have reported to the financial community, it looks to be a little bit higher than originally expected. So we should be able to expect, let's say a reduction in the region of few hundred million euros, because we expect the recovery of the activity in the second half but there will be something in the region between 300 and &#x20AC;500 million of reduction that will take place in the second part of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up question on this, so the free cash flow that you mentioned of 0.5 billion is assuming the 7 billion CapEx or is there any discount in the reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since most of the CapEx spending were originally placed in the second part of the year, anyway, the &#x20AC;500 million improvement, which Mr. Conti was referring to, is mainly coming from the working capital reduction.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon to everyone. As a follow-up on the CapEx, you have mentioned that this year the CapEx will be slightly lower than the &#x20AC;7 billion as you presented during the business plan. Could you clarify where we should expect this lower CapEx, in which division, and the reason for this lower CapEx during the year 2010?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the generation business in Italy. We have seen during the first half of the year a certain decline on the margins. You have mentioned that this is due to the lower hydro production, but better margins on thermal generation. Could you please quantify the expansion on the margins in terms of spark spreads and spark spreads for the generation in Italy? And do you believe that this is sustainable by the year-end? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I will -- starting from your first question about the CapEx. We expect some delay in, marginal delay in our international operation, mainly in Slovakia for something in the region of say &#x20AC;300 million. Then we expect some additional efficiency, for maximum of a couple of hundred million euros. So altogether, we should assume that by the end of the year we should land at say &#x20AC;6.8 billion to &#x20AC;7 billion.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your second question, let me just give you, our spark spreads at the end of June in our house, so we are in the region of &#x20AC;12 per megawatt hour, which we expect to be confirmed or slight increase in the second part of the year. Therefore, we assume that in the second part of the year we should recover also our unitary margin versus the first half.</p>

          <p>Hi. Yeah. Just one question on Spain and one question on your liquidity. On Spain, I have some &#x2013; kind of what do you think the risks are around the current energy review and what do you think the government may require in return for some of the, I guess, longer term investment certainty that they seem to be offering the utilities? And then also in &#x2013; on your liquidity, could you give us a slightly better sense of how the 17 billion of available other committed credit lines break up in terms of maturity? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, 21 is the total, the 17 is the available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, let me just remind you that the vast majority of that is referred to the last &#x20AC;10 billion five years credit line that we have just signed, so 10 out of the 17 are refer to these &#x20AC;10 billion, then we have an average between two and three years of maturity. So I think we have covered the 17. Then of course to reach the 21, we have to add the cash and cash equivalent that we have reported over here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to Spain, I like to remember everybody that the whole issue relates to the initial terms of the government, that they might be needing to propose some haircuts to the systems of premiums paid in tariff and feed in tariff schemes available for the renewables, because they thought maybe they have good reasons to believe so. There has been some exaggeration on that case, and I stick to the point that they need to come up with something to either produce that haircut in tariff or to give support to the thermal generation for their ability to be the backup for those days when there is no water, no sun, no wind. As you might have seen recently, the pricing in Spain has been increasing, because there is lower wind and sun available and water of course, so I will keep to the point that, the starting point being the renewable business, they will have to continue to look into ways to reflect their opinion into a more amenable, yet attractive tariff system for the renewables and a backup system for the thermal.</p>
          <p>I would stop here, because it will be hard for me to comment on things that the government is to some extent discussing in the cabinet and including discussions with the opposition party, and I cannot predict what the outcome will be, but I guess the starting point will remain solid on their hand.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. I have a few questions, hopefully quite quick. I wanted to ask a quick summary, because I have noted down quite a lot on our recurring items and I just wanted to double-check, so I have the presentation in front of me to be sure this is not a mistake. I counted 100 million of non-recurring post-employment benefit cost in the financial expense line and 260 of one-off from the accrual of the tariff deficit. So could you please wrap up exactly if these are the only ones or what would be an ongoing next financial expense for 2010, and this will have such a lot to understand actually earnings power for the year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you also comment on the timing of the securitization of tariff deficit in Spain? What's your working assumption? What do you think rating agencies are factoring in? And other question, we have seen a news from the Italian Regulator that they started effectively a review on the energy market, and given that I haven't seen many details about it, I was wondering if you could shed some light and elaborate a little bit more about these work, could it lead to &#x2013; what the topics debate is, what do you think, have you been involved at this stage? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will start with your first question, Alberto, regarding the financial charges. You're right, we have reported in chart number seven in a different column some items which can be considered, let's say, no recurrent. For sure, the tariff deficit regularization for 196 can be considered non-recurrent. When it comes to the post-employment other provision of first half '10, it will be non-recurrent because we have put in place some financial instruments in order to, let's say, linearize the impact of these different taxes in actualizing the cost of employment benefits. And the other &#x20AC;56 million is marginal item, and I would consider that one as well non-recurrent. So to sum up, as I said, the average cost of debt that we should assume on a normalized basis for the entire year is in the region of 5% of our net debt, and this, say, about &#x20AC;350 million can be considered as one-off item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This will obviously continue to lead us into an excess of &#x20AC;16 billion, even net of this. I mean, these incremental targets would be on a sustainable basis, recurring basis. Your second question relates to the deficit. I just take note of a press release that has been issued by the Minister of Economy last Monday or Tuesday, I can't remember, maybe Monday. They confirmed what we have intelligence on, and I can prove it that they are preparing all the papers by the month of September, including the remaining activities like, for instance, credit rating agencies to fix the credit rating of those papers, papers being available in September. We do on a basis of current market conditions that we would expect to be receiving the first cash installments in October, that's the situation.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the discussion about the energy market, I see a regulator there, he is going towards the end of his mandate. So I guess he might be not aware of any specific issues that they are raising. I guess they might be working on some sort of inner testament for future regulatory bodies. But I don't see specific issues that need to be commented right now. There is nothing really cooking at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First question is about the domestic generation. I see that in the second quarter the output declined by 6.5%, but at the same time the electricity demand increased in Italy around 1%. I understand that maybe one- third of that is due to the stopping in the coal, but I want to understand why it should decline? Second question is the fall in volume of sales. Last year in this period you already sell around 80% of the production of 2011, this year around 55%. Could you explain why there is this slowing in the sales forward? And third question about the spark spread in Italy. You say that currently it's around &#x20AC;12 per megawatt hour, while in the previous meetings you said that you expect a spark spread of around &#x20AC;16 per megawatt hour. Why there is this reduction? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me start with your first question about the domestic generation output. Yes, you are right, we have a decline in the output, which is due to the stop for a certain while of Torre Nord, and this is more or less equal to more then 1 terawatt hour, plus we had some unexpected maintenance activities in our other coal power plants in South Italy, namely Brindisi. So if you put the two effects together you will end up with a difference that you might have if you compare the dynamic of the electricity demand and our output.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your second question, forward sales, last year at this time we were already at 80% when it comes to 2010 in particular. The difference versus this year is basically the result of, I would say, two effects. One effect, which is basically is not an issue is the normal renewing of existing contract which is equal to more or less to 12 terawatt hour, which means, roughly speaking, something in the region of 15-20% which is going to take place in the coming weeks and months. And then we are still missing a portion of the normal auction that the single buyer normally launches during the year, and particularly this year, he is late, let's say. And the total expected auction is in the region of 15 terawatt hours, and at least when it comes Enel, I would say one-third, even more of that should be performed by us. So if you put together all these items you end up more or less at the same level where we were -- we stood last year. When it comes to the spark spread, the extra number that I gave you is the one that we have seen at the end of June. And we are in the region of &#x20AC;12.3 per megawatt hour. When it comes to the guidance, for the full year we expect to be, let's say, moving to say 15 &#x2013; or starting in the region of &#x20AC;15 per megawatt hour.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, two questions, if I may. First of all on Enel Green Power, are you still considering the straight sale as an alternative to the IPO in the autumn? And the second, still related to Enel Green Power, on Green certificates in Italy we are seeing a lot of noise over the past few months. The budgets got just approved if I remember correctly is putting a 20% cut to the obligation of the GSc to buy the excess green certificates on the market. So do you see in 2011, a risk of imbalance in the market and therefore a pressure on prices or do you expect any further clarification in the coming months?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try to &#x2013; it's Fulvio Conti here &#x2013; let me try to give you an answer about the disposal of Green Power. There is no basic change to the dual track strategy for the time being. Of course, we are pressing on with all of the related activities to the floatation that we are still targeting for October. And therefore, we need to move forward on that. At the same time we continue to receive funds due diligencing in the company right now to track whether they can come forward with firm commitment and acceptable offer. And it's still ongoing, so it will be unfair for me to give you comment on which would be the outlook. Therefore we'll continue to pursue the floatation as the main sourcing of activity.</p>
          <p>In the mean time we will continue to assess the potential of those offers, which would be possibly translated into firm commitments pretty soon. And then we'll be re-assessing the situation and we will keep you posted on that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well when it comes to the prohibition contained in the decree, which regards basically potential reduction or withdrawal of the Green certificates. Let me tell you that as of today the parliament has approved the amendment and therefore on the basis of that we can say that the impact of this new decree after the factoring of the amendment is negligible on our Enel Green power targets for the coming years.</p>

          <p>We have also a question coming from the web, which is asking about the evolution of the gas market in Italy and whether we expect this evolution to have any impact &#x2013; a potential impact on the electricity market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the gas situation has not basically changed when it comes to the logistic to the platforms for reporting. I see no new gas lines or new re-gas suppliers coming to alter the local situation, which is still of course based on -- predominantly based on the long-time contracts. The rumors about having some capacity being left over for some spot gas to be accessing Italy, as we have seen during 2010, this would be a marginal impact on the total consumption, which is picking up again as demand is growing. So I don't see reason to be changing our moderate optimism about the -- let me say, the gas position in Italy, which will continue to be to some extent influenced by lack of imports facility to maintain the spot market to be a minimum contribution to the overall situation. So I would not really think of any potential sizable significant negatives on the price of electricity when it comes to it.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions please on guidance. First one is, are you also very confident to do better than your &#x20AC;4 billion net income guidance? Are you also increasing this item? And second thing, still on guidance for Enel Green Power, are you &#x2013; can you restate your full year 2010 guidance for this division?

          <p>When it comes to the first bit of your equation, of course, if we increasing as we are increasing EBITDA, all things being equal, nothing will change dramatically to the -- from EBITDA down to the net income, you would expect to have ordinary income picking up. It is not fair to give you the exact numbers, but you can make your own assumptions based on the fact that interest expenses will continue to be the same and everything else will be the same, and therefore, indeed it's going to be positive news about it. Let's wait for the year-end to see it.</p>

          <p>Good evening. Two questions, if I may, very quickly. Can you please give out the guidance in terms of the full year calculated. I know you made your comments before, but just to understand? Secondly, what do you expect the impact of IFRIC 18 to be on a full year basis, more than the 400 million you spoke about at the first quarter or less? And finally, can you give us a sense in terms of what are your expectations for the international division for the full year? And finally, if you can quantify at the EBITDA level before its impact. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with a first one, which is the tax rate, if I understand what you said. The normalized tax rate for the entire year is, as I said, 32, 33% on average. When it comes to the IFRIC 18, the new accounting principle, the estimated impact for the entire year is in the region of &#x20AC;0.5 billion, so slightly higher than what we said during the first quarter. Since as you heard, we have closed the books with &#x20AC;247 million. When it comes to the guidance of the international division, well, I think we are well on track to reach by the end of the year certainly very close to &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the impact of foreign exchange effects on our EBITDA results at the end of June is something, mainly due to Latin America. Then we have some minor impact in Eastern Europe, namely Russia, and I would say that altogether we do not exceed the &#x20AC;170 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening everybody. I have a couple of questions. But first is on the domestic generation, the guidance that you provide about 2.4 billion EBITDA for the full year imply more or less the same EBITDA for the second half. So this means that there will be any reabsorbtion of the change in the fair value we've seen in the first half or more than 300 million? And probably not benefited from the &#x2013; some recovery in the volume that you were mentioning before, or, for example, the dual mix that in the first half has been offset by the <mark type="inaudible" /> or there is any other consideration to be taken into account? That was the first question.</p>
          <p>The second is on the improvement compared to the targets. In particular, if you will beat the net profit target of 4 billion, this would translate automatically into other dividend, considering the payout target that has been set, or this should be considered together, for example, with the progress in the disposal plan? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Let me answer your first question. Well the second half of this year is &#x2013; of generation energy management easily is expected to be basically more or less the same as the first half. But this is not just by chance because what we're assuming here is that there will be either condition, let's say, similar to the first half, but lower than last year. That's the assumption that we're taking here.</p>
          <p>We expect an additional contribution of our Civitavecchia, Torre Nord power plants, and we do not expect any major increase in the ancillary service market. So if you put altogether these items, the volume should be more or less the same. We will end up with the guidance that they gave to you. Of course the issue of the fair value it depends on the value of the commodities at that very moment, but we do not foresee, as of today, let's say, major inputs positive or negative coming from this fair value valuation. So let's consider that as frozen, as out to the picture.</p>

          <p>Yes, hello. I have a question on Enel Green Power. You said during your strategic day that you were planning to install 3.5 gigawatts in 2014, which is more or less about 700 megawatts per annum, and I understood from what you said that this year you are going to have probably in terms of organic growth somewhere between 300 to 350 megawatts, and will that accelerate over the next year or do you have a different timing for the installations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you are right. We have basically settled the machine to be ready to deliver a higher level of installed capacity starting from next year. You know, that we have 30,000 megawatts of pipeline. We have a very solid pipeline when it comes to the 3,500 megawatts. So we expect in the second half to start increasing our installed capacity and moving forward in the coming years. So with an average which will be very close to 800 megawatts per annum.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good evening. I will limit myself to three questions. On page four, looking at your cash flow, you show that you paid &#x20AC;518 million of substitute tax. Could you just remind us if this is something related to '09 or whether there's something which -- an action that you took in the first half of the year, just as a reminder?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the generation market you show an &#x20AC;8 million decrease. Now earlier this week Terna reported that they have massively improved basically the dispatching -- reduce the dispatching cost in Italian system, and they quantified the benefit to the system of around &#x20AC;500 million. <mark type="inaudible" />  basically what, you and Terna, this is an operator, are saving on ancillary services. I would have expected a much significant &#x2013; a much more significant reduction for you, if you have any view on that?</p>
          <p>And last thing is just, we are seeing that now in Spain what Endesa -- Enel you have sold out of Red Electrica probably because you're going to see the stake as strategic, you still have a stake in Terna of 6%. I was wondering whether you see that stake as strategic or not? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the last one to say, yes, I do still believe maintaining a 5% stake in Terna to me is strategic. It gives me the opportunity to monitor the activities of such an important company into our industry. In particular, in Italy where, as you might know, there are interconnection bottlenecks that needs to be squared. Therefore, adding visibility on the activities even through sitting on a board is something that I trust will continue to be strategic to me.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the ancillary, let me remind you that we have a disproportionate amount of ancillary services. It is we are the one actually having more spare capacity available, as you might remember. Therefore, we take, let me say, the lion's shares on the existing ancillary services. Therefore we're less impacted by the &#x2013; let me say, streamlining of the ancillary services and the better service that Terna is performing.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the substitute tax, yes, you're right, that's what we reported in 2009, which basically has decreased on a one-off basis the tax rate, but the &#x20AC;450 million we are talking about is just the payment of the third tranche and therefore will not be repeated in 2011, next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good evening. I have a remaining question on Enel Green Power and possible placement, or the private placement, I want to make sort of stress test and looking what happens, in case for whatever reason, because the market is not ready to get that code or you don't find a final agreement with anyone in buying the shares. So what happens in case you don't make the placement of Enel Green Power by the year-end? What happens when you have sort of Plan B for the debt reduction and the agreements with the rating agency? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we are not afraid of selling things. We are not under pressure. This is something I feel comfortable to say, but if we don't find the right market conditions we will not be selling, we would be waiting for the right market conditions. Definitely we have good assets in our hands, and I still believe this is a theoretical case you're suggesting. However, if the theoretical case would be the evidence, we'll not be selling. We're not under pressure to sell. We want to sell it as part of our portfolio optimization and we want to crystallize the value that we are building in this company. And that's -- that's the way it should be.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very clear to me. But I'm wondering if in that case you have a Plan B?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course we have a Plan B, but Plan B are for my drawer and it will not be for being disclosed. But the Plan B will have to the enacted, don't worry, we have a Plan B and a Plan C. But this will not be a matter of discussion today.</p>

          <p>Hi. Yes. Just a quick follow-up, I just wanted to say -- you say the tariff deficit securitization is very far advanced, it seems like something will happen in September. How much of the tariff deficit do you expect to be, and was planned to be securitized in September in the first tranche?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
