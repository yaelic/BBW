          <p>Welcome to the BHP Billiton Interim Results Investor Teleconference. My name is Mickey and I will be your operator for today's call.</p>
          <p>I am now handing you over to the host of today's briefing, BHP Billiton's Chief Executive Officer, Marius Kloppers. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to BHP Billiton's Investor Teleconference for our 2011 financial year interim results. Today, we announced record profits for the half-year, with our underlying EBITDA up 60% to US$17.3 billion, and underlying EBIT up 74% to US$14.8 billion. Attributable profit was US$10.7 billion, before exceptional items and that's up 88%.</p>
          <p>You would also have seen that we've announced a substantial increase to our capital management program, which has been expanded to US$10 billion, which we hope to substantially complete by the end of this calendar year.</p>
          <p>Not only are we returning capital to shareholders, but our portfolio of very long reserve life, high quality, large assets and large enough to commit significant amounts of capital in future growth. And in this context, we are planning to spend in excess of US$80 billion on growing our business over our five-year plan period to our financial year 2015.</p>
          <p>We currently have major projects in iron ore in our metallurgical coal businesses, which are at a very advanced stage in our approval process and which we hope to move into execution in the next few months.</p>
          <p>Today's results present the clear evidence that our strategy works for our shareholders and looking ahead, we believe that our disciplined approach in Tier 1 portfolio will allow us to continue to deliver superior margins and returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So on that note, I would be pleased to take your questions. And Mickey, if I can have the first question, please.</p>

          <p>At this time there are no questions. Pardon me. We do have a question now from Mr. Andrew Keen of HSBC. Mr. Keen, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Keen, your line is now on talk. Have you muted the phone on your end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, Marius. Thanks very much. Three questions actually. Firstly on capital management, you're now cash positive, and you're generating $35 billion to $40 billion a year in EBITDA, so it's obviously you've got a very conservative balance sheet. The $10 billion buyback in 2011, on most peoples' assumption is you won't change that. My question is under what conditions will we see BHP take on leverage again? You know the $80 billion CapEx spend is very substantial. But will you go into leverage for that or will you only use leverage for acquisitions?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the project approval process, you've got a lot of projects still in that double chart in the early stage of development. Are you looking accelerating how you bring those projects through? Or are you still using the same kind of project approval process that you've used for some time?</p>
          <p>And lastly, just on potash, I know that it's history now. But time later would you look at doing that bit any differently to how you ran it this time? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andrew. So on the question on leverage, I think we would like to keep the company at an A rating, strong A, as we put it. The value of that has been amplified for us during the recent financial crisis in which the differentiation between the BBB and lower rated companies, in essence, one of the only A's in the sector at the time was really very, very profound.</p>
          <p>And you'll recall that the markets from a bond perspective were essentially closed for mining companies until we opened it. And we don't think that that would have been possible without the rating, so definitely an A rating.</p>
          <p>Over the cycle, we would probably like to carry the amount of leverage that sort of normal economic textbooks tell you is commensurate with that A rating, which does imply a degree of leverage on the balance sheet. What I don't want you to take away from today's results is that we're keeping the balance sheet unleveraged in order to get ready for some unforeseen event.</p>
          <p>Given the size of the company, given the capacity that the balance sheet normally has to have some excursions in debt when one would want to make an acquisition. This is not the governing thought.</p>
          <p>The practicality of returning $10 billion over the year, over the next period is probably something that most people underestimate on how that gets done. And as a result, Alex and myself today have really concentrated on putting a target out there for the capital return that we feel confident we can report success on, within the timeframe that we've articulated. So that's probably what I can say on the first part of the question.</p>
          <p>On the second part, perhaps the best way of articulating this to say the $80 billion is really no change from the path that we've been on for, let's say, the last five years or so.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at our capital expenditure, we have I think the CAGR over the last 10 years is probably on the order of 20% or so. So 20% per annum growth rate on a cumulative average growth rate.</p>
          <p>So what that actually means, if you go and look at the forecast for CapEx that we had and the growth CapEx in our previous reporting periods, you will see that we really just picked up where that what we found is that we have traditionally only given about a one-year view of what the CapEx is. And what has resulted for us is that we believe that the market has under appreciated the sustainability of that, but our past CapEx, plus the 20% growth that we've had annually, would probably put you at higher number than what we've put out today. So it's not a step change, it's just a continuation of what we've done before.</p>
          <p>So most of the projects that I can think of that are going to come into execution, and I'm thinking of things like Samarco pellet plant number 4, RGP 6. Just on the end of that planned <mark type="inaudible" /> of the next 12 months, perhaps something like an Olympic Dam, Jansen, HPX 3, which is the coking coal, Daunia, Poitrel and Caval Ridge. All of these projects, which I have a very high degree of visibility over, have been in preparation for the last couple of years. And so that's probably why we feel reasonably comfortable in saying that, look there is a number targets that are imminent here and why &#x2013; and the concentrated nature of the asset base in which we are investing, the known qualities of the resource base probably gives a higher level of predictability over there than, you know, companies with 20 little projects spread out over probably different assets.</p>
          <p>So no change though. And then in potash, look we've always said that M&amp;A is opportunistic. We saw stock price at which &#x2013; since the day that we discussed that project with the board, the Potash Group share price had gone down to $87. We felt that we could do a deal at a market premium, which still gave us room for value accretion, but it was always opportunistic. Now if the measure of success was to achieve the transaction, I guess, we could have gone and offered $200 a share on a friendly basis and we probably would have had the deal done. Questionable though if our shareholders would have liked that. So, probably not as many things that we would have done differently given that it was an opportunistic plan.</p>

          <p>Yes. The next question is from Olivia Ker from UBS. Please go ahead, Olivia Ker.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Olivia, difficult -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Marius.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I used to think of you as a London person today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just some questions on growth, if I can. Firstly, in petroleum, you've got sort of the baked-in growth up until sort of 2012, 2013. Beyond that I guess you are looking at a number of future options as your next pact on the growth. Do you think the petroleum division sees a period of time when actually production declines somewhat? And then, just in terms of its future growth outlook, a lot of it is iron ore based. Can you just give us any update on sort of RGP 5 timing or CapEx increase or just around the scope? And then also just the size of the outer harbour just in terms of either outer harbour 1, 2 and some ideas around CapEx there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Olivia, I probably can help you make some of those questions today in additional granularity. We have another opportunity to &#x2013; really a couple of weeks from now almost &#x2013; to look at our first quarter production results, and I am sure that there will be more information then. I really can't go into the CapEx of individual projects and then so on, but certainly I have indicated that we believe that some of these projects are very imminent in their approval and then obviously they will appear with a little bit more granularity in our production report.</p>
          <p>On the first part of the question on petroleum growth, you must understand that our overall view of our portfolio is that it is a portfolio of assets that collectively generate a 45% return on invested capital or thereabouts at the moment, or thereabout 31% on invested capital at the moment. But we probably view that less as a series of commodity businesses bulked together than the market probably views that. I mean in reality the why we look at it is that CapEx will sometimes go more to one product and sometimes more to another. We have, today, indicated that the majority of our CapEx will go into iron ore, coking coal, potash and the oil and gas business and, yeah, I think that's the list.</p>
          <p>So the petroleum growth is as you say, is probably penciled in for the next couple of years, but given in the shorter turnaround cycle from discovery to execution, I feel confident that we will continue to grow that business in due course if it shifts up the level of start on the forward resource yield is the shorter cycle than we've got at Olympic Dam where I can see for the next 50 years, or the Bowen Basin and so on, Olivia. So, my apologies that I, probably with all of that, have not added a huge amount of value to you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sylvain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Marius. Just three questions. The first one was on coking coal, following the cost measure that we saw in Australia. Should we expect any form of carryover tonnage impacting prices? I think it's actually adding to prices rollover from the Q1 level of 2005? Second question, I'm sorry, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sylvain, probably around 50% of the cost measure accounts something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. My second question was to get a bit more color on Olympic Dam, a couple of comments in the release, but anything you could &#x2013; more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>more &#x2013; whatever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we would like to approve the first stage of the Olympic Dam project in the next financial year, sorry, in the next calendar year. After I've spoken today, the South Australian made some very supportive comments about the progress of our environmental impact assessment, which really forms the right limiting step for us to get to an investment decision. So what I'm saying is, the right limiting step is the EIS and not the degree of engineering that we've got to do to get to approval.</p>
          <p>And then what you should envisage as we go forward is that probably, while Phase I is in execution, we will approve Phase II, which is sort of what we're &#x2013; what we've done in iron ore over the last four or five years and probably what we're going to see in coking coal where you're busy building one tranche and you've already approved the other tranche.</p>
          <p>And in that way, our investors but also are board get a repeated look to see whether they are comfortable continuing to invest in what is a very large project.</p>
          <p>So Phase I is likely effectively as we detailed before &#x2013; and as is on our web, you know, stripping the ore body and exposing ore. And then Phase II would be expanding that further and putting some surface structure in place in order to expand production. That's sort of what you should view.</p>
          <p>And then we've indicated before that the ultimate capacity of this ore body is many, many, many times the output of these initial two phases. To memory, there is 9.3 billion tons of ore in the ore body, which as far as copper resources go, is quite a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. And my last question. I was interested to know how you look at the debate, buy versus build, in energy versus metal. Even prices are at very different level. Some would say that metal prices look a bit more overheated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think that overall prices have &#x2013; margins are good, both energy versus metal. I think from our comments today, you should read from that that in the bulk of our products, it's probably cheaper buying at the moment or &#x2013; sorry, building at the moment or doing buybacks rather than asset purchases.</p>
          <p>So, normally our cash flow has been so robust that it's been a question of "and." Build "and" look at buying at given moments in time. But probably for many products, at the moment, the aspirations of what sellers would have on Tier 1 assets, probably puts them a little bit out of reach at these sort of price expectations.</p>
          <p>So I don't want to rule out anything, but that's why &#x2013; where I would stand overall. Of course, not all parts of the energy sector responded in a similar way. I think that there is probably two dislocations that I can think of at the moment. One is the WTI vs. Brent dislocation, which means that assets in &#x2013; that service different geographies have actually had a different price for margin response. The other is the ongoing debate on whether there will be any forward convergence on calories between gas and oil, and how that plays out in North Asia versus Continental U.S. and so on.</p>
          <p>So I think on the energy space, there's probably a little bit more variability in where asset prices have gone, depending on the region and the product that they serve and the fiscal regime that they find themselves in. So that's probably how I look at that, Sylvain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Charles Kernot from Evolution. Please go ahead, Charles Kernot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello and two questions, please. First, just in relation to aluminium, which clearly was the laggard as far as performance, as at the half year. We've heard from other companies that clearly the situation in the aluminium market is very uncertain, with very high level of LME inventories, et cetera. Then Alcoa's results, and I appreciate they're obviously more downstream, a lot more diversified continue to be quite a lot better. Is there any sort of explanation that you can provide for us on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charles, a little bit of a portfolio mix issue. How long alumina versus metal you are. When the degree of coupling that your energy contracts had to LME prices. And the players that did best in the last quarter were the guys that had low metal price linkages to their energy contracts. Whereas we've got quite a high degree of coupling to metal in our energy contracts and thence your operating costs go with your &#x2013; with metal price.</p>
          <p>Obviously, when prices go the other way, it works in our benefit and to the dis-benefit of others. But that's played a clear role as we've been in a period of rising prices.</p>
          <p>[ph[ Currency inflation on the South African rand has played a material role, where a number of players have got U.S. exposure and hence have benefited from a weakening U.S. dollar, particularly against producer currency in Australia, South Africa, Brazil and so on.</p>
          <p>And then lastly we had &#x2013; just shy of $100 million of what I would call &#x2013; not extraordinary items, but cost elements embedded in the EBIT line on &#x2013; which are probably sort of, of a non-recurring nature. And that depends to tax effects in Brazil. So the results have been a little unflapped by that as well.</p>
          <p>Having said all of that, probably our view of aluminium has been unchanged over the last, probably getting on for a decade now. That it is a business where, given the more processing-like nature of the streams, both alumina and metal &#x2013; the ability to hang onto margins during periods of cost rises is less. It's got a more processing-like nature. And we probably view that product as having lower overall profit potential on the back of Chinese decapitalization of their facilities. So, and as a result, you've seen that we've got a relative under allocation of growth CapEx to our aluminium business in that five-year deal that we presented today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I see that. I mean the second question flows on from that quite nicely, which is energy coal, again an area where you are going to be spending not very much money going forward. Yet of course, effectively, it's the world's largest mined commodity market.</p>
          <p>I appreciate on &#x2013; Alex's wonderful Jackson Pollock charts that the margin in terms of energy coal has been below the line all way going back to FY 2002. But is there scope perhaps for a change there for an improvement in margins to come through at some stage in the future, given higher oil, higher gas prices? Wouldn't now actually probably be quite a good time to be investing in energy, energy coal, rather than, as I think you are doing, selling off exploration assets in South Africa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the South African exploration assets are relatively small exploration tenements, which have use it or lose it provisions, and since we don't have size and scale well, we probably don't feel that we can build a Tier 1 mine on it. They just don't fit the portfolio. So that's how you should view the South African piece.</p>
          <p>On the energy coal side, probably a little bit a tale of two hemispheres. I think the Atlantic market is contracting on the back of diminished European demand for energy coal. Basically no new coal-fired power station starts in the U.S. for the second year running. Whereas, in &#x2013; with respect to the Chinese and Indian markets, a very robust import growth.</p>
          <p>I think that really the limitation for us in investing more capital in the energy coal business in the Asian hemisphere is just a lack of availability of quality targets, more than anything else. And hence, our overall approach has been towards expanding the Mount Arthur asset to its next two or three phases of expansion, and match that up with the full capacity that we've built. So that's probably what will happen, and we probably feel relatively comfortable with that level of capital allocation within our overall portfolio and probably feel comfortable at that weight in the portfolio, as well.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Abhi Shukla, from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead, Abhi Shukla.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Hi. I would like to ask three questions, if I may. First, on Samarco, I mean I see that your costs have gone up a lot since the second half of last year. Even if I take out the $41 million provision, I see a 32% increase in unit costs. So could you please tell me a bit about what's going on there, is there any other one-off thing?</p>
          <p>Second is on Cannington, where could you please confirm if there is any one-off item in your revenue in Cannington? Because your reported numbers came well ahead of what I was thinking.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on manganese, could you please provide some color on what kind of prices you are getting for manganese ore and alloys? I thought your manganese alloy shipments increased 20% versus last half of 2010. So I was thinking there will be a slight increase in your revenue, but actually a decrease happened. So, could you please tell what is happening there and what kind of prices you're getting? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Abhi, on the Cannington question, that's probably a question of price participation on the movement of the prices there that has got to be taken into account, particularly on the zinc and on the lead side. And then the credits that we get for the &#x2013; for some of the byproducts.</p>
          <p>But I would invite you to discuss that in a more meaningful manner with our investor relations team. I'm probably not the person that is capable of giving you the requisite number &#x2013; amount of detail of that. And so &#x2013; if you get hold of us, we'll answer that question in a more meaningful manner.</p>
          <p>I think the same thing holds on the manganese side. Basically on the manganese business, we get effectively the price of the month of shipment on the products that we sell.</p>
          <p>Now that price is very visible in public and various publications, and essentially, we get that price. However, I think what may have occurred is there &#x2013; I know that in the last half, there has been some reasonably material stock movements, particularly on the alloy side, where the alloy stocks ran up quite a bit.</p>
          <p>So I think, what you are competing with then, which you may want to discuss with our investor relations people again, is the difference between the sales tonnage side and the production tonnage side. Again, I don't have those exact figures in my head, but I'm confident that you're going to find the answer to your question in the difference between sales and production, where I know that the production exceeded sales for some period of the prior period.</p>
          <p>And then on the Samarco question, again, we may be able to give you more points of detail on that if you call in, but the two things that I would like to point out is energy cost in pelletization is a reasonably large cost element. And secondly, the local currency costs against an appreciating Brazilian reais has clearly had an impact as well.</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, we've got the tax provision that you alluded to. I think the answer is between those three things and there are no abnormal items aside of that in the numbers, Abhi.</p>
          <p>But please call in. I'm probably not across that level of detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Could you give any detail on Escondida in terms of moving the concentrate or the OTP projects coming forth? Is there anything more happening on there?</p>

          <p>Ian, that project is, as you know, is in what we call selection files. That's how they go into definition files, which really &#x2013; or what the oil companies call feed. For us that's really to start of detailed engineering. And I expect that in the next &#x2013; between now and the next reporting period, all else being equal, that that project will probably pass that tollgate.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, the scale and scope is not much changed from what you would have seen at the recent Escondida figures. And for &#x2013; in case you were not there, Ian, most of those materials are available on our website. Or again, if you can't find them, our investor relations people are very happy to email them to you or point you in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Mickey, it seems to me we've come to the end of our questions. So for all of those that called in this morning, thank you very much. Again, any further questions, the investor relations people stand by to answer any questions.</p>
          <p>I'd probably like to recap by saying that we do feel that this is a nice set of results. We got plenty of headwinds from various angles and the company has shown that the asset base, the way that we managed these assets have enabled us to generate very healthy margins and, particularly pleasing, very strong set of cash flow figures.</p>
          <p>And I think that we have a point that I'd like to emphasize in closing is that while there is no step change, we have quite pointedly shown as we articulated over the last couple of years, that the resources that we already have in our portfolio, the projects that we're working on at the moment, and the trajectory of capital expenditure on organic growth will equate to some $80 billion of investment.</p>
          <p>And we think that the combination of strong results, strong growth opportunities enables us to really say that the set of assets that we've got is capable of generating cash flow that feeds future investment, while at the same time continue to increase returns to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So, again on that note, thank you very much for calling in this morning.</p>
