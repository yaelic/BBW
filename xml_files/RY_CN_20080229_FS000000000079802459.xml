        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Amy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin by reiterating some of the themes from my speech this morning at our annual meeting. I want to be clear about how I view the business and performance. Our approach to business is based on a few basic principles. Firstly, making it easier for our clients to do business with us, we also have a very diversified business mix which continues to protect against shocks to single businesses, products or markets.  And finally, we want to ensure all of our activities are guided by defined strategic goals that are underpinned by a proactive approach to risk management and the rigorous operational discipline that makes us, management, accountable for results.</p>
          <p>Our focus on doing these things well has helped us withstand the recent pressures and allowed us to build on our past performance and deliver solid results. Almost all of our businesses within our four business segments, and we monitor 42 of them, delivered solid performance this quarter; and a couple, as you know, have been affected by the difficult market conditions. Each business pursues a mandate for growth which seeks to leverage the strength of others so that they can advise and satisfy all of our client's financial needs. This approach has helped us manage some of the challenges we faced in the first quarter as market volatility persisted and growth slowed in the US and around the world.</p>
          <p>Since last summer I've been consistent in saying that as a result of this correction, risk would be re-priced and the market participants with financial strength, sounds risk management and strong balance sheets will ultimately benefit. While I do believe there are still signs of further weakness, and it will take years for some of these financial assets to recover, I certainly expect the aggressive action of monetary authorities will provide a floor for the markets and hopefully pave the way for a recovery in the latter half of this year.</p>
          <p>However, once that recovery takes hold I certainly expect the environment to be significantly different from what we had before this crisis. I believe the damage to the global financial system and the global economy will lead to a new normal. This will include a heightened sense of risk aversion, higher volatility, increased transparency, a move to simplicity, reduced financial leverage, and wider credit spreads. The period of leverage and bank disintermediation will for a time shift in favor of deleveraging where bank relationships will increase in their importance. This competitive landscape is changing, and it will reward those firms, and I believe RBC is one of them, that continue to demonstrate market leadership and balance sheet strength.</p>
          <p>Turning to our financial performance in the first quarter of &#x2013; on slide four.  The first quarter we had $1.245 billion of earnings, and an ROE of 21%. Earnings were down $249 million from the record earnings of a year ago. And on slide five you will see items that impacted us this quarter as well as in Q1 and Q4 of '07. Taking these items into consideration, our earnings continue to be strong. We continue to make progress towards achieving our long-term goals, and I would like to give some highlights in each business segment.</p>
          <p>In Canadian banking our banking related operations continued to build momentum and are running efficiency -- efficiently with an operating leverage of 4.1% and continued growth in key areas such as residential mortgages and personal deposits. In wealth management we increase fee-based client assets and RBC Asset Management continued to capture market share and we led the industry in overall net mutual fund sales gathering more than $4 billion of assets in the record first quarter.</p>
          <p>We're also very pleased and excited about our recent announcement to acquire Phillips, Hager &amp; North. Joining forces with PH&amp;N will bring two asset management leaders together for the benefit of our clients, and will form one of the largest private sector asset managements in Canada; and we very much look forward to working with our new partners from PH&amp;N. This acquisition will help us capitalize on the global growth that we expect in this sector over the next several years. At DS, our Canadian full service brokerage business, we continue to attract experienced advisors and grow our fee based assets. Also we remain focused on growing our businesses outside of Canada as evidenced by our recently announced intention to acquire Ferris, Baker Watts, which will add 330 financial consultants in key regions in our US Wealth Management business.</p>
          <p>Our international Wealth Management business, which provides financial solutions to high net worth private clients in over 32 countries, continues to grow and demonstrate an increase in loans and deposits this quarter. In US and international banking our residential builders finance business caused a significant earnings setback in the profits at Centura. However, we are managing the current challenges and I am encouraged by the work that is being to strengthen our US retail bank. As an example of executing on this strategy is the acquisition of Alabama National, which closed earlier this week. When the US housing downturn begins to stabilize and rebound we do believe our US banking operations will be well positioned. We have over 430 branches in a very attractive region of the US Southeast.</p>
          <p>Outside of the US we remain on track to complete the acquisition of RBTT Financial in the middle of '08, which will create one of the most expansive banking networks in the Caribbean. Solid business growth from RBC Dexia Investor Services in our US banking operations combined to push earnings in this segment higher over the last quarter. As you know Capital Markets had some challenges in the quarter. But in spite of the write-downs we had broad based revenue growth across several Capital Markets businesses compared to last year with higher trading in fixed income, foreign exchange and equity derivatives.</p>
          <p>Our diversified portfolio has allowed us to capture, capitalize on the declining interest rate environment and the increased market volatility, and even with the write-down, Capital Markets still delivered a return on equity in excess to 20%. I'm pleased to say that we rank first in the Canadian mergers and acquisition equity underwriting and corporate debt financing league tables according to Bloomberg's 2007 report.</p>
          <p>In closing, as I indicated last quarter, we anticipated early 2008 would be challenging and our first quarter results should be viewed in that context. We expect economic growth in the US and Canada to pick up in late 2008 and we continue to drive towards achieving our objectives. Our capital market -- our capital position remains strong. Tier 1 capital comfortably above our target range. We are maintaining our quarterly common dividend at $0.50 in the second quarter as we feel it's just the prudent thing to do. And I would like to assure you that we remain focused on taking actions that will create value for our shareholders as well as serving our clients and growing our businesses profitably.</p>
          <p>We're watching our costs. We've got a lot of cost discipline programs in place and maintaining a risk profile and risk appetite that is commensurate with the overall organization.</p>
          <p>And with that I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Risk Officer Morten Friis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gord. I will start with a review of the Capital Markets related areas and then provide an update on our credit portfolios. As Gord mentioned, as a result of continued deterioration in the credit markets, this quarter we had write-downs in Capital Markets of $430 million pre-tax or $187 million after tax and compensation adjustments. Slide 10 outlines these write-downs. 288 million of losses relate to US sub-prime exposure. The balance of $142 million reflects the lack of liquidity in the US asset backed paper, specifically in our investment portfolio supporting US municipal GICs, US auction rate securities and US commercial mortgage backed securities.</p>
          <p>With respect to sub-prime, the $288 million loss consisted of two components. First, $201 million of write-downs and protection with monoline insurers with majority related to ACA that we have fully written down and a portion on MBIA. Second, we had $87 million of write-downs on other US subprime exposures. As of January 31st, 2008 our remaining net exposure to US sub-prime is US $639 million, including insurance with MBIA. Our gross exposure is US $2.8 billion, which represents less than 0.5% of total assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 11, there was significant volatility in equity and credit markets this quarter. In total we had nine days of net trading losses with two days of large net trading losses reflecting write-downs related to US sub-prime. The remaining net trading loss days did not exceed global VAR for its respective days.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 12, in the last three months, the overall quality of our loan portfolio remained well within acceptable range for loss rates despite continued credit deterioration in some areas. We observed higher impaired loans in our US and international banking wholesale portfolio, specifically in our US residential builder finance business, as well as our commercial and retail loan portfolios. These increases are triggered by the downturn in the US housing market and slowing economic conditions. Higher impaired loans in residential builder finance particularly in California, Georgia, Arizona contributed to the increase in PCL in the segment. As we said in Q4, our builder finance clients are reputable and well established. The duration of the portfolio is relatively short. And we previously reduced our business production in some of the less favorable markets across the US. The acquisition of Alabama National would add to the residential builder portfolio, but we have done extensive due diligence on this portfolio and are confident in the quality and performance. Also to give some perspective, the combined portfolios remain small in the context of RBC, representing approximately 1.5% of our total loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>On slide 13 you will see total provision for credit losses increased compared to the prior year and over Q4, 2007, largely reflecting the trend up towards historical averages. The specific provision was up compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the higher impaired loans in our US banking business. The increase also reflected higher impaired loans and lower recoveries in our corporate lending portfolio. In addition, higher provisions in our Canadian credit card and business loan portfolios, primarily reflecting portfolio growth. We are not seeing any major quality issues within our Canadian loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>In summary our loan portfolio remains stable with stresses still confined to specific areas. As we mentioned last quarter, overall loan portfolio loss rates continue to trend higher towards historical averages. At this point I'll turn the call over to Janice Fukakusa to discuss Q1 results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Morten. Slide 15 provides an overview of our quarterly performance. Net income was down $249 million from last year's record results, largely reflecting the items in Q1 2008 and Q1 2007 that Gord highlighted at the outset. Despite these items, we had solid performance in most of our businesses. Non interest expense rose 2% from a year ago from increased sales and service staffing levels in our banking branch networks and higher systems development and processing costs. Expenses were up slightly from Q4, primarily due to higher variable compensation in Capital Markets and increased benefits costs due to seasonal impacts.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 16 our Tier 1 capital ratio this quarter was 9.8% under the new Basel II reporting framework. Under the old Basel I framework our Tier 1 ratio was 9.2%. We have a strong capital position and our access to liquidity has not been impacted by the market conditions this quarter. We continue to be a regular issuer in a variety of markets and have access to both short term and long-term funding. I'll now review the quarterly performance of our four business segments.</p>
          <p>Starting with Canadian banking, on Slide 18, net income was down slightly from last year and down 15% from last quarter. Net income was up 8% over last year, excluding the favorable impact of adjustments recorded in Q1 '07 in global insurance. Excluding the gain related to the Visa restructuring and the charge to increase our credit card reward program liability reported in Q4 '07 net income increased 7% over last quarter. Looking at our banking related businesses, earnings increased 15% over last year. Compared to last quarter, earnings decreased 16% or increased 11% excluding the Visa gain and the credit card charge.</p>
          <p>Volume growth was strong across all our businesses over both periods due to the successful execution of our growth initiatives. Banking related operations are running very efficiently with operating leverage of 4.1%. Compared to last year, expenses were higher, reflecting higher costs supporting business growth, but were lower quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to lower seasonal marketing and occupancy costs. Global insurance earnings were down $96 million over last year and down $13 million over last quarter. As highlighted earlier, our prior year's earnings include the favorable impacts of an adjustment related to the reallocation of foreign investment capital of $40 million and a cumulative valuation adjustment of $25 million related to prior periods. The prior quarter included a gain related to the sale of securities in our US insurance operations.</p>
          <p>On Slide 19, you will see that we experienced some margin compression compared to the previous year, largely due to the impact of changes in product mix and lower spreads on credit cards and personal deposits. Margin compression was minimal quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at Wealth Management on Slide 22, net income was down 14% or $30 million dollar from a year ago. Favorable items in the prior year impacted our results including a $14 million foreign exchange translation gain on certain deposits and a tax reversal. Also, appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar reduced earnings by 5% or $11 million compared to last year.</p>
          <p>These factors aside, we had strong revenue growth in client assets across our businesses and solid deposit and loan growth in our international Wealth Management business.  Non interest expense decreased from last year, mainly due to the favorable impact of the strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar. Quarter-over-quarter, NIE decreased, mainly due to the lower stock-based and variable compensation in our US brokerage business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to US and international banking on Slide 24, earnings decreased $36 million over last year, due to increased provisions for credit losses and higher costs in support of business growth. Earnings increased $10 million over last quarter on solid business growth in RBC Dexia and our US banking business.</p>
          <p>Non interest expense was up 9% or $30 million from the prior year, reflecting higher processing and staff costs at RBC Dexia on business growth and the full quarter of expenses of Flag, the inclusion of AmSouth branches, and our US de novo branch openings. These costs were largely offset by the impact of a stronger Canadian dollar against the US dollar denominated expenses.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows revenue in our banking businesses was flat for the year, primarily reflecting the impact of the strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar. In US dollars, banking-related operations grew loans 12% and deposits 18% over last year, reflecting a full quarter of results from Flag and the inclusion of the AmSouth branches. Our prior year results also reflected a loss on the restructuring of the investment portfolio in our US banking business.</p>
          <p>RBC Dexia revenue was up 24% from last year, due to growth in custodian and securities lending activities, higher foreign exchange transaction fees and business growth from new and existing clients.</p>
          <p>Turning to Capital Markets on Slide 26, net income was down from record results last year, largely reflecting the write-downs that Gord and Morten discussed. Also, appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar and British pound reduced earnings by $24 million over last year.</p>
          <p>Revenue was down from last year due to these items. However, several of our businesses performed very well compared to last year, including trading in fixed income, foreign exchange and equity derivatives, driven by declining interest rates and increased market volatility. Compared to last quarter, our earnings were up primarily on solid revenue growth. Non-interest expense was down slightly from last year, mainly due to a favorable impact of foreign exchange. NIE was up over the previous quarter, mainly due to higher variable compensation, and higher benefits costs due to seasonal impacts.</p>
          <p>On Slide 28 you'll see a breakdown of RBC's total trading revenue. Despite the charges, we had strong trading revenue and our results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified platform. At this point, I'll turn the call over to the operator to begin the questions and answers.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Jim Bantis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I've got two questions. One, if we could chat a little bit about the CDO exposure related to corporates. You've provided us with some additional disclosure, which we appreciate. 2.8 billion coming from corporates and I'm wondering if you could just talk about the underlying securities related to that, how do these transactions come to fruition? Should we look at these similar to other corporate debts that you would have on balance sheet? And then, my second question is perhaps for Chuck and Janice, just if we add back the one-time items related to Capital Markets, 400 million plus revenue, almost 200 million in earnings, we come up with a quarter that was at record proportion. So I wanted to be able to find out what the true operating run rate is from the wholesale operations as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chuck, why don't you take the second one first, while Morten researches the first one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the second one, with respect to trading, it is just many factors. It's like we have a big trading business and it's diversified, both from a product standpoint and geographically.  And so the answer is just not one any single factor. The other thing I'd say is it's two edges of a sword. Basically the things that in some respects caused some of the write-downs that we took in credit markets have also created the spreads in the overall trading market with respect to liquidity and other things that allow you to make more money in your day-to-day trading business; and you also get some advantage from the standpoint of funding costs accounting.</p>
          <p>But effectively, when you look at it, we had a very good quarter in fixed income. Remember, we've got a fixed income business in the US, Europe and Canada, and they're all significant businesses. We did well in each of those. We did have the theme right. We were working on lower rates and a steeper curve, and that helped us.  But basically it wasn't, certainly isn't a huge part of the explanation. We had very good results from the standpoint of the way we set ourselves up for funding. We had a very strong period in ForEx. We had a good equities -- good equities performance just in our day-to-day equities business. We also had good prop results, especially from equity related businesses. So it was a combination of just a whole number of factors and I would point out that the environment that has created the write-downs also is creating an environment where you can trade and make some money.  And in some respects it's a race between these two factors for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So it certainly sounds like you can't have it both ways in terms of adding back 400 million in revenue related to let's say Stan's area, the global markets, it just doesn't work that way given there were some offsetting factors that wouldn't have existed otherwise; right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if somebody waved a magic wand and made the world right from the standpoint of sub-prime and the housing business in the US and some of the corporate credit issues and we went back to where we were, we wouldn't be making as much money on daily trading business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Morten.  With respect to the 2.8 billion corporate related that you quoted; I mean these are the facts highlighted on Slide 37, on page five of the report to shareholders. This is part of our logan structures. They're CDOs of investment grade corporates. Synthetically structured, performing as that combination of names you expect them to perform over the last little while.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Morten when I thinking those structures, there's not unusual level of leverage within them, as you said, it's all investment grade, so the asset quality we shouldn't be too worried about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they are typical for those structures.  And as I said, they are investment grade names, selected at the outset. Given the environment that we've had over the last six months, there have been widening of credit spreads and some downgrades. But it's not a portfolio that from a credit standpoint in itself is performing abnormally to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given the structure of those transactions, would you be required to take an adjustment to valuation based on liquidity as opposed to credit standards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, it's Janice speaking. Within these structures, to the extent they're on balance sheet, they're fair value, just the same way we fair value a lot of this.  But that the reason that you have, if you go through the MD&amp;A and a little bit complex explanation, the reason it's set out this way is that you'll see that when we're looking at our monoline insurers to the extent that they are wrapping those CDO exposures, that's how you have to look at it. So it's more sorting through the different layers in analyzing the structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Andre Hardy of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I also have two questions and they're probably both for Chuck. A lot of the write-downs were related to credit, if not all, and credit spreads have continued to deteriorate. I'm just wondering if you can talk about February and what you've seen so far in your businesses. And my other question relates specifically to auction rate securities. It looks like the bank would have exposure of around 4 billion and correct me if I'm wrong with my numbers. If that's the case, that's a market I understand has run into a lot of difficulty. Can you talk about the risk that there is in the Royal Bank related to those securities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I'm not going to talk about February. You've talked about February but I'm not going to talk about it. With respect to the auction rate securities, we had at the end of the first quarter, I think it was over 4 billion, 4.5 billion I think approximately, of auction rate securities. We also had about $850 million of VRDNs. Those auction rate securities were focused in one business where we are a top five player in the US, which is in the student loan business and they're called SLARS another acronym for student loan auction rate securities. They are trusts effectively which are underpinned by student loans that are 97% guaranteed by the US Government as to principle. And so that is where our focus is in the auction rate securities business. I think 85% or 90% are AAA securities, and effectively that is our position. I mean, it's a business where there's a different types of them and everything else you've got to look at them but effectively the collateral that underlies them is 97% guaranteed by the US Government.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Looking at the US and international banking segment, gross impaired loans, 3.37% GL ratio this quarter continues to move up. Yet we didn't see too much of a move on the provisioning side. Can you talk a little bit about that dichotomy, especially it sounds like with the information you're giving us home builder portfolio is a good 10, 15% of the total portfolio here. So why didn't we see provisions move up accordingly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Morten here. If I couldn't speak to that. I mean the charge, the size of the provisioning is really a function of the inflow of impaired loans; and while the first quarter continued to be negative, it was actually slightly better than the previous quarter. We are -- we do have a portfolio here that will be a drag on performance through 2008.  And the size of the provisioning reflects the size of the current impaireds, and our view on value and recoverability on those assets. So I don't know whether that gets to close to answering what you were asking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to be on the same page there, it looks like impairments are a lot higher than they were last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the impaired formation in our supplementals, I mean part of what's driving the impaired formation on the US side is that we this quarter for the first time in a number of quarters have had some provisioning in the Capital Markets portfolio. One of the assets was a US based borrower, hedged, I might add, so the income from the hedge shows up in Other Income. So part of the growth in the impaired on the US side of the portfolio is actually not in the builder finance portfolio, but part of the corporate banking portfolio. I don't know whether that helps explain what appears to be a dichotomy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I understand that. Just a second part to that. I haven't seen a 10-K or 10-Q for Alabama filed yet, it's closed, I guess we can talk about it. I did get a chance to look at some of the FDIC information. I'm not sure if that's completely comparable. But it looks like non-performings there are close to doubling quarter-over-quarter. Is that, first off, accurate in terms of numbers you have? Are we going to see a filing from Alabama for their fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll speak to the asset quality and the trends that we're seeing. Prior to the close of the transaction, we did have a second round of due diligence and had a clear scrub of the portfolio. Historically, charge-offs and provisioning in that portfolio has been very low. With the developments in the market, they too have had a negative trend. But I think on the net basis, their portfolio continues to perform well. I mean one of the issues we've got with the overall, with the combined portfolio is to try to make sure that we manage the concentration and any further deterioration actively.</p>
          <p>At this stage, we think we have captured any assets that are weak at the time of closing of the transaction, and we just continue to watch any deterioration from that. I mean, our conclusions out of ANB's performance during the period running up to the closing of the transaction is that their risk management practices have actually served them extremely well. Their charge-off rates have been low, both in an absolute sense and on a relative sense. But they are in markets that are in part some of the weaker markets. I would note that the Alabama market is actually relatively stable and less affected by the current downturn. The Florida market albeit is a little more challenging, but their assets in that market have actually been not as deeply affected as you might expect from the overall strain on the Florida market in general.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. That was helpful. One more from me and this is probably for Janice. In Canadian banking only expenses after the last two quarters we did see a decent sized decline. I saw some commentary in the press release talking about seasonal trends. What do we look for here in terms of a run rate and expense growth? Do you think that, that higher trend that we saw in year-over-year increase has normalized now? I was thinking that would probably be in the back half of the year, but it looks like it came through a little early. Have you started to prepare for softer revenue here, is that why we're seeing expenses trend down? Is that what we should look for going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sumit, this is Jim Westlake. I might comment first. I think that we are going to see it trend down that we've been talking with that and expecting it. We kind of peaked out on a year-over-year in the last two quarters of last year with the extra spend we had done on branches and staffing. And so as each quarter comes along, we expect that to moderate even a little more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Sumit, just to add to Jim, what we're focused on is of course on an annual basis, the solid operating leverage that's there in Canadian Banking. So while there is some seasonality, if you look at it over the course of the next four quarters, we should hit the run rate operating leverage that you've seen for the past two years.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Ian de Verteuil from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is just a clarification, Chuck. So the 430 million of write-downs, was that all taken in the trading line? So if we think about the trading line of 600 million, ex-these the trading number was really close to a billion, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wow.  Good trading numbers. And the second question, just to clarify, the exposure to monolines, am I right in saying slide 37, forgive me, I spoke to Amy on this and it confuses me always.  Slide 37, which gives exposure to monoline, does that include any credit default swaps where monolines would be on the counterparty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Morten here.  On &#x2013; the information on slide 37 relates to the various buckets of monocline-related securities or risks that we've got. And so it does include the collateral, the CDSs with other monolines, which from a fair value standpoint is actually a very modest number outside of the MBIA position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 1.1 billion, I think you mean it's in that bucket there, Morten is that right, the 1.1 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's notional or is that's fair value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Swinging back to US international I guess focusing in on what Sumit was getting at, we see in the second quarter very high provision levels, is there any offset that you see possibly coming over the next quarters or are we stuck with low single digits ROEs until the credit cycle begins to abate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll take a stab, and then Peter might want to fill in. I mean In terms of the size of the builder financed portfolio in a Centura context at 2.6 billion is relatively significant.  And with the size of the impaireds and the fact that we will be at best through 2008 and into 2009 before we start to see things recover in that market, we will over the next quarters continue to have a drag from the impaired portfolio, and some risk of further increases to provisions at levels above what would be considered normal. I don't know whether that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Not just focusing in on the risk from credit but is there other areas like, expense reductions or other areas of revenue where we might be able to see some bottom line growth and offset some of the potential risk that provisions face.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. John, that's what I was going to add. It's Peter Armenio here. I mean we have taken several initiatives to strengthen the business going forward and the earnings of course and so we continue to grow our revenue quarter-over-quarter. But there is a cost management program that's on the go right now, which is important and has got several initiatives on the go. Obviously, from our integration with ANB, we also look to cost savings over there and we are reconstructing our builder finance business, which also will provide us with some cost saves as well. So there are several initiatives on the go to strengthen the business and its earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. And does Alabama National, does it represent a possible relief or is this going to be another incremental headwind once when comes on board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean from everything we've seen so far, it makes the bank stronger. So whether it's on their credit side, whether it's on the management side, whether it's the geographies that we're in, the scale that we're getting in certain places, everything that we've done in terms of the strategic expansion is making it a stronger and better bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just emphasize that I mean to the extent that you can in an environment like this is &#x2013; to repeat Morten's comment, we scrubbed this portfolio very, very closely before closing.  And obviously, that's where the headwinds would come from if there was deterioration on the credit side. And with the acquisition, we certainly took advantage of that to do the best we could in terms of providing for anything that we think could deteriorate. But who knows where the market is going to lead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks for the clarification.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Michael Goldberg of Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a few questions. First of all, if I look at your non-performing loans, net of both specific and general allowance, your total allowance is still greater than your gross non-performing loans. But this surplus allowance has shrunk to just 97 million from 579 million a year ago, and 353 last quarter, as your loss provision has been far below your net formations.  So my questions are do you expect gross and net formations to continue to trend higher? Are you prepared to allow your surplus allowance to shrink further?  And would you even be prepared for gross non-performing loans to be greater than the total allowance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Michael, its Morten. I assume you're referring to RBC as a whole here, are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in terms of the expectations on formations, you know, I think as Gord commented at the annual meeting and the following calls that our expectation continues to be for the market to continue to deteriorate somewhat overall. The Canadian portfolios are actually performing quite well; in terms of it's within very acceptable ranges, good risk return balances and no evidence yet of deterioration there. There's some risk that we will see additional formation of impaireds in those portfolios, but there's no evidence that that will happen.</p>
          <p>In terms of the US&amp;I and the Centura portfolios specifically, the big question in terms of formations I think is to what extent the impaired formation and the provisioning will be required for in any volume for portfolios outside of the builder finance piece.</p>
          <p>In terms of the allowance, the provisioning methodology is relatively straightforward. We provide for our wholesale portfolio essentially on a specific name-by-name basis, and so the overall allowance reflects our view of the collection of the files. Having said that, as we then look at our overall allowance taking into account our general as well, the degree of coverage is obviously one of the things we look at. And with respect to the US&amp;I piece specifically, I would also add that when you add in Alabama national to Centura, the coverage ratios for Centura will actually improve somewhat, and that might be a minor reflection of the overall numbers. I don't know whether that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess what I'm getting at is, as I said your surplus allowance has almost disappeared over the past several quarters as you've ran with a provision that's been a lot lower than your formations. So should I be looking for your provision to be closer to the level of your net formations going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I think it's fair to say that impaired formation in the long-run is likely to give an indication of future allowance developments, but it is -- it's frankly it's hard to say anything more helpful than that. The other piece that I would say that in terms of our general allowance, the size of the general allowance is driven by a combination of our views of the portfolio and the specific accounting requirements for the general allowance. And if you look at our portfolios overall, the corporate banking portfolio we've had a couple of impaired loans but I would emphasize it's only a couple and the overall portfolio quality there remains strong, not really justifying provisioning to any real extent.</p>
          <p>The Canadian Banking portfolios have grown and there's some growth in provisioning as a result of growth, but not really quality deterioration of any magnitude, at least. And so the and outside of Centura, the rest of the US&amp;I portfolios also remain at quite strong levels. So given the methodology for looking at allowance and coverage ratios, you know, the overall allowance actually reflects the quite strong health of the portfolio outside of the couple of pockets that we have identified.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to turn to a different subject, what's your take on the prognosis for Canadian non-bank ABCP in light of problems facing BMO's Apex and Sitka conduits, and I'm talking about the Montreal Accord. Do you think it's going to fly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I don't think that we're in a position to be able to answer that. As I said at the press conference following the annual meeting, you know, firstly, we were a very small participant in that marketplace. All six Canadian banks have been asked to support the margin funding facility but at very different levels.  And suffice to say that we're at a very low level because of our participation. But we have indicated that we are supportive because it's important to the Canadian marketplace. In terms of its success, you're just asking the wrong group. As I say, we've committed our support, but you'd have to ask the committee and the people involved in the restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One other question: Just on clarification of the gross and net sub-prime exposure, is the difference between the two the insurance provided by MBIA now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the information on page 5, I guess.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hold on a second. I've got the information here. Let me just make sure I get it for you straight here. So the net exposure, the gross exposure relates to the various held for trading portfolios, 2.4 in Capital Markets and 4.2 in available for sale. And the net is then 237 of other exposure in Capital Markets and the -- and again, the available for sale portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, just a couple of questions for you, Gord. Can you elaborate on why no dividend increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly, we don't -- you know, I know the market gets used to the dividend being automatically increased every second quarter but I would say that if you go back over the last number of years, it hasn't been that linear, and that there have been quarters where we have increased twice in two quarters and there's been other quarters where we have waited three quarters to make an increase. We just assessed the overall -- where our earnings were in the quarter, where our payout ratio was in the quarter and the uncertainty in the marketplace.  And you know, the yield on our stock and as I say our current payout ratio which is at the high end of our range, and we just felt that from a prudent perspective, it wasn't something that we should do and we'll evaluate it as we look at the next quarter. So I'd say it was a combination of things, but it is not something that we, as I say, have always been linear in terms of an automatic every second quarter increase. And as I say, you look at the payout ratio and the environment and we thought we would wait a quarter to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, last question. Gord, what gives you comfort of expecting a recovery later in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure there's anything that gives me comfort. There is so much uncertainty in the marketplace that it's -- if you were an economist, you could be bullish or bearish and you would have a 50% chance of being right. I do think that so much of what is occurring in the marketplace today relates to financial assets and it's very much compounded by mark-to-market accounting rules, which are making it more challenging because losses are being recorded and taken in portfolios, even where there is no impairment. And I think it's causing a lot of transparency issues in the marketplace, it's causing a lot of balance sheet and income volatility.</p>
          <p>I think that at some point here, and I can't tell you when, but at some point here we're going to start getting some degree of stability back into the financial assets, whether it's because there is so much value there with respect to opportunities. And I think if we get some stability back in the financial side of the marketplace, with the money that has been put into the system by the various central banks around the world and with the low level of interest rates, I think that -- and certainly our forecast is that as we look at the second half of the year, we should be facing a better environment both in the financial markets and in the US economy than we sit with today. That's our forecast, and as I say, I think we're certainly confident. But I think the sooner that we get some stability in these financial assets and a bid back into the US real estate market obviously that will be what will be the defining difference.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, that's a very difficult question. I think there is certainly value in the marketplace with respect to some assets and there are some which are going to continue to be very challenging, and that's what makes a market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My first question is for Morten. Just with respect to you, you mentioned that there was a file in the quarter that went impaired and you had credit derivatives that provided revenue. I wonder if you could sort of normalize on loan loss provision for me to ex-out that impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean it's &#x2013; in round numbers, the size of the provision that was hedged was about $20 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>20 million. How would that compare to, say, last quarter? Was there anything like that in last quarter's results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, as a rule, I mean, we do use credit derivatives for hedging our loan portfolio, but we are not a big user of credit derivatives for that purpose and we have not had a significant volume of recovery on hedges over the last few years, in part because we've had so few impaired loans.</p>

          <p>No, but it wasn't a particularly large number. I think it was 50 or 50 million-ish, 60 million-ish.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The following question is from Mario Mendonca of Genuity Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, a question for Chuck Winograd. The current replacement costs on the credit derivatives, there was a rather significant increase year-over-year and sequentially. And I understand that this is a matched book because the liabilities also increased pretty much in lock step. What I'm trying to get a flavor for is, one, what sort of assets are we referring to here? What underlying are we referring to that would deteriorate so quickly? And secondly, if you could tell us who the counterparties are or perhaps you're not talking about counterparties, perhaps you're talking about indices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this particular amount, 3.6 billion, is made up primarily of structured credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not, sorry, just to be clear. Its not 3.6, I'm referring to the current replacement cost credit derivatives, page 23 of the press release. 2.1 billion to 15.8.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2.1...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to be clear, when the replacement cost increases so significantly, year-over-year, or even quarter-over-quarter, it can only mean that the reference assets are declining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just don't have a good answer to give you. I can get back to you offline. Again as you said it's a matched issue and not open exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason why this is important, though, is you've explained that you have $2.8 billion of subprime exposure and that's it. But there's no asset that's declining to my knowledge at that pace.  The underlying quarter &#x2013; from one quarter to the next was off 52%. You disclosed that yourself, 10 billion to 15 billion. And I'm not sure how that could happen if in fact the underlying is not sub-prime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, somebody is whispering in my ear.  I mean, I just can't give you an answer right now because I don't have it. But it's not -- I could tell you that it's not sub-prime in terms of any net exposure to sub-prime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I'm not talking about net exposure. I'm talking about gross exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of gross exposure either. I mean, you can think of examples where we may be trading at a particular period of time and we've got matching trades outstanding that are either with counterparties that are collateralized or we're doing business with and have lines with, where we may have trades that are derivative trades.  And if that's what would be reflected in that, we wouldn't see that as risk because they're offset by the credit of the people that we're trading with. And we generally would have collateral if we were worried about it. So I'm just not -- I don't see that -- we don't see that as an exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The bank had -- I think you again pointed this out. The bank explained that the trading was almost a billion dollars, and that if you remove the 430 from interest rate and the fixed income trading, then the bank had an enormous credit trading quarter as well.  And I can't help but believe that this is precisely what we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell -- if you -- we did not have an enormous credit trading quarter at all. We didn't even have a good credit trading quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would the $430 million come out of the $132 million that you refer to as interest rate and credit trading in the supplemental?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry the 400 --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I can be specific, page of the supplement &#x2013; and the only reason I'm making a fuss about this is because the bank's comment about $2.8 billion in sub-prime exposure, I'm having a lot of trouble reconciling that with the decline as evidenced by the sharp increase in the replacement cost. It doesn't -- I don't know of an asset that is declining 50% in a quarter other than sub-prime. And that's why I'm sort of like a dog on a bone, it doesn't make sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mario, I think what Chuck is saying is that when we look at the overall business, what you see in that disclosure around the gross is that the business is run on a net basis. So that what we've looked -- what we've looked at in terms of outlining the exposures is our net increase in that exposure. And so I think that what would probably be more helpful is if that -- if we could have a little more time to talk you through how we look at the credit derivative business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in addition to that, I mean, credit spreads have widened quite dramatically, so these numbers would change in any event.  And they would probably change just from credit spread widening. But from our standpoint, we've got two sides of the trade; when we do a trade, we basically are handing off the liability to somebody and with that individual -- with that counterparty we're either collateralized or we're dealing with them on a credit basis or we're doing a netting with respect to our overall position with that counterparty and we just don't look at it in the fashion you're looking at it. It has nothing to do with an individual asset decreasing by 50% as far as I can see it. But the problem is, Mario, I just don't think of it that way, so it's very hard for me to adjust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll wrap it up here. The only reason why this is important is there are examples in financial history, one not very long ago, where there are companies that have been long and short certain indices on the presumption that the correlations, historical correlations they'd observed would hold. When they didn't hold, they blew up. That's why I'm asking the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the index trading we do, and we do do some index trading, basically that is being done almost entirely as a market maker. And we would not go home with significant net positions. Now, we do have trades that we've done with two sides here and we -- we have opposite liabilities with those assets and liabilities with those two sides. But we ourselves do not have a substantial position in that. It's in our counterparty exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Which we are all governed by our...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which basically come under limits and it's the way we run it. And we just don't look at it like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just &#x2013; it's Morten.  In terms of the credit derivatives trading, I would also add that a large volume of that is collateralized.  And to the extent that it isn't, it is with very high quality counterparties &#x2013; the majority is collateralized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not entirely sure I've expressed the concerns appropriately, but I think you're right, it's something we should take offline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's something we should take offline and we're happy to deal with it. I could sit around thinking about a lot of risk and this is just not one of them I think about except in the sense of counterparty credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of sub-prime, I mean we have disclosed all of our sub-prime exposure. So, if the question is, is there some other sub-prime exposure that we have not disclosed, the answer is no, as of January 31, there is not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you could theoretically trade sub-prime indices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but we are not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do some trading of subprime indices. It is a small business and if you basically saw the way we handled it, it is basically a market making business in every sense of the word. I'm not saying we have absolutely no position, but it's just not material whatsoever. Our positions are with the counterparties that we're doing trading with. Full stop.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Well, not really, but it will be good to follow up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One thing I can assure you is we'll give as much time as necessary.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and incidentally, the disclosure you guys provided this quarter was top notch and I appreciate it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Thank you for that. And I can tell you that Janice and her team have many hours, have logged many hours to get us there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you everyone. I would just like to clarify one point from a question earlier and that is that ANB will not be filing a final 10-K as they're not required. So let me just turn it back to Gord briefly, just to make some final comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just conclude by thanking everybody for attending the call. It has been an interesting quarter, to say the least, and a very different market than we faced a year ago.  But we're certainly, as I say, ensuring that we provide as much disclosure as we possibly can. And we think we're positioning our businesses well to face these headwinds as we go into the next quarter and hopefully a slightly better latter half of the year. So, thanks everyone for joining us and we'll talk to you again in three months time.</p>
