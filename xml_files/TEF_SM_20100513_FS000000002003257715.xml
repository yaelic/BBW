        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thanks for joining Telef&#xF3;nica's 2010 first quarter results conference call. Today with me I have Julio Linares, our Chief Operating Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Maria &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of our Telef&#xF3;nica Latin America; and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. During the Q&amp;A session, you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to any of them.</p>
          <p>Before turning to numbers, I would like to stress that Telef&#xF3;nica's Q1 strong set of results reflects the priorities established for the year, being our first goal to boost revenues, capturing growth opportunities in our footprint. Top line growth has been outstanding -- outperforming once again our peers despite our exposure to Spain, where economic conditions remain difficult. Our unmatched diversification and solid execution across businesses and geographies are paving the way. Revenue continues to trend up organically year-on-year, showing an acceleration versus the year 2009. And we are building foundations for further top line expansion for an increased commercial activity and faster customer growth.</p>
          <p>First quarter results also show our ability to retain top quality profitability and superior operating cash flow generation despite reinvest in efficiency gains to stimulate revenue. And year-to-date results are aligned with our internal expectations and thus we are comfortably on track to achieve 2010 guidance, as growth will be ramping up throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Medium-term guidance, including growing dividends, is fully reaffirmed and our balance should remains strong driving our high financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Let's now start a detailed analysis of our first quarter results with a summary of the P&amp;L. Consolidated revenues grew 1.7% year-on-year to just above &#x20AC;13.9 billion, reversing the 2.1 decline posted in 2009. Revenue stimulation was achieved despite the Venezuelan devaluations and the lower contribution of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a.</p>
          <p>Organic sales growth stood at 0.9%, ramping up 0.7 percentage points versus 2009 driven by the very solid top line expansion recorded by both Telef&#xF3;nica Latam and Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. As of March, close to two-thirds of our sales were generated outside of Spain.</p>
          <p>Operating income before D&amp;A topped &#x20AC;5.1 billion for the quarter, down 3.4% year-on-year in organic terms, reflecting the sharp increase in commercial activity and negative impacts from regulatory measures and non-recurrent effects.</p>
          <p>OIBDA margin maintained a healthy level, 36.7%, leveraging scale economies and tangible synergies across the Group. As a proxy to cash flow generation, operating cash flow reached almost &#x20AC;4 billion in the January through March period.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 4 for the bottom line review. First quarter net profit reached &#x20AC;4.7 billion or 2% above last year's figure. Our active management of non-operating results is pushing annual growth rates up by 9.2 percentage points from operating income down to net income. Reported earnings per share in the first quarter reached &#x20AC;0.36 or up 3% year-on-year. Our superior top line performance in the sector is best outlined in slide number 5 and drives our top quality cash generation and further improvement in the efficiency ratio.</p>
          <p>Organic revenue growth recorded the second sequential improvement, ramping up 70 basis points from 2009 year end, underpinned by the faster customer expansion that reached 6.1% year-on-year organically up through March. Excluding headwind from MTR cuts across our markets, organic revenue growth would have accelerated to 2.4%, close to 100 basis points up quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, our Latin American operations emerged for another quarter as a differentiating factor of our performance, contributing the most to revenue growth. On top of that, Telef&#xF3;nica Europe is pushing sales up despite very challenging conditions in some of our markets. From a business perspective, broadband connectivity, fixed and mobile, and applications and new services are the main revenue growth engines offsetting the lower contribution from the traditional business. We are increasing our exposure to the highest growth businesses. Broadband connectivity and applications and new services revenues already represented 22% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In slide number 6, we show how we are successfully setting the basis for further top line stimulation. In Q1, commercial results were very strong. We focused our efforts on value and growth levers recording an excellent performance in gross adds, which exceeded the 22 million mark in the first quarter, up 17% year-on-year. Please notice that this figure is 6% higher than 2009 quarterly average, showing the sustained pickup in commercial activity we're noticing across markets.</p>
          <p>In addition, churn remains under control improving 0.1 percentage points year-on-year on quality improvements. Churn contention has not only been outstanding, but also a differentiating factor in a very competitive environment. Total organic net adds were 4.3 million in the quarter, almost triple last year's figure and beat again the 2009 quarterly average mark. Especially positive was the performance in the mobile business, where we added 4.4 million customers organically with more than half of them in the contract segment with a strong drive in mobile broadband.</p>
          <p>We already have close to 16 million mobile broadband customers in the Group. I'd also like to remark the over 50% year-on-year increase in fixed broadband net adds mainly boosted by improved quality ratios in Latin America.</p>
          <p>The chart on slide number 7 underlines a remarkable acceleration in customer growth rates recorded across most services with solid increases in broadband accesses as we continue to actively manage current industry levers. 89% of our retail customers already have a broadband connection, either fixed or mobile or in some cases both. On the mobile side, our focus on enhancing the value of our customers by fostering prepaid to contract migrations and mobile broadband adoption is already bearing fruit, as you can see by the higher growth recorded in the two latter categories than in the total mobile customer base.</p>
          <p>Commercial push on retail fixed broadband is paying off and with the ramp up in the organic customer growth rate to 8.7%. The drive from revenue stimulation have some associated OIBDA margin pressure in the short term, as we decided to reinvest efficiency gains to revamp revenue growth. As you can see on the slide number 8, Group operating expenses were up 3% in organic terms the first three months of the year. External services and personnel expenses drove the growth in cost on the back of higher commercial expenses plus 5.5% year-on-year, derived from fast customer expansion, advertising and customer care, and constant improvements in the quality levels that have required traditional resources in our wireline businesses in Colombia and Brazil.</p>
          <p>Increased energy costs, network maintenance and expansion drove higher network costs. On the contrary, interconnection costs were down year-on-year driven by MTR cuts across regions. However, the bulk of the 3.4% year-on-year organic decline in OIBDA is explained by non-recurrent effects and negative regulatory impacts, which dragged 2.6 percentage points from OIBDA year-on-year change. As a result, Group operating profitability remained robust with solid OIBDA margins across regions.</p>
          <p>Let me now quickly review our progress towards meeting our full-year guidance on slide number 9. Up through March under guidance criteria, revenue growth was 1.7%, within our target range. As we explained during our full-year '09 results conference call, OIBDA quarterly performance wouldn't be linear throughout the year. Q1 of 2010 was below our annual target due to various factors. First, a challenging year-on-year comparison in Spain. Second, HanseNet results have only been consolidated since the middle of February with a very limited contribution. Third, the weaker performance of Telesp and Colombia fixed was recorded mainly from Q3 of '09. And in addition in the first quarter of 2010 we were negatively impacted by the heavy rains in Brazil. And finally, we had non-recurrent and regulatory impacts that I have just explained.</p>
          <p>However, OIBDA performance in Q1 was in line with our internal expectation, so we can comfortably reiterate our full-year guidance. Growth rates should accelerate throughout the year, especially in the second half, as we will have less challenging year-on-year comparisons in Telesp and Colombia fixed and commercial efforts started to rise in the third quarter of 2009. Please note that you are comparing Telesp's best quarter of 2009 with what should be the worst quarter of 2010. OIBDA growth in Q2 is expected to be within the guidance range, though first half performance will still be dragged by the items mentioned before. We continue to expect 2010 CapEx to be in the range of 7.45 to &#x20AC;7.65 billion with Q1 figures reflecting CapEx seasonality.</p>
          <p>Let's now review our performance in Spain where revenue trends confirm that the worst is over. We continue to see a sustained gradual top line recovery in a challenging environment. In Q1, total revenues in Spain dropped 3.9% year-on-year in comparable terms, the lowest decline recorded in the last five quarters on the back of a better performance in the mobile business. It is worth highlighting the very strong commercial KPIs posted in Q1 across businesses with solid customer growth that should translate into a better revenue trend in coming quarters. Gross adds increased 25% on Q1 of '09 compared with a 14% drop a year ago. Revenue performance is improving with a healthy 47.3% OIBDA margin on a comparable basis despite the higher commercial costs derived from our strategy to stimulate growth, which drove the OIBDA margin down year-on-year.</p>
          <p>As we explained in the past and due to the integrated management of the fixed and wireless businesses in Spain and in order to avoid the distortions, which without affecting the consolidated results of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a may result in an erroneous interpretation of the individual performance of each of the businesses especially at the level of operating expenses and investment from the fourth quarter of 2010, we are only disclosing consolidated OIBDA and CapEx figures. Within this context, the company operating cash flow generation remained solid at &#x20AC;1.8 billion in the first three months of the year.</p>
          <p>On slide number 11, wireless service revenues in Spain declined 7.1% year-on-year, posting the largest quarterly improvement since we reached the bottom in Q2 of 2009. Fixed basis points in the fourth quarter '09 driven by the ramp up in customer growth and the improvement in ARPU.</p>
          <p>Commercial activity in Q1 rose dramatically year-on-year. Gross adds went up 31% and we maintained the lowest churn in the market at 2.2%, in line with the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Focused commercial efforts on the contract segment with 197,000 postpaid net adds in the quarter, led to a close to 7% year-on-year growth in the customer base. By the end of March 2010, the contract segment already accounted for over 65% of total accesses. It is also worth highlighting the improvement in traffic. In Q1 of 2010, for the first time since the last quarter of '08, traffic growth was positive, while outgoing voice yield -- voice yield performed in line with expectations and declined around 6%. As a result in comparable terms and excluding the mobile termination rate cuts, ARPU declined 6.7% year-on-year versus negative 7.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Mobile broadband structure (13: 34) is rising and we already have more than three million customers with monthly data flat rates reaching 2.3 million, more than doubling last year's figure. As a result, wireless data connectivity revenues went up close to 70% in the quarter, driving non-P2P SMS data revenues to 65% of total data revenues up six percentage points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>On the wireline business, KPIs are also solid with a significant acceleration in commercial activity versus the first quarter of '09. In fixed broadband, we have a strong 55% market share after recording the highest net adds since the last quarter of 2008, driving the total customer base up 5.4% year-on-year compared to growth of 4.4% recorded in 2009. Broadband connectivity ARPU stood at roughly &#x20AC;30 with a stable year-on-year erosion compared with previous quarters and again in line with current expectations.</p>
          <p>In Pay TV, we have expanded our market share to 18% with Q1 net adds above the average levels recorded in 2009. On the traditional fixed line business to highlight that we have recorded a positive growth in our access base during the quarter given the year-on-year decline at 1.4%. This is reflected on the positive quarterly net adds as compared with quarterly net losses along 2009. Retail line losses, although continue to be affected by new types of regulated wholesale accesses, improved significantly compared with Q1 '09 showing a year-on-year decline of 13.6% while broadly stable quarter-on-quarter. It's important to notice that the retail loss was more than offset by net adds in the wholesale segment and therefore the impact in revenues is lower as these lines ultimately generate revenue for us.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, the relatively weaker performance versus previous quarters was affected by the lower contribution by the subsidiaries like Telyco and TTP. This is an oddity of the IT business, though these revenues continue to perform strongly, and lower voice and access revenues.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, broadband revenues were back to growth in the quarter. In summary, in Spain, we are maintaining our leadership position, while we set the basis for future growth. In a very competitive environment, Telef&#xF3;nica is a player with the widest gap between revenue and customer market share in Spain.</p>
          <p>On slide number 13, we start reviewing our Latin American businesses. We're recording a strong rebound in commercial volumes across the region, which has led to an inflection point in revenue trend. Our total customer base in Latin America expanded rapidly to over 172 million accesses, 8.1% more than a year ago and 1.6 percentage points ahead of the growth recorded in 2009. Higher gross adds in the first three months of the year and churn contention underpinned a robust rise in customers.</p>
          <p>As a result in Q1 2010, organic revenue growth ramped up to 5.4%, after the gradual deceleration recorded throughout 2009, while we expect an opposite trend for 2010. This solid performance was driven by double-digit growth in mobile service and Internet and TV revenues. Organic OIBDA year-on-year growth reached 3.4% impacted by higher commercial costs, up 12% on the strong activity in the quarter underlined with the company's priorities for 2010 of reinvesting efficiencies to boost revenue growth.</p>
          <p>OIBDA margin stood at 36.5% in the first quarter of 2010 or down 70 basis points in organic terms year-on-year and 165 basis points in reported terms. This organic margin erosion is the reflection of two effects, on the endogenous side operational issues, mainly at Telesp and the wireline operation in Colombia, which drove 2.1 percentage points of margins being partially offset by efficiency improvement in other countries with a 1.7% margin improvement.</p>
          <p>While on the exogenous foreign exchange front, the 3.9 percentage points negative impact of the bolivar's devaluation was partially offset by the positive evolution of other currencies leveraging once again our high diversification. OIBDA growth should ramp up in coming quarters as year-on-year comparisons for our wireline operations will ease. It is also worth highlighting the stability of our operating cash flow in euro terms despite the Venezuelan devaluation.</p>
          <p>In slide number 14, we outline the evolution of our Latin American wireless businesses. Customer growth ramped up to 11% year-on-year in the region and our penetration rate has reached 91%. Our focus on enhancing the value of our customer base is reflected in the faster growth in our contract base, plus 17%, and the rapid increase of mobile broadband accesses, which have multiplied by 2.5 times since March of 2009, but only represent close to 4% of our base. Therefore the growth potential is huge.</p>
          <p>Q1 2010, net adds almost rose by three times year-on-year, which is a significantly higher level on the 2009 quarterly average. Please notice that a year ago net adds were down year-on-year. More remarkable is the fact that 45% of the customer growth in the quarter was in postpaid, more than doubling the figure of the first quarter of 2009. In parallel, the outstanding evolution of mobile data revenues and the strong traffic increase drove outgoing ARPU up 3.5% in organic terms year-on-year. Thus, total organic ARPU performance improved from previous quarters remaining virtually flat year-on-year in spite of the strong customer growth posted in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenues went up over 12% organically, a steady acceleration along the quarter. This growth was underpinned by the robust 44% year-on-year increase in data revenues, which already account for 21% of service revenues, advancing over five percentage points versus March 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me now share with you our progresses in transforming our wireline businesses in Latin America as a way to capture the growth potential in the region. Again, commercial KPIs recorded remarkable improvements versus previous quarters. On the one side, fixed broadband accesses reached 6.6 million in March, accelerating its growth rate to 7% year-on-year, fueled by the good performance posted across our operations once Brazil and Colombia are back on track on the operational front.</p>
          <p>Fixed broadband net adds reached 215,000 in the quarter, more than doubling 2009 quarterly average and showing a much better year-on-year performance than in the first quarter of last year. This was achieved thanks to remarkable quality improvements, which led to the lowest broadband churn since we launched this service.</p>
          <p>On the other side, the traditional wireline business is improving both in terms of line losses on the back of lower churn and in terms of traffic, which has slightly improved year-on-year. Our strategy to foster bundle penetration continues to get traction in double and triple-play bundles already represent 57% of our broadband connections increasing by close to six percentage points year-on-year.</p>
          <p>As a result, Internet and Pay TV increased their contribution to total revenues with an average weight of 21% in the region, up 1.6 percentage points in organic terms over last year's figure with improvements in most countries.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to slide number 16 to quickly review Telesp's recent performance. I would like to highlight the significant recovery recording on the commercial front, while the company is again gaining momentum despite challenging conditions due to heavy rains suffered in Brazil in January and February, which limited our commercial activity at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>However, once the rains were over, commercial activity rose sharply, fueling quarterly fixed broadband net adds to 163,000, exceeding the volume recorded in 2009. Close to 50% of the net adds were achieved in March with momentum continuing in April. And we are recovering market share in those areas where cable competition is strong. The traditional business is also improving with line losses coming down 27% year-on-year in the quarter and even recording positive nets adds in March and April. These results also were achieved on the back of a strong quality improvement as showed by Anatel indicators, which have led to drastic reduction in churn.</p>
          <p>We have been able to turn around the operating performance, maintaining a stable CapEx-to-sales ratio in the last 12 months, which means that the Telesp's problems were not derived from the lack of investment in the past. The better operational KPIs are gradually flowing into financials with positive segment derivatives, both in terms of revenue and OIBDA. Top line is consolidating the trend towards positive growth, but OIBDA year-on-year performance was impacted by the adverse weather conditions, which required additional resources to guarantee our services.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, we are planning to improve the trend in operating results we are already recording in Colombia across businesses as a result of initiatives implemented to reposition our commercial offer and enhance quality metrics. In wireline, broadband net adds ramped up strongly to 40,000 accesses, a 79% year-on-year increase and over three times the net adds recorded in the previous quarter. The traditional business is also posting better results, reducing line losses dramatically to just 12,000 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect these operating improvements to gradually translate into a better financial performance with the worst already behind us. In the wireless business, churn reduction has been key to post over 320,000 net adds in the quarter, doubling Q4 of '09 figure and allowing us to regain market share. There's been a marked improvement in the quality of customer growth, as contract net adds rose sharply to account for close to 50% of net adds in the quarter versus less than a third in the fourth quarter of 2009. Improved operating results are paying off in financial results with a significant sequential improvement in mobile service revenues and an improved trend in wireless revenues.</p>
          <p>Let me now highlight the main topics across other key operations. In Mexico, commercial activity is on the rise with a focus on the contract segment outpacing the total base growth by 19 percentage points. Market share expansion continues surpassing already 21%, while the scale with over 18 million customers allows OIBDA margin to continue widening despite the strong commercial activity in the quarter. Mexico remains the largest contributor to organic operating cash flow growth in the region. Venezuela is holding very well the bolivar's devaluation.</p>
          <p>Our commercial strategy is focused on value with a selective customer acquisition approach on higher handset costs. Organic service revenue growth remains strong at over 20% year-on-year, while a 46% OIBDA margin continues to a benchmark in the region. Vivo outperformed the market, strengthening its undisputed leadership for the second quarter in a row. Net adds marked a new record for a first quarter with a strong focus in contract where Vivo achieved over 70% net adds market share.</p>
          <p>Service revenue growth accelerated while OIBDA margin remained very strong at over 30% stable year-on-year despite the strong commercial activity in the quarter. Argentina performance continued to be outstanding across both businesses on the back of strong customer growth even in traditional accesses.</p>
          <p>In Chile, the financials improved in the first quarter of the year, driven mainly by the mobile business while commercial activity was strong despite a slowdown in March after the earthquake. Let me stress that related damages are covered by our insurance policies.</p>
          <p>In summary, very strong commercial volumes across the region bolstered by better economies and churn reduction, which will foster revenue growth in coming quarters and in parallel, we continue to leverage our scale and regional integrated management model to extract efficiencies to report robust profitability.</p>
          <p>And let's now turn to Europe in slide number 19. Telef&#xF3;nica Europe once again delivered strong revenue growth and increased profitability amid challenging economic environment and the negative impacts of mobile termination rate cuts. The Group has further enhanced its portfolio with the incorporation of HanseNet and Jajah to the perimeter of consolidation, up to 54 million customers mark at the end of the first quarter. We maintained our excellent momentum across key growth drivers with increased smartphone penetration and mobile Internet usage. Mobile broadband accesses expanded 67% year-on-year, surpassing 7 million accesses and non-peer-to-peer SMS data revenue growth exceeded 35% year-on-year organically.</p>
          <p>In addition, the mobile contract segment continued showing strong performance, growing its base by 12% year-on-year, accounting for close to 90% of total net adds in the quarter. As a result, organic revenue growth ramped up from the previous quarter to an outstanding 5.4% year-on-year, excluding the impacts from MTR cuts. Profitability in the business was sustained in the first quarter with Germany and UK being the key drivers of Group's organic OIBDA year-on-year increase close to 4% if non-recurring factors were excluded in both periods, demonstrating the value of diversification and further efficiency.</p>
          <p>In the increasingly competitive UK market, O2 continue to deliver solid results. Mobile service revenues continued to excel with year-on-year growth accelerating to 9.4% excluding MTR cuts, sustaining sequential trends. Our core belief in putting the customer first is paying off with the best-in-class churn of 1.1% in the convert segment, reflecting our clear ability to retain high-value customers regardless of any smartphone exclusivity. Our customer base quality continued to improve with nearly half of our customers now in this segment, which has grown 4% in the last 12 months. Telef&#xF3;nica O2 UK is ahead of the learning curve and understanding customer behavior, which allows offering great user experience.</p>
          <p>Independent tests are also increasingly naming O2 as a superior mobile data player. Furthermore, our focus on capturing the mobile Internet opportunity to drive further revenue growth is increasingly showing up as reflected by the 44% year-on-year increase in non-peer-to-peer SMS data revenues in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Improved profitability of the business is differential in the market with OIBDA margin advancing 1.2 percentage points over the previous year to 25.3%, thanks to a disciplined approach to customer acquisition and retention. And the company continued investing in network transformation to increase our already high quality standards.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 21 to review our German operations. The company reinforced its challenger approach after incorporating HanseNet and addressing new market segments with the launch of O2on target for the SMEsegment.</p>
          <p>Trading momentum continued with 357,000 mobile net additions in the first quarter of 2010 or a 16% growth year-on-year with 43% of net additions in the contract segment. This was driven by the continued success O2o tariffs. The robust evolution of mobile service revenue is noteworthy with year-on-year growth ramping up from -- for the fifth quarter in a row in organic terms and excluding MTRs to 3.8% leading also to the first year-on-year increase in reported terms since the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Key growth drivers were a rapid growth in non-peer-to-peer SMS data revenues, plus 44% year-on-year, fueled by increased penetration of mobile broadband into base and] supported by customer base expansion. The company continued advancing in terms of profitability, growing OIBDA by 13% in organic terms up through March and expanding OIBDA margin 0.9 percentage points organically on the back of operational efficiency developed in 2009.</p>
          <p>Reported margin declined year-on-year due to the lower margin in HanseNet, which drove a 1.3 percentage points drag in the OIBDA margin. Operating cash flow was over seven times higher than a year earlier driven by enhanced profitability and after the network rollout developed last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 22 to review our financial position, we would like to say that our debt level has increased by &#x20AC;1.7 billion since December 2009, mainly due to acquisitions, primarily HanseNet and &#x20AC;1 billion reduction in the value of our cash in Venezuela following the devaluation of the bolivar. This has pushed our net financial debt to 2.2 times OIBDA or 2.3 times when included debt like cash commitments, so the ratio stands in the middle of our target range. I would like to highlight that we have reinforced our liquidity position, while pushing our interest expenses below our initial target level. Year-to-date, we have raised long-term financing in excess of &#x20AC;5 billion. We have issued &#x20AC;4 billion in bonds in Europe and the U.S. and some bank credit lines and loans of &#x20AC;1.6 billion. As of March, we kept our total undrawn credit lines in the &#x20AC;8 billion range with more than two-thirds maturing long-term.</p>
          <p>The effective interest rate has fallen by more than 0.5 percentage point from 2009, benefiting from our floating exposure. The interest costs stood at 5% or &#x20AC;46.5 billion average total debt, which is better than the low part of the range for the full year. Some backup is expected that some of the savings will not be repeated in the coming quarters as they are related to financial accruals of contingencies that we have avoided. Also, mildly upward sloping yield curves in general will raise the cost of our  floating debt. All in all, we expect to meet our initial target for the year.</p>
          <p>Let me now spend a few minutes on our &#x20AC;5.7 billion all-cash offer announced for PT's 50% in Brasilcel. Our ambition is to materialize what has been our first M&amp;A priority for several years. We're talking about a full value offer that represents a unique value creation opportunity for Portugal Telecom's and Vivo's shareholders that fully crystallizes the Vivo value and that cannot be replicated on a stand-alone basis at PT.</p>
          <p>The fact that PT's Board unanimously rejected the offer without giving PT's shareholders the opportunity to be heard is indicative of PT's Board priorities and should raise significant concerns about corporate governance in an internationally listed company that according to its management is shareholder-driven. We are offering an extremely generous premium to both last 12 months prices for Vivo's own shares and the value of Brasilcel selling through PT some of the valuation as estimated by analysts. It is a full price, because it includes the full year evaluation of Vivo and most of the synergies derived from the potential subsequent integration of Vivo and Telesp. Therefore it more than doubles the maximum market valuation ever achieved by PT's stake in Vivo as seen at Bloomberg and since Vivo's market cap is currently close to that maximum, the offer cannot be labeled as opportunistic.</p>
          <p>The difference between our offer and the stand-alone Vivo value is synergies that only we can create. We have over the years presented multiple alternatives to Portugal Telecom to access and share these synergies with no answer. Our offer proposes to share a vast proportion of these synergies. Under ideal circumstances, with PT's share of Vivo valued at our offer price and everything else valued at market, PT's fair share of those synergies would be 31%.</p>
          <p>We are offering a substantially higher proportion of synergies at 31%. PT's Board decision to shrug off our proposal should be more perplexing, raising doubts about PT's directors fiduciary duties to choose the best option for all shareholders. Our offer is full, clear and final. PT's strategic position will be enhanced, not constrained, by accepting our offer. I think it would allow it to deal with debt, pension and dividend sustainability issues of major strategic significance. PT's past reputation as a shareholder minded company is seriously at risk.</p>
          <p>To finish my presentation and as a summary of Q1 of 2010 results, let me say that we have posted a very strong set of results, despite challenging conditions in some of our markets, delivering on the management priorities we announced for 2010 by first accelerating revenue growth versus the fiscal year '09 to deliver once again a distinctive growth profile in the sector. This enhances the value of our diversification with close of two-thirds of our revenues being generated outside of Spain.</p>
          <p>Second, ramping up the commercial activity across regions to further stimulate top line growth, posting a solid growth in customers, focused on contract and broadband. Third, posting a healthy OIBDA margin and generating a high operating cash flow. Fourth, maintaining a solid financial position. And finally, I'd like to reiterate that we are fully on track to meet our commitment, not only in 2010, but in the mid-term. We do confirm our 2010 and 2012 guidance including dividends.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you. First question on the guidance for 2010. You flagged some factors such as the year-on-year comparisons that help the achievability of that, but I wondered in terms of the commercial activity, should we expect a clear step-down in the second half of the year, perhaps, in order to help achieve that EBITDA target for the full-year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the Vivo offer, a couple of questions here. Firstly, for PT, you mentioned obviously they haven't given shareholders an opportunity to discuss this. Would you consider or are you able to call in AGM PT to discuss the Vivo bid? And what is the scope, if any, to raise some of the three billion synergies you flagged between Vivo and Telesp under the current ownership structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, thanks for the questions. First on the guidance, as we said in the full year of 2009, the year is going to be extremely non-linear. We expect most of the contributions especially in the year-on-year comparison term to come in the second half. The ramp-up in commercial activity started in the third quarter of 2009, where we anticipated that they will -- would not come to an end and that we would be investing in keeping our customers well served. So yes, there is going to be an extremely non-linear profile of the year and we're very confident that not only in Spain, but also in the recovery in our Latin American operations, it will be highly visible in the second half of the year. Which is why we have reiterated the guidance that we provided about three months ago.</p>
          <p>On your Vivo question, well shareholders have the right to call AGMs. I think it is not interesting whether it is one set of shareholders or other that calls the meetings. We understand that whenever an important thing is put to the board or directly to the shareholders, it should be analyzed there. Under normal circumstances, any shareholders should be able to call a meeting and we don't see why that wouldn't be the case this time. As to a synergy sharing, it's very hard to breed without mating, if you allow my expression. It's very difficult that those synergies which have a lot to do with unifying, saving costs and avoiding duplication, besides some financial and more non-operational savings can be achieved without really putting the assets together. Which is why we have been so decisive in putting those numbers on the table. We think it is extremely difficult to achieve those synergies without proper integration. And certainly this is the kind of thing that we have spent a lot of time thinking about.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Will Milner from Arete Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of questions on Brazil. Firstly on Vivo. Voice revenues were flat year-over-year despite the massive increase in traffic, so clearly voice pricing is falling pretty rapidly. I just want to -- how you think about preventing data pricing going the same way, given you talked about the massive potential in data?</p>
          <p>And the other question is on Telesp. Just in Telesp's local results, it looked like both personnel costs and outsourcing expenses increased around 10% year-over-year. Now partly the outsourcing was due, as you say, to bad weather, but just looking forward how do you see those cost buckets evolving over the course of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. I will take the first, the Telesp one. On the personnel costs and on the outsourcing, the personnel costs we are recurring in the first quarter of this year part of the variable cost of remuneration of our team corresponding to 2009, and therefore, it should not be recurring. And you're right on the outsourcing part of your question. It is due to much more intensive maintenance and repair effort during the first two months of the year because of the heavy rain that occurred in Sao Paulo in these two months, the heaviest rain period in the last 63 years, so we were forced to increase the level of outsourcing support in order to preserve or even increase the quality levels that we have done. In fact, we have prioritized repairs and maintenance with &#x2013; compared to sales and we have put the whole team to take care of quality. And that is why the commercial activity only was effectively taking place during the month of March. So that's on Telesp.</p>
          <p>And on Vivo, the evolution of service revenue is even improving. Net adds, as you know, 2.2 million and therefore, we should expect those adds to contribute to further growth in the remaining quarters. Churn is pretty stable at the level of 2.5%. In terms of the level of ARPU, it is declining, but it is declining slightly compared to the previous quarters. And in fact, service revenue has been accelerating and it has been stronger in the month of March than in February and April has been even stronger than in March.</p>
          <p>So we are seeing service revenue acceleration, which should -- in the coming months should take away the concern of aggressive pricing campaigns among the different competitors in the region. The market is effectively becoming more rational, especially in the handset subsidiary part of the business. And on the data market, we are seeing, I would say, a rational behavior in the market in terms of going to escalatable tariffs depending on data and data limits. So we will keep you posted, but as far as it stands for the first quarter, market is proving to be aggressive and very sound and very dynamic, but it's improving, and it's improving both in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of profitability.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from David Wright from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's David here. A couple of questions. Firstly on Vivo, I guess, it's a two part. I think you used to be &#x2013; there is a sort of representation at the PT boardroom level. Should I assume that you are not privy to those discussions?</p>
          <p>And second of all, it does make sense, of course, to merge Vivo and Telesp at some point. It does seem that PT didn't even reference the price that just said they wanted to stay in Brazil. What is the opportunity to just continue the JV and try to inject Telesp into that as an alternative?</p>
          <p>And then I guess, secondly my question is on MTRs. You've said quite frequently during the presentation and in the report, that growth is better ex MTRs, which of course have been fairly severe. But the outlook for them is perhaps even more severe and I'd be interested in Guillermo's view on how MTRs could move into Spain, perhaps also Matthew's view on how they could evolve in Germany. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, Santiago here. Let me take the first question. If I understood you correctly, the first part is about out board representation at PT. Certainly, whenever anything is related to Vivo, especially in contentious terms, Telef&#xF3;nica representatives are absent as they should be. So you can take it for granted that the -- that's exactly the way it has worked in the past. The relationship has been quite fluid and no problem has arisen on many term including that.</p>
          <p>And on merging, I think I mentioned and indicated that we have tried pretty much everything else, including combinations of the sort that you seem to indicate. So if after 11 years of owning 10% of PT and  eight years of the Vivo combination, we are where we are is because we have not been able to find some kind of compromise between ownership and synergy extraction, which is why we decided to go this route. I think I should let Guillermo answer the MTR part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David regarding MTR the current regulation in Spain, the glide path has been defined, has already been defined until the beginning of 2012 and until the end of 2011 converging to &#x20AC;0.04. They're roughly -- right now we're a little bit below the average in Europe. And let me remind you that the exposure that we have -- the net exposure we have for an  interconnection rate, our total revenues in mobile is 2% and that's because of the size of our operation in mobile and also the size of operation in the fixed business.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David, it's Matthew. So in Germany, we've got certainty through to November 2010. And I certainly wouldn't expect the same level of proposed cuts that we've seen in the UK. And as you know, we and the operators in the UK have been extremely vocal about Ofcom's proposals, which we just see as unreasonable, particularly moving from a lwic to a lwic plus model. So debate is ongoing with Ofcom in the UK. In Germany more stability and certainly we don't expect it to be as severe as the UK. proposal.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Luis Prota from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I have two questions. The first one is on Venezuela and whether you could give us an update on any likelihood of repatriating cash as this is having some impact on the full-year monetary adjustment. And also in this country, if you could give us any light on what percentage of the margin compression that we saw on a year-on-year basis this quarter is due the higher cost of the handsets. You are mentioning this in the press release, but I remember in previous conference calls, you mentioning that because the level of subsidies is very low there and that the impact from devaluation was not going to be material here, so I'm surprised to see that in the press release now.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the tax rate, which is also related to the EPS target for the year. So, Santiago, you mentioned in the full-year results the tax rate now is expected to be 25 to 27%. I understand that on a quarterly basis this changes, but this quarter is 30%, is there something this quarter happening or should we still expect 25 to 27%?  Anything that you can explain there would be useful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luis, let met take the Venezuelan question first. Things have gotten slightly more complicated in Venezuela for internal reasons, and so we are getting enough delay in the repatriation of those funds. There is also a risk although not a major one that part of the funds that we have there will not come as soon as we expect. But certainly, as soon as we get full information and full clarity about when and at what rate that will come, we will disclose it. It will be an important fact.</p>
          <p>On the tax rate, we do reiterate the tax rate soft guidance that we provided. You should be aware that a lot of the deductions and tax relief positions that we take are one-off events. They happen to fall in one particular month and those three -- the first three months of the year are not particularly abundant -- or rich in tax events. So we do keep the guidance. It is going to go between 25 and 27% and the first quarter results is just going to be a data point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Luis, taking your question on the margin compression in Venezuela, what percentage is due to handset, most of the effect is due to handsets costs. As you know, we are now buying the handsets not at the official rate, but in the market, and therefore that's affecting both the cost, because we are accounting this extra cost -- this FX extra cost at the operating level -- the operational level.  And that this is also affecting the absolute amount of customers that we are able to get from the market, because it's put a lot of pressure on the commercial effort. So, we cannot disclose you how much of the margin compression is there, but it is mostly due to that and we will keep you posted whenever we are able to get some handsets at the official rate, because that should help to alleviate this tension.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can follow up on this  -- this means that you're not <mark type="inaudible" /> customers increasing their cost of the handset?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions, please. First on Mexico. Service revenue seems to have slowed down a bit although still a strong performance in Q1 versus Q4 and that's pretty much unlike what we're seeing in a number of other countries. Is there anything specific that explains that? And are you expecting a reacceleration as we're seeing in other countries in Latin America?</p>
          <p>The second question with regards to Portugal Telecom and the Vivo situation, Portugal Telecom management has very clearly said, I think, in the past that they are very attached to Vivo. And in that context and given the fact that in the later proposals that you made to PT management you highlight a number of ways PT management could create value for its shareholders, why didn't you decide to bid right away for the whole of Portugal Telecom? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on Mexico, revenue growth is effectively, as you were mentioning, 40% and it's lower than before, but should also take into consideration the fact that the company is becoming bigger and bigger and, therefore, we have to start things from a legal base. We see the market is strong in Mexico,  service revenues are growing nicely. Handset sales are also growing nicely in Mexico. If we are lagging behind ourselves and we would be much more aggressive on the data -- part on the mobile Internet part but we're constrained by the lack of spectrum mainly on the Mexico City. And that's why we will be active on the auction -- spectrum auction in the next weeks.</p>
          <p>But having said that, <mark type="inaudible" /> revenues are still growing 24%, they already represent 25 -- 22% of total revenues. Net adds are much higher than in the first quarter of 2009. Our churn levels are pretty stable and lower than those of our main competitor -- the market leader. We have been able to increase market share once again in the first quarter. We are already up to 21% threshold and according to our estimate, we have been getting 27% of net adds. Profit growth is pretty sound 17% year-on-year versus our growth in the <mark type="inaudible" /> of 14.8%. So on MOU, I mean it's &#x2013; MOU has been growing to 2.5%. So it is true that we are growing less than before, but it is also true that growth is still there, it's pretty sound and we see a very strong market dynamics and we hope we will take advantage of that.</p>
          <p>As a result of all that, Mexico is becoming more and more important at the regional level. The contribution of revenue growth of Mexico in the first quarter of this year is much higher than in the first quarter of last year. And effectively, it's taking the relay -- partially the relay of lower contribution from Venezuela for example. So we are -- we have very big expectations about Mexico and we're putting our effort to really speed up growth there.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is not trueon PT's and Vivo's situation. Our alliance with PT has always been centered on Brazil, that's how it all started, that's what we wanted and that's what we're trying to complete with this offer that we've put on them. It has not been hostile to any one and certainly not to PT or Portugal that we're interested in. We've always said that this was a bridge to Brazil and unfortunately all the other things that we have tried over the years didn't seem to work out for very understandable, but very unacceptable reasons. The full bid on PT is plagued with all sorts of uncertainties. It is not the kind of thing that we would like to do, but certainly the economics of the deal would suggest that it probably would have been more financially viable to do so. But certainly it not only about the financial values, it's also about respect for Portugal, it's about respect for its shareholder's decision that we decided to put all the pressure on one single very attractive irreplicable offer.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. I'd like to redirect your attention to Spain, if I may, and just ask you, having been through a pretty severe recession, what you think based on this experience might be the impact on the business if austerity measures are to be taken to bring down the Spanish government's funding deficit? And also if in the course of trying to deflate the economy somewhat to sort of rebate it in euros, the government might look at the cost of certain important items to consumers such as your line rental, for example, and ask you as a theory anyway, as a hypothesis, to reduce your line rental slightly to help them accommodate lower pay in the, for example in the public sector?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon, this is Guillermo. First of all, it's too early to tell the impact of the measures and the measure that have been announced by the government --  the effect it would have on our business. However, overall comment is that we believe that they will help to create confidence in the financial markets and in the overall economy as a whole.</p>
          <p>Regarding what are we seeing in the business this last month and these last weeks, as Santiago mentioned in his -- in the presentation, we think that the worst is over. We see some earlier slight signs of recovery -- very, very early -- very, very mild but, for example, mobile traffic is for the first time in many quarters on the positive. Very small, 0.1%, but that's a positive. We see the market as a whole, not only Telef&#xF3;nica market, but the whole market of broadband, of fixed lines growing. Of course, we are not in the level of two years ago, but they are growing, and they are behaving better than a few quarters ago. Also some maybe internal financial things and measures like bad debt provisions -- we are recovering bad debt provisions, so that's a positive. So too early to tell the measures of the impact of the government.</p>
          <p>And regarding our business with the public sector, let me remind you that the type of business we conduct is a multi-analog contract with a strong ICT component. So many of these services are provided in synergies and cost saving for the customers and the scale for the public sector. So too early to tell, but on that side, we feel a little bit comfortable with our business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions really. One is, could you, I guess, an observation it seems that versus other integrated operators, your Pay TV growth seems relatively modest. Any plans to do anything there?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I guess, what -- back to Vivo, I mean, it sounds as though the sort of marriage with Portugal Tel is sort of on the rocks. I mean, what's the next steps if it becomes clear that shareholders will not back your bid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would take a part of the first question regarding the Pay TV effort in Latin America, what has occurred during the first quarter and then I'll pass it over to Guillermo for his comments on Spain. In the first quarter, we have been, as you know, focusing on reversing the situation both in Telesp and in Colombia. And on that side, in Telesp, we're mainly focused on the traditional business, the traditional lines business and ADSL. And that way, we have not been that active on fueling our growth on TV on the triple-play side.</p>
          <p>But in spite of that, we have been growing more in TV than the previous quarter. So it proves that the market is there and it proves that once we are setting up -- we're fixing the basics of the market, bundling is effective. And therefore, that's why we're focusing in the second quarter of this year mainly in Telesp, but also in Colombia to increase the quality of our offer on TV both in terms of the number of high-definition channels and in terms of the electronic guide, the interaction guide with the customers in order to improve our situation.</p>
          <p>So basically, we have been more successful in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter in TV, but still we're not at full steam at all. We need to improve our offer. Our churn, our TV churn has been significantly reduced in the region. So it's a pending matter to accelerate on that side for the second quarter of this year. And therefore, we do see the market, we've seen that there is an opportunity. We have been pretty focused on fixing the basics of these major two businesses.</p>
          <p>As you know, in Argentina, we are refrained from selling TV, because of regulation. And in the other two markets, in Peru and in Chile, we have been doing relatively well. So I guess that you will be seeing a higher activity in the TV, on the Pay TV side. We ambition to be a player and we think the market is there and decent growth opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the Pay TV market in Spain, first, as a market, the market has been decreasing a little bit since the beginning of the recession. In our case, last summer, we changed our content offering, including a football channel in our offering. And since then, we start growing again. Right now, we have an increase in our customer base of 21%. Our market share is 18%. It was 14% one year ago and that's impressive taking into account that we don't cover the whole geography of Spain. We only cover 60% of the households, because of the lengths of the look. So, we are growing nicely and reaching a 20% mark in a few quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jonathan, on the next steps, this offer is worth about 80% of PT's market cap. We were surprised to learn that PT's Board of Directors with the absence of Telef&#xF3;nica representatives decided to shrug it off in a two-hour discussion with a two-line statement with no other ways to proceed forward. So we certainly think this is the kind of issue that shareholders should be directly consulted about. Whether this can be done or it cannot, remains to be seen, but certainly our offer is still full, it is still fair, it's still valid. So there is always the chance that the issue might be revisited. Other than that, if shareholders are not interested, we have nothing else to add. But we do think that shareholders ought to be heard in this process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mandeep Singh from Berenberg. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Given the nature of the relationship and how that may have developed and the bid, if the bid is not clearly accepted, which it appears it won't be, do you see your own partnership with Portugal Telecom as untenable?</p>
          <p>And the second question is why you're not using such proceeds to buy back your own shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, Mandeep. It's not that that relationship with PT has gone to any the rocks, it's that we have diverging views as to what the next step in Brazil should be. We jointly own and control 60% of the economic value of Vivo. We think -- and there is a lot of value lying idly on the floor and we think it should be picked up. That's what we  feel inclined to do. We think that's the overall mandate of our shareholders, but it is not Telef&#xF3;nica Portugal Telecom's difficulty in understanding any other thing.</p>
          <p>When this thing is over, we will just reassess what the other option are, including going back to where we were, because if shareholders do not like our proposal then that's fine. But I think it's shareholders that ought to decide and something which is worth so much and promises so much of the full value and then some of an asset probably ought to be directly studied in a more measured, in a more detailed way than it has.</p>
          <p>It's also not the case that we have inherited &#x20AC;5.7 billion and we want to do something with them. We do have the financial flexibility to accommodate this transaction and if it doesn't happen, we'll just have to go along with the life. The life we had until one week ago. So it is not this or something else in the same way that for PT, it is not this or something else. It is either this or nothing. And I think that's a clear decision that shareholders of PT have to decide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just follow up if you don't mind, I think you were asked the question earlier, but the quantum of synergies is exactly the same in aggregate if a deal was done at the Vivo level, is that something you would consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said in the presentation is that the share of synergies that should accrue on a purely fair value, mathematical equation is no higher than 31% in the best of circumstances. And what we're saying is that the number we're putting on the table is significantly higher than that 31% of value of those shares. And that's a value creation opportunity, because it is next to impossible to prove or to demonstrate that Vivo, on a stand-alone basis, can create through the current management, as much value as we are putting on the table today. That's the reality that a PT shareholder should be facing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Tim Boddy from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I've got two questions. Starting on Spain, it seems there's a separation now between GDP performance and revenue performance in Spain. It'd be helpful just to understand the extent to which you think that's a reflection of structural pressures as opposed to any macroeconomic issues?</p>
          <p>And secondly moving on to some Apple related questions. The iPad pricing that you announced in the UK looks somewhat keener than rivals and I noticed that CapEx in the UK is up nearly 30% year-on-year. Could you just talk through how you're thinking about the opportunity for mobile broadband in the UK and the CapEx implications? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, let me pick up the Apple question and then I'll hand over to Guillermo. Yeah, we announced our pricing this week I think. What we fear as the iPad is a device that we think is going to get a lot of Wi-Fi usage and effectively what we're doing is exploiting the agreements that we already have with the cloud and BT Openzone on Wi-Fi that we  structured in our iPhone launch. And we think that's a positive for customers and for us, if we can get more customers coming to us using the device then all the better. As far as network quality is concerned, you will have seen that our network spend in the UK went up in the first quarter. And as promised, data quality we're given has been improving since the middle of December. We still watch it very closely, but certainly we're a lot more comfortable now than I was in the middle of December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Guillermo, Tim. Regarding the revenues and GDP, so far in the case of Spain in our opinion, our revenues are much more linked to macroeconomic consumption rather than overall GDP. That has been the case so far, I don't know in the future. So that's why we are trying to track closely what's going on with some of the proxies like the traffic or the minutes of use of our customers in mobile and also the overall commercial activity in the whole business. So far we've seen mild recovery of traffic that should be confirming the future and that's why we are betting heavily on trying to get more customers, because we see that the worst is over and that we  should provide some recovery in the rest of the year and in the next quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to follow up on that. It seems that most forecasts suggest Spanish GDP should be roughly flat this year or slightly down. Is this just the case that your business is sort of lagging a quarter and this is now the bottom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it might be the case. Again we are trying to track better the macroeconomic consumption, because that's what in our opinion are explained better and what's going on in our revenue side. But that's why we are hoping and we are expecting that in the second half of this year, we might start to see some more strong recovery in the revenue side. Wireless, as you know, has been more elastic to -- in the correlation with consumption. So it has gone down deeper in the beginning of the cycle and it's recovering better in the last few months. So, that's -- and also we're seeing that in April and in the first two weeks of May where we are seeing that wireless is starting to behave a little bit better. But again, these are early warnings and we hope that we can confirm this in the next few quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...on the intense commercial activity that you're doing, just maybe going through the main initiatives and now that may translate in a positive impact on the revenues in the second half of the year? And secondly again on the Vivo offer, if we were to get to the AGM level, would Telef&#xF3;nica be able to exercise their voting rights given that you have 10% in PT? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding, Luigi's question about commercial activity in Spain. First of all what we are trying to -- and we turn around in fact we can see the -- as you look at the numbers compared to the first quarter last year is the growth of total accesses. We're now focusing on different businesses. The postpaid mobile businesses is the one that we are turning around more rapidly. Remember, in the first quarter last year, we had, I think, a negative number in post-paid, and now we have almost 200,000 positive net gain. Within that, particularly mobile broadband is the area, where we are growing at this faster rate, more than doubling the base of customers. Pay TV although it has a lot of seasonality and seasonality is very much linked to the football season, we are showing growth despite, as I mentioned in previous question, the fact that the market overall is not growing. And also in fixed broadband though we don't have the numbers, we had two years ago as a market, every quarter the market is growing better than before. And we have been defending very well our overall share. So overall we've seen that the market as a whole is becoming better, so the number of total customers add in different businesses is growing. It's positive and it's growing and it's completely different to the situation we have in the first quarter of last year where obviously commercial activity was lower and commercial expenses were lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Luigi, and on the leads to AGM, if it comes with -- we've always voted in the AGMs with our 10%. We do intend to vote in the next AGMs of PT to the extent that we continue being shareholders unless, of course, explicitly and decisively impeded or prohibited from doing so, which we are not aware is the case today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have time for one additional question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question today comes from Robin Bienenstock from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much. Two questions. I guess, my first question is that you have a principle of keeping your average debt maturities around six years and I've noticed that a lot of your debt recently has looked shorter-term. So, I'm wondering if I can tell me what the maturity is now and whether you'd be happy for it to drop below that six year average if it needed to do that later this year?</p>
          <p>And my second question was about your view on the case before the competition commission in Brazil about MTRs. You've talked a lot about MTRs in Europe, but your exposure through Vivo TO MTRs in Brazil is obviously quite a little bit higher, and I was just wondering if you have any views on that case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Robin, on the debt question, average maturity is down 6.3 at the end of March, in the comfortable zone. Depending on the issuance, we take advantage of different currencies and different terms. Sometimes it's a five-year that looks more attractive, sometimes it's the 10-year tenure. We try and mange those opposing maturities to keep the average on balance. A shortening or a lengthening to the extent that those are temporary is not a major problem for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question on MTRs in Brazil, the exposure year-on-year has been decreasing at the level of Vivo. And as of today it's effectively 4 percentage points lower than the previous year and it keeps going down. All the operators we are doing major efforts to foster on-net traffic and that's why you will see that on-net traffic is even growing more and the total traffic of Vivo.</p>
          <p>And having said that, and going especially specifically to the Anatel position. Starting this year, in 201, Anatel has the right to decide based on a cost basis, and the cost fee is being communicated by the operators and their own service of internal research of Anatel. This can be applied if the operators do not reach an agreement among them, and therefore, we've seen that till mid of this year where the effective revision of tariffs takes place, it would not be seen or not if they have reached an agreement between the different operators. And therefore, we see that most-likely scenario and it's still yet to be seen is also progressive reduction of MTRs on a  glide-path model &#x2013; pattern.  But still we will need to wait probably the mid of this year to see what is the position of Anatel. So right now starting 2010, Anatel has already the right to decide based on cost, but it can only apply that right if there is a disagreement among the different operators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was really more interested in knowing what your view was on the <mark type="inaudible" /> case before the Competition Commission, and then how that might influence what Anatel will do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have a clear view on that yet. I mean, I think that for the time being the most -- I think the most-likely scenario is that we will all agree and that we will reach an agreement between the different operators. So I guess that is still to be seen. I think that the next two months are going to be crucial. So probably for the next conference call, we will really know what is going to happen.</p>

Next conference call will be end of July as we publish our Q2 numbers, that I'm sure we'll show an improvement over this bottom of the year Q1 numbers. And then over the coming weeks, we will be either participating in events that you might attend or visiting you personally. Thanks a lot for your time and have a good evening.</p>
