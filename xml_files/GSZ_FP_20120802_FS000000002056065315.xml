          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to conference call on GDF SUEZ 2012 Half Year Results organized by GDF SUEZ along with G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GDF SUEZ, Jean-Francois Cirelli, Vice Chairman and President, and Isabelle Kocher, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>For your information, this conference is being recorded. Thank you for holding. The conference is chaired by Mr. G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GDF SUEZ. Mr. Mestrallet, I now hand over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our H1 conference call. I'm pleased to be talking with you this morning, as we have just released our H1 2012 results, one week earlier than last year. The key points that I'll comment on this morning along with Isabelle Kocher and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Cirelli are the following.</p>
          <p>Starting with our results during the first half, <mark type="inaudible" /> (1:16) once again that our business &#x2013; of our business model in a particularly challenging environment, most notably in Europe. The results allow us to confirm all our 2012 financial target for the full year and also something that remains a priority for us, our attractive dividend policy.</p>
          <p>H1 2012 has also been a major milestone in the history of GDF SUEZ with the full acquisition of International Power. The group is now the benchmark energy player in the fast-growing market. We see this step as a major and structural move for our company. It significantly changes our identity and turns us into a unique global player among the industry.</p>
          <p>We consider we have now the critical size and we give the priority to performance and profitability. Along with this successful transaction, we have pursued our industrial development focused on returns. Several significant contracts have been won. I will come back on that. We have also been active on the regulatory side in France and Belgium and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois will give you an update on that situation.</p>
          <p>Of course, everybody knows that the economic context is difficult and this is especially true in the European energy markets where there is no improvement foreseen in the near future. We anticipate a special difficult 2013 year. Therefore, our ambition is to focus on performance and flexibility. And I will say a few words on our roadmap.</p>
          <p>Compared to H1 2011, our net recurring income group share increased by 6% at a faster rate than EBITDA for which we posted plus 4.2% growth. This is in line with the decision of the group to focus on bottom line.</p>
          <p>This solid performance allows us to confirm our guidance for the full year of 2012, which is net recurring income group share between &#x20AC;3.7 billion and &#x20AC;4.2 billion assuming average weather conditions and stable regulation.</p>
          <p>CapEx stood at &#x20AC;4.7 billion at the end of H1 2012. For the full year, we are adjusting our expectation to &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion. This figure does not include of course the acquisition of the International Power minorities.</p>
          <p>For 2013 given the wider economic backdrops, we plan to adjust our CapEx program to the lower end of the range of the &#x20AC;9 billion, &#x20AC;11 billion range. Along with the successful implementation of our asset optimization program, we have already achieved more than &#x20AC;8 billion of asset disposals out of the initial program of &#x20AC;10 billion since the beginning of 2011, which makes 80% at the middle of the period. And this will enable us to further strengthen our balance sheet and comfort our dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Our A category rating has been recently confirmed by both Standard and Poor's and Moody's. This is a clear competitive advantage for us and this allowed us to achieve weaker conditions in our recent debt capital market transactions in May and July 2012. We raised &#x20AC;4.5 billion with an average cost of financing of the 1.68%, the lowest coupons ever paid by GDF SUEZ.</p>
          <p>Now, let me give you a few words on our dividend policy, which is a priority for GDF SUEZ. I'll confirm our commitment to an attractive and sustainable dividend policy. 2012 dividends will be achieved equal to &#x20AC;1.5 per share. Over 2012, 2015, the dividend paid by GDF SUEZ to its shareholders will be at least equal to or higher than the prior year.</p>
          <p>Our dividends are secured by the strong free cash flow generation of our business portfolio. As you may see for 2011, the free cash flow was 2.7 times higher than the dividend paid.</p>
          <p>As you know, we also have the share option for the upcoming 2012 interim dividend of &#x20AC;0.83 per share to be paid on October, 25. I want to make it very clear that this is a one-off option, designed to optimize the financing structure of the acquisition of the IPR minorities. Our dividend policy is and will remain a key pillar of our value proposal to the market.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at our main achievements over the first half with IP. Through an innovative two steps acquisition, we achieved an accretive transaction with IP for GDF SUEZ earnings. It reinforces the long term growth and value profile of the group. It also simplifies the group structure and reduces minority's interest. This strategic step leads to an immediate increase of the net recurring income generated from the fast growing areas from 23% to 30%.</p>
          <p>We have a medium term objective of allocating between 40% and 50% of our growth CapEx to the fast growing markets. On the financing side, the structure of the transaction was very, very balanced. Markets response to our share dividend option and our latest bond issuances demonstrate the market confidence in our long term strategy and in the outlook of GDF SUEZ.</p>
          <p>Over the first half, we have accelerated our developments in high growth markets. Accelerating our development in fast growing markets is indeed the first pillar of our strategy. This map, you can see is a clear testimony of our strong commitment to this goal. Let us briefly review some selected examples of this development. The map in the slide number seven for those who are online by telephone.</p>
          <p>We have been selected official bidder for our power plants in Kuwait and in Mongolia, a new and promising market in Asia. We are expanding in the Middle East through new commissioning in Saudi Arabia and Oman and commercial operation have started at the Al Dur plants in Bahrain.</p>
          <p>We also started commercial operations of Senoko in Singapore and of Paiton in Indonesia, and also creating a new trading platform which was opened in Singapore.</p>
          <p>We have pursued the strengthening of our global position in LNG with a floating LNG import terminal project in India, together with the objective to access liquefaction capacity in the U.S. through an agreement with the SEMPRA, the U.S. Group, in order to export shale gas after liquefaction from U.S. to Asia.</p>
          <p>We have also signed new contract with PTT in Thailand, where we will ship LNG for the first time in H2 2012. I'm also very happy to announce that we signed two new significant medium-term contracts for LNG delivery with KOGAS from Korea and GAIL from India.</p>
          <p>In the E&amp;P, supported by our strategic partnership with CIC, the sovereign Chinese firm, we sealed our first corporation with PetroChina in Qatar. We also announced this morning our large project in the U.K. Cygnus, for which we have the operatorship. This project is now reaching sanction and pending government approval, we'll start construction as scheduled.</p>
          <p>The Cygnus gas field is the largest discovery in the southern gas basin of the North Sea in the last 25 years. Plus gas from Cygnus will be produced in late 2015 with 14.2 million barrel oil equivalent, yearly production by 2016. The sale is expected to meet the demand for nearly 1.5 million homes at peak production accounting for around 5% of the UK's gas production in 2016. GDF SUEZ is the license operator, Centrica and Bayerngas are our partners.</p>
          <p>To sum up, GDF SUEZ is a unique global energy player which combines the skills to achieve these developments, strong resources, daring and winning spirit, power to convince, financial rigor and building &#x2013; capacity to build strong partnerships. Our unique ability to manage large projects is a clear competitive advantage to develop these markets.</p>
          <p>As we see on slide eight for some years we have been expanding our power generation activities into high growth regions, especially in Latin America, Middle East and Asia-Pacific. These markets are where demand for electrical power will increase most. For example, in the Asia-Pacific region excluding India, which is Southeast of Asia, this region is expected to need around 240 gigawatt of new capacity by 2020. And we have a significant number of projects in this region, nearly 10 gigawatt under construction, over 3 gigawatt in the advance development stage and another 17 gigawatt in the early development stage.</p>
          <p>For our gas and services businesses, there are also several large projects which will be commissioned over the coming years. For example, our E&amp;P production will grow with the contribution from three new fields, Touat in Algeria, Cygnus in the U.K. and Gudrun in Norway as our strategy is geared towards pursuing gross where we'll only do it when we meet our strict financial criteria, in particular, in terms of expectations in achieving attractive returns.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move to LNG, which is also a key part of our international growth strategy. Compared to its peers, GDF SUEZ has a unique position in LNG with a diversified supply portfolio, including global liquefaction capacities. I will take this opportunity to give you a brief overview of the entire LNG value chain within our group.</p>
          <p>You already know that LNG demand is strong, especially in Asia, and is expected to double by 2025, thanks to economic growth, price attractiveness, concerns on the environment, accept clean energy, and needs to diversify supply sources.</p>
          <p>We are the largest LNG importer in the Atlantic Basin and third largest LNG importer globally. Around 30% of our long-term gas supply is LNG. We have the ambition to increase our LNG supply portfolio from the current 16 million ton to 20 million ton per annum by 2020 through projects that offers attractive returns. Last project in the U.S., in Cameroon and in Australia are supporting this growth strategy.</p>
          <p>Our optimized fleet of 17 LNG carriers with various chartering duration also provides high flexibility. We are able to ship LNG where it is needed and to capture value from premium markets. Over H1 2012, we have doubled the number of cargos shipped to Asia.</p>
          <p>We have a global presence in re-gas &#x2013; re-gasification for more than 31 million ton per annum capacity around the world. LNG is a highly dynamic business in terms of commercial innovations. With new applications that open new customer's bases such as in transportation, trucks versus train, ships fueled with LNG, also with new technology that drive engineering needs such as floating LNG, and small scale LNG.</p>
          <p>And with more than 60 top LNG experts, Tractebel Engineering is currently working on 24 LNG projects including 16 projects outside of Europe. On a medium-term basis, we have concluded a significant range of LNG supply arrangements. 138 cargos will be delivered to major Asian players between 2010 and 2016, and this figure do not take into account the new deals signed with KOGAS and GAIL.</p>
          <p>By 2020, our target is to double the sales to third parties mainly in emerging markets. The contribution of the entire LNG value chain to GDF SUEZ performance is significant adding the contribution coming from our Energy International, to Energy Europe, to Global Gas &amp; LNG and Infrastructure business lines.</p>
          <p>Our LNG activities posted &#x20AC;800 million EBITDA for 2011. 60% of the total came from the supply and sales, 40% came from both International and European Infrastructures.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to say a few words about our roadmap, in the current European context, where the intensity and duration of the economic crisis are too difficult to evaluate, I would like to remind you that the group has set four management priorities. First, optimize the asset base, focus on bottom line, which led us to set guidance at the net recurring income level, increase financial flexibility and also anticipate trends in new markets and favor commercial innovation.</p>
          <p>Regarding our asset base optimization, we are on track to meet our 2012 annual Efficio 2 target of &#x20AC;600 million after achieving &#x20AC;300 million in H1. Cost reduction and performance improvement are our priorities for the upcoming period.</p>
          <p>Regarding our financial flexibility, we already achieved &#x20AC;8 billion on our portfolio optimization program over the past 18 months, which represents 80% of the initial program of &#x20AC;10 billion. And now, we expect to complete our enhanced &#x20AC;13 billion program by the end of next year. We will also maintain a strict selection for our organic investments and focus on profitable growth.</p>
          <p>Given the current environment, we anticipate that our growth CapEx will be down from &#x20AC;10 billion, &#x20AC;11 billion this year to the lower end of &#x20AC;9 billion, &#x20AC;11 billion next year.</p>
          <p>Regarding our focus on net recurring income, first it is now the key aggregate of our guidance and as incentive, top managers will save around 50% of their quantitative variable compensation based on this parameter.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Jean-Francois Cirelli, who will give you some update on our European operations. Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, G&#xE9;rard and good morning. Today, I will give you a quick overview of the price environment for power generation in Europe, then I'll make a focus on the latest developments of gas tariffs in France and nuclear in Belgium, and to conclude, I'll come back on our gas supply business which has always remained profitable and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>Regarding the market environment in Europe, obviously the recent developments in the power market are challenging, in particular on the copper plate in Central Western Europe. First, power demand remains low. Second, power prices are continuously decreasing since mid-2011. Next year forward are below &#x20AC;50 megawatt hour first time since 2007. And third, in a sense, coal is displacing gas in Europe given the current coal prices, thus reducing the profitability of our CCGTs. In the months to come, our activities will be affected by first the continuation of this deterioration of the market conditions, and second, the end of free CO2 allocations scheduled, as you know, for next year. The impact for GDF SUEZ will be roughly 45 million tons of CO2.</p>
          <p>So, therefore, in this challenging environment and since the creation of the Energy Europe business line, our top priority to offset this trend is to optimize our power fleet &#x2013; power asset fleet. To reach this goal, first we continuously improve our operational performance. The ambition is to maintain the high level of availability of our network fleet and to improve the efficiency and flexibility of our brands to be better adapted to the market evolutions.</p>
          <p>Second, we are reviewing all our asset fleet to close or mothball plants no longer profitable. Last year, 2.9 gigawatt have been decommissioned or mothballed, the bulk of it coming from Teesside in the U.K. For this year and next year, for 2012 and 2013, we already announced the closure of 1.2 gigawatt in Belgium and 0.4 gigawatt in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Third, we have decided to currently stop all Central Western Europe thermal projects.</p>
          <p>Four, we continue to have a very highly selective development strategy for investment based on value creation.</p>
          <p>And finally, for Energy Europe businesses line, we have, as you know, &#x20AC;200 million targeted synergies, which have been announced in February, half of them will be posted this year and the rest next year.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn rapidly to the French gas tariffs. As you know, the last weeks have been very active. First, with the recent decision of the Conseil d'Etat following the appeal that we filed in October last year, we got a very positive signal which confirms that tariffs should cover costs. This is in line with our expectations and confirms that the legal principle of pass-through of cost has to be respected.</p>
          <p>Consequently, we will booked in H2 2012 a positive this year &#x2013; a positive impact at EBITDA level of around &#x20AC;290 million before implementation costs and &#x20AC;190 million at net income level.</p>
          <p>We will have a progressive cash inflow, mainly next year in 2013 due to the progressive billing we will put in place. Clearly, the invoices will be spread over two years started at the end of 2012 and the last invoices will be sent mid-2014.</p>
          <p>Second, the July tariff increase. As you know, according to the current formula, tariff changes as of July 1 should have been plus 7.3% as supply costs rose mainly to the &#x2013; an increase &#x2013; due to the increase of oil prices over the period of calculation and a weakening of the euro versus U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>These tariff changes was also necessary to cover non-supply costs and according to the CRE, our regulator. CRE, our regulator, declared that our request was justified. French government decided to <mark type="ph" /> capitalize (25:45) changes at plus 2% as of July 20.</p>
          <p>CRE and the Conseil Sup&#xE9;rieur de l'Energie had both expressed an unfavorable opinion of the 2% tariff increase decided by the government, setting therefore a favorable basis for any upcoming case for that GDF SUEZ or its competitors could file against this decision with the Conseil d'Etat.</p>
          <p>We in GDF SUEZ are currently reviewing the situation and we will take our final decision in the coming weeks. For Q3 this year, the estimated shortfall, differences between 7.3% and 2% for GDF SUEZ; at EBITDA level is close to &#x20AC;30 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are also currently expecting from the government to work in two new directions. First, extending the current social tariff scheme. This is an avenue that we support; indeed it will also facilitate future price adjustment. And second avenue, producing progressive tariff for gas and electricity, but to be fair with you, we have no clear proposal so far. This will be clearly a discussion that we will have with the government and other sector in Q3 and Q4 this year.</p>
          <p>Now, a brief update on nuclear situation in Belgium. First, the robustness of the Belgian nuclear facilities has been confirmed by the Belgian and European nuclear safety authorities. They had no objection for the pursuit of the seven units in operation given the safety and security standards applied in our plans.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, as you know, some investments are needed and an action plan represented additional CapEx of around &#x20AC;200 million for the seven nuclear units had been validated. Naturally, it will be less if Doel 1 and 2 are closed.</p>
          <p>Second, regarding the lifetime extension of the nuclear power plants, the Belgian government announced the decision to extend for 10 years as of 2015, the Tihange 1 unit and to close Doel 1 and 2.</p>
          <p>First, this decision does not respect the previous agreement signed in 2009 with Van Rompuy government. Second, the two units to be closed represent a contribution of around &#x20AC;100 million per year before nuclear contribution and tax.</p>
          <p>Third, for Tihange 1, before taking our decision to extend or not the unit, we need a clear and stable legal framework and also all the economics, of course, an investment in lifetime extension will have to meet our investment criteria. Clarifications from the government are expected after the recess as the new nuclear law is in preparation.</p>
          <p>We will take our final position based on this law, so in September or October. If this investment is finally decided for the extension of Tihange 1, GDF SUEZ's share will amount to roughly &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, a word on the gas supply business. As you know, the conditions are unfavorable on the gas market for now some years. But I want to restate that this business has been continuously positive, will remain so this year and we are very confident that it will be the case beyond 2012. This makes, in my view, a clear difference with other players in the market.</p>
          <p>We are able to keep this business profitable because of the combinations of three elements. First, our approach is to negotiate much more frequently with our suppliers to introduce the appropriate changes in the contracts, so that they are in line with the market evolutions. We've managed to shorten the review cycles to less than two years to ensure the contracts remain profitable for us.</p>
          <p>Second, we did not believe that the structural solution can be implemented as a one-off or is even desirable. We are convinced that a permanent adaptation of the long-term supply portfolio is a much more efficient solution. We prefer a dynamic approach.</p>
          <p>Third, we have a very flexible gas portfolio, both on the supply and the sale side. Notably, G&#xE9;rard mentioned it, we had &#x2013; we have a strong advantage with our LNG portfolio and we extract all the value from the flexibility brought by these assets of stacking or not volumes and creating diversions.</p>
          <p>So far our strategy of negotiation has also been to favor a much more significant improvement of the contracts for the upcoming deliveries instead of seeking only compensation for the past.</p>
          <p>And so far, we have several commercial negotiations as they have allowed us to reach successful agreements. But arbitration is still and still would remain an option. We have reached agreements with all our major long-term suppliers in 2010 and 2011 and even two times over this period for some of them, notably Gazprom, Sonatrach and Gas Terra.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we will renegotiate 55% of our long-term volumes and next year, although the next 15, 18 months we will start again with discussion with Statoil, Gazprom, ENI and Sonatrach. With Gas Terra which represents around 60 terawatt hour per year, we expect to reach an agreement in very short-term.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly comment the circle in the middle of the center of this slide because it's not very self explanatory. In 2010, according to the contracts, we could have renegotiated 65% of the long-term volumes and that's what that we have done. Again in 2011, 65% of our long-term contracts was opened for revision, price revision, and again we did it then. And this year, 55% of the volumes are again opened for price revision and we are currently renegotiating this 55%.</p>
          <p>All this negotiation currently underway, all levels will be used and we have four parameters to negotiate &#x2013; to renegotiate contracts.</p>
          <p>The first one is to increase the share of gas market products indexation. The second is to decrease the level of oil index prices. The third is to increase flexibility with a reduction in volumes. And the fourth is increase ability to develop LNG volumes.</p>
          <p>So we are using all these levels. And naturally, it will depend on the contracts, the constant objective being to ensure that profitability of the contracts in the current market conditions are really met.</p>
          <p>Therefore, I confirm that for the full year 2012, gas supply EBITDA contribution will again be positive in the upper end of the &#x20AC;100 million, &#x20AC;200 million range that we indicated in February. Thank you for your attention and now I hand over to Isabelle.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Francois. Before presenting our financials into more details, I would like to start by highlighting that in a particularly challenging environment, the group has recorded solid half year results. The net recurring income is up year-on-year by 6%. Cash flow generation increased significantly as well.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, our credit ratings have been confirmed by both agencies in the A rating category following the full acquisition of IP. But, first of all, I will give you another view of our H1 results.</p>
          <p>You see on slide 24 that broadly speaking GDF SUEZ delivered an improvement in all key financial metrics in H1 2012.</p>
          <p>It is a case, as I said, at net recurring income level group share, plus 6% and also at free cash flow level plus 5.4%. It is also true at EPS level, which is up by 6.2% with a limited effect of scrip dividend at end of June ends on the contrary a positive effect of the share buyback program.</p>
          <p>Looking at other metrics, EBITDA reached &#x20AC;9.2 billion, up 4.2% and 3.7% on an organic basis. Even operating income increased by 4% and by more than 5% on an organic basis. Net income group share was last year really boosted by significant capital gains, roughly &#x20AC;600 million and it explains the lower results in H1 2012.</p>
          <p>Let me now &#x2013; on slide 25, comment more in details the net recurring income since we are now focused on this aggregate. Now, I remind you that this non-GAAP measure only excludes from net income exceptional items such as impairments, restructuring costs, disposals, mark-to-market effects and nuclear contribution is not included so far since we contest this contribution.</p>
          <p>As I said, we reached plus 6% increase at net recurring income group share level. First of all, depreciation and amortization have roughly followed the growth of EBITDA. On the financial results, the slight increase in costs reflect the increase in gross debt in preparation of the IPR full acquisition. This is therefore a volume effect. Income tax expenses are much lower. This is mainly due to the U.K. following higher tax in E&amp;P last year and a new legislation regarding the so called <mark type="ph" /> foreign branch (37:37) exemption.</p>
          <p>Contribution of associates decreased following the booking of Belgium inter-municipality in available social securities in H1 2011. And minority interests grew following the strategic partnerships signed in 2011 with CIC on E&amp;P and with CDC and CNP on GRTGaz and also reflecting the IPR growth on scope effect.</p>
          <p>Of course, the effect of the IP minorities' buyout is still to come over the second semester. For yearend, as mentioned before by G&#xE9;rard, we confirm our commitments to be between &#x20AC;3.7 billion and &#x20AC;4.2 billion in net recurring income group share.</p>
          <p>I will now present to you the breakdown of growth from operations by business line.</p>
          <p>On slide 26, you see that the EBITDA, as I said, increased by 4.2%. These figures take into account the positive climate and gas tariff effects compared to last year; on climate in France, positive impact of &#x20AC;290 million for Energy Europe and Infrastructures with a return to average weather conditions and in fact, even a slightly cold climate.</p>
          <p>The negative impact of the &#x20AC;73 million gas tariff shortfall in H1 2011 didn't repeat itself in H1 2012. These figures also include strong actions on cost and performance with an Efficio effect of &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>I'll describe rapidly the operational performance by business line. Energy International first, slide 27, EBITDA grew by 5% with scope and foreign exchange effect. Performance is good in LatAm, especially in Brazil; good in Asia; it is stable in the Middle-East. And favorable market conditions affect mature markets, Europe with especially hard situation for CCGT in the U.K. like in fact elsewhere in Europe, weak markets in Australia and to a lesser extent, in North America.</p>
          <p>We continue to deliver synergies. This is included in the Efficio program. Two concrete examples maybe, synergies we achieved between electric cogeneration plants by standardizing stock spare parts processes and reducing outages; also reduction in overhead of corporate functions through streamlining of step functions. Adjusted COI grew by 15% helped by the end of the one-off 2011 negative effect on TPA and by the strong growth of associates. For full year, we expect similar trends as H1.</p>
          <p>Two, Energy Europe, slide 28, I remind you that we indicated a stable EBITDA for full year 2012 compared to last year with &#x2013; and despite the positive climate and gas tariff effect. And we explained that we expected a decrease on gas and electricity margins.</p>
          <p>At this stage, it is better in terms of trends since the EBITDA increased by more than &#x20AC;200 million against H1. This is mainly due to the fact that we preserved well our gas margin. We see even a slight increase on these gas margins. Electricity margin decreased by roughly &#x20AC;150 million as expected and this is mainly due to two elements, lower load factors for facilities and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois described rapidly the prices context and increase of injection prices in Belgium.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we maintain our forecast of general stability compared to 2011 and once again, the H1 EBITDA results on this business line includes gain from our Efficio performance. For example, streamlining on &#x2013; of sales and marketing processes in our B2B markets by applying very lean management techniques and reorganization of our Italian operations.</p>
          <p>Global Gas &amp; LNG, I remind you that we indicated for full year 2012 for plus &#x20AC;300 million growth at the EBITDA level. During the first semester, EBITDA contribution grew by &#x20AC;170 million due to oil price increases, but also to higher production level despite the disposal of Elgin-Franklin last year. This is mainly due in fact to the Gj&#xF8;a field and the LNG side sales increased notably in Asia. In H2, we expect the production decrease compared to H1, especially in Gj&#xF8;a.</p>
          <p>Infrastructures performance on slide 30, increased by &#x20AC;50 million, is flat after integration of the scope effect of gas storage facilities in Germany. Storage performance in France is affected by lower sales of capacities and distribution benefited from a positive weather impact, but not yet from the new tariff in place since July 1. For full year, we confirm a slight increase in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Energy Services, slide 31, EBITDA is flat compared to last year. If we take one-off positive impact of &#x20AC;17 million in 2011, Energy Services demonstrates its resistance to difficult economic conditions.</p>
          <p>The achievement of this result includes a net EBITDA contribution from our Efficio program of &#x20AC;45 million. Amongst the dozens of individual actions that are being currently taken, we can cite the restructuring of our <mark type="ph" /> preferred (43:52) U.K. and Netherlands operations.</p>
          <p>I won't come back on environment since Jean Louis Chaussade and Jean-Marc Boursier disclosed yesterday the details of their financial results. EBITDA decreased, but we expect the full year EBITDA level, which is all in all stable versus last year. But globally, we confirm the indication we gave of an EBITDA around &#x20AC;17 billion in 2012 taking into account &#x20AC;700 million contribution from projects and &#x20AC;600 million of Efficio impact. This operational growth has allowed us to generate strong free cash flow.</p>
          <p>On slide 33, you see the free cash flow generation, &#x20AC;4.7 billion, as I mentioned. Secondly, you see the growth CapEx amounting to &#x20AC;3.3 billion. For total CapEx, including growth and maintenance CapEx, we will be between &#x20AC;10 billion and &#x20AC;11 billion in 2012.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, our portfolio optimization program is on track, as we will be seeing in the next slide and this initiative will help us to reach our net debt on EBITDA ratio of around 2.5 times by yearend. At this stage, H1 net debt on EBITDA ratio remains at a level of 2.7 times impacted by the recent full acquisition of IP and not yet by the remedies of this operation.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the complete integration of IP allowed the group to simplify its structure resulting in a significant decrease in minority interest on the balance sheet by one-third compared to full year 2011.</p>
          <p>I propose now to have a closer look at our portfolio optimization program on slide 34. So, this program is well on track and in line with our group strategy. First, let me remind you that we announced the &#x20AC;10 billion portfolio optimization program in 2011 when we acquired 70% of IP.</p>
          <p>We announced, a few months ago, an additional &#x20AC;3 billion disposal program to finance the IP minorities' buyout; that is to say &#x20AC;13 billion as a whole. So, as you know, we achieved last year a &#x20AC;6.6 billion and so far this year, we have locked in an additional &#x20AC;1.5 billion, of which Choctaw in the U.S., 40% of Al Hidd Power in Bahrain and Eurawasser in Germany. We plan to close the remaining &#x20AC;5 billion by the end of 2013. We are engaged in a concrete process for the relevant assets and we are confident in our ability to achieve the target.</p>
          <p>The impact of 2012 P&amp;L resulting from the portfolio optimization operation closed in 2011 and in H1 2012, should reach around &#x20AC;550 million at the EBITDA level and around &#x20AC;250 million at the net recurring income group share level. This is in line with what we've indicated early in 2012.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for attention. I'll now hand over to G&#xE9;rard Mestrallet.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Isabelle. As a conclusion, I want to underline that the first half of 2012 represents a major milestone in the group's history. Our quick move is to finalize the full integration of International Power, accelerates our shift towards the high growth areas. This is a changing index of our group, its identity and the way you have to look at it as a unique value proposal in the industry.</p>
          <p>Our business model is unique, far reaching and positions us ideally to take advantage of profitable growth where it is and weather challenging conditions when they happen. For several years, we have been able to build pioneering positions in selected markets and with our ambitious development target, we'll stay ahead of the pack. Thanks also to our strict financial discipline, our solid balance sheet, and also our permanent cost and performance actions.</p>
          <p>So, we thank you for your attention today. And before answering your operations, a few words on our next events. We'll be on roadshows after the summer break in September. We will hold our Q3 conference call on October 31. And I am very happy to announce our next Investor Day in Q4 2012.</p>
          <p>And now we are ready with Isabelle and Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois to answer your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question for today comes from Vincent de Blic from JPMorgan. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have three questions, please. The first one is on slide five and your comment about free cash flow &#x2013; excuse me, investments maybe down. I was thinking this free cash flow number, you used maintenance CapEx, I was wondering whether you could give us CapEx number which is more representative of what you have to spend over the mid- to long-term to keep with the group in its current five or to keep earnings cover flat more or less, which is probably more than just &#x20AC;2.5 billion of maintenance? That would be the first question.</p>
          <p>The second thing is on cost cutting. If I remember the 2012 EBITDA bridge correctly, I think the &#x20AC;600 million from Efficio is offset by cost inflation or other effects. Some of your peers, I'm seeing even in particular are targeting significant reduction in nominal OpEx &#x2013; nominal controllable costs, I think &#x20AC;1.5 billion for them. Do you think you could do more, is it something you are working on? Anything you can give us on this?</p>
          <p>And the final point was just on disposals and the number on page 29, I think you say, &#x20AC;550 million EBITDA impact for 2011 disposals and H1 2012, I think you are saying &#x20AC;500 million in February for 2011 and full year 2012. If you can just clarify that nothing has changed or whether there is slight increase in dilution? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we shall answer your questions. Perhaps, Isabelle will answer to the third one. On the first one, it's true that our free cash flow is computed after maintenance CapEx. So, this &#x2013; the difference between the cash flow and the maintenance CapEx is a good measure of what is available to distribute the dividend and to invest in growth CapEx.</p>
          <p>We are very confident in our ability to continue our &#x2013; to maintain strictly our dividend policy and our CapEx program. You will have noted that in the &#x2013; for 2013, I have indicated that within the range &#x20AC;9 million, &#x20AC;11 billion that we had indicated six months ago, due to the economic environment will be in the lower end of this range for the total CapEx, growth plus maintenance. And we have also clearly always indicated that the priority is given to the dividend policy and in case where there will be additional constraints, that'd be not the case today, the priority will be given to the dividend policy and the adjustment will be done under CapEx.</p>
          <p>About the cost cutting program, and Efficio, this program of &#x20AC;600 million, it's for the year 2012. It's additional measures on this year, coming results of all what we have done during the previous years, of course, and we are working for the year 2013 and 2014 of course, on the extension of this program, intensification of the program and we will speak about that later on in the year. Isabelle, on the disposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On disposal effects, no major changes in fact. So, I confirm that the impact of the deal closed in 2011 and in H1 2012 will be roughly &#x20AC;500 million and &#x20AC;50 million and of course, the remaining part of the disposal to be made before yearend 2012 will be very limited on P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Can I just follow-up on the first question on the CapEx. When you look at growth CapEx, I mean, can you give us a feel of how much is really discretionary and how much is basically needed to keep the group's earnings well over the midterm if that makes any sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I understand well the question just to confirm that the level of maintenance CapEx is &#x20AC;3.5 billion, the rest of the range between &#x20AC;9 billion and &#x20AC;11 billion is gross CapEx or financial CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course, we have the flexibility to adapt the gross CapEx on the new investment we decide, as long as we decide them for the future. Of course for the year 2012 and even for the year 2013, we are building some power plants which &#x2013; whose construction is extended on several years. And on our hydro projects, on our coal-fired projects, on our investments in E&amp;P, some of them are already launched. And, of course, for the two years, the present year or the next year, some of the investments are already been decided in the past and we take the portion of the investment in our development to make for the future, but there is obviously, much more flexibility on the future CapEx, the gross CapEx and on the maintenance CapEx, especially on the safety investments that we maintain at the required appropriate level.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Julie Arav from Barclays. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have three questions if I may. The first one, can we have an update on general project progress, the cost over runs and an idea of the return. Can we have also an update on your hedging in your E&amp;P business in terms of volumes and prices for the years ahead?</p>
          <p>And my last question concerns France, the government has announced that they plan to review the full pricing mechanism for gas tariff. What would you expect? Do you expect that it review the parameters of the formula to integrate more spot gas indexation? Or, do you see risk that the government gives out the pricing formula mechanism and comes back to an arbitrary increase as it was the case before 2010? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And perhaps we will split the answer in three answers. I propose that Phil Cox, Chief Executive of IP which is &#x2013; who is with us, answer to Gj&#xF8;a first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well, we continue to make good progress on Gj&#xF8;a. As you will be aware, there were some further disruptions on site during 2012. But in the first half, the project is under now full construction. We expect commercial operation to commence probably in Q1 2013. And the CapEx guidance is very broadly in line with previous guidance of R$15.4 billion, and we continue obviously with a project of such scale on a whole wide range of options to create additional value, with additional assured energy, with additional long-term tax incentives. And frankly, there is a long list of further initiatives.</p>
          <p>So, to the last part of your question, what's in return, we don't comment specifically on a project-by-project basis. But we remain confident that Gj&#xF8;a will be a very enhancing project for the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Phil. On E&amp;P and price volume effect, Isabelle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll repeat that on the first semester we got significant price effect due, of course, the increase on oil prices. We saw also a significant volume effect and I mentioned that few minutes ago. It is due to the very good performance of Gj&#xF8;a platform. And you remember maybe that last year at the same period &#x2013; for the same period we had technical issues on Gj&#xF8;a. So the comparison is very favorable for the first semester.</p>
          <p>On the second one, we expect a decrease on production and we expect stable prices over H2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the third question on the gas tariffs mechanism in France, Jean-Francois, what are our hopes, our dreams?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dreams and hopes, I don't know, but we know today is that first, we have no clear views of &#x2013; as of now what could be the changes that has been announced by the government and we will do more in September, October.</p>
          <p>Second, we said that the legal principle, that tariff should cover cost will not be changed and that is basis of the tariff and that is very important for us.</p>
          <p>Third, certainly, some adaptation of the price formula may be injected in the current scheme, in particular to take into account the latest renegotiations of contract that we will have this year.</p>
          <p>And four, I will say that the government is not for the time being totally focused on the question of the progressive tariffs that I mentioned, which certainly will be for the end users, end consumers and certainly a lot of technical difficulties for that so we will see.</p>
          <p>And final word that we do not see or foresee coming back to arbitrary mechanism. So the formula will be also maintained. So, I think for us, some uncertainties for us, but two basic principle which are important, first principle that cost &#x2013; that we should cover cost and second that we will keep a price formula.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Francois, it's very important to remind that the fact that tariff will reflect costs. It's not a dream. It is an obligation, an absolute obligation. Other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Michel Debs from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and I have two questions please. The first one is still on E&amp;P. What is your sensitivity to Brent prices because on the one hand you may lose some money on the clean spark spreads and on the other hand you are making more money on the E&amp;P. So, if we say that Brent prices go up $10 per barrel, what happens to your EBITDA and net income?</p>
          <p>Second question on disposals, you have indicated you have done some disposal in H1 and more are to come. I think the number is &#x20AC;4.9 billion by yearend 2013. Do you have a rough estimate on the EBITDA net income impact of those further disposals? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer briefly on the second one, and I will let Isabelle on the first one. No, we have been very precise on the impact of what is already booked in terms of impact on EBITDA and net recurring income group share. But for the coming asset sales, we will not make at this stage any &#x2013; give any indication. The indication we give very firmly is that we've been able to deliver very efficient manner at good prices, the &#x20AC;8.1 billion of asset sales, which represents 80% of the first, the initial &#x20AC;10 billion program. 80% have been delivered in 1.5 year. We are just in the middle of the period. And then &#x2013; so the &#x2013; we have now extended the program to &#x20AC;13 billion and the remaining part to be done is &#x20AC;5 billion and we are very confident in our capacity to deliver that before next yearend, but in the impact we will not disclose today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the question on E&amp;P, in fact for 2012 we are long haul since in fact we are completely covered for gas sales and not for E&amp;P production. And on the mid-term, if you look at the, I would say, the structural exposure of the group, we are short haul of course, since gas supply in LNG are short and we are partially netted by long E&amp;P activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good day. Given your focus on internationalization of the business and sort of weak earnings domestically, have you given a thought to reducing your holdings in the infrastructure business, i.e. selling down some of your gas transit businesses in the last third gas directive and the aim of separating upstream from transit businesses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question is about the internationalization of our growth that's factored and priority that we have put in place and presented. No, we have no project to reduce our infrastructure exposure in France and in the gas transit, there are limitations &#x2013; legal limitations in France, but the regulatory scheme in France is satisfactory and working well for the infrastructures much more than the gas tariff for the individuals. Now, we have also some activities on the international level. And at this stage, as you know, we have a tradition of cooperation and partnership behavior and we do not exclude to associate partners in our &#x2013; some of our international activities in infrastructure such as storage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it's probably a leading question but if Total were to look to sell their asset in South West France, Total Infrastructures Gaz France, do you think you would be allowed to bid for that or more infrastructure ownership in France is not of interest to you?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning to everybody. Just two questions, firstly in respect of the second half impact from the collection of last year's tariff short fall, is that something that was already included in your &#x20AC;17 billion EBITDA indication for 2012 and indeed your flat Energy Europe EBITDA indication for 2012 or should we be thinking about that as being additional?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, in respect of the CapEx therefore for this year and, indeed more importantly, I think going forward 2013 and beyond, I certainly would have positioned you at the bottom end of the range as you've indicated. But I just wondered where the delta has been in your CapEx plans relative to what you might have previously thought and you could do, just &#x2013; which division is it in place? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll answer to the first question and I confirm that the short fall on collection in France within certain environment is fully included in the indication we gave of &#x20AC;17 billion for the full year.</p>

          <p>I think that we don't exactly understood your question, I mean, if you are mentioning the &#x20AC;290 million of short fall in Gas de France, naturally they will be added, it's new revenue. But as I was telling you, there is still some increase to be passed before the end of the year. We got 2% in July, but we should have got 7.3% and if we don't recover this difference between &#x2013; before the end of the year there will be &#x20AC;30 million for Q3 and naturally more for Q4 given the fact that it is the winter time. So all together the plus &#x20AC;290 million and if we have difficulties, so we have to wait to see what kind of addition we could add to the current estimates we have for 2012.</p>

          <p>Okay, Mr. Young, I hope that we have clearly answered to your questions, but the communication at the moment of your, well the question was not very clear for us and perhaps to give one final indication on your first question, I will say that clearly the &#x20AC;290 million tariff we could, that we will have is not in the &#x20AC;17 billion guidance that we gave because this guidance is excluding the change in the regulation.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, correctly understood was about the level of CapEx in 2013 and 2014 and the following years. And my comment will be very simple, we had announced that the &#x2013; for the &#x2013; starting from the beginning of 2013, the range of our CapEx would be &#x20AC;9 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion. As you know, we have been closer to &#x20AC;12 billion last year, this year between &#x20AC;10 billion and &#x20AC;11 billion. And for 2013 and 2014, we will be closer to the bottom part of the range, closer to &#x20AC;9 billion and we'll remain at this level as far as the economic environment will remain difficult. As you know, we have for around &#x20AC;20 billion of projects every year and therefore we select the best projects, all of course meeting our investment criteria and we adapt the level of the envelopes, of the global envelope to the what is needed to maintain our financial structure, to keep our A rating that we have been able to keep even after the full acquisition of IP and also to maintain the satisfactory financing of the whole dividend and CapEx program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of way you have made, shall we say, downward adjustments in your CapEx plans, is that mainly coming in the international sphere or are your comments around Europe indicative of the fact that you are effectively cutting European CapEx to maintenance levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. This is for the whole; the envelope is for the whole CapEx of GDF SUEZ including maintenance CapEx and growth CapEx. And, of course, the relative portion of CapEx dedicated to fast growing countries will increase. Today, the photography of the percentage is around 30%, 30% of our CapEx have been in the rapidly growing countries. And after the IP transaction, this percentage will be increased to a range 40%, 50%, but all that is within the total envelope after the &#x20AC;9 billion, &#x20AC;11 billion and for 2013, 2014, closer to &#x20AC;9 billion than to &#x20AC;11 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I guess what I'm asking, if you would be in say in the range of &#x20AC;10 billion to &#x20AC;11 billion with CapEx and you're now going to &#x20AC;9 billion, where has this $1 billion plus difference come on a divisional level, is it in Europe or is it in the International Power activity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I've got two questions. The first one is regarding your credit rating target, A category. I wonder how you're looking at this world around you. We've seen a number of your peers have no longer got A category ratings. Do you think your A category target is an absolute one, or do you care about where your competitors are in the bond market, most of them now having, well, dropped to BBB category?</p>
          <p>And in that context, how keen are you on pushing through your disposal program or would you ultimately say, if you don't achieve the expected valuations for those disposals, you would be prepared to maybe temporarily reneg on your single A category target?</p>
          <p>And the second question is another one on your earnings guidance. Thanks for clarifying what's included in the &#x20AC;17 billion, but as I understand it, this is also post the additional disposal impact now that you've sold more assets. Just wonder whether you can confirm that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Isabelle will answer to the second one. On the first one, we have taken this commitment at the level of the board and it's a commitment <mark type="ph" /> to maybe the (1:19:00) market to maintain the A rating. And, so far, we don't intend to change even if some of our competitors have been downgraded. That's their problem. We have set this objective and it has been firmly repeated by the top management and the board and we have been successfully maintaining this rating even after the two steps of the acquisitions of IP, thanks to the credibility of our optimization &#x2013; assets optimization program. We've been able so far since the merger to sell roughly &#x20AC;25 billion &#x2013; not far from &#x20AC;25 billion since the merger, always at good conditions. And we think that we will be able to continue to do so, and to get good prices from the assets we sell. That's a condition of course that we think we will get it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x20AC;17 billion for the indicated EBITDA level for full year, first of all, I repeat that, this indication, as we always do, is &#x2013; at climate and normal &#x2013; I would say normal climate and regulation which is, in fact, the case at the end of H1. So, it is a result, is a positive effect of the decision made by the state council to recoup tariffs from last year and it doesn't take into account the &#x20AC;30 million <mark type="ph" /> by (1:21:20) shortfall mentioned by Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I confirm also that this &#x20AC;17 billion level includes, of course, the effects of the disposals which will be made by year-end. So, that is to say, not only the disposal already made, but also the disposal to be made by year-end.</p>

          <p>And we take our next question now from Benjamin Leyre from Exane. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good morning. Two questions, please. First one on Belgium, do you anticipate the possibility to implement any form of capacity mechanism for your &#x2013; that could support the profitability of your Belgian gas plants, for the existing gas plants? And the second point, what is your latest view now on the timing of the retightening of the global LNG marketplace? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the first question, the Belgian government has announced that for the new CCGTs to be built in Belgium, certainly some capacity payment will be needed as there are no investors today willing to invest in Belgium. So &#x2013; but what kind of form this capacity payment could take, we have no clue about it.</p>
          <p>Second, will it be only reserved to new entrants or new CCGTs? Also no clue. So, I think, we are clearly &#x2013; it's not very &#x2013; totally unclear to say what will happen. So, normally, the Belgian government intends also to say something in the law to come on this issue, which also has to respect the EU laws and competition laws in that range, so that would be also a nice exercise. So we will have better view in the fall. But basically, naturally, we and other utilities will favor capacity mechanism in Europe to support our CCGTs and to &#x2013; as a backup of renewables, so like the others, we are willing to introduce scheme which supports our CCGTs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the LNG markets, you know the present situation, you have three markets in the world, the U.S. market, the European market and the Asian market. And those markets are relatively disconnected because the price of natural gas on the U.S. market is US$2, in Europe $9 to $10, and in Asia between $15 and $18, even if there is a limited real marketplace in Asia, but you have transactions, huge transactions and at the ranges of price that I mentioned.</p>
          <p>So, physically, the only way to connect those three markets is not pipes. It's impossible physically, it is LNG, the only technical way to connect them. And with those price differences, it is absolutely obvious that in the future, the LNG will take a higher play, higher role, higher percentage in the gas natural exchange &#x2013; natural gas exchange in the future. And we are confident in the growth of the LNG market. As you know, the Chinese have put natural gas as an essential part of their energy mix in the 12th plan of China and then, they will produce a part, they will import a part from Russia or Turkmenistan and they will import the rest through LNG and therefore they are building some LNG terminals and we are associated with CNOOC, one of the most important oil and gas players in China. In China, we are in connection with the CNOOC building one floating LNG terminal in China.</p>
          <p>The question is the &#x2013; of course the U.S. market. Will the U.S. be soon exporter of LNG in the world, because with the domestic market at US$2, this creates specificity in the global market and we consider that a part of the natural gas produced thanks with unconventional gas, thanks to unconventional gas in the U.S. will be exported and it is the reason for which we have signed a preliminary agreement with Sempra, the U.S. energy group, which has a project to build an LNG liquefaction plant in Louisiana and we are in association with Mitsui, Mitsubishi and therefore GDF SUEZ to work with Sempra, each of the three foreign partners being responsible for one train and the proceeds of the train &#x2013; the transformation of natural gas into LNG will be dedicated to Asia using the extended Panama Canal.</p>
          <p>This is what we anticipate and probably the price in the U.S. will not remain at US$2; at this price $2 the production of shale gas in the U.S. is not profitable. So, in the medium term, the price will be higher than level and of course there is a room to &#x2013; large room to make the export of natural gas produced in the U.S. to Asia especially where the market is most booming after transformation in the form of LNG. So, in the medium term, there will be some rebalancing of the prices in those market, but it will take time.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. Patrick Hummel from UBS. Three questions if I may. First one, when you say, you're stopping your thermal project developments in Central Western Europe, how does that affect the assets that are already under construction? Are you actually delaying or slowing down construction work there or are they completely unaffected? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>Second question regarding the French gas supply business, I mean, now that there is also a debate about the potential change in the formula, et cetera, i.e. the regulatory risk is still significant, have you ever considered the option of just selling that business or handing the keys to the government?</p>
          <p>And the third question is rather just a reconfirmation, I mean, you've clearly emphasized the importance of dividend in the presentation. I just wonder whether you can clearly say that except for the upcoming interim dividends which you offered also in kind for the IPR acquisition, all the upcoming dividends for the coming years, will they be cash only? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When we say that we'll stop our thermal plants naturally it's the new thermal plants. We will have two coal plants coming into services next year, one in Netherlands and second in Germany so, but for the time being and currently given the market condition, we will not open or engage into new thermal plants.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all, on the contrary, I would say, it's not a good option financially also to slow down the construction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now for the second question on the French gas distribution &#x2013; French gas sales, and the various options. I will say that, we are not in principle opposed to unconventional solutions to solve this problem, but so far, we have not taken any decisions of that kind.</p>
          <p>Now, about the dividend, it's clear that we have taken the decision to propose the possibility to the shareholder to take the dividend during the year 2012 in shares, it is, as we have said, dedicated to finance the International Power acquisition and next year we will come back to a cash dividend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions please. First of all on slide 4, for the 2012 guidance, again the &#x20AC;17 billion, you've basically reiterated the parameters you are using for your guidance including commodity prices for Europe and globally. Of course, for some of them, particularly in Europe, the market indicators are now quite below these assumptions, But could you confirm this should not be a concern regarding the &#x20AC;17 billion as you should be more or less totally covered for your volumes for this year? So can you confirm that actually the &#x20AC;17 billion should not be affected by, for instance, current spark spreads or power prices in Europe? Number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, moving to slide 12, very interesting market indicators again for European Energy. You told us in Q1 that the trend in spreads, gas and power, in Europe would lead to some &#x20AC;500 million decline in EBITDA for 2012. And some of these indicators, the clean spark spreads, have not improved for sure and you indicated that we should probably assume further pressure on load factors for gas plants in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now, if we assume this type of market conditions as we see now, and as your hedges roll off further for next year, we should probably assume further pressure on European energy EBITDA. Can you confirm this directionally or maybe help us with a quantification of some form of mark-to-market, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will answer your questions. So, first of all, I confirm of course that the &#x20AC;17 billion we indicated takes into account the current level of prices in Europe. So, no additional pressure to be expected by year-end. I confirm this &#x20AC;17 billion level.</p>
          <p>You're right, we mentioned the global &#x20AC;500 million pressure on the margins, both electricity and gas margins. To make it simple, I will say that, for the moment, at the end of H1, it is better on gas and a little bit higher on electricity. As far as 2013 is concerned, so you know that we have a progressing &#x2013; progressive hedging policy, so today, we are covered at 70% globally speaking on European power activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as you rightly mentioned that the trend is downward. But we will do our utmost to offset that to the maximum extent. And, in particular, through the exception &#x2013; the operations and trying to adapt our fleet to stem against this negative trend. So, there is a negative trend due to the reduction of electric prices, power prices, but naturally, the company tried to do something against it.</p>

          <p>And now, we take our next question from Bertrand Lecourt from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's Bertrand Lecourt from Deutsche Bank. I've got several questions. The first one is still on spreads &#x2013; power spreads. It seems that in the first half surprised that we are maybe not that bad for the business, especially in Benelux, which is showing a good progression in EBITDA, but I would like to understand what kind of &#x2013; of the 11% in EBITDA, how much was weather? How much was the pressure on spreads and where that could go for next year? And what would be the cost of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:36:46) allocation of CO2 from next year on?</p>
          <p>Second question is mostly looking at all the debate that there was in the first half on your bottom line and the payout ratio. It seems that the net income is still growing, but the payout ratio remains high since the free cash flow is enough to pay a good dividend. But going forward, it seems that the return on equity is not that high compared to peers, I think it's around 6.5% today. Where do you think it is going, knowing that you are giving us a guidance of above &#x20AC;5 billion of net income for 2015, I don't know if you keep this guidance. Even if you get to this level, you get a return on equity of around 8% and this is below the sector rate of around 10%. What do you plan to put in place to put this net income higher? I think you missed around &#x20AC;1 billion, &#x20AC;1.5 billion of cash. It doesn't have to come necessarily from the international level, but from Europe, do you need to <mark type="ph" /> restructure savings (1:37:36) at least to secure these returns for shareholders and to secure your payout ratio in the business?</p>
          <p>And also third question. In terms of guidance, you look at the bottom line, which is a good thing, but what kind of growth you are expecting at the bottom line, is that more in the next three years, 0% to 5% growth or 5% to 10% growth? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on your first question, the &#x2013; we're suffering from two direction, first the baseload prices &#x2013; the outright prices are slightly decreasing over years and will continue to decrease, and second, the spark price and the CCS spark price in particular are very low. This is only running on peak spark price and not on baseload. So, these two negative effects are compensated first by the hedging policy that we are implementing, which is a sort of buffer for revenue and second by the operational excellence that we try every year to improve for our power sector.</p>
          <p>So, it's a reason why this year, you will see still good results, and certainly there will be less next year unless the price &#x2013; the power prices are going up again, <mark type="ph" /> all these are changed, total change (1:39:15) on what we are currently seeing on the market. As far as the CO2 is concerned, I gave you the rough number, 45 million tonnes for the entire group, part in Europe, part in the U.K., part in services also. And this 45 million have to be paid and you know exactly the price that we have today. That means that it should be about &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the future, we did not change the guidances we gave six months ago. We're not used to do that at this moment of the year. Nevertheless, some remarks about the dividend payout ratio and return on equity. On the return on equity, it is true that it is at a relatively low level, but as you know, we've made lots, several mergers recently, and therefore the level of the equity for the new group, the merged group have been re-evaluated. And therefore we have relatively large equity base. And you have to take that into account when you measure the return on equity. For us, what is much more important is the cash. Cash is king in our behavior at the group and it is the reason for which the payout ratio is, of course, an element that we take into account, but which is more important is the real cash capacity to pay the dividend and to compare the free cash flow to the dividend and the free cash flow has represented last year 2.7 times the dividend.</p>
          <p>Of course, we &#x2013; all our efforts are concentrated on improving the earnings of the group and we'll continue and even intensify all the actions dedicated to improve the operating performance, operating excellence of our business units to intensify the cost cutting actions within the group, to intensify the procurement plan and extend the procurement plan within the group to continue to control the CapEx. We are absolutely on track for the Efficio program for that year and we will deliver the full impact for the full year and we are already intensively preparing the 2013 and 2014 plans in that respect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, excuse me, can you confirm that we still have this net income, I don't know if it was a soft guidance or not, for 2015 that you plan to reach above &#x20AC;5 billion, &#x20AC;5.5 billion plus the IPR consolidation?</p>
