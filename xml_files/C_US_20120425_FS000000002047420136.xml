          <p>Welcome to Citi's Fixed Income Investor Review with Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach; and Treasurer, Eric Aboaf. Today's call will be hosted by Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Fiszel Bieler, you may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the fixed income investor presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the risk factor section of our 2011 Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>With that said, let me turn it over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to be hosting our Fixed Income Investor Review this quarter. Today we're going to update you on our continued execution and progress in several areas, including our liquidity and balance sheet management. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, is going to take you through some specifics on our balance sheet progress, our liquidity profile and our capital position, as well as review our recent issuance activity and current funding plans for the coming year. Many of you may have joined us for last Monday's earnings call, and there are key points from that call that I would like to highlight to start us off here on slide 1.</p>
          <p>This quarter we reported net income of $2.9 billion for the first quarter of 2012. Ex-CVA and excluding the net gain from minority investments we earned $3.4 billion in net income, or $1.11 per share. This is a significant increase, both from the first and fourth quarters of 2011. While our businesses operated in an improved environment in the first quarter, we also saw the benefit of our investments.</p>
          <p>We generated revenue growth and had positive operating leverage across Citi's core businesses, Global Consumer Banking, Transaction Services and Securities and Banking. Key drivers such as loans and Citicorp grew by 12% from the prior year while we deepened client relationships and improved market share in several businesses. Global Consumer Banking generated $10 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 5% from the previous year. Securities and Banking revenues rebounded, driven by particularly strong performances in fixed income. In Transaction Services, revenues were a record $2.7 billion, reflecting strong growth, particularly in trade finance, where our unique global footprint gives us a meaningful competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>Overall, net income ex-CVA for our institutional businesses increased 12% compared to the first quarter of 2011 and was 4.5 times larger when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. We reduced our legacy assets in Citi Holdings by 7% during the quarter and Citi Holdings assets are now at $209 billion or just 11% of our total assets. While the operating environment improved in the first quarter, there is still much macro uncertainty and we'll continue to manage risk carefully.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to capital and liquidity. First, let me share with you some numbers since we further added to our capital base during the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $122 billion of Tier 1 common capital and a ratio of 12.4% under Basel I, up from 11.8% at the end of the fourth quarter. And, for the first time, we shared our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel III basis, which stood at an estimated 7.2% at the end of the quarter. Now, keep in mind that Basel III requires the deductions of certain minority holdings on a dollar-per-dollar basis from an institution's capital basis and the 7.2% figure reflects that.</p>
          <p>In aggregate, our minority investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, such as Akbank and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney amount to 120 basis points of these deductions. As you know, we expect to reduce certain of these stakes over time. While we're at 7.2% now, we still expect to exceed 8% by the end of this year and have various paths to do so. In fact, based on current analyst consensus estimates of our earnings, for the remainder of 2012 and our anticipated actions, including the reduction of our stake in Akbank, we expect to be above 8%, even if Morgan Stanley doesn't exercise its option to buy 14% of the MSSB joint venture this year.</p>
          <p>On liquidity, more than one-quarter of our balance sheet is in cash or liquid securities and even though the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio doesn't come into effect until 2015, we are at an estimated LCR ratio in excess of 125% at quarter-end. As a result, we have already exceeded the proposed requirement. As you can see, our capital and liquidity numbers are amongst the strongest in our industry, globally.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 2, I'd like to reemphasize some of our key earnings results from the first quarter. There are a few significant items I'd like to mention that affected our results. First, on the revenue side, CVA and DVA were negative $1.3 billion in the first quarter as Citi's credit spreads tightened and we also benefited from a pre-tax gain of nearly $500 million related to minority investments. And on the expense side, legal and related expenses remained elevated at over $500 million. However, repositioning charges declined to $66 million from over $400 million in the prior quarter. Citigroup reported net income of $2.9 billion or $0.95 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>Excluding CVA, DVA and the minority investment gains earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.11 per diluted share. Revenues of $19.4 billion were down 2% versus the prior year on a reported basis. However, excluding CVA, DVA and the minority investment gain revenues were up 1% from last year as revenue growth in Citicorp out paced the decline in Citi Holdings.</p>
          <p>Expenses of $12.3 billion were roughly flat year-over-year on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and the significant expense items I just mentioned, operating expenses were up less than 1%. Incremental investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs of $3 billion were down 5% versus last year. Net credit losses of $4 billion were down 37% year-over-year including incremental charge-offs of approximately $370 million in the first quarter related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages. As we discussed in more detail on last week's earnings call these charge-offs were related to the national mortgage settlement.</p>
          <p>Excluding these incremental charge-offs, NCLs would have been down 43% from last year. Virtually all of this incremental $370 million of charge-offs was offset by a reserve release specific to the deferred principal amounts. And so the net impact was essentially earnings neutral. Excluding this specific release the net reserve release in the first quarter would have been roughly $800 million, down from $3.3 billion in the prior year. Citigroup end of period loans were up 2% from last year to nearly $650 billion as strong loan growth in Citicorp continued to outpace the wind-down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to over $900 billion.</p>
          <p>And now let me turn it over to Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. While the operating environment improved in the first quarter we've continued to manage our business and our balance sheet carefully given the macroeconomic uncertainty. Both our capital and liquidity are robust no matter which measure you use. We have a Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 12.4% and our Basel III Tier 1 common estimate is 7.2% which includes a 120 basis point impact for minority investments certain of which we intend to divest. We have ample liquidity with $421 billion in aggregate liquidity resources and our current Basel III LCR estimate of above 125% is comfortably in excess of the 100% proposed minimum.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress in reshaping the balance sheet which provides us with additional capital and liquidity to strategically deploy in our Citicorp businesses. Year-over-year our lending growth is up a healthy 12% in Citicorp and 2% in total after taking into account the holdings wind down. Our total deposits are up 5%.</p>
          <p>We are seeing continued improvement in credit trends with net credit losses down 37% from a year ago and we are well reserved with loan loss reserves of $29 billion or 4.5% of loans. And net loan loss reserve releases are down approximately 65% year-over-year which demonstrates significant improvement in the quality of our earnings this quarter. With this strong balance sheet we have the resources and the capabilities to continue to grow as we help our global clientele navigate the current environment.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 4. Let me describe how we are managing our balance sheet for the current environment and investing to grow the Citicorp businesses. On the left you see assets for Citicorp and Corp Other which are up 5% year-over-year as we continue to reinvest in the franchise. Here you can see how we have deployed our balance sheet to support our customers over the past year in Citicorp. For example, net loans, which is our largest asset category, is up approximately $61 billion year-over-year and approximately $8 billion quarter-over-quarter as we continue to lend to both consumer and corporate clients in a disciplined manner.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we've increased our trading assets by $18 billion quarter-over-quarter and in line with the prior year period in response to customer demand during the improved operating environment we saw in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the right, you see Citi Holdings' assets which are down 29% year-over-year as the wind down continues to free up capital. Our Citicorp, Citi Holding strategy continues to provide us the flexibility to redeploy that capital and take advantage of growth opportunities, particularly in our lending businesses, while also giving us the ability to size our market-making balance sheet to the current economic environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 5, given our healthier balance sheet, we've been deploying our capital in the Citicorp lending businesses in a disciplined manner, as I just mentioned. Let me describe what we are seeing in loan volumes. In Citicorp loans grew $514 billion, up 12% year-over-year, including 6% growth in consumer and 23% growth in corporate loans. This quarter's result represented the seventh consecutive quarter for Citicorp loan growth.</p>
          <p>In our institutional businesses, lending increased 45% in Transaction Services from the prior year, driven by trade finance lending in Asia, Latin America and Europe and we saw 15% growth in our Securities &amp; Banking corporate loan book with increased borrowing across all client segments and geographies.</p>
          <p>International consumer banking loan volumes increased 8% year-over-year overall, led by growth in Asia and Latin America. These trends reflect the underlying economic growth in these regions as well as the results of our investment spending, which are driving growth in both cards and retail loans. North America consumer loan volumes were up modestly at 4% driven by retail banking loans as the cards market continues to reflect consumer deleveraging as well as CARD Act and other regulatory changes. Our overall increase in Citicorp loan volume provides a powerful engine of year-on-year growth in net interest income and accrual earnings.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 6, having just discussed our loan trends, let's turn to deposits. This page shows how our deposit base is continuing to grow. Deposits around the world are our primary source of funding in the bank, which I will discuss with you further in a moment. Company-wide deposits increased 5% or $40 billion year-over-year, and increased a robust 7% in Citicorp. As I've said before, deposits are one of our lowest cost sources of funds, and you can see that while deposits have grown, the overall cost of funds on deposits is down year-over-year and significantly more from prior periods. This reflects both the low-rate environment and our ability to lower price points, which widens our margins, given abundant customer liquidity while still remaining competitive and attracting deposits.</p>
          <p>We would, however, expect to see some pressure on deposit rates due to competitive pricing in certain regions or when interest rates increase. This quarter, in keeping with our client-focused model, we saw healthy deposit growth across all our deposit-taking businesses, including Consumer Banking, the Private Bank and our Securities and Banking business and in Transactions Services.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 7, this page shows how we continue to improve the quality of our deposit base. You can see on the page that we have been actively changing the composition of our deposits within both Global Consumer Banking and our institutional businesses, meaning Transaction Services and Securities and Banking. Time deposits, where rates are fixed for the term of the deposit and which have lower margins, are becoming a smaller proportion of our base in both businesses, whereas operating balances are becoming a larger proportion of our deposits. These checking and savings accounts for individuals and cash management accounts for corporations are providing wider margins and have exhibited stickier behavior. Year-over-year, our deposit mix has shifted positively within each business. Operating balances are now 76% and 73% of the total for the Global Consumer and our Institutional businesses respectively.</p>
          <p>On a firm-wide basis, operating balances now represent 74% of our overall Citicorp deposit base, whereas last year they represented approximately 71%, and two years ago, they were at 62%.</p>
          <p>On slide 8, I want to show you how the balance sheet activity that we just reviewed is contributing to our net interest margin. This quarter, we saw NIM remain flat, which is largely due to a few offsetting factors. As I mentioned, we rebuilt our trading book after the fourth quarter decline, and those assets came at lower yields. That offset the NIM tailwind that typically comes as loans become a larger proportion of our asset base. At the same time, as you've heard me say before, we've been focused on reducing our borrowing costs. In the bank, we've been substituting maturing long-term debt, which is a more expensive source of funding, with deposits, our lowest cost source of funds. This has a positive impact on NIM.</p>
          <p>And finally, we had a reserve release in Japan consumer finance, which had a positive impact on NIM this quarter. Looking forward, absent any other significant changes, our NIM will likely continue to reflect the pressure of a low interest rate environment and subsequent changes in our portfolio. As such, we expect we'll probably see a NIM ratio, closer to approximately 2.85% next quarter and after that we would expect that NIM should be stable or perhaps grow slightly.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 9, looking at Citi Holdings, let me describe our progress in reducing the amount of our higher risk assets in general. Holdings assets have declined by 74% from their peak in 2008 to $209 billion and now stand at just 11% of our balance sheet. The $16 billion reduction in the first quarter was comprised of roughly $4 billion of asset sales and business disposition, approximately $11 billion of net runoff and pay downs and $1 billion of net cost of credit and net asset marks. This slide shows you the key businesses within Citi Holdings where those reductions occurred.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the two largest components of Citi Holdings, the special asset pool and local consumer lending are down 51% and 24% respectively from the first quarter of 2011. And, as I've said before, our local consumer lending U.S. mortgage business is a fraction of the size of that of our large U.S. bank peers.</p>
          <p>Clearly we are continuing to make significant progress executing on our Citi Holdings asset reduction strategy and as we have stated, we believe the pace of reductions will continue at approximately this rate.</p>
          <p>Given the interest in GIIPS countries, we wanted to update you on our exposures on page 10. At the end of the first quarter, Citi's gross funded credit exposure to GIIPS was $20.5 billion, roughly flat to last quarter. Netted against our gross-funded credit exposure, we have margin posted under legally enforceable margin agreements, collateral pledged under bankruptcy remote structures and purchase credit protection from financial institutions predominantly outside of these five countries. These amounts totaled $14.5 billion. So, net of this margin, collateral and purchase credit protection, our net current funded exposure to GIIPS at the end of the first quarter was $9.1 billion, this was up a bit from the $7.7 billion last quarter due primarily to normal fluctuations in the trading book while the banking book itself was down slightly.</p>
          <p>You can also see that the majority of our exposure in these countries is to corporate, not to the sovereign itself. We continued to carefully manage these exposures while serving our important clients in these countries. Importantly, since the end of the second quarter of 2011, we have decreased our net current funded GIIPS credit exposure by half, down 50% from $11.9 billion to $6 billion.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 11, having discussed balance sheet trends in some detail, now let's review Citi's liquidity and funding strategy, which has been a cornerstone of strength. Our current strategy is designed to provide ample, high quality liquidity to make sure that we are well-positioned to grow our core business and navigate various market conditions. In both the bank and non-bank, we carry a healthy liquidity buffer which is generally held in cash and highly liquid securities, such as treasuries and agencies and other G7 instruments. We execute on this funding strategy in both our bank and non-bank businesses, by accessing a spectrum of funding sources.</p>
          <p>In our bank businesses, our funding is primarily in the forum of stable, diversified deposits from around the world which I discussed earlier. In our non-bank businesses, we use a modest amount of short-term funding, such as repo to finance liquid assets. We then use a range of long-term debt instruments to cover our broader business needs.</p>
          <p>Our funding strategy has served us well over the last few years and has prepared us easily to meet the proposed Basel III liquidity requirements as we show on slide 12. The Basel III liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR is designed to ensure banks maintain adequate level of unencumbered cash and highly liquid securities that can be converted to cash to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario.</p>
          <p>As you're aware, the proposed minimum requirement for the LCR is 100%. The Basel Committee recently disclosed results from its Quantitative Impact Study exercise which was conducted in the second quarter of 2011. The average LCR for all large group one banks was 90% while the European large bank average was 71%. While we are still awaiting final guidance on the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio, we believe that we are already comfortably in compliance given the current rules as we understand them and we are running an estimated LCR ratio above 125%.</p>
          <p>Given that the industry average is below the proposed minimum requirements, it appears certain banks will need to reposition themselves in order to achieve compliance with the LCR minimum. Industry repositioning will likely take the form of issuing more long-term debt to close liquidity gaps, selling less liquid securities inventory and replacing them with government and agency securities and in raising additional customer deposits or reducing customer lending. Since Citi's current LCR estimate is more than 25% above the proposed minimum, we believe we will be able to avoid any potential repositioning costs I just outlined.</p>
          <p>Part of the reason we scored well on the Basel III LCR is the size of our liquidity buffer which is defined as cash and highly liquid securities on slide 13. It stood at approximately $421 billion at the end of the first quarter. This quarter, our high level of bank liquidity is up as deposits have increased. At the same time, our non-bank liquidity to support our parent and broker dealer activities decreased slightly. We continue to believe that this range is proportionally calibrated to the size of our balance sheet and current market conditions.</p>
          <p>In addition, as of the first quarter, we currently estimate that other entities and subsidiaries held approximately $93 billion of cash and unencumbered liquid securities. When you include this additional liquidity, our total liquidity buffer is approximately $421 billion.</p>
          <p>And finally, it is also worth mentioning that we only include our on-balance sheet liquidity buffer here. As such, we don't include borrowing capacity at the Fed Discount Window or international central banks or with the FHLB as part of our aggregate liquidity resources. That capacity is over and above what you see on this page.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14, let me describe for you the current status of our ratings, a topic we have discussed quite a bit over the last year and a half. As you are aware, S&amp;P and Fitch resolved their industry-wide reviews in the fourth quarter of 2011 and announced their rating changes at that time. You may recall that during this previous rating action, we estimated that less than 1% of our funding could be impacted. The actual impact was far less and was not material. We are rated A/A1 with S&amp;P at our key operating entities for the Citibank, N.A., CGMI [Citigroup Global Markets Inc.] and CGML [Citigroup Global Markets Limited] and A/A2 at the Citigroup holding company. Also, we are rated A/F1 with Fitch at both the operating and holding company levels.</p>
          <p>As you are also aware, on February 15th of this year, Moody's announced an industry-wide review and placed 17 global banks and securities firms on review for downgrade, along with many more local banks around the world. As you can imagine, we have been in active dialogue with Moody's during the review time period and have been discussing Citi's strong capital and liquidity position, ever-improving asset quality and overall franchise strength. We have also discussed our relative standing and strength as compared with the other U.S. and European banks on review.</p>
          <p>Now, given this potential action, we have carefully thought through the potential impacts. In this context, we are often asked about funding requirements related to derivatives. As we have disclosed in our filings previously, in the event of a downgrade, Citi may have to post additional funding in the form of cash, obligations and collateral, specifically in the event of a two-notch downgrade by Moody's, Citi could be required to post additional funding in the form of cash, obligations and collateral of up to approximately $2 billion. This is a subset of what we shared with you in the 10-K which represented a two-notch downgrade across all three agencies at once.</p>
          <p>Further, in terms of the derivatives business, that activity is predominantly conducted on the bank today and we do not believe that a downgrade to the A3 level will have a material impact as this remains above the counterparty threshold for the vast majority of our clients.</p>
          <p>In general, these are very small numbers in the context of our $1.9 trillion balance sheet, as well as when compared to our liquidity buffer, which as we just discussed is more than $420 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 15, I wanted to take a moment to talk about what we've been hearing and seeing from our clients and investors regarding credit assessments and how that's changed over the years. In the past, when information was limited and infrequent, ratings often served as the only available measure of creditworthiness. This suited an era of smaller, simpler banks with limited disclosures as well as a nascent investor marketplace.</p>
          <p>Today, investors and clients have become increasingly sophisticated and are typically assessing banks on multiple indicators rather than solely relying on ratings from two agencies, no less a single agency. In fact, investors and clients are looking for an investing edge and have effectively built internal teams to take on the credit assessment process.</p>
          <p>In contrast to the past, clients and counterparties today are looking at a variety of metrics to assess bank creditworthiness. These measures include financial metrics such as a bank's equity base, regulatory capital levels, liquidity profile and loan loss reserve; market metrics, which are available in real-time such as bonds and CDS spreads and stock price are also being included in valuations; and finally business metrics, such as business strategy, geographic diversification and risk concentration are also key drivers of the assessment process for today's complex multinational banks. We believe this shift to a more integrated approach to credit evaluations is appropriate in an increasingly complex market environment and have expanded our disclosures accordingly.</p>
          <p>In keeping with our discussion of the changing market environment, Citi has significantly shifted its funding mix over the last few years away from short-term sources to deposits and long-term debt and equity. Slide 16 shows the funding composition that we have for the bank and non-bank. Within our bank, we believe our deposit base is one of the most stable and lowest cost-funding source and you can see that approximately 80% of our bank is funded by deposits, compared to 72% in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the non-bank businesses, long-term debt represents the most significant component of our liability mix. The vast majority of this funding is comprised of senior term debt, along with subordinated instruments and trust preferred securities. As of the first quarter, long-term debt, comprised 35% of the funding in the non-bank. While long-term debt was lower over the course of the past year, so is the level of assets, especially illiquid assets it is meant to support. Approximately 30% of our non-bank liabilities are secured financings, often referred to as repos, which provide funding in a carefully calibrated manner for liquid securities and modest haircuts. Finally, our large base of book equity supports both the bank and non-bank entities.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, let me turn to long-term funding in our liability management initiatives. The top half of the page shows our long-term debt outstanding by category over time, including senior debt, TLGP and credit card securitizations. The bottom half of the page segments the amount of long-term debt in the bank and non-bank entities. The bottom is another cut of the top to provide you with some further texture. As you can see here, our long-term debt outstanding has decreased year-over-year in most long-term debt categories as we have deleveraged the balance sheet, especially in the bank.</p>
          <p>In the bank, we have consciously reduced debt funding as we have grown our deposit base. Looking at the non-bank at the bottom half of the page, longer-term debt has decreased as we have let TLGP roll-off while keeping a healthy amount of funding for our broker dealer. In the non-bank, assets have been reduced at a corresponding pace, especially as we wound down Holdings and took actions to reduce higher risk and less liquid Basel III assets in the dealer. As you can see here with our current estimate for the fourth quarter of 2012, we believe that this trend will continue, and expect a decline in the amount of long-term debt that we have outstanding, particularly in the bank.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 18, let me review with you the liability management strategy that we have been executing over the course of the last few years. As we have discussed on past calls, we've successfully de-risked our balance sheet and reduced Holdings assets, thereby creating ample liquidity. Through selective public tender offers and open market purchases, we've reduced outstanding debt, both short and long-term, with either excess cash or by replacing it with new issued debt at lower spreads.</p>
          <p>The chart on the left-hand side of this page shows our quarterly liability management activity in the non-bank. As you can see we've been consistently active in the senior benchmark and structured space. This quarter our buybacks of structured and benchmark paper allowed us to lower our overall funding costs.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of this page, you can see that we carefully managed the Weighted Average Maturity of our long-term debt. Over the last year WAM increased to approximately seven years from 6.2 years in 2010. On the bank, we have consciously allowed TLGP to run off as we have replaced it with stable deposit funding. You can see, at the end of last year, with TLGP rolling down, we no longer have unsecured benchmark debt with maturity greater than one year in the bank. On the dealer non-bank, we've used our liability management efforts, coupled with our issuance strategy to consciously maintain the maturity of our debt.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 19, you can see expected maturities for full year 2012 and also our expected maturities of long-term debt over the next two years. This chart clearly shows that maturities peak in 2012 and come down in 2013. As we see in light blue at the top of the first column, TLGP debt represents the bulk of the maturities in 2012. Many observers have noted that this wave of maturities is an industry-wide situation, which came about as many banks issued TLGP and other government-guaranteed debt in 2008 and 2009. As I said before, for us at Citi, we do not expect to replace TLGP maturities. As we have demonstrated and reviewed on prior slides, the reason is clear as we continue to reduce our Citi Holdings balance sheet in both our bank and non-bank entities, our need for long-term debt is coming down.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we issued approximately $7 billion in long-term, structural debt. We issued across multiple tenors in both benchmark and structured notes. As we stated last quarter, we continue to expect to issue approximately $15 billion to $20 billion of long-term debt during 2012 although this number may change based on market conditions and other factors. At this time, we believe we will be at the low end of this range and the balance of our issuance program will be a mix of benchmark and structured debt.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 20, as many of you know, as part of the CCAR process, Citi received approval to redeem certain series of outstanding trust-preferred securities. Let's take a moment to review the securities that we have outstanding. You can see on the bar charts below, that we have grouped our outstanding trust preferreds into two categories based on their call features. Those that are currently callable and those that are not currently callable but we believe would be callable under a regulatory capital event. These securities are ordered in each category by coupon and the smaller bar shows the notional amount for each security as well.</p>
          <p>Many of you have asked about our current strategy with regard to our trust-preferred securities given the regulatory changes pending under Dodd-Frank and Basel III. For the issues that are not callable now but would be at the time of a regulatory capital event, we, along with many others in the industry, are awaiting the expected forthcoming NPR from the regulators.</p>
          <p>In general, we will consider various factors when evaluating each of our trust-preferred and enhanced trust-preferred securities including aspects such as coupon, currency and the optional and regulatory call features of the securities I just reviewed and the timing of such options. You can expect that Citi will make the appropriate economic decision.</p>
          <p>So turning to slide 21, let me talk about capital, which continues to be an area of significant strength for us and supports lending growth that I described. Our Basel I Tier 1 common capital stands at $122 billion and our Basel I total capital is $172 billion. At the end of the first quarter our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio was 12.4%, significantly up from a year-ago and up from the fourth quarter. Our risk-weighted assets stand at $978 billion and Citi Holdings risk-weighted assets now represent approximately 19% of the total.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, our Basel III Tier 1 common estimate was 7.2% at the end of the first quarter and we still expect to exceed 8% Tier 1 common under Basel III by the end of this year. As you can see, our capital base is one of the strongest in the industry, both as compared to U.S. and international banking peers.</p>
          <p>Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, as I said, our capital base continues to be one of the strongest in the industry, and this is reflected across every one of our significant capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Second, we have significantly improved our structural liquidity by increasing our capital base and deposits and reducing Citi Holdings assets. We believe that we have ample liquidity, and our estimated Basel III LCR is over 125%, which is significantly above the estimated industry average and proposed required minimum.</p>
          <p>Third, we will have a significantly lower proportion of wholesale funding going forward. We currently have modest long-term debt issuance plans over the next year. We' will not be replacing the maturing TLGP debt. Thus, we expect that our long-term debt outstanding will continue to decline.</p>
          <p>And fourth, while the environment remains uncertain, we saw continued strength in our core lending and deposit-taking businesses, as well as in our market businesses this quarter. As we stated earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage again in our Asia and Latin American Consumer Banking businesses this quarter and Transaction Services achieved positive operating leverage as well.</p>
          <p>That concludes our fixed income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John and Eric. I appreciate the call, as always. Two questions if I could. One, thanks for all the detail on the possible impact of the Moody's downgrade. What I'd like to zero in on is the preparations you've made with respect to your repo funding base. I take your point very much that people are not going to be just following Moody's blindly, but as you know some 2a-7 funds and all that are limited in what they can do, assuming that Moody's makes a mistake and would take the rating down to prime 2. So could you talk a bit about what you've done to maybe diversify the counterparties in your investor base there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Ryan. It's Eric here. We've done several things that are relevant to the repo base, but first I've got to remind you that the preponderance of our repo activity is handled on the dealer, which is part of the Citigroup chain, and thus, has a different set of ratings than the bank. And in fact already has a P2 rating by Moody's. That's important, because that investor group, the repo counterparties, have already dealt with the potential situation. And as you know, Moody's has reaffirmed our P2 short-term rating on the, at the Citigroup and dealer level.</p>
          <p>That said, we've done several things over the past couple years on repo to ensure that it is carefully calibrated, and that includes the following list. I think number one, we have significantly lengthened the tenor of the repo base. Historically repo had been done on a multi-week, one-month basis, and we've significantly lengthened the tenor across fixed-income repo, equity repo to make sure that it's a robust and dependable source.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we've diversified the client base. We'd gone through an assessment, probably over two years ago to identify, which counterparties were more sensitive, less sensitive to ratings, and we adjusted that mix so that it would be a robust source, regardless of what might change in the external environment.</p>
          <p>And third, we actually specifically put in place very tight limits on any sensitive counterparties like the 2a-7 funds. I think I've told you before, those funds against the repo base that we have are really a low single-digit portion of our funding today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. And the next question really has to do with the operating business. And that is with Securities and Banking, if we look at the geographical mix, North American revenues, year-over-year, this is year-over-year, North American revenues were down about 17%, whereas EMEA was up about 16%. Now I noticed too that FICC was up a lot, equity &#x2013; it was true for everybody, but equity was down a lot. Is it that, just one business is more FICC-centric than the other? Is that what's driving the difference between the U.S. revenue trends and EMEA ones?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it's a little hard when you get into the &#x2013; this is John, Ryan. When you look at the geographic split, there's a lot that goes into that. A lot of our G10 Rates business is conducted actually out of Europe. G10 Rates had a very strong quarter in the first quarter, so you might see a little bit more growth than in Europe. And some of our more credit-sensitive businesses are done more out of North America. And as I think we indicated last year, we had repositioned some of those businesses to be more in line with the Basel III environment, and therefore, had actually reduced the balance sheet that we had devoted to those businesses. So I think that is more what you're seeing in those revenue figures, when you try to compare the geographies.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Eric. Hi, John. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple quick questions, I'm going on the supplement here that you put out last week, and I'm looking in the liability section on page 4. I want to continue the conversation on deposits. I see that from last year to this year most of the growth in deposits, there's a lot of growth in deposits in non-interest bearing deposits in the U.S. offices. I'm guessing that that's a continuation of something that we've spoken about before, the unlimited FDIC coverage for transaction and non-interest bearing accounts that ends at the end of this year? How are you looking at that going forward and how are you going to keep that money in the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, it's Eric. Let me take that one. The first context I'd give you is that we have deposit insurance programs, not only in the U.S., but around the world. So this is one of many sources of funds for us.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we are not actively, and we've never really actively marketed an insurance protected deposit account as a lead product. And you can imagine why, because of exactly the risks that you've raised. If you suddenly add a lot of those deposits and then something changes, you're open to risk so we have not actually done that. What we've done is literally just continued to build our deposit base. We've done it a balanced way.</p>
          <p>What you'll notice is that most of those non-interest bearing deposit accounts are actually in operating balances, right? Which are the stickier and more reliable deposit balances and thus, we have a fair amount of confidence that while there may be some changes that come and go in the insurance program, we don't expect much of a change as that happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I see that on the deposits outside the U.S., that's fairly flat over the period. Is that something that you expect to grow? Are you picking up share from, say, European banks that are leaving emerging markets? And is that a push for you? And furthermore, can we see more self-funding of those type entities going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, it's Eric. Good questions. I think we are seeing some inflows of deposits as customers and corporates and different clients of various types are evaluating their various banks and clearly see us as a very healthy and strong bank and part of a flight to quality as they look at some of the dislocations in Europe or in other parts of the world. I think what we've continued to do is carefully calibrate the pricing on deposits, to make sure that we're not pricing up.</p>
          <p>In fact, I think we've consciously let pricing flow downwards, because really we're not in the business of raising large amounts of time deposits or discretionary deposits. What we really try to accomplish within our Transaction Services business in particular, is a cash management type of program, which has local cash management, international cash management, custodial clearing operations, and deposits just happen to be a productive by-product of that activity, which really, makes them, in the end, a fairly low-cost and sticky funding source for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But we won't look forward to you gathering more deposits or even issuing longer &#x2013; medium and longer-term debt out of these type of entities like an HSBC or Santander?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, let me put that differently. We're not expecting to issue much long-term debt in the bank entities, specifically because we are rich in the deposit liability source. What we are doing and we've always done is actually had a very balanced balance sheet with regards to deposits, relative to loans, in every one of our entities. In fact, you could imagine we run 100 entities-plus around the world. Every one of those is run at a very high standard of liquidity. It's not as if we ask one entity or one country to fund another because that would not make for a robust local franchise. As you know, we run a global franchise that is, that's across our businesses, but every one of those also is run on a local basis. That's really been done that way for many years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, one more if I could sneak it in on page 20, on the TruPS. The graph here implies that you may have approval to, depending on the NPR, but you got approval from the CCAR process to redeem all of these. Is that the case or is there a certain dollar hurdle that you got approval for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert, it's Eric again. We got &#x2013; we did not get, we did not ask and did not get approval for redeeming all of our TruPS. As you know, we need some of the TruPS as part of the Tier 1 requirements and they don't phase out until &#x2013; by year, starting in 2013 and going for five years hence, so we need some of these. What I can tell you is that we got approval to redeem a substantial amount. We're not at liberty to say because that's obviously part of the discussions that we've had with the Fed, but I can tell you that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you can't elaborate on what a substantial amount would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at this point. I mean, as soon as see more of &#x2013; as soon as we see an NPR and have a regulatory call event then we can actually act in the market and disclose which we would like to and have gotten approval to call. But at this point, just given the obvious confidentiality requirements of the CCAR process, we can't elaborate further.</p>

          <p>Now we'll go to David Knutson with Legal &amp; General.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a couple of questions, one on Moody's. Is there any sense that after this review is completed, will Moody's continue to have a negative outlook regarding Citi's credit or do you anticipate a stable outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Eric. I really don't know. It's probably best to ask them. They're rerating the entire global banking industry, country by country, as well as large banks and probably best that you just ask them directly about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and on the long-term debt issuance plans, 15 to 20 for 2012, you've done seven, so really the amount is 15 to 20 minus the seven, just to clarify, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the economic basis that you talked about, regarding the TruP redemption, is the right way to think about the economic evaluation of it, if you have a TruP which has less regulatory capital, therefore it starts to look like senior debt, should we consider, when we're trying to understand your perception of the economic value or economic trade-off here, should we look at the TruP cost, relative to an equivalent senior debt cost? Perhaps a short-dated senior or a longer-dated senior, maybe you could describe it a little bit more, what is the economic valuation perspective you have in regards to your TruPS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Eric, I think that's a good construct and in the direction of how we approach it. You know, these trust-preferred will become, in effect, senior debt as they have less and less capital content. And so, we literally need to compare the borrowing costs of new issue debt or existing debt with these trust-preferred coupons and just make an economic decision between the two. You know, do we think about it as the equivalent of a short, one and two-year debt? No, I think you really need to compare this to medium-term and benchmark debt issuance costs and then we do the analysis from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last question with the news regarding Argentina and YPF, does this impact any of your international development or growth plans with this expropriation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we've always been very careful around the emerging markets. As you know, we've been operating in the emerging markets for hundreds of years. We've been through governments and government changes in Latin America, in Argentina specifically, but in every part of the world and you can imagine, we have a pretty elaborate playbook on how to operate in these kinds of environments that change and could change in different ways.</p>
          <p>That said, the balance sheet is quite healthy in Argentina. It's been a good country for us, but not a particularly high growth country for us. And we've not seen any balance sheet changes over the last couple weeks or months that give us any concern at this point, but it's obviously one that we're very careful about and are actively watching and managing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last thing. The capital action plan that you're seeking, the $8 billion, when I think about the overall projected capital that Citi will have relative to the other large integrated banks in the U.S., it seems to be a bit aggressive. So I guess I'm curious, the view regarding the unsecured credit ratings of the firm, what is the value of being at the upper band of your peers and when I say your peers, I'm saying the other large integrated U.S. banks? Do you find that you would have &#x2013; is there significant value from an issuance perspective to be in the upper band? Or is where you're at a way to help &#x2013; you know, to operate healthy in the future?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, David, it's John. I just want to make sure that I understand your use of the term upper band. Which upper band are you talking about? The upper band of...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you could say JPMorgan is probably at the top of the ratings relative to I think, your peers. So is there...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're looking at it from a rating-agency point of view?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's exactly what we're in discussion with Moody's about right now. That's exactly what we discuss with all rating agencies, and try to understand how they actually determine their ratings. As we determine how they actually produce these ratings, then we get the ability then to make decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the business can operate efficiently given the ratings that you have now? Or is it something that you would hope to migrate up towards the top of your peer group?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Now we'll open the floor up to Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, again, thank you for the call. Just a couple of bigger picture questions, perhaps. Eric, you spent some time on Citi's strength in terms of the liquidity coverage ratio and made the obvious point that you all sit above the 100% number and above many of your domestic and international peers. There was some concern when the LCR was first announced that that would have a very negative or upward bias to corporate loan pricing. I'm just curious if that's been the case so far? We haven't heard a lot of commentary about it. I wonder if that issue was a little over-hyped when the LCR first came out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, it's Eric. The LCR, I think by and large is designed thoughtfully by our regulatory agencies, right? We have had discussions; the industry has had discussions with them about refining the LCR. One of the discussions I think are less around corporate loans themselves, but more about the treatment of corporate deposits and the runoff rates that they assume. If that's what you're referring to, I think those discussions are ongoing. We'll see how the agencies &#x2013; what decisions the agencies make and obviously we'll operate on that basis. If that has some impact on our willingness as an industry to pay different amounts on corporate deposits versus retail deposits, I think we're going to have to see that as it plays out. It's very hard to predict it, but certainly folks have surmised that that could very well change on the margins some of the pricing that banks have for deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, this is John. With regard to your question on corporate loans, one of the things Eric mentioned when he was going over the LCR, is that given our current ratio, we don't really need to think in terms of repositioning our portfolio to come into compliance with the LCR. There are many other institutions that have yet to actually reposition their portfolio, in order to drive their ratio up higher. What could very well happen, as they reposition their portfolios is that they will jettison corporate debt that they would otherwise carry as part of their investment portfolio today. And it's those types of activities that could then have an impact on corporate debt pricing in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So I think, Eric is quite right as far as his commentary on the impact of corporate deposits, but the impact, the potential impact on the cost of corporate debt and the impact on corporate issuers is something that I think that we have yet to really see what that impact is. We still haven't had the general repositioning that's going to be required by the industry.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And if I could, just a question on the TruPS repurchases. You said that you plan to call a substantial amount of the 21 or so billion that you listed on slide 20 today. Just curious as to, in the long-term what potential beneficial affect that might have on your net interest margin given, if I assume that you replace all those with 10-year, unsecured debt, which is probably an overly simplifying assumption, but if we assume that, it looks like about a 300 basis point benefit in terms of the weighted average coupon on the TruPS versus your 10-year unsecured debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, it's Eric. I think it's a little more complicated than that because you actually have to think about our total debt outstanding, right? Which I think we showed on one of the pages and has trended about $250 billion of debt. That includes these TruPS, where, on this page we see about $16 billion of TruPS. So yeah, there's going to be some optimization between those two sources. I think on a weighted average, it'll be a slight improvement on our net interest margin, our funding costs and that'll be a benefit to the shareholders of the company, but I don't quite see how you get to the math you did. Maybe we could follow-up offline, if you'd like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other consideration that has to be brought into the mix is of course we still think, of course we don't have an NPR but we still believe that there will be, not just a Tier 1 common requirement under Basel III, but also a Tier 1 capital requirement and if you look at the B III rules as they're currently drafted, at least in general there's about another 150 basis points of capital that you need to carry between your Tier 1 common and total Tier 1. So calling of the TruPS is one thing because the TruPS will no longer count as Tier 1 capital but what is yet to be determined, is what do you need to carry then, in order to bridge that extra 150 basis points of the capital requirements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. As we sort of think about long term capital planning and regulatory changes and things like loan loss reserves probably declining because of hopefully a better economy, is there more room for sub debt in the capital structure down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Eric. That's a very good question because up until now most of the discussions among the Basel Committee and the regulatory community has been around Tier 1 common capital, which is common equity, which is only common equity, and then Tier 1, which as John just mentioned, will be some type of preferred, although we still need to get more data about that and more information. What has gone unsaid and is unclear, to be honest, until we get a U.S. NPR or more work is done by the Basel Committee, is regarding sub-debt and what we generally think of as Tier 2 capital, what will quantify? How much exactly? And are there any subcomponents of sub-debt in Tier 2 capital. At this point we have not &#x2013; we, I think, as an industry, don't know very much. So we're obviously going to maintain some of our sub debt, but we don't have enough information as yet to do that much long-term capital planning for that part of the structure.</p>

          <p>The other question I had &#x2013; or it's not really a question. I'm just wondering whether you could maybe as best as you can, maybe characterize the discussions that you've had with Moody's from a qualitative perspective? They seem to be hearing it from all sides, from banks, from investors that maybe this action that they're considering undertaking is perhaps not the most accurate representation of bank financial strength at this point in time. I'm just wondering whether from your discussions, whether you feel that they're willing to give ground on maybe some of the commentary that they've put out thus far? Or whether they've put a line in the sand and it is what it is?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>This is John. Moody's obviously prizes their independence. But at the same point in time, they certainly listen to input, but ultimately, they'll be the ones that make their own decisions and you're really going to have to you direct your questions to them.</p>

          <p>Hi, calling from Morgan Stanley, good morning. A couple of questions, guys. First in Securities and Banking, I'm sure there'll be more detail when the Q comes out, but could you talk about what the risk metrics, specifically VaR, looked like in the quarter, relative to previous quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what you're going to see is that the published VaR will actually be down from the prior quarter. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I do believe that you'll see that the trading VaR is down both year-over-year... [Incidental noise] (1:05:54) ...as well as down from the fourth quarter. [Incidental noise] (1:05:58) I guess that's the special VaR signal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. [Laughter]. The reserves number you mentioned, that 4.5%, I think you were still higher than on reserves to loans than some of your peers. I think the peak was somewhere over 6%. Do you have any view of how low this can go if trends continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's significant, when you look at the various disclosures that we've given you, out of the $29 billion worth of loan loss reserves that we have, we allocate $10 billion of those loan loss reserves to our mortgage book, both first and the junior liens. So I think that the answer to your question is really going to be dependent on what happens with the mortgage book at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then I'll slip in a last quick one, a lot of questions about TruPS and the NPR and what you do there. I presume your financing plan that you've' disclosed, the $15 billion to $20 billion, is inclusive of what your expectations are on taking out TruPS?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Matt, it's Eric. Are you referring to the lower tier 2 sub-debt as it's referred to in Europe? Is that what you're referring to?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll certainly evaluate those as part of our capital structure and funding needs. Clearly sub-debt performs multiple roles both as capital and as debt. And kind of in line with how we think about the TruPS, we have to take an economic view with regard to those issuances. If they're at a certain coupon relative to other sorts of debt instruments, then, that are beneficial to us, we'll have to respect that. And obviously if they're at a high coupon, we might take a different action, so it'll really depend on the economic situation of the individual deals.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's purely on economics, there's no reputational risk or anything like that that comes into the equation at all?</p>

          <p>I think there is &#x2013; it's hard to talk about reputational risk in the way you described. There's reputational risk if we don't take economically rational actions and so we really need to balance a host of factors.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys, first question is on page 19, on the long-term debt issuance. Can you just remind us the different entities that issue long-term debt? And I think it shows in the footnote that you have Citigroup Inc. and CFI as the two primary issuers. How do you decide on what &#x2013; which entity to issue from and what is it supporting mostly? Is it the broker dealer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, it's Eric, let me tackle that and the two questions you had. The two issuing entities are there in the footnotes as you described. There's Citigroup Inc. and there's Citigroup Funding Inc., so CFI. The general approach that we have taken and moved to over the last couple years is to issue benchmark debt out of Citigroup and the structured debt or structured notes out of CFI just to create good clarity in the investor base as to those types of debt and the issuing entity.</p>
          <p>That said, what happens is that debt is available to support the activities in the parent which has some of the old entities, like the Citi Financial entities, and to support the entities of the dealer, so that debt is then ascribed to different entities, oftentimes on an MIS basis or otherwise. To support those entities the economics are transfer priced into those entities, and it's done in a way that the major entities that we operate are effectively funded and have the right amounts of liquidity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. So the CFI issuance of $1.8 billion is all structured notes?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have the full deduction. As we said in some of the opening comments, that 7.2% is net of 120 basis point deduction from our capital base as a result of the various investments that we've got in unconsolidated financial institutions, such as MSSB and Akbank.</p>

          <p>It's Eric, David. I'll have to check with the exact process, but let me do that, and maybe we can follow up off line. Certainly we prefer to be transparent and very clear about our actions, both positive actions we take and actions we take not to do something. So we'll do the best we can, but let me just check the exact protocol that we have.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other thing you did ask about CFI, there is a minority of debt that we issue in CFI that is not structured and also not benchmark size. So it's not the $750 million or $1 billion deals. That tends to be some of the smaller vanilla deals. Sometimes we put those in CFI because they have been designed as more of a one-off placement or as a one-off deal. It keeps the benchmark debt very clearly at the Citigroup level and some of the more tailored debt in CFI so that you'll see some of those deals as well.</p>

          <p>Secondly, you're still going to be faced with some of the current rules, as far as concentration of deposits in various institutions and I think that certainly in a post-Dodd-Frank world, as you put it, that will even &#x2013; that's something that people will look at with even more vigor than perhaps they've looked at previously.</p>

          <p>Okay. If I could ask a separate questions about how concerned are you gentlemen about a potential increase in risk coming out of Europe? We've got the French elections to be resolved on May 6 and it appears there may be some fiscal, austerity fatigue setting in, not only in maybe France but in other parts of Europe. Do you believe that the overall risk quotient coming out of Europe in let's say the second half or the last three quarters of this year could indeed be poised to increase meaningfully.</p>

          <p>We've been conscious of the risk around Europe for going on two years now and I don't see anything that would cause us to let down our guard, as it were, regarding Europe. It's still very much a situation that needs a lot of work. What we've constantly said is that the Europeans have the ability to handle the situation if they so choose, but this is still an ongoing situation and one that is certainly going to weigh somewhat on the world's economy for a good time yet. So we continue to watch Europe very closely and we manage our risks appropriately.</p>
