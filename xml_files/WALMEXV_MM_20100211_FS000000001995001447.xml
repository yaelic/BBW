          <p>Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. It is a pleasure for me to welcome Scot Rank, now as our President and CEO of Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico. Scot has experience in the consumer and self-service industries of Mexico. He joined Wal-Mart de Mexico in the year of 2000 as the head of Bodegas Aurrera. He was appointed Senior Vice President of the Self-Service in the year 2003, and in 2005 he was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>Under his leadership Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico has grown at an accelerated pace and created two new business formats. These are Bodegas Aurrera and Bodegas Aurrera Express.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rafael. And thank you all for joining us this afternoon. For Wal-Mart de M&#xE9;xico 2009 was an important year in several aspects.</p>
          <p>First we delivered strong results in a difficult economic environment. Secondly we improved our competitive position for the long-term and thirdly we acquired Wal-Mart Centroamerica, expanding our presence to six countries and increasing our profitable growth potential. Sales, operating income, EBITDA and net income for 2009 were the best ever in the history of our company. Sales reached 269 billion pesos; operating income 22 billion pesos, EBITDA 26.9 billion pesos and net income 16.8 billion pesos. Earnings per share reached one peso, 99 centavos and they've increased 130% in the last five years.</p>
          <p>In 2009 our sales growth was remarkable given the very challenging environment that we faced. GDP for the year decreased an estimated 7% in Mexico. While WALMEX same store sales increased 3.4%, and total sales increased 10.4%.</p>
          <p>We also improved on our competitive position for the long-term. Our growth in 2009 compares very favorable with that of the industry. Wal-Mart same store sales for the self-service formats including Sam's grew 3.9%, while same store sales for the industry, as measured by the national retail association or ANTAD, if we exclude WALMEX decreased 1.1%. In the terms of total sales, our self-service formats grew 11.3% compared with the 4.4% growth of the ANTAD excluding WALMEX.</p>
          <p>It was a year when we also gained market share from the informal market, in contrast to what happened in previous crises. We reinforced the personality of our different formats and we strengthened the loyalty of our customers. We centered our commercial strategy in better serving our customers by adapting to their changing needs. The number of customers who visit our stores and restaurants increased 13.8% and 3.3% in comparable-store terms.</p>
          <p>Rafael, will you share the numbers with us please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Scot. As you said, we delivered strong top line growth, which together with our disciplined of constructive search for efficiencies, allowed us for operating income, EBITDA and net income to grow more than sales. Our Retail business increased sales by 10.4% in the year 2009. EBITDA amounted to 28 billion pesos, and represented 10.2% of total income, a growth of 12.8% over the previous year levels.</p>
          <p>Now if we see the consolidated numbers, this is the total business, EBITDA amounted to 27 billion pesos and represented 10% of total income, a growth of 12.7% over the previous year. Earnings per share increased 15.4%. If we see the balance sheet, as always we feel very proud about it. We have in cash, at the end of the year, 19.5 billion pesos. This figure is 72% higher than last year. During the year, the company invested 9.7 billion pesos in fixed assets, repurchased 58.4 million shares for an amount of 2.5 billion pesos. And in March of 2009, we paid a dividend of five billion pesos.</p>
          <p>Our cash generation and strong balance sheet with no debt allow us to continue strongly investing in prices, opening new stores, remodeling existing stores, expanding distribution capabilities, paying dividends and buying back our own shares, always with a long-term vision. Inventory management and financing improved as inventories decreased 1.3% compared to the 10.4% increase in sales and 12.5% increase in accounts payable to suppliers.</p>
          <p>As you know, I always like to comment on profitability. Return on capital employed went from 27% in the year 2008 to 28.1% in the year 2009, while return on equity went from 23.9% to 24.5%. Continuous profitable growth is one of our main priorities. Last year, we increase 10.6% our in store capacity, and at the same time, we increased profitability. This combination is a result of our disciplined approach to growth on our multi-format portfolio, which maximizes both growth and profitability, driving value for all our shareholders.</p>
          <p>If we see the opening during the year, last year we opened 275 stores of our different formats. This is 29 Bodegas Aurrera, 37 Bodega Aurrera, 180 Bodegas Express, 16 Wal-Mart's, seven Sam's, three Superama and three Suburbia. We increased in-store capacity 10.6%. We will be disclosing our 2010 growth program next week at our annual analyst meeting to be held here in Mexico City.</p>
          <p>If we see the bank, last year, we opened 152 branches, 127 of them during the fourth quarter. Our customers can now make deposits, cash withdrawals and verify their balance at over 19,000 checkouts.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to highlight some numbers of the fourth quarter. Total income increased 10.5%, while same-store sales grew 3.8%. General expenses grew only 8.7%. This figure very positively compares to the 10.5% increase in total income and to the 11.2% in average in-store capacity. Now on the other side, Scot, the greater challenge we faced was gross margin. It was 22% versus 22.4% in the year 2008.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, Rafael, gross margin was pressured because we intentionally decided to invest in lower prices in the fourth quarter. We did that in order to increase our price advantage, drive more customers into our stores, increase our performance gap against the rest of the competition and end the year with very clean inventories. Our customers' response to our strategy was very good. Sales were driven by an increase of traffic of 3.8% at comparable stores. Ticket remained flat as a result of our investment in prices.</p>
          <p>We increased the gap in our performance versus the rest of the market. As we commented before, during 2009 our sales growth compared very favorable with that of the industry as measured by ANTAD. The difference in same-store sales growth was 500 basis points. During December, that difference increased to 580 basis points as our self-service formats increased same-store sales 3.9% versus a decrease of 1.9% for the rest of the industry, excluding WALMEX.</p>
          <p>Another benefit of our strategy was to end the year with efficient inventory levels. Our inventories decreased 1.3% versus last year, while sales grew 10.5%. Inventory days decreased from 28.7 in 2008 to 25.7 in 2009. This will benefit the first quarter of 2010, as we have already seen in January 2010 with a solid 5.5% same-store sales growth.</p>
          <p>Now Rafael will make some additional comments before ending this presentation.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Scot. I want to remind you that we will be hosting our sixth annual analyst meeting here in Mexico City, this is next week. And this year we will have the first store tour in Central America followed by our annual meeting on the 18th. Management presentations on the 18th will be webcasted and will be available at the company's website.</p>
          <p>I would like also to inform you that during today's Board of Director's meeting, it was decided to call for the annual shareholders meeting here in Mexico City on March 11, 2010. During that meeting, a proposal will be presented to pay a dividend of 0.70 Mexican pesos per share. This would be equivalent to 35% of the year 2009 net earnings. With this, we are now ending our webcast regarding the fourth quarter results. Thank you again, and we will be available to receive any calls with questions that you may have. Thank you very much.</p>
