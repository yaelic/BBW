        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. This is Caroline. Welcome to your ING's Fourth Quarter 2009 Conference Call.</p>
          <p>Before handing this conference call over to Jan Hommen, Chief Executive Officer of ING Group, Patrick Flynn, Chief Financial Officer, and Koos Timmermans, Chief Risk Officer, let me first say that any forward-looking statements in today's comments are subject to a number of current views, assumptions and variables including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, movements in security markets including equity markets and underlying economic conditions and changes. These are set out in greater detail in our public filings, which we would urge you to read.</p>
          <p>The realization of forward-looking statements could be materially altered by unexpected movements in any or all of these and other variables. Good morning Jan, Patrick and Koos. Jan, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for being on the call. This call will last an hour and a half, I think we have said. And we'll do a quick introduction of the numbers because you probably have seen the numbers already. We do a quick presentation, you can follow that. I think the presentation is on the web. And then we open it up for questions.</p>
          <p>Now ING has emerged stronger, I am on slide number two, has emerged stronger and a more efficient Company from 2009. And when you look at Back to Basics, we over-delivered on all of our objectives. We paid back half of the capital injection made by the state, which I think was an important turning point for us. Our priority is operational separation of the Bank and the Insurance Company in 2010 and to be able to create two strong businesses that can stand alone by themselves and have a good future going forward.</p>
          <p>In Q4, I would say the trend in commercial performance continued. It was positive again. Market conditions have improved but we still had impairments and revaluations that have continued at a substantial level. We took a one-off provision for the deposit guarantee systems scheme in Netherlands following the failure of the DSB Bank. That's included in our bank numbers.</p>
          <p>And on balance, we report an underlying profit of 74 million. Shareholders' equity increased to &#x20AC;8.95 per share and all our capital ratios have improved.</p>
          <p>Then I go to page three. You see the deliverables on the Back to Basics program. Well all the targets were met. The target for cost reduction was set at 1 billion originally, increased that to 1.3 and ultimately we achieved 1.505 billion.</p>
          <p>Also, we reduced our balance sheet by 18%, the target was 10. Reduced the leverage, we now have 27.8. And the number of people reduction was 11,000 people. So we have become a more efficient Company. We have become a less risky Company and we have become a much less leveraged enterprise.</p>
          <p>A substantial reduction in expenses on page number four, significant reduction. The total Back to Basics 1.5 but what's in there is a structural improvement of 1.2 billion and about 2.81 &#x2013; 281 million are one-offs releases mainly, so they may not show up again in the years to come. We continue to be very vigilant on cost and we'll continue to have projects to make sure that our costs will stay in line and will not increase.</p>
          <p>Provision for deposit guarantee scheme for the DSB is recorded under operating expense as are also the impairments on Real Estate development project which is somewhat distorting for presenting the right picture here, certainly for the Commercial Bank.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I think I am satisfied with the progress we have made to improve the efficiency, and we continue to look for ways to reduce costs and streamline our processes under the One Bank project that we have in the retail business. And also in the Insurance organization in the Netherlands and we look at performance improvement initiatives of the project we stalled that we have started in our Insurance organization.</p>
          <p>On page number five, you see the balance sheet reduction, 18%, yeah that's a significant reduction and you see it explained what the contributions have been. I don't want to pay attention to that now maybe you want to come back on that.</p>
          <p>On page number six, you see the slide where we show what we are doing to prepare for the separation of the Insurance organization. We have formed a team that is in a very orderly fashion, dealing with that, a very diligent team. It's a project that I think will take probably a year to accomplish.</p>
          <p>Preliminary analyses are showing that we have about five countries where we have significant entanglement issues, significant integration levels, where we need to work on and then about 10 to 15 that have medium integration and about 35 countries where there are no entanglement issues at all.</p>
          <p>We have separate work streams organized who are analyzing what needs to be done for operational separation including HR and finance and Brands and Option IT distribution and facilities. And the aim is that we are done by the end of the year, that we finish this project by the end of the year. But the actual timing of the divestment project will then be more or less depending upon the markets and the market conditions and the improvements we can secure in our operating performance.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier we are not in rush, I don't feel any pressure here at this moment, no time pressure, we have plenty of time to do this. And we plan to use the coming two years to improve significantly the operating performance of our Insurance organization and to optimize the portfolio so that when we go to market with our Insurance business, that we are in a position to extract the best possible value for investors. And meanwhile, it is business as usual. We are managing our Company, our employees and management is focused on delivering quality products and good services to our customers.</p>
          <p>Slide number seven, you see the underlying profit. Significant improvement compared with Q4 last year. It's a small profit, but yeah, it had an impact with the provision for DNB (sic) [DSB] as well as the special loss provision that was made at the end of Q4 for the Insurance organization.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight, you see the Commercial results. Commercial performance improved strongly in 2009, supported by cost reductions and improved margins at the Bank. The pre-provision profit before market impacts reached 8.8 billion in 2009, again a significant improvement over 2008, where we scored 7 billion.</p>
          <p>On slide number nine, you see the Commercial performance delivered by &#x2013; on the Bank side. On the top, that result was 1.8 billion for the total year that brought the total to 7.4 billion. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, an 81% improvement mainly as a result of cost savings, but also better margins and strong results in our Financial Markets operation. Insurance, Commercial result was 296 million, for a total for the full year of 1.4 billion and the results were 5% better than a year &#x2013; a year ago, mainly as a result of cost savings.</p>
          <p>In Q3 &#x2013; compared to Q3 there was a decline but that's due to the increase in operating expense and lower non-life results in the Benelux.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10, you see the increase in shareholders' equity. We jumped shareholders' equity from 17.3 billion to 33.9, so a significant increase. The by-the-book value now is &#x20AC;8.95 and the tangible net asset value per share is &#x20AC;8.14.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows the capital ratios. All our capital ratios have improved. The core Tier-1 ratio went up to 7.8%. The Tier-1 ratio at 10.2. The debt leverage in the Group was brought down to 12.4 and Insurance is now below the 10% level, 9.7 as a result of the sale of the Australian joint venture, which the proceeds we used to reduce to the debt level.</p>
          <p>And now let me turn it over to Patrick who will tell you more about the results of the Company.  Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.  Slide 13, we have the key highlights of the results by ING. I will not read through these individually but I'll come back to summary at the end. As Jan said, 2009 was a tumultuous year, a year where ING has significantly strengthened its balance sheet, reduced costs. And on slide 14, I think you can see that coming through the financial results. The underlying net result for the full year, profit 748 million, which compared to a loss of 304 in the prior year, a turnaround of a billion. That turnaround is even more marked when you look at it quarter-on-quarter. Fourth quarter 2009, small profit of 74 million compared to a 3.1 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Overall, the net result is a loss of 935 million, however, I think it's worth pointing out that that includes the 930 million post-tax cost of the settlement on the IABF Alt-A arrangement that was mandated with the EC if you exclude that we were at breakeven.</p>
          <p>Going forward to slide 16 where we talk about the Bank results. Jan mentioned the strong Commercial result, 1.8 billion, a little bit lower than the third quarter primarily due to lower seasonal results in our Financial Markets business.</p>
          <p>Couple of points to bring out on this slide, impairments and debt securities still a chunky number 272 million, however, it's significantly lower than the third quarter, where we had 664. We signaled that Alt-A impairments would decline and they done. The residual mark-to-market now is only 150 million. So I think this is a positive that we should see continuing lower Alt-A impairments going forward.</p>
          <p>Real estate revaluations are at a similar level to the third quarter as our loan loss provisions. And Koos will give you more insight on that subject in his presentation that comes later.</p>
          <p>The other key impact as Jan mentioned, was we took a charge for DSB, namely the failure of DSB and our contribution to the deposit guarantee scheme in the fourth quarter which combined brought the results, underlying before tax to 132 million.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slide 17, interest margins. ING's interest margins have stayed strong at 141 basis points, which compares to 140 in the prior quarter. There's some improvement in retail deposit margins where deposits levels in the Netherlands reduced 25 basis points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, lower short-term rates curtailed ING Direct's margin four basis points. We have also given you a sensitivity here, 100 basis point shift upward in the yield curve, would cost approximately seven basis points.</p>
          <p>On the subject of funding again, deposits moving forward to 18. ING has a strong loan-to-deposit ratio and that further improved in the quarter. It is now at 106%, improving from 108. We're fundamentally funding our commercial loans with commercial deposits. Loan levels remained largely flat in the quarter whereas deposits grew somewhat, which led to the strengthening in this ratio.</p>
          <p>Slide 19, we look at the banking business lines. Key point here is that compared to our prior year we have improved significantly across the board, with the exception of real estate.</p>
          <p>Retail Banking results of 421 million in the quarter are five times that of the preceding quarter 2008. It's down from the third quarter '09 primarily due to higher loan loss charges in the quarter, albeit our retail interest margin has improved successively each quarter this year.</p>
          <p>ING Direct, a loss of 177 million is lower than the preceding quarter. That's due to lower Alt-A impairments, which I referred to earlier. In addition, we took a realized loss of 83 million on selective de-risking of some prime RMBSs. This helped reduce our RWAs by 7 billion.</p>
          <p>Commercial Banking, on the right hand side, top of the slide. Profit of 379 million, down 200 compared to prior quarter again was driven to &#x2013; by the lower seasonal effects I mentioned earlier. And Real Estate, similar number as impairment levels remained at the levels we saw in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to Insurance on slide 21. Commercial results, 296, broadly in line with the third quarter's slightly down. However, the underlying result the net of 47 million. And we had a 551 million profit in the prior quarter. The key thing here is we updated our lapse assumptions in respect of guaranteed variable annuity products to reflect lower customer lapse experience. This is an annual assumption review we undertook in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Other points here, as we mentioned in the third quarter we had a number of positive realized gains which helped boost the number in the third quarter whereas this did not continue to the same degree in the fourth. Another point that I'd like to draw out here, which is a small number, 45 million, on equity hedge costs. It was a much higher number in the past and these hedges are running off so this cost will decline further.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 I think, gives you a more what I would call a more meaningful representation of the Insurance business. Preceding slide makes it look more volatile than it really is. Here we see on slide 22 that our Insurance operating income, partly stable improved somewhat from the preceding quarter. Admin expenses are slightly up, which meant that the life operating results reduced 20 million. The effect of the non &#x2013; the volatile items I referred to earlier is &#x2013; are summarized in the line at the bottom, non-operating volatile items. So the core Insurance result is partly stable and generating 456 million.</p>
          <p>Moving forward to slide 23, underlying results before tax by region. For the three operating regions excluding corporate line, the results all show an improvement compared to the fourth quarter '08. Insurance Europe profit 234 million, it's down compared to the third quarter, primarily due to impairments we took on hybrid capital instruments in which we have invested following EC restructuring of those companies.</p>
          <p>Insurance Americas is down to 14 million driven mainly by the variable annuity assumption change and some further impairments in RMBS and CMBS. Insurance Asia Pacific lost 29 million, is almost exclusively due to the 190 million element of the lapse assumption change related to VAs in Japan.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 shows the sales numbers. These are down on the preceding quarter, albeit we had an increase in VAs in Europe.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, we give you further an update on the Insurance capital structure. Key points to note here on page 25, is that equity is improved from 15 to 16 billion, partly due to an injection of capital and profit and disposal of our Australia business. This represents and demonstrates our continued full commitment to boosting our capital position in Insurance. We also give you a breakdown below of the distribution of the net assets by country.</p>
          <p>So in summary before I pass on to Koos, results for ING have improved to a profit for the full year of 748 million. In the Bank, the strong interest margin helped sustain revenues, albeit we were knocked back by the impact of DSB on real estate charges in the quarter. Hence, we posted a pre-tax profit of 132 million. Insurance results were primarily hampered by the annual assumption change in respect of variable annuities. But our insurance equity has increased to 15.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I'll now hand you over to Koos, who will take you through the risk section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, all of you. First on the risk front, and what I'll do is I'll update you on the sovereign exposure. We'll go through the loan loss provisioning part. We'll take you through Alt-A, what impairments have been taken and what is left. We also &#x2013; I'll give you some insight on the Real Estate part, both the investment part as well as the developments and then finally we'll go through the RWAs. But let us first start with the government.</p>
          <p>On page 28, what you see is our total exposures and then let me first start on the left-hand side we have for the Bank and the Insurance Company and the investment portfolio of 212 billion. And out of 212 billion there is 88 billion of governments. And if we then zoom in on certain exposures and then particularly, I'd like to go to Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain then what you see in fact is that the total of that is 4% of this portfolio. So in other words, we have in Greek &#x2013; we have 3 billion, we have in Spain 3 billion and we have in Portugal 1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>If you look at that exposure, this is all part of our investment portfolio. So it is available for sale and what we have seen at year-end this portfolio, if I only zoom in on Portugal, Spain and Greece was valued at zero and it declined to minus 0.2 billion in our re-val reserve on the 9th of February. So that is a bit the price effect. What I want to say with that is, overall the exposure is not that high and the results will be reflected more in the revaluation reserve of the Bank.</p>
          <p>If we move from the investments in the governments, let us first do a quick overview of the general account of the Insurance Company before we move to the loan book and go to the Bank. On page 29, I give you a quick snapshot of the general account of the Insurance Company. In total that's 152 billion. What you see in there is a significant amount of government bonds. That is what you see in the wheel, the 41 billion, which is a reflection of the de-risking. We also see that if I look at the rating and I add up everything with the rating from AAA to BBB you see that 95% of the portfolio is at investment grade.</p>
          <p>Overall, if you look at it, the revaluation reserve of the debt securities there, it improved over the year 2009 significantly. It improved by 5.9 billion to minus 2.3 billion at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Point of issue is the CMBS portfolio, which is in there. Yes, we have high credit enhancement in there and yes, the debt service capacity ratio that stayed at 1.6 so there is no deterioration there. Nevertheless, on some parts of that portfolio we have taken small impairment there. Overall, the view there is that underlying what we have seen is some deterioration. Prices however have gone up so that might lead that we might sell some parts of that portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we move from the general account of the Insurance Company to the risk cost of the Bank and then we are page 30. What you see there is that the addition to the loan losses is 96 basis points and that is the net number. What you see there as well is that in essence, we had quite a lot of releases, 38 basis points and why is that? It's just secondary markets for our distressed paper are better so that means like you sell at better prices than what we have provisioned for.</p>
          <p>Also what you see is the early restructuring deals which have been done. Well, those ones are done and that normally leads to some releases as well. Total stock of provisions, it's at 4.4 billion at the year-end. If you look at going forward what we see there well basically in the early 2010, we see it moving around at the levels of second half of '09.</p>
          <p>We move from the loan losses, let us look at the sectors, which contributed in there. And that is what you see on page 31. You see that the high contributors are still the structured finance although it is less than the last year's and the U.S. mortgages with 114 and 156. But what you also see is that right now the increase is a bit more in the SME side. Mid-corp and SME and you see the decrease more in the general lending products. And so that is on the net basis what you see happening in the loan loss provision front. So the dynamics are that the large corps is a bit less, the mid-corps is a bit higher and at the moment still, the U.S. mortgage is ongoing.</p>
          <p>If we move from the loan losses to the non-performing loans then let us first look at the commercial loan book and that is on page 32. What you see there is again the non-performing loans are slightly lower than, on average, than in the third quarter. Where you see lower well-structured finance, it's a bit on the real estate finance because some files have been restructured. But you see a bit the increase in the mid-corps and the SMEs.</p>
          <p>Overall net-net, it's a lower number. If we go from the commercial loan book to the mortgages, and the mortgages are on page 33, then you see basically the NPL that is staying at 1.3% where the increase is in the U.S. mortgages to 4.7%. So a slight increase, but at the same time, if you look at Dutch mortgages and if you see delinquencies, the 30 days or you see the delinquencies in the 90 days, it's still staying stable.</p>
          <p>If we go from mortgages to the Alt-A portfolio, Alt-A, you see on page 34. Basically there's a few things to note. Relatively over 2009, we have seen quick pre-payments. So that means like the overall portfolio has gone down, and which led also to the Dutch government pre-paying our loan to them quick. But if we zoom in on our position in that portfolio, what you see is that over Q4 we have taken a 324 million pre-tax impairment based on a 150 million credit loss and that means that right now what is in portfolio is there is in total 150 million of negative re-val reserve left.</p>
          <p>Overall what we have seen is still delinquencies moving up from 24.1 to 25.9. So the increase of delinquencies is less. Prices have actually of the Alt-A bonds, have increased. So prices increased and slightly less deterioration of the underlying. That is basically what we have seen on the Alt-A part.</p>
          <p>If we look at &#x2013; if we go from Alt-A to the Real Estate investment side and that is on page 35, what you see there overall is that the Real Estate investment portfolio. So that is the Canada exposure plus it is the seed capital in the funds in both the Bank and the Insurance Company. Overall you see that the portfolio, which is revalued through P&amp;L, is declining. The total value right now is 7.7 billion. It is declining first because values have declined but also because we had a sale in the fourth quarter of 0.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Net-net if you take that sale of the 0.8 billion out of the fourth quarter then you see a bit of a stabilization happening there. Now, why is there a stabilization? You could overall say that the yields with which you discount cash flows are kind of stabilizing around 7%. Nevertheless, the rental income and the expectations of rental income are still declining. So what you have seen over this year is quarter-by-quarter a bit lower downward valuations of the Real Estate portfolio with a lesser speed. So that is what we in a nutshell see on the rime side, on the investment side.</p>
          <p>If we go to the Real Estate development part and that is on page 36, there we have taken a significant impairment in the fourth quarter. Now on the Real Estate development part, the total portfolio, the 2.3 billion there, the impairment in Q4 has been relatively large ,which is also because we went through each of the individual projects there and took decisions to exit more projects than at the fourth quarter. And if you exit it, then at a certain moment you need to move from a going concern to a sales value.</p>
          <p>Overall, what we see there on the Real Estate development part is that over the next year, still you will see downward valuations of Real Estate affecting the portfolio. But Q4 really was a bit an IR exception, because we had seriously gone through a lot of projects and made that exit.</p>
          <p>If we move from the Real Estate development part to the risk weighted assets and then we're on page 37. We started this year with 343 billion of RWAs. In essence what you see is that we had a 10% credit migration, so you could say that is the Basel pro-cyclicality, which is for ABSs and for the other one. Then what you see happening is we took a lot of mitigating actions. And what are the mitigating actions? We reduced balance sheet and remember we did not invest bonds in ING Direct. We also had the facility with the Dutch state and selectively we have sold some ABSs and that actually brought our total RWAs down at the end of the year as compared to the starting of the year. So in essence, you could say that is one thing, which was particularly helpful as well in making sure that our core Tier-1 secure &#x2013; our core Tier-1 ratio improved.</p>
          <p>You see that also particularly if you highlight then from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, third quarter we were 337. We do get credit risk migration. At the same time, we sold for instance, part of our U.S. prime RMBSs and that resulted in 7 billion RWAs less. And why is that so? Because what we sold and that is what you see on the bottom left hand side, what we've sold is the lower rated tranches of the ABSs. And there you can with a relatively modest hit on your earnings, you can release a serious amount of RWAs. So that is what we have done.</p>
          <p>So concluding on a nutshell, loan loss provisions kind of stable at the second quarter or the second half of the year levels. Revaluation Alt-A small amount left. If you look at the rime, so the investment portfolio, decline is slowing down. If you look at the red, the development part, it increased, but specifically in Q4, but still that is a more concerning portfolio for the year 2010. And if you look at RWAs, I think that is managed. So that concludes the risk part.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Koos. Let me summarize and then we have a page 40 &#x2013; what is it? Page 40. The letters are getting very small for me. Here we list our priorities for the year 2010. Of course the number one is to make sure that we do a very good separation of the Bank and Insurance organization operationally complete by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we need to improve the performance of our Insurance operations in order to maximize value once we do the divestiture program. And we have a project here under the leadership of Tom McInerney, the Mistral project where we bring together all type of ideas to improve our operations.</p>
          <p>The third one is to make sure that we maintain the engagement of our employees while we are working on the separation process and I think we have taken a lot of steps already. But it's important to be vigilant and we would like to see the engagement scores as we every year have for employees that they go up this year, even though the circumstances may be difficult I think the leadership needs to be able to do so.</p>
          <p>And number four is to make sure that our customers are happy. In particular we have a new initiative the Net Promoter Score that we are rolling out in our retail business. We expect a lot of that.</p>
          <p>Number five is we want to be a good citizen.</p>
          <p>Number six, we need to take another look at our portfolio. We always do that but also again this year certainly when we prepare for the separation, do we have all the right businesses to go forward with and how can we make sure we do.</p>
          <p>And then the last one is, we will be vigilant and continue to be vigilant on cost and further improve our efficiency. So this is a year of transition. A lot of groundwork is being laid for a successful future, but I also see it as a &#x2013; as a year of opportunity, where we are redefining our future and we're defining the future of two very interesting businesses of our Company.</p>
          <p>So having said that, we have until 10:30 to answer your questions. So, let's start immediately and give you the floor.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Mr. Duncan Russell [JPMorgan].  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Okay, so first question. Good morning, first. First question is, you were talking at the start about the disentanglement process and how that would take a year until you do the whole thing. I was just wondering of those projects you identified, I think you said in 20 something projects or something like that, could you tell us for the U.S. specifically whether that was one of the business units where you've got a lot of disentanglement to do or whether there is not much disentanglement to do. So could you identify how much is for the U.S. subsidiary of the Insurance business? And specifically please, that's the first question. Second question then is on the variable annuity adjustments, so the policy-holder behavior. Could you give any sort of indication on what sort of assumptions you are making now? So for example, how much of policies which are 20% in the money you assume. And then just some sort of reference of policies, which were in the money and their resulting lapse and assumption and anything you could give that would be useful versus current experience and versus past experience. And that was it actually. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Duncan, I will do the first one. And then I send Tom or Matt Rider who we have will do, Matt is our new Board member on Insurance, will do the second one. On the disentanglement, very simple, there is none. There is &#x2013; it's all completely separate and there will be no disentanglement issues in the U.S. so that's a pretty straightforward easy country. Matt, you will do the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So on the VA assumption changes, what we've done is had a look and we do this routinely by the way on all our products, is look at the experience that we have been seeing over the last several quarters and we make those adjustments during the course of the year. Now on the VA specifically in the U.S., what we were seeing is some credible evidence to suggest that for contracts that were significantly in the money we were seeing lower lapse behavior than was originally anticipated &#x2013; credible evidence led us to making the change that we did in the U.S. and then we did similar actions in Japan. Now I am reluctant to give one single number in terms of the lapse assumptions, mainly because we do this on the basis of how much the thing is in the money. It varies by policy duration and so on. So I think it would be inappropriate to give a single number on this. Just to maybe leave you with the message that every time we do one of these assumption changes, we try to get to back to the middle of the road and that's where we stand now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to be clear, the assumption change, does that take it down to what you are currently seeing? So you factored in the current kind of economic environment, the markets, et cetera. Or have you assumed again, are you somewhere between what it used to be and what it is currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like I said, we take a middle of the road estimate, looking very much forward to where we think the &#x2013; to where we think the economy and the markets are going to be. So it's not like we take it down to immediately the experience that we see, but we take a prudent number and we get back to the middle of the road.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if lapses used to be, I don't know, 10% or something. What have you assumed now? <mark type="inaudible" /> portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's why I say it's very difficult to give a single number in this regard because it varies by how much it's in the money, how much &#x2013; what policy duration and so on. So we're not going to give that information out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from Spencer Horgan [Deutsche Bank]. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two things please, first one is obviously you referred to the 1.5 billion of cost savings you've made in 2009, and you said you are going to continue to focus on it in 2010. I wondered if you might dare to put some sort of number on it for 2010. And then the second question is I think you touched on this, but I didn't quite get it. There seems to be an equity injection into the Insurance Company down from the Holding Company. Could you just explain exactly what's going on there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll do the first one and Patrick will do the second one. The 1 billion cost reduction, yes, we secured that one and we will continue to work on further cost reductions. I give you a few examples where we are working on. There is project going in Retail Netherlands, that's already a project for two or three years, that still will have benefits when we complete the next phase. But now in the third phase of the project that will have additional benefits going forward. And then we have the One Bank idea. As you probably know, we have put our Retail Bank, Commercial Bank and ING Direct under one leadership, one management team and one balance sheet. And we have already secured a number of benefits here, but there are still more to come. Then we have Insurance. We are merging in the Netherlands the back offices of our European activities in the Benelux. And in Eastern Europe, we are integrating and doing a back office integration of our Eastern European activities. So all these things and then in the U.S. we continue to look at further opportunities to reduce our costs. So these are all programs ongoing. We have them individually listed, we have not made a let's say big number other than. These are individual project, but it shows that we have a continued attention for further reducing our costs. Patrick.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in respect of the insurance equity, what we did was following the rights issue, we injected 550 million equity into the insurance holding company. And we also used profits, part of the profit on the disposal of Australia, New Zealand to fund a 1 billion reduction in hybrid. So we increased equity and used that to reduce hybrids, which have come down from 4 billion to 3 billion.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Farquhar Murray. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Farquhar Murray from Autonomous Research here. Just two questions, if I may. Firstly just starting with kind of Basel III. I mean a couple of, well one peer in particular has kind of highlighted some numbers in terms of that Basel III tier-1 ratio and their kind of net stable funding ratio. And I just wondered whether you now might be able to give some color around those as well. And then secondly just coming back on the variable annuity assumption changes. Could I just clarify, I mean if lapses stay at that current level that you saw towards the latter end of last year, can I take it that you would actually have an incremental charge in the next 12 months? And then also I mean what are the macro dynamics of these lapse assumption changes and could we see recoveries in certain markets in REOs? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Koos, you want to deal with ratios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you, Farquhar, if you look at the Basel III, then I think what most of you know is that the components, which are in there like the DTAs and everything else. I mean, you know, we are a modest user of that. So from that angle, you could argue like our capital ratio is above average or below average hit, then I would say it is below average. Nevertheless, still some rules are uncertain and the question is like what will be grandfathered as well in terms of hybrids or not. So I find it a bit uncertain to make a definite conclusion on this right now. And we have to await the quantitative impact study, but overall, so far, so fine, but we must see first the rule set in stone before we know.</p>
          <p>If you look at the stable funding ratio, it's a little bit similar. I mean the rules which are there for liquidity, are rules which are applied already for a long time in the Netherlands. So in that sense, we are following these kind of liquidity rules or similar type of rules already for I think, since 1996.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the issue there is that the devil is in detail because there is still some uncertainty on what kind of liquidity do you need to hold for a certain type of demand deposit from customers and also what kind of assets are eligible. And between the most harsh and the most lenient part, well, you can drive a truck in between those assumptions. So that is what it makes it a little bit difficult to come to a conclusion there. And so overall, we are watching that carefully but at the same time it does not lead to taking an immediate action right now in the Company. I mean, we first must see the quantitative impact study.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Farquhar  maybe &#x2013; this is Matt Rider. Maybe I take the VA assumption changes again. So I think your question is, if sort of markets stay the same, are we looking at incremental hits to the P&amp;L as a consequence of the assumption changes and the answer is no. And in fact, what we should see is that the impact as we come out of the crisis a bit should be a bit more positive. The change that we have actually made is the lapse rate only for contracts which are in the money. So as we emerge from the crisis and we see that contracts become less in the money, then we should see some improvement here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-on with that, I mean, you kind of suggested that the lapse change hadn't taken it to the current level of behavior that you're seeing. I mean, if markets were just stable and lapses stayed as they were, would we see a charge at the end of the year, is my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the charge would come as a consequence of if there was any further review of the lapse data and we saw something moving about, then we would obviously take that into consideration but at this moment, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from Christopher Hitchings [Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods]. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much indeed. Couple of issues, some follow-ons from before. Can I just, looking, on the VA assumptions, you have &#x2013; are these mostly, I mean these are where guarantees are in the money so that presumably their policies sold relatively recently. And now you introduce some very new products that try to increase or reduce lapse rates last year. Are any of those involved? Just on from that, I know you haven't updated your meta-value. You were going to move to MCEV and disclose it later. But have you made any changes for those lapse assumptions in your new business assumptions? What is in the fact? I mean, are you selling VA new business now? What &#x2013; under the new products, when are they coming in? Secondly, in terms of the development assumptions the, sorry, the development provisions in Banking, can you give us some handle on what types of developments are being provisioned and on what basis? And your warning that there could be more of these to come, again can you give us some handle on that? Finally, third question is on the bid &#x2013; does the timing of the sale of Insurance depend anything on the appeal you are launching against the EU Commission and what is the &#x2013; what's the issues facing that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Chris we &#x2013; on the first one I think will be for Matt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Chris, so &#x2013; yeah, Chris, just thinking about what products this has impacted, it is the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit that we have sold in past years and this an area where we do have a lot of credible experience at this point and that's why we've reflected the assumption changes. On the more recently sold LifePay Plus withdrawal benefits, we are not seeing credible experience at this point so there is no reason to change any of our assumptions. What we typically do is make sure that when we price new product, we take into account the best estimate of what we think future experience is going to be, depending on whether it is or depending on whether it's in the money or out of the money or policy duration and so on. I think at this point I'd turn it over to Tom and he'll talk about recent sales and then rollout of new product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes certainly, Christopher. You've seen us in 2009 significantly reduce the sales of VAs in the U.S. and now we've ceased sales in Japan. We are in the process of getting final regulatory approvals for the new VA product and so that product as I have mentioned in the past, will have no roll-up increase. It's basically a return on premium although it will have an annual ratchet. And the only funds that will be provided would be index funds. So it's clearly a lower risk product. In addition, it's lower cost to the consumer because instead of paying our upfront commissions, we will pay a trail commission over time. So that allows us to reduce the &#x2013; because of the lower guarantee and the reduced commissions upfront, allows us to reduce the price. So that product should be available for sale some time in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Koos, I think the development. You referred to development expense on Real Estate, hey? So, Koos, you want to elaborate on that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure, Chris, if you look at development what we are doing there is you have three phases. You have research, you have some land purchase and then you move into construction. Normally, the way how you do it is you move to construction as well if a project is at a certain moment, pre-let. That is the business model of development. What we have done in the fourth quarter is we have said like well, on some of these and then we looked at some countries and some projects, we said well, some of these we are going to exit. And then it means like you depreciate down all your or you impair all your research costs which you activated on your balance sheet and that led to a sort of a one-off higher amount of impairments in Q4 which is not representative for 2010. Nevertheless if you ask like, what do you expect over 2010? Still you could expect some shortages or some cuts on rental income and therefore projects overall being less profitable. So it is not that I can say like with Q4 impairments we are completely done. Nevertheless you know the Q4 was a bit higher, because we really went with the dust comb through all the project and decided to exit a few.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, just on that, could you give us any figures like for example what your research &#x2013; what the research budget or component of your asset is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I don't have the precise breakdown here. I can say that if I look at the impairment in Q4, a significant impairment was taken on some land positions, which we had.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

So we expect to get some answers on a relatively short basis. We cannot be precise because we don't know. It's in the hands of the courts. But I think at this moment, Chris, I am not really planning to do a sale or we are not really planning to do a sale of the insurance activities any day soon. We have time. I think we want to use the time well. We want to make sure we have the performance at the level that we want it to be. And we also want to make sure that markets are there in order to do the right transaction, so, no, not necessarily connected to the EC appeal.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, it's Frank Stoffel from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just a few questions please. On your U.S. mortgage non-performing loans, that actually I think increased by 9% in the fourth quarter. Could you please just elaborate on when do you expect this to stabilize and whether there was anything you could elaborate on what has happened actually in Q4? Then the underlying growth and risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter was actually 10%, as Koos has mentioned. Sorry, I couldn't find a comparable number for the third or the second quarter, if you could please provide some, that'd be great.</p>
          <p>Then you just indicated a shortfall in the U.S. insurance reserve, a 90% confidence level surplus at 50% confidence level. Can we just &#x2013; does it signify or should &#x2013; does this mean that we should not necessarily anticipate that this means a reserve increase is on the agenda in the U.S. over the next couple of quarters? Then on the Banking underlying result of 1.8 billion, could you please comment how the re-pricing of the particularly of the commercial loan book, went on in the fourth quarter? Are you happy with what you have achieved? How do the new margins compare what you've got in the third quarter? And lastly, the net deferred tax asset in the bank, I think it was 3.8 billion at the end of 2008. I think you've commented that you expect this to come down significantly in 2009. Do you have a number that you can provide us with, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well a lot of questions. I would suggest we limit it to three going forward, otherwise we may run into trouble. The first question, Koos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Frank, if you look at the total amount of non-performing loans in the mortgages, yeah, it moved up by 9%. But let's make a difference between percent and percentage points because it moved from 4.3 to 4.7%. So that is what the increase has been. And I cannot say I mean underlying overall this is still sort of in line, to be honest, with prime fixed mortgages what you see and significantly lower than prime ARM. So if you ask me like, is it kind of bottoming out already? Then the answer is no, and I don't &#x2013; well, I don't know. I only see on Alt-A that the amount of delinquency, for instance, is leveling off. But on the mortgage market here, I find that difficult to see that at this moment. But the increase is, yeah, in that sense, more modest. If you go to the next point on the risk-weighted asset increase, what I said is that in total year-over-year if you look at ABSs and the loan portfolio, the total increase in RWAs has been 10% for the year in Q4. If you annualize the number, it has been 7%. <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may be worthwhile to go through just a recap of what we've disclosed here with respect to reserve adequacy in the Americas. So what we've disclosed is at basically at year-end 2009, we see that the net liability provisions for Insurance Americas became insufficient by about &#x20AC;1.6 billion at that 90% confidence level. And that's an important one to understand that, you have to recognize that that test is significantly more conservative than using the best estimate reserve adequacy approach that would be commonly employed among other U.S. insurance companies for instance.</p>
          <p>So but if you look down at the 50th percentile our confidence level, again at the Americas level the net liability provisions are more than sufficient at something like &#x20AC;1.8 billion. And I think we've disclosed that. Now a lot of the cause for that reserve adequacy issue is coming from the U.S. and specifically the variable annuity, the variable annuity business, the closed block. At this point, the deterioration is really largely a consequence of modeling improvements that we have done as well as assumption changes as well as the impact of the &#x2013; we had some losses on the capital hedge that we had earlier in the year and that's impacting the reserve adequacy. So at the 90th percentile level, the block becomes a bit more sensitive to changes in equity and interest rate markets. But what happens is that the impact on sort of a best estimate or 50th percentile level is actually much less. So what we do is we go from this about a 600 million inadequacy to about a 900 million inadequacy over the course of the year. And again we disclose that.</p>
          <p>So you asked a specific question about, would we be increasing reserves or something in the course of the year? And I want to address that very specifically. So right now we are addressing many, many different alternatives to improve the reserve adequacy situation. Importantly, you have to look at this in the context of the financial markets. And we are in fact doing that. Certainly, if the financial markets were to underperform say, in the coming quarters and years then that would probably have an influence in the &#x2013; influence on the actions that we might take, let's say to improve the adequacy at what would then be sort of a deteriorating position at the 50th percentile level. But we're not there yet. So as we begin to emerge from the financial crisis, what you are going to see is rising equity markets and in general the interest rate rises together with lower volatility. I think are really going to help that situation. Now there are obviously things that &#x2013; things that we could do to improve this. We could write-off DAC or increase reserves or restrict positive DAC unlocking or something like that or even zero out profits like we did in Taiwan. But anything that we would do in that way would require a change to our actually our own accounting policy. And that would be something that we would &#x2013; that would be an action that we would need to take that obviously we would need to give you heads-up on. So right now, we're not anticipating that.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the question related to the re-pricing of loan, the loan book. What we are seeing is that the loans that are &#x2013; are due and being re-priced, were done let's say three, four years ago, they're being re-priced at a higher level. But at the same time, we see that the pricing is becoming a little bit over the top. So we don't see this &#x2013; the increases anymore. It is becoming stable to a bit more competitive, let's say. And Patrick, you take the deferred tax.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning gentlemen, three questions. First of all, on the lapses as I understand that is really based on experience that compared to past your lapses will be slightly less than you have issued so far, is that correct I understand? Secondly on the DSB portfolio, could you a little bit elaborate on the level of charge you have taken there because in the market, there were quite wide range of assumptions with respect to in terms of loss for on DSB ranging from 500 million to 1 billion. Could you a little bit elaborate on which number you were taking as a base for your calculation? And last, on the Real Estate, the non-performing loans has declined. But this story mainly due to restructuring. Could you a little bit elaborate what's excluding restructuring the NPL would have to develop in Real Estate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think the first question was on the lapses again. So, what we're doing is we're looking at our past experience to try to project future policy-holder behavior into the future. And what we've seen is lower lapse rates specifically on contracts with benefits that are in the money and that's the change that we've made for going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay question on DSB, we are not disclosing the number. It's still a preliminary estimate. To help you, your numbers are way too high &#x2013; 500 to a billion. Let me give you a little hint <mark type="inaudible" />. It is less than 200 million but I don't going to give you the specifics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but I mean for the total &#x2013; loss on total would be so for the whole banking sector so not for your part -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I see. Okay, well I'm not commenting on that one. Our provision that's all I know, is less than 200 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Real Estate part, to be honest I don't have that because I know the NPLs and I know the NPL decline, but the what if we did not restructure, how would my NPL have looked like, that it is not the way how I look at it. I mean I can try and look it up but normally what we do is, yeah we have files if they are at a certain moment they need to be provisioned or they're non-performing then you deal with it and from then on you calculate your NPLs. So but that what-if, I cannot answer.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning gentlemen. Fran&#xE7;ois Boissin from Exane BNP Paribas in Paris. Two questions, please. Could you give us a bit more color on the real estate development exposure by country after the write-downs that you booked in Q4 '09? And second question, can you maybe give an update on the asset disposals other than Insurance and specifically the Dutch Banking operations and the ING Direct in the U.S.? I mean what &#x2013; can you tell us some timing and updates on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the last question first. The asset disposal on the Dutch Banking activity we're planning and working on that, want to separate it out and carve it out of the operations in the Netherlands but no progress to further mention here. And ING Direct, as I said earlier, or we have mentioned that earlier in previous calls, we are not in a hurry at all. We will take our time. We are not, in fact in any way discussing or negotiating any transaction over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I mean, is there any renegotiation? I mean to trying and avoid disposal in this area or...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I cannot go on to details, we have filed an appeal with the European Commission and I need to wait until that will be resolved, until we can do anything further. And, Koos, developments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at the development breakdown, 40% of the development exposure is in the Netherlands. We have in total for the rest, the significant countries are Germany 9%, Spain 19% and we have Hungary at 9%. And then there are some other countries but that is all then below &#x2013; well at or below 6%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the net exposure now is 2.3 billion, right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. William Elderkin. Please go ahead. I'm afraid Mr. Elderkin's de-polled. We're in keeping for the next question. You have a question from Farooq Hanif [Morgan Stanley], please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning everybody. Two quick questions. Firstly on net interest margin, you've given, you've made a quite a lot of statements today. So you've talked about the sensitivity to the yield curve. You've mentioned some things about pricing. Can you just, can you know, bring that all together and tell us where you think it's going? I mean you are getting positive re-pricing on loans, you're seeing competition coming back. I think in the past, you've said that it's wise to assume that the 140 that you are making right now goes sort of back towards 120 or so. I mean how realistic is it that actually your margins remain quite good for 2010? That's question number one. Question number two is, today what are your current thoughts on the structure of disposals? I know you've made some comments that IPOs are looking like an option. Are you talking about one or two? I mean can you just give us some whatever you &#x2013; you can tell us about what you think the best approach might be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On interest margins, yes, the levels that are higher than we've seen in the past. As Jan said, there is increasing competition coming in and over time we would expect those to &#x2013; those margins to come back down to the level we indicated before. 120 basis points is a good longer-term estimate. Clearly, it hasn't happened yet, we're still in a position where we're benefiting from higher interest margins. And I think that would probably continue for a little while longer before the longer-term margins come in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on that, don't you mean that the fall-off to 120, is that just you assuming rates will go up or is that just based on competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of things. Competition will come back. Potentially interest rates would go up as well. So we mean we benefited from widening margins on re-pricing in loans, where in the crisis period when those loans mature, the margins will reduce. So it's a combination of things, but primarily competition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that for the time being, we don't see any let-down of margins. The margins are basically at this level and maybe gradually later in the year declining, but I think for the time being we see them as fairly robust. With respect to the structural disposals, yeah, of course, Farooq, we are looking at various ways to do this. First of all, we have said we are separating the Insurance and Bank organization wherever it's necessary and we will take probably a year to do so. Further, we are not in a hurry to go into any type of sale process, because we want to take a very careful look at how markets develop and market circumstances are. We clearly have an interest in doing this right and to create the best possible value for shareholders. When we look at market circumstances today, I think the public market looks like the most attractive market and whether there is one or two IPOs, I can't say at this moment. That that's still to be discussed. But further then that I can't go. We need to keep a very close eye on how markets develop and how we develop as an organization to see what the best opportunities are for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to what extent do you think you're going to be influenced by Solvency II, for example, just wanting to get things out of the way before that becomes a hard capital requirement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will take a look at that as well and of course we'll do our planning based on all the evidence and all the circumstances and all the input that we can get at those points in time. But I am not in a hurry today. I think we want to take our time, we want to do it right, we want to go to market with a very good performing business and we're working very hard on that one. That's our first priority.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, everybody. It's William Elderkin. I had a couple of questions, please. First of all, could you just give us an update on what your expected tax rates are in the Banking and Insurance division, given all the changes in the Group? The second question is, if I look on page 70 at the Insurance Europe margin analysis, can you give us an idea of how much of the Insurance operating result is derived from the Dutch business and how much I guess from these European businesses? And then the final question is, can you give us an update on your thoughts on Solvency II discussion and what that means for your Insurance business. Does that mean there might be more or less capital going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the tax rate I think the guidance we gave you is 20, 25%. Where we're looking at it now we see that probably going to the 30, perhaps 35% range in 2010, largely due to change in mix and less tax-free equity income potentially in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said 2010, I'm &#x2013; just in terms of building our models going forward is that 30 to 35% range, the kind of number we should be using?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's the &#x2013; that's what I would suggest you use in your modeling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to be clear that this is &#x2013; would that apply equally to the Insurance and Banking businesses or are the rates slightly to be materially different?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point I think the guidance we can give you is for the aggregate because it will depend on the how the business evolves. But I think that's best used &#x2013; for the both.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So I believe you are looking at a Life Insurance operating result of 167 million for Insurance Europe and a total operating result of 221 and of that, about 100 or so is the Benelux on the Life side and the non-life is about 50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Solvency II? Koos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think on Solvency II I mean the good thing which we embrace, is that it becomes more risk based. So the calculation of what risk is, that is the part where we are happy with. Still the issues which we find is that number one, for our liabilities, should there be some form of recognition that the balance sheet side, the liability side is more stickier than for instance in a Bank which is the so-called liquidity spread, this cushion. And we are clearly in favor of applying that. Second part is asset risk factors that is moving in the right direction with the sales. I mean that is going down a bit. But still one of the bigger issues is to compare economic capital to a market value balance sheet that leads to an element, which is a bit too pro-cyclical. And there is an ongoing dialogue with the regulators on this and that is where we are taking part in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is your sense that as things stand, the proposals would leave your business, do you need more capital, less capital, about do you have the right amount of capital there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I find that difficult to say, because you could say like on as-is basis currently right now, then the amount of capital is sufficient. But if the system becomes too pro-cyclical, then you need to hold more, more buffer. So it's actually the pro-cyclicality element that is a part where we have a concern on and that dialogue that determines whether you need more buffers but the current capital situation is fine.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Marc Thiele. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I would like to ask three number questions. Firstly, I was previously thinking you would produce a few numbers related to the profitability of the asset management. I couldn't find anything. Could you at least provide us with the third party assets under management excluding unit-linked. Then secondly, ING Direct USA on page 38, you mentioned the disposal that you've done. Can you give us an update how much capital is in that operation and what level of risk-weighted assets are we looking at? And then thirdly, there was little change in the loan loss provisions in the fourth quarter sequentially, the coverage ratio is still relatively low at 36%. Historically, the level was 45 to 50%. Over which timeframe would you expect a move back towards the 45, 50% level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question relating to the asset management. We have said that as of the first of this year, we will start working on that one, so that by Q1, it will be the first time that we will report them separately. So they are not yet in the 2009 numbers, but you'll get them as of Q1, 2010. Then we have a question on ING Direct. Koos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe can I first start with the loan loss provision and then we will go to the ING Direct. If you look at the loan loss provision part, the coverage ratios, coverage ratios are a result of a number of factors. I mean the first part is of course, we are in a more securitized business, so which leads to lower loss given defaults.</p>
          <p>Second part is in the beginning of a crisis if you have new files, then in general your coverage ratio is low and if you have a lot of older files then your ratio becomes higher, because those are the more difficult workouts. Third element, which plays a role is in general and then if I look particularly at retail, after three years we basically write something off entirely. So we don't leave it on. And that means a lot of old IR provision files are just being taken out.</p>
          <p>So I think those are a number of reasons why, in the end, our loan loss provision is something, which the coverage ratio can move a bit up and down. At the same time, if you look at when do we end up at the 45, 50 guidance, that is a more difficult one. We indicate &#x2013; indicated already in the previous quarters that that is sort of we move in 2013 to this target. That is where we will end up with. But right now, I mean the only guidance I have is that what we see still in the second half of this year, a little bit leveling off of loan loss provisions. That is something which I see as the base case for the next few quarters. But I cannot give a sort of a precise time path where we will end up in when we will precisely be at this 45, 50. If you take ING Direct in the U.S., the risk-weighted assets, then in total we are talking about 25, that is the RWAs for the U.S. portfolio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I've got three questions, please. Firstly, looking at your Tier-1 hybrids outstanding at the moment, the ones that are trading substantially below par. I mean effectively by our calculations, you've got roughly &#x20AC;750 million of potential core Tier-1 gain if you conducted some form of liability management exercise. Could you just maybe give some insight as to how you're thinking about that and whether you're looking to harvest that gain at any point?</p>
          <p>Secondly on the de-leverage of the Insurance business, could you just maybe give a bit of explanation as to why you're doing that? I mean is it to help a potential sale at INGV and therefore should we expect a continuation of that de-leveraging? I mean there is another 3 billion of internal hybrids there. And then finally just whether you are going to be paying a dividend internally from the Insurance operations up to Group? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In respect to the hybrid, yeah. We keep a close eye on where the market prices are, obviously. And that's something we're looking at and keeping, evaluating our options. We also want to see where the EC &#x2013; where the Sovency II debate's going and hybrid capital, what's eligible, what's not. And how these new co-co instruments evolve and what options in that space. So we are keeping our options open and looking at how that develops. On the leverage change, it was simply because we had an internal ratio on hybrid capital where we're slightly above our internal ratio, we wanted to get it back in line. So we moved it, moved the hybrid level down, so that we were within our own internal ratios. And on dividend policies, we maintain our internal dividend policy discipline. Is &#x2013; it remains the same as it has been in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So does that &#x2013; just to be clear then, is there &#x2013; because I think there was no dividend paid from INGV up last year, is that case this year as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In 2010, we will maintain the same policy and as results developed and if we have results in excess of minimum requirements we would dividend up from INGV and other all other insurance subsidiaries. We will maintain our existing pre-existing policy in this respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so just one very short follow-up question, but obviously you said there's no disentanglement issue with regards to the U.S. and I think also you have been quoted about examining different IPO options. Is there any sense that maybe getting rid of the U.S. quicker might generate greater value for the Group from the second IPO, given I guess maybe issues around reserving strength and all the rest of it at the U.S. this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we have an, a process here that we like to run as confidential as possible. So whatever we do, we will let you know as soon as we do it, but we are not going to speculate on what are alternatives that we can do, but thanks a lot for the tip. We'll keep it in mind.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. It's <mark type="inaudible" /> Amsterdam. I have a question on a sheet which was in the last presentation is not in this one. It's about the capital structure of the new bank, which includes the Insurance subsidiaries. Is your expectation as of the relevant regulation for this set-up, is it unchanged? Second question is more on the business model going forward. I mean you have slightly increased the intensity of risk-weighted assets, is this more or less continuing and will it be impacted by the &#x2013; by the regulation change? And then about regulation change, President Obama has proposed two things which regard to the bank tax and the Volcker Rule. As I &#x2013; is my expectation correct that this will not impact ING very much? But what would be the impact of it when this kind of measures would come to Europe? As the Dutch Minister of Finance has more or less voiced his support so in this sense, could you give a flavor on this? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Patrick, the cap structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the Bank holding company type structure I think you're referring to, no we didn't include it in this deck in part because in Basel III rules have since come out and we need to evaluate how they were &#x2013; they were playing out. And I think part of the reason we showed it was to demonstrate the underlying capital strength of ING as compared to some other bank issurers which has also been reflected in the press, but the primary reason we have not put it in is that we have to look at what Basel III rules will do and whether that structure will apply under Basel III.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the RWAs, I mean in general what we have seen is RWAs they've gone down because of all the risk taking actions we have done. Going forward what you can expect is I mean on credit migration that could still go on for the next year, but nevertheless we will continue to apply the same methodology as this year, which means invest a bit less in bonds. So I think we have sufficient mitigants to manage the RWAs going forward. If you talk about regulation, there you could say like in 2011 there will be the new Basel rules on trading and that will lead to an increase in RWAs but our total amount of risk-weighted assets for trading are low so even if that doubles or triples, then that is not something which will hit us significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Obama tax and the Volcker Rules, I think we need to be really careful. We see a lot of suggestions coming to the surface from different type of players in the market, not very well coordinated. And I think what needs now is a well-coordinated regulatory framework with a level playing field that will apply worldwide ideally but if not, in the European markets. I think that is important and not to regulation that is today it's going this way, tomorrow it's going the other way and nobody knows exactly which way it is going. I think that's very dangerous for the rational development of this industry and could only lead to too much capital or too much regulation and then you have the consumer ultimately to suffer from that because then prices will have to go up. I think we need to be really careful here. And I don't know what the Obama tax will be when it comes to Europe. I don't want to speculate on that one either.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. I just have a very quick follow-up on the VA lapsation, which is can you tell us which vintages of polices are affected? For example is it mainly '03 to '07 or is it earlier than that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Nick. It's Matt. I think the best way to characterize it is, it's a long run assumption change that we are making for the future but it really affects all the vintages. So it's the entire block. So we are basically coming to a new management best estimate for contracts that are in the money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But can you give us, I think you did say earlier that it wasn't the policies that were written most recently. It was ones written a little bit further back which would be logical because they have more, they would be more in the money, logically. You can't give us any flavor on this.</p>

          <p>Your final question comes from Benoit P&#xE9;trarque. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Benoit P&#xE9;trarque, Kepler in Amsterdam. First question is on the risk cost. The gross &#x2013; we are seeing gross additions we &#x2013; it's around the 134 bps for Q4. Actually the increase is coming from the Benelux Retail division. Is that a structural trend here or is that just bad luck in Q4? Second question is on the Real Estate development division. What is the NPL on Real Estate development end of Q4 as well as the cover ratio, please? And last one on the sale of U.S. prime RMBS, the 800 million disposal, which freed up 7 billion of risk-weighted asset. It sounds great deal for you. Can we expect more these &#x2013; kind of similar disposals in 2010 and similar realizations of risk-weighted assets, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it bad luck or not, we &#x2013; what we talk about in the Netherlands and in Belgium is more the SME part. And normally what you see in a crisis like this is that first the more higher leveraged large corporates, they had been affected and we had, on the Real Estate side, we had more covenant breaches. So that has been the theme early 2009 and mid 2009 and late 2008 what you see then is that it starts to more hit the real economy. And the real economy is more with the SMEs and that is why here you see some &#x2013; you see it more affected at this moment. Can I say like is that bad luck or not. I mean the answer is in fact that the watch list and that is before something becomes a very much a problematic foul, the watch list for the large corporate that stabilized already more in the third quarter. And I think you see some stabilization in the watch list for SME right now. But typically SME is just a bit slower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2010, can we take a range of 110 to 120 bps risk cost? Is that kind of level you are looking at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think I am already giving guidance on affect on the overall amount of risk cost which is already a bit &#x2013; well say risky because I mean, you don't know these kind of things. But if you ask me like can I give guidance on specific sectors there, I find that a difficult one. Again the only thing what I can say is that overall there is different slices of credit in the portfolio with each their own dynamics. So that means like we gradually are leveling off there. But it does not go in one go.</p>
          <p>If you talk about the Real Estate development part, I don't have NPLs because in fact what you have is you have basically activated cost, you have some lands, and you have projects under construction and at a certain moment if you would decide like a profit is not or a project in the end is not going to give you a positive result, then you take an impairment. So, there so there is no NPLs on the development part. And if you look at the third question, the 800 million disposal. Yeah, typically what we are vulnerable for is that if you have an ABS and even ABS has a very low credit rating, then it bites you a bit in the ankle and as far as RWAs is concerned. So then at a certain moment, if it bothers you and if the price is good, you sell something.</p>
          <p>Of course really, I mean, can I &#x2013; can you expect more than typically the guidance, I can give you this is rule which is on Banking and not on Insurance. And if you look at Banking, you know how much is the total amount of very low rated ABSs, then that is relatively small. And if you look at Alt-A, on Alt-A, we have a different ruling with regards to RWA. So no, there is not a clear expectation that there is lots of ABSs, which are near the front door which are about to sell.</p>
