          <p>Hello and welcome to this telephone conference, where we, Nordea will present the Fourth Quarter Results. With us today, we have Christian Clausen, Group CEO and President; Fredrik Rystedt, CFO; Ari Kaperi, CRO; me, Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n, Investor Relations; and also Andreas Larsson, Senior Investor Officer. We will start with a presentation and then we will open up for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So Christian, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. I will give a few remarks to the first few slides and then Fredrik will take over and Ari Kaperi will also take over before I end.</p>
          <p>The key message of today was that this was an important milestone. And the main reason is, of course, that we came out strong on the financial crisis, as you know. And in the beginning of the year, we then embarked upon a prudent growth strategy with our nine initiatives. And of course, it is a milestone because coming out of a crisis with an acceleration of growth and efficiency, improving market shares, getting more customers, at the same time, as we have prepared well for the New Normal in the Basel III world entering the year by strengthening our especially liquidity and funding position is quite a milestone. And of course, on top of that, two quarters with record level income and then new record operating profit, all-in-all a strong milestone.</p>
          <p>And the result highlights you're seeing during the day just highlight that we had record levels of income and we also have a very significant activity level, reflected by the net fee and commission income, which actually covers a lot of activity areas, which gives us commission.</p>
          <p>Just to come back on total income, it's record level. The interesting thing is that the underlying customer income is actually increasing by over 10%, which we have been talking about previously. We are saying that underlying activity, business activity, is increasing 10%, part of it because of new customers, part of it because of more activity.</p>
          <p>And then, in this particular year, other areas are actually coming down, because you probably remember, we had this fantastic beginning of 2009, with two quarters of very high margins on capital markets, which we said would not repeat itself. It has not done that, as expected. But actually, it's been offset quite a lot by our very high customer activity. So the high customer activity is one which bodes well into the future.</p>
          <p>Talk about the long-term targets, our main one is doubling in seven years the risk-adjusted profit. We have been on track. We are slightly below, but interest rates are also very, very low right now and we've incurred some extra funding costs which were not in store. So we are saying that assuming that assumptions we did in 2007/2006 when we launched, this target that the seven years represented a full cycle. Then we strongly believe that this is still within reach.</p>
          <p>So this assumes that we, in the coming few years, will have continued recovery and some economic growth, that we will have some normalization of interest rate levels, and so on. As put it other word, that we don't see the cycle change completely with the double-dip or surplus kind that, of course, could make it difficult. But within that assumption, I think our plans we put in place actually have a potential to reach their target.</p>
          <p>The second mark, a strong quarter showed a return, which we have clearly reached a best-in-class ROE after Q3. We have averaged 14.1% 1% in average over this period of time.</p>
          <p>That concludes my opening remarks and Fredrik?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. I will go through the income statements and a little on the capital position. Starting with net interest income that grew by 4% in the quarter and continued to be fueled by improved deposit income, as a consequence of higher interest rates, primarily on the Swedish side. We also managed to increase the volume on deposits, and of course, also on household lending.</p>
          <p>So if you look at slide nine, you can see the bridge between the third and fourth quarter. As you can see, we had a continued good volume growth contribution from particularly household, while corporate lending volumes were largely flat in the quarter. That's been largely the trend for the full year, although corporate lending has shown some growth in the year.</p>
          <p>As relate to margin, we continued for &#x2013; for many consecutive quarters now we have increased the corporate margins and we managed to do this also this quarter with a few basis points, while household lending margins were largely flat or slightly down. You can clearly see the increase of the deposit margin there on slide nine, and also the impact from slightly higher funding costs that we have picked up, of course, in the quarter, but also particularly for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>The interest rate sensitivity slightly increased with approximately &#x20AC;50 million. This is not due to any changes in assumptions relating to the margin impact, but more has to do with the fact that we've actually increased the liquidity buffer to &#x20AC;61 billion from the previous level of &#x20AC;55 million in Q3. So that's the main explanation for that increased interest rate sensitivity.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the record level of net fees and commissions, it's up by 18%. And that's the back &#x2013; or on the back of an extremely good performance in the savings area, but also higher lending and brokerage fees and the fact that Danish guarantee scheme has expired.</p>
          <p>Just a comment on the savings since it was a very strong quarter. We continued to appreciate the asset to values in assets under management and the growth in assets under management was 21%, a very, very strong growth in assets under management throughout actually 2010. And we've also had some positive impacts from performance fees in the fourth quarter, also pushing fees and commissions up.</p>
          <p>As in the third quarter, fair value result was &#x2013; continues to be strong, and particularly so in the customer area. So whilst unallocated market results has been lower in 2010 than it was in 2009, we are compensating that large fee with very, very good customer activity, as you can see, bringing a record level also in Nordic banking, and of course, a good contribution also from Life &amp; Pension.</p>
          <p>Just quickly on the expenses. The reported number for 2010 is up by 7%, but excluding the FX effect cost or the translation impact, the growth &#x2013; underlying cost was 3.1%, so slightly below that of 2009. Of course, this 3.1%, including FX, also includes the costs that we have had for the strategic initiatives. Particularly in Q4, as always, seasonal effects are present, within an area such as marketing or traveling, etcetera, and that was also the case for this year.</p>
          <p>So leaving the P&amp;L and going to risk-weighted assets, we increased risk-weighted assets, excluding those translation loss, with 1.9%. And it was actually a growth in pretty much all customer areas, but particularly relating to areas where we are still using standardized approach, and of course, having a risk weight of 100% in those areas. It was particularly in those areas that we had a growth. We also had a slight model change also contributing to risk-weighted appreciate &#x2013; or risk-weighted asset appreciation. We, as Ari will talk about later, also had a positive rating migration, which was a positive factor in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, the capital position, we have an unchanged core Tier 1 ratio at 10.3% or just over 10.3%. And of course, this is partly due to the fact that we've had a good profit level, but also a high increased volume. So lending is up by 11% all, of course, consuming capital. Dividend pay-out is also up to &#x20AC;0.29 per share, the proposal. And that is the dividend pay-out ratio of 44%. So once again, the core Tier 1 ratio is at 10.3%, which is slightly down from Q3, but unchanged as the full year.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I'll leave over to Ari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So then we move to asset quality. I'm on page 17, so that you can see the macro situation in our area is solid and positive. GDP growth is very good in the Nordic countries, carried by Swedish strong economy, but as you can see also other countries are showing quite positive development, driven by good exports growth, good consumer confidence, and also some signals of increased investment. Inflation is modest. Our public finances in the Nordic countries stay relatively balanced. And also, we see a drop in the unemployment rate. So all-in-all, the macro situation is positive.</p>
          <p>And of course, that doesn't impact to our asset quality, so that our asset quality is improving. And then you see that our credit losses are trending down. In the fourth quarter, we were already at the level of 23 basis points from our total lending book, which is already below our expected average loan losses, which is 25% over the cycle.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 19, you can see that in the fourth quarter, the net loan losses incurred was &#x20AC;166 million. That comprises a new loan loss level of some &#x20AC;400 million, but also lot of recoveries from earlier-made provisions, especially on the collected provisions because the overall credit quality is improving.</p>
          <p>When you take a look at how these loan losses are split between countries, you can see that we had in Q4 very low loan losses in new European markets, in Sweden, in Finland, also in Norway. However, that the loan losses increased in Sweden and Norway from the very low level, they have been more or less nonexistent so far.</p>
          <p>In Denmark, we were still at the same level as in Q3. It is 44 basis points, because there is a clearly still tail of customers, corporate customers, small and medium-sized corporate customers, as well as agricultural customers who are in problems.</p>
          <p>Our impaired loans, they were a little bit up in the Q4, as you can see from the following page. That is also understandable, at least for the business cycle, because what happens is that now it's much, much easier to identify those customers who will not make it. And when we see them, then we make a loan loss provision and that impairs the whole loan of that customer. However, it's not increasing our risk because we have covered this loan loss risk earlier when we've built up our collective provisions.</p>
          <p>And when we make collective provisions, there is no impaired loan attached to that. But now when they are, in a way, transferred to individual loan loss provisions, then we can see increase in impaired loans. And as you can see, that most of our impaired loans, they are still performing, so that the customers are still paying interest and are paying the principal, so that we are still early in our provisions. And from these total allowances, you can see that actually the total allowance is unchanged, but there is now a change from collective individual.</p>
          <p>And then page 21 shows this positive development in our corporate credit book, so that you can see our exposures to the customers who are in high rating grades, that is increasing and whereas the exposures in the low end of our rating scale, they are decreasing. All-in-all, this rating migration had an impact to our risk-weighted assets of 1.1% positive impact in Q4. From the corporate book only, the rating migration was 1.5%, which is a good number.</p>
          <p>With these words, I hand over back to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I have a few comments on what is happening on the regulatory side. We have, as I prepared &#x2013; as I said, prepared during the year, what is happening, the main three challenges, as you can see on slide 23 is, of course, the capital, the short-term liquidity and the long-term funding path. They put the pressure on return on equity and makes everybody write business models. And we are, of course, doing that as well in our New Normal business model review we're doing, in order to &#x2013; with objective to increase RoE, of course, and to mitigate the effects.</p>
          <p>But first of all, a few comments on the three elements. Capital, you all know, 10.3%. We are compliant to the Basel III rules. And no matter how we look at it, we see it as a strong position and probably also maybe stronger than our economic needs. But in light of the regulation, there is no doubt that it's still uncertain exactly where the &#x2013; we know the minimums now from Basel III, but we don't know the local regulations. But if you take the Standard &amp; Poor's, we are doing it &#x2013; risk-adjusting it, it is clear that we are one of the strongest banks in capital and also have that view ourselves.</p>
          <p>Liquidity is interesting because LCR has been defined, it's an observation period. But we have actually increased the liquidity buffer to the level needed in LCR. We are not still investing it, slightly different what LCR requires, but it's &#x2013; as it's similar to the ones in Basel III, the main exception is that we don't have bought as many government bonds &#x2013; they are available in our area. And we can also see that the short-term funding is now significantly less in our liquidity buffer, which also suggests a very strong ratio on the longer funding, which the next slide shows that we do not believe in the NSFR.</p>
          <p>We said that many times. We think the parameter setting and the whole way it's constructed is wrong. They should move to another way of doing it. That's the way we are doing it, by having some limitation on how much mismatch you can do on the behavior and maturities. And we have created a very prudent situation. We have increased our loan funding. We have done a number of things, which means that we today are pretty well matched from a behavior point of view. And that's actually how we believe we need to run this prudently.</p>
          <p>Now the regulator may come out in NSFR-like issues, but it's still to me uncertain that, that will actually come out in the observation period. It's going to be observed. And they're going to look through how that can be done, but we think we have created the right mitigation of the risks, funding risk and liquidity risk, which we need to do in this way. But of course, we will review the business model. We have a good starting point at 12.8% RoE, but there, of course, is lot of things we can do. So we are working through our segments, our value chains, our products and behaviors, in order to use as little capital and funding as possible.</p>
          <p>A few words on the customer momentum. We have a strong market position; the number of gold customers up, assets under management is up, and we have very strong momentum. And at the same time, we have higher customer satisfaction and that all points to a business momentum. We really feel now, and this slide 31 actually shows a very simple one, the monthly average, rolling three months, 12 months and 24 months. And you can clearly see the momentum picking up towards the end of the period here even more and still high growth all the way through. It's actually going all the way back to 2006 where we started this, where we have seen this impressive growth rate and the income level, but it has some momentum now. This is due to the nine initiatives.</p>
          <p>And we have a few comments on the nine initiatives. I would say the most important one is the future distribution. We have very significant feedback from customers when we adjust our branch network to the new format. That is working. They like it, they appreciate it, and give us high marks. We like it. We appreciate it because we're doing things much more efficient. We have much more customer meetings, much more service, transactions per employee. And we certainly get all around the customer and get all the business from the customers this way. And then we've improved our Netbank significantly.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all, this is a project that will continue for the coming years and gradually transform the whole branch network into this format. And we are continuously adjusting it to &#x2013; from the learning, but we are now running two branches in regard of this, that this is the right way to do it.</p>
          <p>Total new customer acquisition, already mentioned, 200,000 new customers, a growth rate of 6%. The growth plan Finland focused on the Finnish issues, but I think the household volume speaks for themselves in terms of this being an important growth driver.</p>
          <p>Within corporate, large corporate companies, we're doing really well. We're gaining relationship, core relationships, and we're doing more business. We're not doing that much lending in Q4; companies are cash rich and they use the capital market, but that is not to be worried about. We still make money on other areas, as you can see, income up 19% in the quarter and more than 40% over the year. So I strongly believe that we have proven here that we are on the right track on that initiative as well, much more to do, but on the right track.</p>
          <p>And the same thing goes for the capital market initiative, which supports, of course, the corporate one, being on top of the lead tables here both on Eurobond and equities, I think is a strong proof that we have a position and a role to play here.</p>
          <p>New European markets. We opened our branches in Poland. They are online, delivering growth, and it is impressive how fast we see income coming in, in new branches. And we will continue that in '11. We cannot say how many branches. It will not be 45, it will be much less, but we think we will expand within the branches and fill the branches with people, both customers and employees, and broaden out the offering quite a lot. It's a good thing.</p>
          <p>Then we, at this time, taking in a few more efficiency slides, just to prove that we have also, by these initiatives, a lot of efficiency gains. We have reported that. Fredrik mentioned that, but I think that we see here clearly, that it's quite significant. On the customer side, we see income per FTE up, customers per FTE up, new customers up. We see business volume per FTE up. Number of meetings per private &#x2013; personal bank advisors up significantly and gold customers up.</p>
          <p>And if we look at the back end of the business, in terms of a two-year rise in business, it's clear that we have significant gains. And this is very much our investments in the back end of the foundation. It's on payments. It's on the transactions in general, which in many transactions the Bank is <mark type="inaudible" /> moving away rapidly towards the metaphors. Asset management costs, asset management cost per portfolio, a measurement of efficiency we have it down. IT production volume is down significantly, very much part of our IT initiative.</p>
          <p>Number of contracts, loans, cards, invoices per FTE in the administrative area is up 25%. And the corporate payment transaction per FTE is up 28%. And the square meters per workplace is down 5%. And that's extremely well aligned with our customer strategy because our people are out there with the customers not spending time at the office, which is very good.</p>
          <p>The financial impact from the Group initiatives is significant. We've reported these. And as I said, this is a milestone year for Nordea I think. We couldn't have dreamt about coming better out of the crisis or better into the new growth area, and being so well-prepared for the new regulation.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'll leave it open for questions now.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question today from Nick Davey of UBS. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, everyone. Good afternoon. It's Nick Davey from UBS. I've just got three quick questions, if I can. The first is on regulation and capital, I think we've &#x2013; you mentioned the magic word of mitigation during the course of your presentation. I just wanted to get a flavor as to whether you're talking about mitigating the capital impact or capital erosion impact from Basel III. And if you could give us some flavor, perhaps, as to how that would take place. Are we talking about maybe something that would be erosive to revenues or if we're talking about maybe some moving of the credit book on to full IRB from standardized that might offset some of the Basel III impact, just to give us some flavor really about that capital number?</p>
          <p>The second would be on funding. And on slide 26 just talking about the behavioral average maturity of both sides of your balance sheet, I wanted to get a flavor, if I can, really from you as to what message you get from your regulators when you show them this slide. I mean, it seems that every stability report or Central Bank speech that we look at nowadays seems to be urging the banking system to turn out its funding, pretty consistently. So I just wanted to get a flavor from you as to what kind of pressures you were feeling in the domestic regulatory backdrop, to continue to do that and really what kind of rallying power you feel you or Sweden has really against Basel on the shortfalls of the net stable funding ratio?</p>
          <p>And then third and finally, very briefly on Swedish margins in the retail business, if you could just give us some flavor of the dynamics you've seen there in a rising rate environment in the last quarter. It looks to me, from the margin numbers you give us, at least, that you've managed to maintain pretty stable lending margins despite rate rises and been able to keep hold of the deposit margin expansion. If you could just give us some color around that as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can start, on the Basel III mitigation. I think there are many ways we can mitigate, of course, in terms of operational terms. We can be generally more capital efficient. We can consume or direct our business in more capital or less capital intensive areas. But there are many operational ways we can mitigate.</p>
          <p>There are also kind of -- well, basically, two technical things we can do. First of all, we have still to go through internal rating-based models, and particularly so for the corporate sector where we're still foundation at -- in our corporate portfolio. And of course, we expect to be AIRB approved in the next coming years. So of course, that's a mitigating thing. The other part, which is an obviously technical mitigation is the internal models for the CVA calculations. So both of those two is, of course, mitigating factors.</p>
          <p>Now we have provided estimates previously, during 2010, that Basel II, without those mitigating factors would take out approximately about 1% of core Tier 1 ratio approximately in that order of magnitude. Of course that's without mitigating actions. So there are many ways that we can work both from <mark type="inaudible" /> and operational way. And thirdly, which we also stated in one of the slides here, is that we can also become more efficient on our collateral management, on the credit side. And that's also part of our everyday work that we've done during Q4, as we've done previously in the year, as we will continue to do. So it's all of those three things.</p>
          <p>If I should continue, on the behavioral maturity, it's a good way of looking at long-term funding and liquidity risk, we believe. We have gone through every part of our balance sheet and identified including certain elements of stress, what the behavioral maturity is, both on the asset and the liability side. I think it actually has triggered a lot of interest from the local regulators, contrary to the capital side, where everyone seems to be generally of the view that it will be largely implemented in its current shape and form. That is not the case for liquidity.</p>
          <p>So we believe that there is still some room for discussions with our local regulators and potentially also on the European side for liquidity measures such -- in just the way that Christian alluded to. So as you know, we share the view that liquidity risk has been too large. And you have very clearly seen that this year, or 2010, we expanded long-term funding quite significantly. We had roughly &#x20AC;18 billion of maturities. We had new issuance of &#x20AC;33 billion. So we expanded long-term funding. We did a similar thing in 2009. So we believe we are in good shape, in terms of liquidity risk. Swedish margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are working in all markets very hard to get the margins up, because we see the need, as such, coming from these regulatory challenges and new normal environment. And we have been able to keep up with the good margins, in Sweden actually, a little bit increased, as you said. It's very much coming from this kind of re-pricing to the existing book, because we still have, let's say, a lot of -- or at least a certain amount of quite low margin loans in our book. And we are actively re-pricing those. And it also, of course, comes from some high-yielding deals. The private equity fund market has been quite active. And those deals are typically quite high-margin deals.</p>
          <p>But I must also say that -- actually that the market is holding back this margin increase potential, so that we clearly see that the intense competition coming from various players in the market. And we have not been able to, let's say, increase the margins as fast as we have &#x2013; would have hoped. But it is a more honest picture we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could add in a little on this regulation question you asked, whether we would have any impact. That remains to be seen. But we have a long list of arguments why NSFR is not constructed in a logic way, a lot of arguments actually. And I think our own figures suggest that very clearly. And if you had to start all over in defining something about funding risk, you would not start NSFR way. At least you have to have special name to do that. You would start out based on maturities and say, okay, what is our risk in our maturity mismatch. That's where you would start.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons NSFR is so wrong is that it makes some assumptions which are not real life and was not true through the crisis either. So, some of the haircuts are a bit strange. Some deposits count better than others. Some do not count at all. Some of the wholesale funding does not count at all, the last year. This is very harmful, especially to the Nordic area where all the mortgage lending which is funded by bonds. And then suddenly, the last year, the maturity of a bond does not count, and there are so many technicalities.</p>
          <p>And when you look at from a Nordea issue where we have less short-term funding than our liquidity buffer, then in reality the rest is funded. And the maturity of our new funding was six years this year, nearly. And the average is nearly four years, or more than six years. And the average is now four years. And then it is easy to see that to be NSFR compliant for Nordea would mean that we were negative in our maturity transformation, i.e. that the maturity of our liabilities needs to be much longer than our assets. And that seems to be a bit strange. And when I say this to Wellink, he gets all upset, actually very silent at the same time because he doesn't like to hear it.</p>
          <p>And at the end of the day the NSFR was decided to do -- it was decided an observation period, the reason being that they realized there are significant problems, not least because the interpretations in the U.S. are very different. So actually, we spent quite a bit of time with this. And as you may know, I've been elected as Chairman of European Bankers Federation. And I'm spending quite a lot of time in that capacity to actually lobby for something more sensible in this area.</p>
          <p>Not to say that the short funding on balance sheet should be avoided. Certainly it should. Some of the unsound banking models which actually exactly mismatched funding too much should be avoided. So that's not the argument. The argument is let's do something sensible and something operational, something which is really handling the funding risk the way you like to and, at the same time, avoid mixing a long funding and short-term funding, as they actually do. I think the mix-up between LCR and NSFR is incredible and not very logical.</p>
          <p>So I think we can put forward a good lot of arguments on this. And I think that as we go forward, we will see that there will be changes in this. Our duty until that happens is then to ensure we have a prudent funding situation. That's exactly what we've done. We find ourselves in the right situation. We find ourselves where we want to be, in full control of the risks and well funded. So we do not find the need to do anything more. And I also believe regulation, at the end of the day, will not be much different from what we are doing. Maybe the parameters will be different but the economic realities will probably not change. So I would not envisage any further costs in that area for Nordea, at least as we know it now.</p>

          <p>Excellent, thank you. That's very clear. If I could just quickly try one follow-up, Fredrik, just to see if you'd be willing to give us some sense of -- you mentioned the offsetting factors of taking some of your corporate books and standardize onto AIRB. Would you be able to give us a flavor, on a base-case assumption, how much capital erosion you'd be able to offset by that process?</p>

So of course that was just one example. But there are other areas in part of our book that are still on the standardized approach. So there are many of those. And this was one example.

          <p>Our next question today comes from Omar Keenan from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Your line is open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I've just got two questions, please. First, looking at the corporate deposit increase over the quarter, is this the impact of the cash management buildup? Or is there something else there? I'm just trying to ascertain how much of the growth can be carried over into 2011.</p>
          <p>And secondly, just the provisions in the shipping and international, which fell 54%, I think, over the year. Could this trend reverse over 2011, given difficulties in the bulk market? Can you tell us what your outlook is there or if you have any exposure to Korea Line for example? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can perhaps start with the corporate deposits. It was actually -- the corporate deposits was, in both what we call savings accounts, and also transactional and term deposits. So it will spill over to some extent. It was a very good ending to the year. So we expect some of that to spill over. And of course it's a focus area for us. There are some year-end effects that you have seen also in previous years, which may not continue. But I think there will, of course, be spillovers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll take this shipping market. It's, of course, the nature of the shipping market that it's cyclical. And sometimes different sectors are up and other sectors are down. It's as you said, now that the bulk and tankers are a little bit down. But then again, the containers and the oil offshore, which is very important regions for us in the shipping side that they are relatively strong. And this is what will happen always. We are used to this cyclicality.</p>
          <p>And of course, then it's our job to choose those customers who can live through these cycles. And we have been successful so far in this business, and you have seen that our loan losses, they have never been high in the shipping, and especially now in 2010 they came down. And then we don't foresee that this will change in 2011, 2012, so that we are quite comfortable with the quality of our shipping book.</p>
          <p>Then as you can easily, probably understand that we can't comment any kind of customer-specific issues, referring to your question relating to this Korea Line.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, there. I was just hoping to get some granularity on your comment on Denmark where you say that loan losses appear to have peaked. If I remember what you wrote in the results. So I was just -- are you sort of expecting, I know you don't want to guide this year, but are you expecting those losses to trend down this year towards your sort of normalized level in Denmark as well, or does that just mean that you don't expect them to increase?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was just -- very quick question on corporate deposits, which seem to have responded, at least versus my expectations, corporate deposit margins, which seem to have gone up quite a bit. So I just wanted to ask you how you see the sensitivity to rising interest rates both in Sweden and in the euro countries on rising interest rates on corporate deposit margins. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I start with this Denmark, as you heard and as we know that the macro thing of -- macroeconomic issues in Denmark they are also developing in a positive way. Then again we see the positive rating migration in our credit book in Denmark, so that the overall credit quality is clearly improving in our Danish portfolio.</p>
          <p>So that then they are indicators which shows that actually we don't see that there is a high risk of increasing loan loss levels in Denmark, on the contrary. So that's the background for our statement that we think that we have seen the peak in Denmark. Because now the loan losses from our own book, if we exclude this Danish guarantee scheme, it has been more or less at this level now say in the last two quarters.</p>
          <p>But then I think that, as we saw already, also in the Q4, there is a -- this kind of tail of customers in Denmark, small and medium sized corporate customers, also agricultural from -- customers from agricultural sector who will not make it. And that's according to our assessment. And those are exactly the customers who have made now new loan provisions also in Q4, and they will -- we expect that there will be this kind of tail of for some upcoming quarters.</p>
          <p>Difficult to say exactly that when this tail is, let's say, is disappearing, but at least we believe that net loan losses in Denmark at least they are not going higher from this level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I can comment on the interest rate sensitivity, Aaron. I think such a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity is actually coming from the assumptions relating to margins. And if you split that up into more granularity it's a -- a dominant portion coming from the household transaction side.</p>
          <p>Now, that was not your questions, but roughly we are just short of half of the transaction deposit accounts on the household side is actually in Finland, so it's euro-based. A significant portion, about 20% is of course also in Sweden, so that's where you see the deviation or increase coming from during this quarter, but of course euro is more important.</p>
          <p>If you take the corporate side the sensitivity is much lower, because first of all, we tend to -- or the interest rates will actually be more flexible than it is on the household side, so sensitivity is typically lower on the corporate side, on the margin development. So, we expect that the &#x20AC;500 million that you see in interest rate sensitivity is largely coming from the household side and largely coming from the transaction side of the book.</p>
          <p>If you take the distribution of corporate, it's much more evenly distributed between the Nordic countries pretty much; no one is really dominating there. Although, in fact, yes, Sweden and Finland are at the same level together with Norway, so it's pretty much a similar level. So the transaction accounts on the household side is more the issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Fredrik, sorry just if I can clarify then. What I was looking at was just your corporate deposit margins in Sweden are up 24 basis points over the last two quarters I guess, household deposits are up 28. So the difference seems to be a lot smaller than I would have anticipated, I wouldn't have anticipated this substantial margin expansion on the corporate side. And the same is true I guess for Finland where your corporate margins are up some 15, 16 basis points, and household are up just over 20. So I was just going to ask you is this a temporary effect of these last two quarters or would you -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Aaron, it has to do with something else. It's a very relevant observation, but it has to do with the extremely low interest rates that you see in Sweden. So the first increases we get to keep a relatively bigger portion. Of course, as interest rates keep on going up we basically will not be able to keep that portion of the margin on the corporate side whilst we keep the addition -- or a bigger proportion of the increase on the household side. So it's consistent with developments. So it's more a shorter term issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question today from Johan Ekblom from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just two questions if I may. Firstly, on fee income, clearly part of the jump is coming from the discontinuation of the Danish banking package. But if we ignore that, how much of the rest of the increase would you view as sustainable and how much is due to seasonality?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on capital. You've reiterated several times how comfortable you are with your capital level, and I recognize that regulation hasn't been completely finalized. But, when we think about payout ratios going forward, should we expect you to remain around the 40% or is there scope for a higher payout ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can maybe start with the asset management side. Of course, there the Danish package of course contributed to that. But as I also mentioned in the presentation, we have typically in the fourth quarter, if we have performed well, we also have the performance fees. And within that increase in comparison with Q3 we had approximately about &#x20AC;15 million in performance-related fees. So they would be of a more temporary, well, I shouldn't say temporary, but Q4 nature put it that way and the rest is more a consequence of course asset appreciation and good performance. And payout ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the reason why we are comfortable about the capital level is of course pointing to the fact that we believe that the mitigating actions we are doing, and the new regulation of risk-weighted assets and so on can maybe out-balance each other. So we see this level to be sustainable going forward, even without having made a very precise statement on that. And that is clearly enough. That could support a higher payout ratio in theory.</p>
          <p>The reason I say theory is that the minimum rules have been decided in Basel, but it's now up to individual governments and jurisdictions to actually implement the capital requirements. We don't know exactly how the local implementation will be. So I still think it's uncertain whether their core capital ratio will be 7, 8, 9 or even 10.</p>
          <p>Just last week we saw in the UK, the Bank of England report coming out suggesting 50%, no, 20% I think it was, but at least a very high percentage. And we have seen Switzerland move, and we have seen others, and it can be a combination of core and other things. So we don't even really know where capital is going to end up. And as long as we don't know that I think our view is to keep our payout ratio as we have had for many years. We find it a prudent way of doing things. And then sustain this maybe rather high capital level and then when we know exactly what the real local regulations will be and what the hurdle rate will be for AA rated banks then we will take a new stance. But so far I think it's fairly uncertain where the real demand for core ratios will be</p>

          <p>Our next question today will come from Jacob Kruse from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. It's Jacob Kruse from Autonomous. Just first &#x2013; a question on capital, the Riksbank talked yesterday about, between 9.5% and 12% core capital ratios for systemically important banks. I just wanted to see if you have any insight to the &#x2013; sort of the risks of you being qualified as one of those banks, and if you believe that those would indeed be the ratios that &#x2013; that Swedish regulators would look for given what the Riksbank is saying.</p>
          <p>And also secondly on that, if you could just give us an idea of your risk weighting on your Swedish mortgage book, and then lastly just on the corporate spread widening, if you could discuss a little bit, how much of that in Sweden is to do with mix change with private equity and how much of it is risk &#x2013; re-pricing of loans on a like-for-like basis? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I should start with this thing about core &#x2013; but that's exactly what I alluded to, is that clear what the requirements will be for banks like Nordea and other banks for that matter. It is clear that Nordea is a systemic bank on a local, regional level and thereby on a European level, but not on a global level. I think that is clear from the discussions that have been taking place on global and European level. But I think today it's pretty unclear what this CP will end up and I'm not sure whether it will end up in capital requirements actually, because it is actually &#x2013; that could create a lot of strange dynamics.</p>
          <p>So coming back to that statement, and I alluded to a similar statement made last week in the UK, I think it's unclear where the countries will come out on demands and core. And they can use whatever argument and reasoning they want, but we don't know that yet and we cannot be sure, but that it will be around 9% or 10% or whatever that we just have to wait and see.</p>
          <p>My personal view on this is that it's completely out of reality talking about these numbers. We all know that just reaching the Basel III numbers with a little margin is requiring nearly &#x20AC;1 trillion on the European banking system, a lot of research has been done on that and the Basel Committee themselves confirm this.</p>
          <p>So starting to talk about 3 percentage points more, another trillion in equity capital is to me completely out of whack with common sense and realities. And I don' think that will happen, because that can -- could be eventually a next step if any research shows that is prudent to do that. I find that the first step should be taken now and I think that will be done. And then let's adhere to that.</p>
          <p>So let's wait and see what will the countries come out with. This is only a European discussion. I do not hear that at all in the U.S. I have to say. On the contrary they talk about 7% and maybe 7.01% but not anything more than that. And I think that is another benchmark which will be there for you is what do they do over there. So let's see where it ends before we take decisions on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now maybe on the Swedish mortgage risk weights we have 6%, we have an average of 11% for the Group on risk weights for the mortgage lending and of course particularly in Norway and Denmark being higher than that, so that's how the 11% is comprised.</p>
          <p>And as it relates to the corporate lending margins and the increase in the fourth quarter is largely due to repricing and not so much a mix shift, in fact it's marginally only a mix shift it, has to do with repricing.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everybody. I have two or three questions. The first one is on volume growth. This year the consolidated level was around 11% period end. Do you think this is sustainable going forward? And with regard to Swedish mortgages up almost 30% year-on-year, do you think this is matter of concern? This is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, again I just want to be sure I understood it correctly when you talked about potentially actions to mitigate risk assets did I understand correctly you said this could add 1% of Core Tier 1? I just want to be sure I understood correctly.</p>
          <p>And again on this topic, if I look at your Pillar 3 report 2009, I see that standardized &#x2013; the corporate and the standardized amounted to roughly 28.2 billion last year with the &#x2013; is this the amount that you could eventually switch to IRB to mitigate the risk assets and have a lower risk weight?</p>
          <p>And finally just as more a curiosity actually, normally your assets classified as available for sale accounts for nothing, technically &#x20AC;6 million in shares last year. But if I look at your financial assets breakdown in Q4, I see &#x20AC;5.8 billion roughly of interest bearing securities emerging from nowhere. I just wanted to understand what is this? What kind of securities are that, and what this actually was the contribution of these things to the NII in Q4? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what's first, the effect on mortgage growth in Sweden?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it was actually volume growth in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was it sustainable, I think &#x2013; I didn't actually hear the question. Did you hear it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was whether the 11% lending cost we see is sustainable, but yes, that was the second one, the first one was volume growth in general as I heard it. And then we could say that part of it course an FX effect. We think the underlying growth in corporates will come back. I think it's temporary we see in the fourth &#x2013; in Q4.</p>
          <p>So there will be some growth in corporate lending and also the household lending. Given the favorable economic environment we are looking into it, the Nordic area will probably also continue, not necessarily double digits. So some lending growth this year is what we are looking into.</p>
          <p>And as your main &#x2013; Swedish have been &#x2013; a lot of technical factors come in there to explain that. But in general we can say that in Sweden actions have been taken to mitigate any bubbles coming up, and the discussion is hot on this topic.</p>
          <p>A ceiling on loan to value has been set in on 85%. The banks have decided and communicated that they will require amortization of loans above 75% of values. So I think a number of things are being done, and maybe more needs to be done. But the observe &#x2013; that everybody is so observant upon this potential covenant is probably enough to cure it. And so I think this is under control. And everybody agrees that we don't have the bubble yet, but of course as the growth continues it might just be there.</p>
          <p>Then on the other hand, as I often say when I am meeting with government, they have to realize in Sweden that most other finance ministers in Europe will give a left arm to have a consumer confidence where we have lending growth, which is double digit and a lot of spending going on.</p>
          <p>Then there were questions about litigation and other areas, but I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll be glad to answer that. Maybe I just can add to this issue of Swedish mortgages that this is not a credit issue for us. This is &#x2013; has to do with the consumption space and that's also a concern of course for the politicians. And of course the cause of this is the very low interest rates and as interest rates are actually now increasing a lot of those issues are likely to go away.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the mitigation issues, what I said before was that we had previously communicated during 2010 what the implications of Basel III would be without mitigation and the impact, the negative impact or rather an increase of risk weighted assets is equal to an approximate impact of 100 basis points of 1% on the Core Tier 1 ratio. We have not quantified any impact from mitigating actions and -</p>

So it has increased fair value where items of fair value with 11, it has decreased interest, net interest income with &#x20AC;11 million. That's the exact impact of it. Steve?</p>

          <p>We will take our next question say from Jan Wolter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Jan Wolter here at Deutsche. Three questions if I may, first on Sweden and the margins here on the mortgage side, I think the liquidity premium must now be charged to clients from January 1st, according to the recommendation from the Swedish FSA. If we look at list prices we can't really see anything has been added to them. Will you add this liquidity premium to your price and when? Where can we see that? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second also on margins, but in Norway where you say competition is quite intense both on lending and deposits. What's your best guess here? Do you see this continue, abate or get worse? And the third question is on loan losses, also Sweden and Norway. Loan losses are up this quarter sequentially. Would you say that's many small losses as the recent year or a few large, and that &#x2013; and do you feel that we have already seen the big improvement in Nordea's lending book in terms of credit quality? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can maybe take this first issue of liquidity premium and it is exactly as you say, it basically states that our prices should reflect liquidity premia in the pricing. And that is something we've actually done for quite some time. We are working with what we internally call pricing grids. And the way we calculate the underlying data for those pricing grids include of course the funding costs without liquidity premia. We add liquidity premia and other costs such as capital charges. So we already use that methodology meaning for the pricing aspect of it.</p>
          <p>That doesn't mean that you actually have to brand it specifically to the customer. You have to include it and of course that's obvious since it is included in the funding of the bank.</p>
          <p>The other issue as relates the funding the internal transfer price of money is something that all banks are working with and so are we to incorporate that into the systems, etc. of the bank, and we will do the same over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the next two questions, first one was this Norwegian margins and how do we see the competition and the pressure of those. If you look at mortgage lending in Norway, but the competition has been very fierce and we don't &#x2013; at least for the time being we don't see any kind of relief in that. Difficult to say whether they are going down, hopefully not, but there the competition is very, very fierce.</p>
          <p>In the corporate side, in a way probably the margin pressures they are there, but we have been able to live with them, and actually they are a little bit up also, not also in Norway. So that in that way I think the Norwegian market is quite the same as the other Nordic markets in the corporate lending side.</p>
          <p>Then you asked a question about our loan losses in Norway and Sweden. So it is actually, it's very, very few individual corporate customers in both countries, so that there is no flow of many small losses, its a few individual corporate losses. And we have to, of course, remember that the loan loss level still is very low in both countries. In Norway its 24 basis points, in Sweden its 12 basis points. But we are talking about a very, very small number.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Jan Erik Gjerland from DnB. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jan Erik Gjerland from DnB. I have three questions. The first one on trading, just wanted to make sure I understood the &#x2013; how you did your fair value adjustment for gains in the Q4 and in total in 2011. How much of that you really put into the customer driven amount. And secondly, how recurring the life business is and how recurring the life earnings are on the trading.</p>
          <p>Secondly on the funding side it would be interesting to hear your front book &#x2013; back book margin on your new versus your average borrowings in your &#x2013; on your funding? And secondly, on the funding how is your new liquidity papers yielding versus what you had in the portfolio as you're moving into more conservative levels?</p>
          <p>And finally on the net interest income I begin to hear if you are able to actually increase your margin on top of an interbank rate or on top of your own funding cost. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jan, I can start with the fair &#x2013; items of fair value. If I understood your question correctly it's how much was impacted by fair value adjustment. And of course there is one particular item in Q4 which relates to Pandora and it was just over &#x20AC;50 million that impacted the results.</p>
          <p>We had a similar impact in Q3 of approximately &#x20AC;30 million. So the difference between the quarters was a bit over &#x20AC;20 million roughly. And that's the main fair value adjustment that was made in the quarter and of course impacted the results slightly positive.</p>
          <p>As your question was related to your question on life, well, maybe I can just comment &#x2013; sorry if I stay on the customer business, we have of course over the year in total decreased the result considerably in the unallocated part of a very, very strong 2009, the crisis year 2009. But as you have seen we have largely compensated that with strong flow business. So a lot of the profit is actually driven, as Christian alluded to also earlier, from actually customer flows and risk management products that we serve our customers with.</p>
          <p>Your question on life, we've had a good year on life of course as assets have appreciated, and a general very, very good strong year in items at fair value for life. Whether we can repeat that of course is always the question. We don't give forecasts for it, but we recognize the fact it's been a good year for life.</p>
          <p>I think your question on funding if I understood you correctly was whether we are funding ourselves more expensive now than we did a year before, front or back, I'm not fully sure of your question. But generally speaking if you look at, and I alluded to it before, that this year we have funded &#x20AC;33 billion. We did a considerable amount also 2009 and 2008, and of course we have 2008 in the back end of the year and 2009 early part were very, very high levels. So of course, we have funded ourselves in the last two and half years or so at a high spread.</p>
          <p>So of course our spreads have contracted and sometimes also expanded. We have sort of, I think now in average, a level which is not particularly lower than the market levels for the total funding book. So I don't expect any negative surprises in that end.</p>
          <p>Are there any more questions that we have missed now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Liquidity buffer, the yield now more conservative approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question was on the yield on the buffer as such.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, we have of course different yields in the buffer but it's generally very, very good papers including a lot of government bonds and corporate bonds so &#x2013; . And of course the funding rate is &#x2013; the funding rate for that is relatively high.</p>
          <p>So it is a costly exercise to run the buffer, whilst in 2009 it was extremely profitable. As you know, interest rates went down quite a lot, so we gained a lot in treasury. So the decline in 2010 from treasury was significant. And of course some portion of that or a portion of that actually came from the liquidity buffer. So the liquidity buffer is not a high income source for us of course needless to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally on the net interest income, your customer margin if they are measured against the interbank rate which is moving upwards and downwards or is it really towards your own funding costs? Let's talk about margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am sorry for missing that question. We have maintained measuring versus LIBOR side, well actually versus our own treasury rate so to speak. And then of course that's defined as the reference rate, so LIBOR and SIBOR and not against the funding costs.</p>
          <p>So where you will find the difference between LIBOR and our own funding costs would actually be in treasury. And one of the slides I showed which was the bridge between for net interest income you can clearly see that line of negative &#x20AC;207 million for treasury it says on that slide. And of course that is basically where you see the difference in the funding costs, on that particular line.</p>
          <p>So we are still measuring against the reference rate. And the reason we are doing that is for comparability reasons. When we calculate anything versus customers we of course do that on the back of our actual funding costs. That is the only sensible way of doing it. So pricing and all other things are doing against our funding costs, but for reference and comparability reasons we show it versus the reference rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay good. Just a follow up, the &#x20AC;50 million from Pandora is that out of the &#x20AC;408 million or out of the grey area on the top of that, the unallocated levels?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>No, they are included in the business area. You will find that in Nordic banking in Denmark.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so they are within the &#x20AC;408 million?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. Our last question today comes from Maths Liljedahl from Nordea. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just some questions related to market shares in corporate lending. I know Nordea is relatively aggressive, but it still seems like Nordea is losing market share within corporates in Sweden, Norway and Finland. Could you comment on who is actually taking market share in the different regions? Is it international players or is it more local players? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we are losing market share. It is more or less stable. It's moving up and down a little, and something about the statistic is also a bit uncertain. A lot of things come into this corporate market including not only private corporate but also public corporates and a number of other issues. And we also have some uncertainty on how it's actually calculated. But our general perception is that we are gaining market shares actually, especially in Sweden and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I am only looking at the stated market share within the different regions. So if I look in Finland for instance that &#x2013; it goes down from 44.4 to 33.4 in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But anyway it fluctuates between countries and quarters, but anyway it is &#x2013; the way we measure our progress in our corporate initiative is not market share and lending either, for many good reasons, more &#x2013; only as the type of income we have on ancillary business. So, when we look at our income on the corporate side it's moving up so fast, it's faster than we see others. That's the reason why we believe we gained market share. And we certainly know we gained lead relationships.</p>
          <p>So I would say that in general it is clear &#x2013; it is not only our clear perception, we know that we are gaining market share on our corporate business, not necessarily on the lending as such, which is also an area we are &#x2013; of course in light of the new capital regulations, pursuing with a lot of <mark type="inaudible" /> focus on the rating levels and the capital consumption, which is of course important in this area.</p>
          <p>So we are not necessarily lending driven our customer relationships here. But we can go back to this market share thing because it shows a number of strange things for which might &#x2013; which you can discuss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay, thank you, but do you have a feeling of who is more aggressive in the different regions then? If it's international players in Sweden is it more local players in Norway or is it relatively evenly split so to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, Maths, just a general comment, as Christian alluded to, our ambition is to be in wholesale relationship banking, so from a total share of wallet perspective our absolute conviction is that we are actually taking market share.</p>
          <p>Then &#x2013; and we've done that for quite some time, and of course those that are most aggressive now in this new landscape are basically those that have lost the most during the crisis. And of course those names you are aware of. So it's a very significant interest of course from some players to take back some relationship, and thereby doing that with lending at less attractive terms. And of course that is partly the reason. So it's not mentioning any names, but I think there is a willingness to take back what has been lost in some cases. And we'll see that quarter-to-quarter in various ways.</p>
