        <plist>
          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Bank of America Quarterly Earnings Announcement. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please note this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Stitt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Chuck Noski begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include, among other things, changes in economic condition, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>
          <p>Also joining us this morning will be Neil Cotty, our Chief Accounting Officer, who served as our Interim CFO prior to Chuck arriving here, and Neil did much of the presentation last quarter.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank all of you for joining us as we discuss our second quarter earnings. I'd welcome Chuck to his first call as CFO, and as Kevin said, Neil is with us.</p>
          <p>Just to start us off here and on Slide 4, but in general, I'm just going to give a couple of points on my perspective on the quarter. We did make a $3.1 billion in net income for the quarter, but importantly, even with the earnings, we are continuing to move our core franchise forward. Our credit quality continues to improve, in some cases faster than we anticipated, as we came into this year.</p>
          <p>As the management team and I have put together the principles we're going to operate under to make sure that we can position this company now and in the future in a way it needs to be positioned, one of the principles that we've been focused on is to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We've strengthened our capital this quarter and our reserve coverage ratios even with a release, so we have a stronger balance sheet.</p>
          <p>We all &#x2013; the team has continued to work through reductions in legacy positions, whether that's in commercial real estate, capital markets, the former Countrywide franchise or some of the loan products in Card Services.</p>
          <p>Another principle that we've been focused is narrowing the focus of our franchise, ensuring that every activity we have at Bank of America is core to our core three customer bases: consumers, companies and institutional investors. Along with that line, this quarter we sold our interest in Ita&#xFA;, in Santander Mexico. We sold the MasterCard shares we had and today we announced that we're selling Balboa Insurance consistent with this strategy.</p>
          <p>Additional principle that we've been managing to is to get ahead of the impact of new capital requirements and we've been doing that this quarter by continuing to reduce positions &#x2013; some of the positions I just spoke about &#x2013; and freeing up capital whenever we can to build our capital ratios in anticipation of the new Basel rules. In addition, this quarter we also sold some private equity positions to help us in this regard.</p>
          <p>Another principle is that we think that we &#x2013; as we look back at the cycle and what went right and what went wrong, is we have to be much stronger risk managers. And I think this quarter shows that even though we've had revenues on our Capital Markets business go down, it was the nimble way in which Tom Montag and Bruce Thompson and the team adjusted our trading positions, reducing the VaR and basically getting out of the way of the euro crisis and sovereign debt crisis this quarter.</p>
          <p>So we've made progress on those core operating principles and as &#x2013; but as we look ahead, we're well aware that the headwinds we're going to continue to face and we need to deal with and to produce the revenue and profits this company needs to produce. First, we continue to see an economy which our experts don't believe will be a double dip. They think that's a low probability, but we seen an economy that's going to grow in the 2.5% range in the second half, which continues to be below trend.</p>
          <p>Unemployment will remain at high levels, and as we look at the consumer, we're seeing even though the consumer spending has been up consistently quarter-on-quarter, we're worried about slowing momentum as the year-over-year comparisons get harder as the second half of the year was strong for the consumer. And again, we continue to watch the housing market carefully and it stays in our focus.</p>
          <p>As we look on the loan demand side, it continues to remain weak as the consumers continue to de-lever. On the commercial side, the commercial customers remain conservative by holding large amounts of cash while awaiting signs of sustained demand for their products before they need capital growth. Another area that is hitting our revenue and earnings is the impact of sustained low rate environment on this core franchise and it continues to impact the net interest margin.</p>
          <p>Another major area, and I'm sure you'll have lots of questions about this later and Chuck will talk about the areas, is the impact of new regulation. And as I look at the new regulation, a lot of people focus on the Dodd-Frank bill, but you've got to put it in the context of all the different things going on, whether it's the Reg E, the CARD Act and then the areas that will be affected by Dodd-Frank. This will cause &#x2013; the most recent is the Durbin amendment in the interchange area. This is going to cause a significant reduction in revenue in the future and a carrying value change in our asset in the credit card business and Chuck will address that later.</p>
          <p>So as you think about the quarter, it's more noise than we would have liked, but some of that is inevitable as we continue to reposition this company and as we continue to hit some turbulent markets that we did during this quarter. That said, we continue to make progress positioning our company now for the future.</p>
          <p>On Page 5, you can see the progress we made in the various customer groups in our customer-driven model. We've told you and we'll continue to tell you and the way we're managing this franchise is to take advantage of these very strong businesses that have superior positions in every part and every capability that they bring to the customer. I'm not going to go through all the points on this page, but I wanted to touch on a couple areas just to give you my perspective. Obviously, Joe Price's Consumer team has the core challenge to adopt a retail banking model in the United States to the new consumer banking reality, to mitigate the lost revenue and adjust the operating cost to meet the return goals we have in that business.</p>
          <p>In our home loans insurance business, it lost money this quarter, less than it lost last quarter, but it's sort of a tale of two cities. On one hand the &#x2013; our production &#x2013; we're number one or two in a given month or quarter, with about 20% market share on the production side. At the same time, we're devoting a ton of effort and expense to working through defaults, short sales and modifications and we're attempting to help every customer we can. In spite of all of that all hard work, we'll continue to see elevated foreclosures, short sales and other liquidations for the next several quarters, as we clean up the legacy Countrywide portfolio.</p>
          <p>Moving to the commercial side of the business, domestic commercial loan demand remains muted as companies continue to generate solid earnings and cash flow, but tell us that they are reluctant to expand due to the uncertainty they see in the future. Importantly, as the company has a global commercial franchise, that does mask that companies in Asia and Latin America and companies in the U.S. that do business in those markets are demanding capital and our business wins, especially in the corporate investment banking area, show that. And that's why we continue even during these times to invest in our international growth in the global capital markets business and the global investment &#x2013; corporate investment banking business.</p>
          <p>The third area I wanted to touch on is the sales and trading area. Tom Montag's team experienced a drop from a very, very strong first quarter, however, we still earned over a billion dollars in Global Banking and Markets, and the global markets segment produced about a third of those earnings. We continue to be impressed with the growth in the investor client activities as Tom and his team have seen both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. around the world. But in this quarter we couldn't fight the macro slowdown and euro debt issues and sovereign debt issues, so we got out of the way.</p>
          <p>Our investment banking team's performance continues to be very strong. It continues to improve on its number two ranking and is coming close to closing the gap to number one. So all in all, as you can see on Slide 5, we continue to make progress in our core customer segments. But the goal is not only to perform well in each of these segments but to get the most from the entire segment group together.</p>
          <p>So Slide 6 is a slide I've shown you before. It shows some of the successes we've had this quarter leveraging this franchise, especially between Sallie Krawcheck's Wealth Management business and Joe Price's Consumer business and David Darnell's and Tom Montag's Commercial businesses. I'm not going to read all the numbers, but I will confirm to you and commit to you that we focus on these metrics every day and like the direction that they continue to head. The principle that we are focused on is not only do we need to get everything out of each of our businesses and their component parts but in order to provide the right service to the clients and the right returns for the shareholders, we've got to do more with the whole thing.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me hand it over to Chuck to go through the quarter's numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 7, we reported net income of $31.1 billion or $0.27 per share versus $0.28 per share in the first quarter and earnings of $0.33 per share in the second quarter a year ago. Credit quality continued to improve with credit costs dropping $1.7 billion from the first quarter to 8.1 billion. This quarter had several large items having both positive and negative impacts on earnings, but we think results are representative of the challenging economy and difficult rate environment as we continue to bring down risk and position the balance sheet for the future as Brian outlined. And we think that the next few quarters will also be about improving credit while addressing the negative impact from Reg E and the CARD Act.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 8, let me briefly summarize some of the material items this quarter that impacted earnings. We had several announced asset sales during the quarter, some of which were related to our agreement to pay back TARP. Our ownership in Ita&#xFA; was sold for a pre-tax gain of $1.2 billion. Our Columbia long-term business was sold for a pre-tax gain of $60 million but resulted in a reduction of goodwill and intangibles of approximately 800 million. Our MasterCard position was sold, resulting in a pre-tax gain of 440 million. We entered into an agreement to sell our ownership interest in Santander Mexico, which generated a pre-tax loss of approximately 428 million before associated tax benefits. All of the asset sales this quarter impacted Tier 1 common equity by $2.3 billion and added 18 basis points to the Tier 1 common ratio.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 8, let me briefly summarize some of the material items this quarter that impacted &#x2013; let me talk about asset sales. Let me also add that we're exploring a potential sale before the end of the year of Balboa Insurance, one of the largest creditor placed insurers in the U.S. As most of you remember, we agreed to generate $3 billion of capital through asset sales or other actions in 2010 and have until December 31 to complete. Other items in the quarter included the credit mark on the Merrill Lynch structured notes under the fair value option that resulted in a gain of $1.2 billion and is reported in other income, but as you'll recall, there is no additional regulatory capital benefit related to this gain.</p>
          <p>We received a dividend of $535 million from our ownership stake in CCB that is reflected in equity investment income, a hike in the UK payroll tax resulted in increased personnel expense of $425 million, and finally we increased our reps and warranties expense by 722 million to $1.2 billion as a result of our continued evaluation of exposure to repurchases, including our exposure to repurchased demands from certain monoline insurers. Although this expense and related reserve are based on a life and loan calculation, the environment around repurchases continues to evolve and we will assess this reserve based on the facts available to us each quarter. We expect the level of putbacks each quarter to remain quite variable.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to Slide 9 and discuss some general financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue of $29.5 billion was down 9% from the first quarter and 18% from a year ago on a managed basis. We had a drop in net interest income of $873 million from the first quarter due to lower loan levels and the continued low interest rate environment. Sales and trading revenue declined 55% to $3.2 billion, and I'll go into further detail on that in just a minute.</p>
          <p>Expense levels were down 3% but did include the $425 million in higher personnel expense due to the UK payroll tax. Last quarter included annual retirement eligible expense of $758 million and higher litigation expense while most other expense areas were relatively flat. Our provision was down 17% with net charge-offs down 11% and reserves reduced by $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Commercial non-performing loans, leases and foreclosed properties decreased 5% from the first quarter, while commercial reservable criticized levels were down 9%, reflecting three quarters in a row of decreases. Net charge-offs were impacted this quarter by an acceleration of losses in our foreign credit card portfolio of $378 million to conform with how we account for renegotiated loans domestically. Our allowance for loan and lease losses now stands in excess of $45 billion, or 4.75% of total loans and leases versus a charge-off rate this quarter of 3.98%, and net charge-offs are expected to continue to decline.</p>
          <p>The total reserve, including the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, is nearly $47 billion compared to $48 billion last quarter. We ended the quarter with higher and stronger capital levels as Tier 1 increased 44 basis points to 10.7% versus the first quarter. Tier 1 common was up 40 basis points to 8%, and tangible common was up 13 basis points to 5.4%. Global excess liquidity increased roughly $20 billion to almost $290 billion while tighter required funding stood at 22 months.</p>
          <p>On Slide 10 you can see trends for the past five quarters. Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings dropped to approximately $12 billion, reflecting the changes you can see on the slide. Going forward we believe revenue will benefit from sales and trading performance, however this benefit will be offset by the impact of Reg E, the CARD Act, lower loan levels, low rates, and potentially other regulatory impacts not yet assessed or identified. An additional benefit to earnings will be expected decreased credit costs due to lower charge-offs and reserve reductions.</p>
          <p>Switching to the business segment slide, on Slide 11, I just want to point out that like last quarter, all business segments made money with the exception of Home Loans and Insurance. HLI had a smaller net loss than the prior quarter, $1.5 billion, versus a net loss of 2.1 billion despite higher reps and warranties expenses, $1.2 billion versus 526 million last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to net interest income on Slide 13. Net interest income on an FTE basis was 13.2 billion, down 873 million from the first quarter. This was due to lower loan levels, lower yields on credit cards and the impact of rates on both our core assets and trading book. During the quarter, the net interest yield of 2.77% decreased 16 basis points, due mainly to a shift in the mix of earning assets as higher yielding assets are replaced with lower yielding assets driven by the lower rate environment. Our average balance sheet for the quarter was down $20 billion versus the first quarter reflecting decreases in average loans of approximately $25 billion. Loans were down due to charge-offs, paydowns, and de-risking the portfolio as well as weak demand.</p>
          <p>Implementation of the CARD Act had a negative impact on net interest income this quarter due to reduced balances and an inability to re-price for risk. We expect this impact to increase in both the third and fourth quarters. As you can see on Slide 14, average loans, excluding residential mortgages, were down $29 billion or 3.8% from the first quarter, while average total deposits were up $10.6 billion or 1%.</p>
          <p>Excluding the Countrywide decrease of 2.4 billion, average retail deposits showed organic growth of $8 billion or 1.3% even as we maintained our pricing discipline. Also shown is the increase in our discretionary portfolio on an average basis versus Q1. Going forward, we expect net interest income to trend down in the second half of the year due to continued loan runoff, the impact of the CARD Act, and the low rate environment. Our overall interest rate positioning continues to be asset sensitive relative to the forward curve.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 15, card revenue began to stabilize as higher interchange offset the additional impact of the CARD Act. Total interchange is up 10% from the first quarter and 19% on a managed basis from a year ago due to higher consumer spending. We expect the Durbin amendment, as currently drafted and subject to final rulemaking, to have an adverse impact on debit card interchange starting in the second half of next year, which I will discuss later.</p>
          <p>On Slide 16, we show service charges were relatively flat at $2.6 billion, and as we mentioned in prior quarters, we made changes to our overdraft policy last year which are costing us, on average, about $160 million per quarter. Reg E will have an additional impact to service charges when it becomes effective in the third quarter this year. We believe that the total impact of these changes will be reflected in the fourth quarter numbers. We're estimating overall service charges in the fourth quarter to be around $2 billion, which will fully reflect Reg E versus the $2.6 billion this quarter. Obviously, we will look to mitigate some of this impact going forward.</p>
          <p>Mortgage banking income on Slide 17 dropped from the first quarter as a result of higher reps and warranties expense. Production levels in first mortgage increased to approximately 72 billion from approximately 70 billion in the first quarter. And in core production revenue we experienced higher margins and lock volumes. Total reps and warranties expense in the quarter was $1.2 billion and the reserve increased $600 million to $3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Core servicing income increased from the prior quarter and was offset by less favorable MSR results, net of hedges, compared to the first quarter, while the market-driven decline in the MSR value of $4 billion was effectively hedged. The capitalization rate for the consumer mortgage MSR asset ended the quarter at a low 86 basis points due to the drop in rates at the end of the quarter versus 110 basis points in the first quarter. Reflecting the impact of increased home purchase transactions driven by the federal tax credit and seasonality, we saw an increase in the level of purchase mix in our fundings to 53%. Given the drop in rates over the past few weeks, we would expect production volumes to remain in line with the second quarter as refinance volumes offset the expected drop in purchase volumes due to the expiration of the first-time home buyer program.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 18, as we said earlier, the sale of the Columbia long-term business generated a pre-tax gain and reduced goodwill and intangibles. Investment and brokerage fees were down 1% from the first quarter as an increase in brokerage fees was offset by the decrease in asset management fees related to the sale of the Columbia business. Asset management fees of 1.4 billion were down 6% from the first quarter, while brokerage fees increased 4% due to higher transactional activity.</p>
          <p>Normalizing for the sale of Columbia, we showed an increase in asset management fees of 6% driven by higher market valuations in the first quarter as well as seasonal tax fees. Clearly given the market valuations at the end of the second quarter, this trend will reverse itself in our third quarter results. Assets under management ended the quarter at just over $600 billion; down due to the sale of Columbia's equity and fixed income, lower market valuations and outflows from the former Columbia cash complex. We also continue to experience stability and retention in the level of our wealth advisors.</p>
          <p>Sales and trading revenue on Slide 19 of $3.2 billion, which includes both net interest income and non-interest income, dropped approximately 55% from a great first quarter due to general market deterioration as a result of concerns around the global economy and a lack of liquidity as sovereign debt fears and the regulatory uncertainty fueled investor concerns. Compared to the prior quarter, FICC revenue dropped 58% to $2.3 billion, driven mainly by lower results in credit products and rates and currencies, and equity revenue also declined. Net write-downs on legacy assets were relatively minor in both periods.</p>
          <p>Investment banking revenue on Slide 20 increased 6% from the first quarter, although down 20% from a very strong quarter a year ago. Results were driven by an increase in M&amp;A and leverage finance, and our monthly results in the quarter followed a U-shaped pattern as markets declined in May and global fee pools reached their lowest monthly totals since 2003. Then revenues rebounded in June to the levels we saw in April. Our overall global fee ranking remains stable at number two when compared to the first quarter, but we believe we substantially narrowed the gap between number one and number two this quarter. Our revenue remains concentrated in the Americas versus a more diversified global mix at some of our peers, and consequently, we continue to focus on that opportunity with key hires in relationship building in important markets outside the U.S.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the remaining revenue categories on Slide 21. Equity investment income reflects the activity for the quarter I described earlier. Net gains from the sale of debt securities were $37 million and included losses of $711 million on sales of non-agency RMBS sold as a result of a change in certain portfolio objectives to focus on capital management and credit risk reduction. Other income also reflected insurance revenue of $678 million, down a bit from the first quarter but slightly up from a year ago and also included the credit mark on Merrill Lynch structured notes.</p>
          <p>Let me say a couple things about expense levels on Slide 22. Total expenses decreased $522 million from the first quarter due to the absence of $758 million in expense associated with retirement eligible stock grants we normally incur in the first quarter as well as lower litigation expense, offset by an increase due to the second quarter UK payroll tax. Personnel expense compared to a year ago was up $1 billion, reflecting the UK payroll tax as well as higher expenses for the build-out of our Global Markets and GCIB businesses as well as the higher level of head count and expense at Home Loans to address loan modifications and workouts.</p>
          <p>In addition, compared to last year, we are seeing the impact of deferred compensation in our Markets businesses that was granted last year and is hitting expense this year. We're watching expense levels closely, and we'll take appropriate actions if and when our outlook changes. Excluding personnel expense, expenses were down 2% from the first quarter and 8% from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Before moving to credit quality, let me add a few comments around income taxes. Due to capital gains from special items during this quarter, the effective tax rate of 17.7% included a $250 million tax benefit from the partial release of a valuation allowance from the Merrill Lynch capital losses carried forward. Separately, you may have read that the UK has announced that it intends to lower its corporate tax rate in the third quarter by 1% effective in 2011. Although this is good news from a cash tax cost perspective, this change, when enacted, will require us to write down our UK net deferred assets by approximately $400 million. The UK Treasury has announced plans for further reductions in the UK tax rate in future years. Similar charges to income tax expense would result upon enactment for each additional future 1% reduction in the UK tax rate.</p>
          <p>Moving to asset quality on Slide 24, we continue to see an improving trend as net charge-offs decreased $1.2 billion from the first quarter to 9.6 billion. Consumer improvement in the unsecured lending portfolios reflected lower losses while consumer real estate stabilized. Commercial asset quality also improved as net charge-offs and reservable criticized declined for the third straight quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 25, as I mentioned, during the quarter in the foreign credit card portfolio, we had an acceleration of $378 million in charge-offs to conform to our domestic charge-off policies. Excluding this impact, foreign credit card charge-offs would have been $564 million versus 631 million in the first quarter. In addition, if you remember last quarter, we had approximately $800 million of consumer real estate charge-offs on collateral dependent modified loans upon the implementation of new regulatory guidance. The collateral dependent impact for the current quarter was $142 million, and also, as we've done in past quarters, we repurchased government insured delinquent loans because it is more economical than to continue to advance principal and interest at the security rate. These loans are insured by the government, but do in fact show up in our 30-plus performing delinquency measures.</p>
          <p>Turning to credit quality trends on Slide 26, total net charge-offs of $9.6 billion decreased 1.2 billion compared to net charge-offs in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of collateral dependent modified loans in the first quarter and the foreign credit card adjustment this quarter, consumer losses versus the first quarter were down $813 million and commercial losses were down 134 million. The allowance for loan losses decreased $1.5 billion through the provision. This was driven by improving delinquencies, collections and bankruptcies in our domestic consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios and improvement in our dealer financial services portfolio. These reductions were partially offset by reserve increases associated with the consumer real estate portfolios including $328 million for the Countrywide purchase credit impaired portfolio and $600 million for other consumer real estate loans.</p>
          <p>On the commercial side, reserves on our core commercial portfolio decreased 350 million as we've seen broad based improvement in customer credit profiles, resulting in lower reservable criticized levels.</p>
          <p>On Slide 27, we show you the trend in non-performers. In the consumer area, we saw an increase of $483 million. The pace of increase slowed from the first quarter as delinquency inflows have slowed in residential mortgage and home equity. Commercial non-performers decreased just over $700 million from the end of first quarter driven by paydowns, charge-offs, and asset sales.</p>
          <p>Almost all the decrease in NPAs was real estate related, although most categories were down. Approximately 95% of commercial NPAs are collateralized and approximately 40% are contractually current. Total commercial NPAs are carried at about 21% of original value before considering loan loss reserves.</p>
          <p>On Slides 28 and 29, you can see that excluding the impact of delinquent government insured loans, consumer delinquency trends continue to improve. 30 plus delinquencies decreased approximately $3 billion or 14%, excluding the impact of delinquent government insured loans. Delinquent government insured loans added $2 billion to the 30-plus delinquency levels although they are still insured. These government insured loans are primarily related to repurchases from Ginnie Mae securitizations for economic reasons.</p>
          <p>We can finance these loans with a cheaper rate on our balance sheet and our risk exposure is the same whether we are the servicer or the holder of these assets, since they are insured. Commercial reservable criticized levels declined by $4.9 billion or 9% versus a drop of 3.4 billion in the first quarter, representing three straight quarters of decreases. These decreases were broad based across all clients and industries.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 shows you the trends of consumer charge-offs. As you can see, all categories continue to improve or stabilize, even with the acceleration of losses of the quarter in foreign credit card. Going forward, we expect to see continued improvement. On Slide 31, you see that commercial charge-offs peaked in the third quarter of last year, although we did see a small $30 million uptick in commercial real estate charge-offs this quarter.</p>
          <p>Getting back to home equity, let me elaborate a bit on our home equity book on Slide 32. We covered this information last quarter and since it hasn't changed significantly, we won't go into it in detail today. I'll just remind you that although losses are still elevated, the vast majority of this book are not piggyback loans for home purchase or refinance, but rather the loans that consumers used in most cases for non real estate purposes. Collateral and reserves exist to partially offset future losses and 94% of the loans, with combined loan to values greater than 100%, are current.</p>
          <p>Turning to capital liquidity highlights on Slide 34, our liquidity position strengthened during the quarter as customers continued to de-lever and through a shift into more liquid assets in our discretionary portfolio. Cash and cash equivalents were up $6 billion and our global excess liquidity sources ended the period up about $20 billion from the end of the first quarter. Remember, that consists of both cash and highly liquid unencumbered investment securities such as U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage backed securities held at the parent, our banks, and our broker dealers, which are readily available to meet our liquidity needs as they arise.</p>
          <p>We think it is prudent, given low interest rates, to maintain a high level of liquidity, and we continue to be very measured in our approach to reinvestment. As noted on our last call, we'll continue to be selective in going to the debt markets and diversifying our funding footprint, but we expect our benchmark issuance to be substantially less than our maturities.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, our GAAP capital levels will benefit from the initial mark-to-market of our ownership position in CCB, currently carried at cost. This is because the shares become unrestricted in the third quarter of 2011, resulting in a mark in OCI beginning one-year prior. The mark impacts GAAP capital, not regulatory capital, and the related unrealized gain at June 30 was roughly $12 billion pre-tax.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 35, I've already pointed out our increased regulatory capital levels. We view these levels as strong and believe we can increase these levels over the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>On Slide 36 we've listed several pieces included in regulatory reform. We have already discussed the impact of the CARD Act and Reg E, and we're still gauging the impact of derivative and proprietary trading reform. Although we're still waiting for more clarity, we believe the impact will be manageable given that we do distinguish between fiduciary and trading businesses. In addition, a large part of our revenue and earnings is generated by client-focused businesses, versus proprietary activity.</p>
          <p>As for the Durbin amendment, let's turn to Slide 37. All of our consumer and small business card products, including our debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within the Global Cards Services segment. When the financial reform bill is signed into law, the Durbin amendment will impact the future revenues generated by our debit card business. We estimate that our debit card revenue for 2010 will be approximately $2.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Although subject to final rulemaking over the next year, we estimate that the decrease in annualized revenue before mitigation could be as much as 1.8 billion to $2.3 billion starting in the third quarter of 2011. The estimated shortfall in revenue would impact the carrying value of the $22 billion of goodwill currently included in the Global Card Services segment.</p>
          <p>Using these revenue estimates, we estimate that the impairment of goodwill to be reported in the third quarter of 2010 could potentially be in the range of 7 to $10 billion. We will continue to explore mitigation initiatives, not all of which will be reflected in the Global Card Services segment. The amount of impairment recorded in the third quarter will be after consideration of the value of mitigation initiatives applicable to Global Card Services that exist at that time.</p>
          <p>Before we open it up for questions, let me reiterate that 2010 is an environment where earnings and capital formation are the goals. The economy and the consumer at the present time are still delevering so core revenue growth is difficult. The improvement in credit in quality is better than our expectations in March and our outlook for the rest of the year has also improved. However, we do have revenue headwinds that we highlighted in the second half of the year as customers continue to delever and we realize the full adoption of legislation.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned in the first quarter, from an earnings perspective it will be the dynamic of how fast credit improves and expenses are kept under control versus the drop in revenue. We are focused on internal investments and service levels that continue to benefit our customers and believe that the long-term business model of the company positions us well to emerge much stronger competitively.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll now open it up for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give a little more clarity on the outlook for net interest income? It was down about 900 million this quarter, some of it's obviously from trading and that's always hard to project, but your comments that it's going to trend down going forward, do you think we'd have similar declines to what we had this quarter or more modest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they'll certainly be similar. We don't expect them to be quite as significant the last half of the year. Of course that will depend upon the environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing to keep in mind is as you watch the reduction in loans and quarter to quarter, some of it's core loans that the economy just continues to retract, but some of it also is stuff in our portfolios that we're trying to run off.</p>
          <p>In those portfolio are typically fairly high yields, but they also have a fairly high credit cost. So that dynamic has been going on for several quarters. It starts to mitigate as you get over the next few quarters, because those portfolios are being run down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separately, what are the assumptions that you're using in terms of how much the debit card revenues might decline on a gross basis? It just seemed like a pretty big decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, keep in mind the numbers that we gave reflect no mitigation actions, and obviously over the forthcoming months and as we watch the rulemaking by the Fed, we'll be adjusting our business model to attempt to mitigate as much of that as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it seems like one potential offset for the industry would be bringing down the rewards. Can you just remind us, do you have rewards attached to your debit cards, and is that a pretty big cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not a significant part of our debit card. On the credit card it would be, but not on the debit card as much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just lastly if I may, the non-performing assets were relatively flat quarter-to-quarter and it's still early in the earnings season, but we're seeing declines at some other banks. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on why the pace of improvement there is maybe taking a little bit longer than at some other places?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's largely the impact of some of these legacy portfolios that Brian was referring to.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Betsy. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So a couple of questions. One is just on the FICC line, was there any one-timers in there this quarter? I know you had peers so far down &#x2013; about a third Q-on-Q and you were down a lot more than that. I was just wondering what was in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you have impacts of CDA and other things that, Betsy, it's hard to say they-re one-time or not one-time. We just had a very strong quarter in the first quarter, so I think I'd look at it as more there are pluses and minuses in the first quarter, plus and minus in the second quarter. I think it's our relative strength in the first quarter from our franchise that made our potential due to market conditions to come down further.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you can get into quarter 2 line items about ins and outs of this but I think it's better said that probably we just had a very strong quarter first quarter, compared to what we had had in prior quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just when I look at your FICC line and trading relative to the underwriting, it looked like the way we think about multiples there, the multiple came down a bit. So and then you indicated that the trading team was nimble ahead of the European market correction so just wondering if there was anything that they did that might have been a near term..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To give you a sense, we run about 300 million round numbers of average &#x2013; 280, 300 million of average VaR. In the first quarter &#x2013; we were down to about 180 in the second quarter. They took the risk down because they weren't sure of the direction, and that gives up opportunities if they would have gotten it right. So I think it was more making sure that we managed the risk down than it was &#x2013; we just thought it was so volatile. I think Tom and his team just thought it was so volatile they just got out of the way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay and then just separately, I know you spoke about the &#x2013; on the commentary around Durbin already, but maybe I could just ask it from a slightly different angle, which is what are the key drivers to the assumptions that come up with the 1.8 to $2.3 billion reduction, the 60 to 80% reduction in that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's largely our interpretation of the law, Betsy. If you look at the rule making flexibility of the Fed, it's actually pretty narrow. They have some definitional opportunities there, but as we've assessed it, they don't have a lot of wiggle room in terms of being able to modify what's written in the amendment.</p>
          <p>Again, I want to emphasize that that estimate assumes no mitigating actions and, as you might imagine, Joe Price and his team are working diligently to determine the appropriate ways to mitigate the impact of Durbin. Some of those mitigating actions may occur in other business segments of Bank of America and wouldn't necessarily be reflected in the Card segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, because basically the Fed's required to look at what the cost to provide the service is, and so is it fair to assume, therefore, that your revenue decline is &#x2013; brings down your debit fees to the cost to provide that service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've made some assumptions. We believe we're probably the most efficient provider of that service. But we do have some expectations that the Fed is not going to require a merchant to offer a different rates, if you will, for every single credit card that a consumer might bring to its store.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, it's a &#x2013; at the margin, in isolation is a very profitable activity. And when you go from full recovery of revenue to only cost recovery, the impact is substantial. The issue is it's not a severable activity in a sense from all the other things that customer does from us. So there's other ways to make money and other ways to mitigate it. But when you look at that narrow revenue stream, that's a fairly profitable revenue stream, because it's very leveraged because you're not taking into account any of the cost of originating the customer, servicing the other parts of accounts, running 18,000 ATMs that they have access to at 6000 branches and that's part of the conundrum in the statute, quite frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The Durbin amendment, Betsy, remember, allows us to recover incremental cost and as Brian said, the cost of bringing that &#x2013; the aggregate cost of bringing that service to the customer, the fixed cost we have and the overhead are substantial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And so reward program you mentioned is not as big as in credit card, but there is some reward program associated with debit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very minor. We'll get you that, Betsy, but don't think of that as a relevant question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the goodwill charge would come when?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When the President signs &#x2013; in the quarter in which the President signs the bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So it would be in the third quarter of '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Even though the rulemaking could change and you're just taking that &#x2013; your scenario as the base case scenario?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our judgment, Betsy, as we look again at the degree of flexibility that the Fed has to write the rules, it's fairly narrow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of flexibility, we've made a judgment that under any reasonable range of outcomes, we think we'll have an impairment in goodwill, and under the accounting rules, when you've reached that judgment, then you've got to measure it as best you can and take the charge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In a matter of transparency, it's the law of the land when he signs it. The question exactly impact could be subject to some interpretation, but we've got to take it when it becomes the law of the land.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And during the quarter as we evaluate mitigating actions, we will come back with our best estimate at the end of the third quarter. That will be the charge we take. We will continue to work to improve the performance of that business through other mitigating actions. But to the extent that those mitigating actions occur in a different business segment, we really can't take credit for it in making this goodwill impairment measurement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And do you know when the timing of those mitigating action announcements would end up being? Do you have any date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is going to be in my mind a one, two, three-year type of work. It's going to be changing. As I said in my comments, Betsy, Joe and the team have been hard at and will start to roll out changes in the core way the customer accounts operate, of which this is a part. And so it's not an overnight thing. It's going to be over a series of the next 6 to 12 quarters before we can identify it and get it through &#x2013; back in the P&amp;L.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess two questions: First I think it's a fairly easy one. When you talk about the billion after tax for the CARD Act, could you indicate to us how much of that might already be embedded in the 2Q run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About a quarter of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then secondarily, given the different types of re-reg related headwinds that we've discussed and you've discussed on the call, are you giving any thought to reconsidering your stance on Reg E and sort of going back and reconsidering whether you might work to change that policy and get customers to opt in to try to recover some of those overdraft charges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're the largest consumer franchise and especially in the sort of core consumer markets. As we looked at the change we made in Reg E, we were very comfortable we made the right changes for the good of the customer. And I think even if a customer opts in, quite frankly, the next time they overdraft and hit four, five overdraft fees for a cup of coffee and a few things, they're going to realize that that was not the choice they wanted to make. It's clear from the customer research we do, and so I don't think that's the way to go.</p>
          <p>I think the way to go is to move away from the penalty that the intersection of the overdraft charges, the toughness in the economy, people stretching their paychecks as far as they can, and then the way the charges worked. And think of that through and go to less penalizing a certain group of customers and spread it across the broader group of customer base so we can achieve a return on the business, because the outcome of a specific customer interactions, we had a small percentage of our customers are paying a good chunk of the fees. And it just &#x2013; when you looked at it in hindsight, it's not the right way to treat them. I don't think them opting in is going to change that dynamic, and I think they'll be upset once they opt in down the road.</p>
          <p>And so rather than go through opting them in and then having to fight about it again, I think the better course is to get it over with and start to charge a better way. And we've seen our customers respond from &#x2013; our attrition rates are way down. And if you actually look at the overdraft fees, they have come down some over the last couple quarters, but they're stabilizing and stuff, and the customers are understanding it. We expect them to continue to drop as Reg E comes in, but on the other hand it's the best thing for the customer. So I think other people have taken different positions, and we'll see, but we've taken a consistent position. We won't have such a penalty-oriented pricing in this franchise, or else we'll be destroying the value of the franchise over the long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brian. And then lastly if you could just maybe give a little bit of a big picture answer to sort of the question of &#x2013; we're obviously seeing throughout the banking industry a lot of revenue headwinds related to lack of loan growth, net interest incomes coming down. We've got all these re-reg related headwinds that we're discussing. What would be the big picture opportunity for Bank of America to kind of go back through and really take a hard look at its operating expense base and bring down operating cost related to some of these revenue headwinds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at &#x2013; you have to sort the businesses, I think, into different parts for that. So if you look at the consumer business and you just look at the numbers of branches we had four quarters ago versus now, you'll see they're down a couple, few hundred. If you look at even trimming some of the ATMs, changing the functionality of the ATMs, there's no question that Joe Price and his team are hard at work on the cost structure &#x2013; how to mitigate this by revenue and by cost, and he has to do that. He knows it, and he's working on it.</p>
          <p>If you back up in the broader picture to all consumer segments, we're still suffering in the Card business and in the Mortgage business the impacts of the delinquency servicing costs, for lack of a better term, and to give you a sense, it's probably a good loan is $30-ish of service or something like that, and a tough loan is 700, $800 of service. So that has borrower costs way up, and likewise in the credit card. So in those businesses, the cost structures are being worked on as we speak, and will have to continue to be worked on with the caveat that until we sort of break the back on the hard work around foreclosures and defaults and the delinquencies, the last thing you'd want us to do is pull back on the resources dedicated to that.</p>
          <p>Let me completely flip that to the other side in something like Tom's business. Tom's business is a revenue business, and you can see it in the quarter-to-quarter in terms of the $3 billion plus in profit in this first quarter and 900 in this quarter that the challenge there is all about people. So what you don't want to do is go pick up the costs as we're building out and driving the business and driving the profitability on the basis of one downdraft in the quarter. So as I look at it, each business is different. We will have to drive the costs down, but it's differentiated. We'll have to drive the costs down overall and we have. Then on personnel expenses I think we're down 8% in a linked quarter basis and stuff and we'll continue to do that.</p>
          <p>But I think we have to be careful about which business and how. And then in the broadest context, one of the reasons why we're getting rid of some of these non-core activities is a restructuring that not only has the value of capital, but also has a value on a more straightforward company. So to the extent we can get that out, we can take down some of the costs attributable to that from unique operations, which are not sort of scaleable into the broader base. So you're absolutely right. Over the next several years, costs are going to be an issue for our industry, especially on the consumer side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What was the loan utilization in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it changed significantly. On revolving credit lines, it's &#x2013; we report different numbers, but it's sort of core middle market credits. It used to run 40s, now they run 30s. So the actual utilization rate is a little different when you mix some of the smaller business credits. But if you think about a core middle market company, it's not moved up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's still &#x2013; I had 37% in the first quarter. Is it still 37%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in the aggregate, but I think, Mike, as I look at it, I always focus on the lower sized companies than larger. I look at the core middle market companies. It's even lower than that and has been steady. So there's no loan demand, because there's no demand for the products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that &#x2013; it didn't get worse? It just stayed flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and that &#x2013; yeah. As we look out, Mike, I think that that we have seen some stability in the applications in our small business credit. We've seen some stability in those numbers, but the operative word stability not optimism yet. But if you went back two quarters, you had noticed that you were still coming down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're shedding a lot of assets. What about CCB and BlackRock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CCB is a strategic asset for us, and we'll let you know when we make the decisions about various things. But I think that the CCB asset &#x2013; we have a strategic relationship that is broadening as we speak, and we benefit by it. BlackRock, as I have said many times, is a great company and we're very happy with it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then back to the NPA question, it seems like the prime mortgage NPAs went up by a few percent this quarter. Why is that staying up? And do you think we're going to have a double dip? And when does that come down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean by double dip in housing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our experts don't &#x2013; our internal comments would think that the probability of the double dip is low, as I said, and I think that applies to both to housing and the general economy. But the question on the NPAs, I'd make sure we understand exactly the question, because I missed you right at the beginning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry. Just the NPAs in residential mortgage were up linked quarter, and I'm just wondering when you think you might see a turn for the better in that category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're still a few quarters away. I mean, it's cut in half from the first quarter, so I think as &#x2013; over the next couple quarters I'd say you'd start to see that mitigate. So if you look at &#x2013; it was 1.1 billion growth in the first 677 &#x2013; on Page 27 you can see it, Mike, so. But I still think we're a few quarter away on that. It would actually be the slowest. If you think about what's happened, the Card business turned around sort of first because it frankly is the easiest to move to reposition.</p>
          <p>And then the Commercial business turned around, the C&amp;I business that broke through pretty quickly again because, frankly, the team did a great job in underwriting I think through the cycle and then was able to get it done. The real estate related stuff is just slower moving, and the consumer real estate, commercial real estate will take us a little longer to completely break the backs of the credit in total even though they're coming down and getting a little better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any other factors that are influencing that? You mentioned elevated foreclosures as you clean up Countrywide. Anything else related to government intervention that's changing and therefore that's impacting the outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quarter to quarter the government programs are basically the same, and we've modified our 600+ thousand. What we have done is during the second quarter, I forget exactly which month, but basically we started releasing people who aren't going to qualify for permanent mods into the foreclosure process, and so that &#x2013; remember we used to say we had 700,000 total mods and then dropped to 600,000, and largely that was a release. So the process is moving through the system. It's a difficult process, but there's been no substantive change in terms of government support for the modification programs. We're finishing up on the work that we're doing there and continue to originate modifications in accordance with the currently outstanding programs.</p>

          <p>Brian, I'm sure we talked about this so none of this will be a surprise to him. Mike, if I think about my priorities, open and direct communication with our shareholders and other constituencies, doing the right thing, doing it the right way, a disciplined approach to our finances, focusing on returns not absolute size, committed to a strong balance sheet, strong capital with adequate liquidity through the cycle. We're going to focus on our core businesses. We're not going to get diverted into other activities, and obviously focus on strong controls and expense management. So that's my focus. Those are my priorities.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions here. Brian, you spoke several times about de-risking the company. Could you just go through and sort of summarize the major areas that are being "de-risked"? And if there's any way, and I realize this is very difficult to sort of size the impact that that de-risking may have had on second quarter results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just in the broad context, I think going through the customer groups, on the consumer side when we talk about taking out the risk, in the unsecured lending products, the card products, we had a consumer lending portfolio, which is a high point well over $20 billion. It is now down to 16 and will continue to effectively run to zero over the next few years. We had obviously legacy assets from Countrywide, which we are continuing to run down, some of which are in the Consumer segment, some of which are in the central segments, but we're running those down.</p>
          <p>The home equity book we're continuing to let drift off some of the tougher areas where we probably originated credit to &#x2013; on too unfavorable terms to the customer. And then in the very small business area, that was an area if you remember our charge-off rates ran almost 18 to 19%, and that's come down. It's down to about $12 billion in the second quarter. I think at the high point, I'd say it was 15 or 17. In the consumer it's more running off sort of non-core portfolios or portfolios that have risk in them we take. And so I can't off the top of my head say exactly what happened, but it is taking up revenue. And frankly some of those yields in some of those portfolios are actually higher yields than the core consumer card would be.</p>
          <p>When you look at the commercial side of the business, our core middle market business is very strong, and we're doing everything we can to grow loan balances. There's just not a lot of demand. But on the commercial real estate side, for example, we had &#x2013; in loans we have a couple of these large deals. One of them we liquidated in what we used to call large floaters, but one of them we liquidated this quarter. We expect to liquidate the rest of them. So they're stuck, large commercial real estate deals. And then the rest of David's portfolio has actually been very strong. And then when you go to the large corporate portfolio, it's performed very well, meaning lending portfolio in Tom's world and we would be doing ain't there. In Tom's world it's really the legacy trading assets, the yield run-down, wrapped asset run-down, and we just continue to run that off.</p>
          <p>So from an asset portfolio side, it's a whole bunch of pieces, and I can ask Kevin and those guys to try to take a stab at it. But I think, let me go back to a broader perspective as you think about over the next several quarters. What I think we owe you over the next few quarters, Nancy, in parts it's working through it, make sure we have a good handle, is sort of the core, non-core view as we work out as to where the loan portfolios that we expect to carry and want to carry and how they are behaving versus portfolios that aren't. And we'll do more for you in each quarter in the quarters going forward. It's just been as we've been making the transition here, it's been harder to isolate them and getting Chuck on board, sort of getting it put together, lot of other things going on, but we will do a better job showing you as you come out of this year and the economy stabilizes what the core asset side looks like and try to highlight that for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Also there was a story yesterday in the Wall Street Journal about some of the initiatives that are taking place in the branch network, and I'm wondering when Joe is going to address &#x2013; is going to speak to us about what's going on there or you're going to do any kind of sort of strategic review of what's going on in retail. And is there any expense associated with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we told you &#x2013; told you I think in the last call is our anticipation would be to come to you in the early next year with sort of a complete layout of the company an investor day that we haven't done in a few years to lay it all out. I'm sure, frankly, between now and then Joe will be in situations where he'll talk about it, but the thing is things change. We were here 90 days ago, the idea of interchange being a relevant question, I don't think was on anybody's mind. So we're trying to make sure that we get the rules of the road set, and then we can react to them. So the last call would have been Reg E and CARD Act. This call it's interchange and the questions. We've got to sort of make sure that we have the cement forming under the rules and then we can do it. So it's going to take a few quarters.</p>
          <p>It's not that they're sitting on their hands. We piloted the products in Georgia and other areas where &#x2013; the all-electronic product. We piloted some of the monthly fee products and things like that. So they'll be making some of those changes even as we wait to the transformational new products set around the core consumer checking which will roll out next year. But they're starting to put some of those changes in, all consistent with the core thought process that shifts from more penalty-oriented pricing to more broad-based pricing, and with a thought process that says we have to provide a return for you and our shareholders in consumer banking. Its ROE's 11%. That business has to produce a lot more for that &#x2013; for us to be able to do what we need to do in our balance sheet. So it's all the levers. They'll pull them all and we'll be &#x2013; as the quarters go on here and we get more used to what the rules really say, then we'll be able to show you more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one final question. I think Mike Mayo had used the term cleaning up Countrywide. And I would just ask how far through that process do you feel that you are at this point? And when do we get to Countrywide sort of looking like "a normal mortgage company?"</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you separate it in two pieces, I think the front end we're finishing the last part of the integration of the systems and implementing the full image-based systems and stuff. And one of the things we don't talk about is we've had some of the largest systems work ever done in our company's history going in on the weekends now with Merrill Lynch and Countrywide and completed very well and stuff. So from the front end, they've completed that work. And so from a production side, they're still about a month away from having fully done I think, a couple months in, in terms of the last pieces of it, and we had to slow down a little bit to make sure it was really working right.</p>
          <p>But from the production side we're 20% market share sort of quarter in, month in, quarter in, quarter out. So that's sort of behind us, one brand in the market, core products, what we want to do, adjusted all the buy box so to speak, adjusted the product framers. That's done. It's really now the back end and this is &#x2013; think about it as 1 million 2 million, 3 million, 4 loans that we have just to work through. And then the subsequent work through those loans which may need to be touched again, and that's &#x2013; so it's sort of bifurcating in two pieces right now. And so I'd say it's still probably &#x2013; I think this year, next year, and into '12 before you see that back end really go over the edge and you see significant reduction and it's past the point we get to a normalized sort of default practice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I've got basically kind of two questions. Just expanding on the Durbin, could you maybe flesh out what kind of actions you would take both inside the card business and outside the card business to mitigate that? And kind of a corollary, as compared to the overdraft where you didn't take kind of goodwill write-downs when Reg E cut your overdraft fee revenues, why would you take them now before this is kind of fully fleshed out and your mitigating actions are in place? Could you kind of differentiate between the two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the back half of that question and leave the front half for Brian. What we do each quarter for our key businesses where we have substantial goodwill balances is go through an assessment, a two-step assessment as required by the accounting standards to determine whether or not the carrying value of our goodwill holds up. And so that's an incremental kind of an effort. And frankly when the first round of regulatory changes came into effect or were announced, we had plenty of headroom, if you will, in our goodwill impairment calculations. The impact of this most recent set of legislation was more significant, and so we have been doing this evaluation regularly, but with the consideration of the Durbin amendment, it did trigger the signals to us that we had an impairment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you think about the CARD Act, that will take into account the valuation as of the June quarter, and we were to the plus. It's next quarter, and we all anticipate the President will sign the law next week, that will hit you. Then the difference also is the segments. The overdraft fees in the Consumer segment, this goodwill comes from the purchase of MBNA. We got to start back there. And that was a card company and we put our payments business together under the leadership of Bruce Hammonds and Ric Struthers and now Susan Faulkner back then and put the two together so the segment was reported separately. In the retail business where the overdrafts go, there's a hugely &#x2013; a whole bunch of revenue streams including a bunch of margin obviously on the deposit business that supports the goodwill number which is actually less in this business. So it's just not been an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, sorry to harp on this, but you didn't buy a signature debit business with MBNA so where is that goodwill &#x2013; how is that goodwill coming from that acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on the enterprise, which is our consumer payments business, which is a combination of our debit card business, credit card business. That was put together two, three years ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our global credit &#x2013; our Global Card segment has both debit and credit in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it has for a significant period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so as changes have occurred in legislation affecting either debit or credit, they've affected our future projections and valuations of goodwill, and this was &#x2013; this most recent action is the one that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it tipped you over the edge with respect to the valuation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as the mitigating actions inside and outside of the segment, could you talk about that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; for the overdraft and the debit interchange, you basically think about it as you have a checking account and you have how you're going to charge for the checking account. You can pick up revenue obviously by the spread on the deposits, you could pick it up revenue by the fees. So the mitigating actions from the revenue side are along those dimensions which is different types of fee structures, higher minimum balances, still charging for overdrafts and other things that occur on the check side and things like that and then potentially new products that they're working on that will provide some of the benefits that people wanted from an overdraft &#x2013; prepaid debit and things like that, so we're working on those.</p>
          <p>Those &#x2013; it's all around either the fee side, payment with monthly fees, et cetera, or the spread side. One of the issues until rates rise, the spread side is relatively inelastic, because on the checking you're charging zero, so the values really come as the core rate structure moves up. And then the issue as we've said before, some of that falls in the deposits line of business and some of it falls in -but from the standpoint of how customers think about it, they're paying for a checking account, 6,000 branches, 18,000 ATMs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

          <p>Okay. Just kind of a follow-up on a different issue and that is, you talked about the compensation line, but with a significant reduction kind of linked quarter $4 billion roughly in trading profits, I guess shouldn't we have expected to see a little more of a reduction on the personnel expense accruals? I guess maybe could you flesh out that versus the deferred comp that you alluded to in the press release?</p>

          <p>Given the variability between the two quarters, I think you really have to look at it on a year-to-date basis, and a year-to-date basis we're in the sort of mid to high 30s in terms of our accrual, in terms of a percentage of revenues. And depending upon how the rest of the year goes, that seems like a good year-to-date kind of number.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Brian, I think I've heard you talk in the past about the pre-tax pre-provision earnings power of the company eventually being 52 to $60 billion. With this quarter the Durbin bill maybe hitting by 2 billion with maybe the margin spread was down by 1 billion, that's 4 billion annualized, the fee income included, the DVA of over $1 billion, the rep and warranty moved up a little bit higher, does this quarter or FinReg details make you change how you think about this 52 to $60 billion? Or do you think that needs to be lowered a bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if I ever talked about that number, but &#x2013; in the past because I think we saw 14 billion round numbers and then 12 and what we try to make sure people don't annualize the 14 off the first quarter, because we thought trading had an out-size nice. But I think as you look forward, I think an idea in that high range would be &#x2013; based on everything we know today, that would probably be more than we'd expect. On the other hand, we have time to work through some of this mitigation, some of these provisions.</p>
          <p>So I think our view is that if people are up at the high end of that range, I think they are high compared to the things that have hit us since &#x2013; even like interchange has hit us since the time we made that. So I think as we look in the future, in near-term future quarters, I think we've been clear that the 12 billion that's had some pluses and minuses &#x2013; you put trading back in, take some stuff out, that's more in the range that we're talking about, 11, 12 billion for the near term with some pluses and minuses each quarter going through.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Brian, I hope you don't think I'm harping on this or everyone else is, on the Durbin amendment, I'm just trying to struggle to see what assumptions you're using in which the Durbin amendment pretty much knocks off 70% of debit interchange fees. Can you share the assumptions that you're using?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The broad assumption is you went from ability to charge to ability to only get recovery of cost, incremental costs of supplying the service. And so, Chuck, you've been tearing apart the assumptions that get us there, and Neil could add to it. But it's from a broad perspective. You have to read what that law says which is that you can recover incremental cost. This is why we were so &#x2013; as an industry, trying to make sure that people understood that because it's an unusual event for someone to regulate a particular transaction between two businesses to only allow you recovery of cost. That's a very unusual event in American history.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, appreciate, if you go and read the rules carefully, and there's still some wiggle room with the Fed in terms of their rulemaking, we're able to recover incremental costs. So the overhead, the infrastructure, a lot of the things that we offer our retail customers in the banking centers is not incremental, and so this was a particularly lucrative business for us. As Brian said, this is not going to benefit the consumers at all. This is simply a movement between different businesses of profitability.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Amazing. Brian, one follow-up I think Betsy had earlier, in FICC trading, was there any issues with European sovereign debt that might have brought down the trading amount in the quarter? It seemed like you were lower than what I've seen from maybe Citi and J.P. Morgan. I know you qualified that by saying that you took risk off the table during the quarter, but was there any type of items related to foreign or sovereign debt issues in the quarter that impacted that more significantly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not anything significant in terms of the &#x2013; nothing on sovereign debt. We didn't have a lot of exposure. We managed it well. If you look at that revenue line on the chart there, you can see that the numbers run on the FICC side 5.5 billion last quarter, and you look back on the other quarters you can see that, that was just an extremely strong quarter for us. So we think of Tom's business being sort of quarter-in quarter-out on average, and it will move by seasonality more like 5 billion, and that's why in the earlier question, he needs to hit about 5 billion on revenue, 20 billion revenue a year, and we think that's a solid performance of that business. As you look back, you can see that you can to the 5 billion average but it bounces around a bit based on some of the seasonality and some of the opportunity.</p>
          <p>So the $7 billion in sales trading revenue last quarter was a significant outsized performance, and most of it, as you can see, the equity businesses is more of &#x2013; it got dinged up a bit with some of the derivatives, but generally is a billion, $1.5 billion business sort of because of the cash nature of it and the way it works as well as the derivative. But it's sort of a -more of an annuity stream for lack of a better term, and the FICC is where you have the volatility. It's not a sovereign risk issue. It's more related to the lack of opportunity in terms of the upside and then any hits we took around the classic sort of CDA issues of counterparties and things like that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We don't think &#x2013; again, this is &#x2013; there's lots of regulations, and this one is harder to understand because it's not so discernible. But we &#x2013; because we're customer driven, and Tom, frankly, the last 18 months has been pushing out some of the vestiges of proprietary and trading between Volcker and Lincoln, we don't see this as being as significant on this side of the house at all. And frankly there's some benefits into it of counterparty risk and things like that, that will help. So we have not &#x2013; this has not been our major concern. Obviously the numbers we put out and other stuff, that's where the concern is.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of small things. On the reps and warranties, the increase, I'm not too clear whether we're going to a new level of expenses. I mean, you were at the lower level of about 0.5 billion for several quarters. Is this a new level? Is this &#x2013; or is part of this a reserve build? Could you flesh that out a little?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Carole, as you might imagine, there's a real variability in the degree of dialogue between us and the various monolines. In some cases, we're in a very constructive discussion where we have an ability to understand our exposure and measure it and accrue for it. In other cases there's litigation involved and a lack of communication because of the condition and the circumstances of those monolines. So what we've tried to do, as we would each quarter, is make our best judgment and our best estimate around that exposure. Last quarter we told you that as it related to monolines, we didn't have enough information to make an accrual. We have more information this period, this quarter, to make an accrual.</p>
          <p>It will depend upon the dialogue with the monolines, or the lack of dialogue and the kind of work we do so see if we change our estimate. So what I communicated in my prepared remarks was that it's going to be &#x2013; it's going to be a bit lumpy. It's going to be a bit variable. And it will &#x2013; it's &#x2013; there's not a run rate concept here given the behavior of the monolines.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. So the 1.2, I mean the &#x2013; yesterday on the J.P. Morgan call, Jamie Dimon also said that in addition to large corporates having a lot of cash on their balance sheets that he thought small and mid-sized companies were also sitting on a lot of cash. Is that your experience as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say mid-sized, yes. I'd say very small companies I'd be careful because it depends on what industry whether they're successful or still struggling. So if they're in pure retail, restaurants and stuff, you don't know. But if they're in retail, restaurants or construction, things like that, those companies are still struggling. But mid-market companies have done a great job through the cycle of getting themselves de-levered and in very good shape. And as you talk to those middle market customers, they're ready to go.</p>
          <p>They just need to see the opportunity, and those that have business in Asia and stuff are actually seeing revenue growth. And those that have business in the United States, they're moving along. But they have &#x2013; but they're worried about Europe, if they have business there and so it's no different than you'd sort of intuit from the general economic picture. But they have gotten themselves and they're sitting on the cash. They're &#x2013; if the catalyst exists for demand, they'll be able to fill the demand very quickly.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Most of my questions have been asked, but on the repurchases, I wonder, can you talk about, is it still mainly the '05, '06, and '07 vintages that are at issue here with this quarter's bump-up, or is it an issue that '03, '04, '08, and '09 are being infected now as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And intuition would tell you that someone has paid us three, four years and this thing is starting to age behind us, and that you've sealed a group of activity and a group of loans that we're going to have to work out over the next several years from all aspects, not only from rep and warranty, but just generally working through it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'm not sure I'll get any further than anybody else has, but on the potential offsets to like the debit card interchange fees, are there levers that one can pull in terms of either demanding increased free balances from customers or fees or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've got fees, we've got the spread, and then we've got the sort of activity per account, which would be raising balances and any other cost side. We are working on all those dimensions, and so, raising minimum balances and things produces a more efficient, in other words, that that customer has to give you more to get &#x2013; keep an account. And adds to your efficiency. So all those are on the table. It's just with the law that was signed, the law that was passed yesterday is not even law yet, but it will take time to retool the whole franchise and have a dialogue to customers to do it. But every aspect will be done.</p>
          <p>And then the one thing I'd say that is one of my things that I get asked a lot about is, how come this is such a great area for banks with low rate environment. It's not good for a deposit franchise, and so we if don't pay on checking accounts and the issues when rates are effectively zero, the value of that to this company is less than it is when the short rates are 2.5 or 3%. So as rates rise, that will also be an offset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think importantly when you think about the mitigating actions, think about which ones will occur within the card segment and which may occur in other segments of Bank of America. That has a real impact on the accounting judgment we are making for that third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take actions in the deposit &#x2013; our deposit segment to begin to mitigate this, it doesn't help our goodwill write-off measurement because that relates to the card segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. So if you can recover it, the point you're implying is, if you can recover the revenues from the merchant somehow, then that mitigates the goodwill write-off?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if we did something in our deposit-taking business, in our checking accounts and the kinds of actions and mitigations that Brian alluded to, that don't result in incremental revenues inside the card segment, it doesn't affect the goodwill write-off judgment, but we run the business in order to optimize the enterprise, not the segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that &#x2013; I mean, what you're concerned about and what we're concerned about, the balance sheet adjustments we made were not at a level. That's done. The real question is what's the business model going forward on the consumer side, and that is all the mitigating factors, no matter where they come in, you'll get the benefits of them as shareholders. So whether it's spread, whether it's fees, and any segment, whether it's minimum balance requirements to make us more efficient and then taking the costs out. The team is working on it. We're putting them in place. We've already implemented them in some of the earlier &#x2013; the CARD Act and other things but it will take time to do it as we move through the deposit franchise over the next several quarters.</p>

          <p>Yeah, you're absolutely right. They did decline this quarter, and we have &#x2013; and they will probably decline going forward.</p>

          <p>Okay. Focusing on the investment bank for a second, you mentioned that you're intending to grow staff outside the U.S. Can you give us a sense as to what impact that might have on expenses in the Global Wealth &#x2013; or I'm sorry, in the Global Markets business?</p>

          <p>A lot of it is &#x2013; a lot of people are being hired as we speak, and so they'll come on their own rate. But I think from a &#x2013; the numbers people we're adding relative to the whole size of the business, it will be an impact but not a huge impact. And the way we accrue for, against the profit and revenue, so that it will work out in terms of the operating dynamics. But I wouldn't say it's going &#x2013; it will change the dynamic of the cost structure in Tom's business that materially over the next several quarters. It's replacing people we lost and adding people, but it's against the total base of 10,000 to 15,000 people. It's in the hundreds type of thing.</p>

          <p>And then the last question, in terms of your potential sale of Balboa, my numbers suggest that there's about a little more than three billion of assets in Balboa, a couple of billion dollars in capital. Assuming you are able to execute the sale, what effect should we see from that in terms of assets and/or capital getting freed up?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll fill people in on that, I think, Kevin and those guys can fill you in specifically. We just &#x2013; today put it in the market, and so I don't have a quick answer for you off the top of my head. But it will be a sale. We'll get a gain. It will be behind us. It contributes to earnings. But our view is why are we selling it? We're selling it because it's not a core activity of making mortgages and we're continuing to fine-tune the franchise.</p>

          <p>With that, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and have a good day.</p>
