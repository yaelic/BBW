          <p>Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Phillips 66 Earnings Conference Call. My name is John and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Senior Vice President Investor Relations, Strategy, and Corporate Affairs. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Good morning, and welcome to Phillips 66 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. With me this morning are Greg Garland, our Chairman and CEO; our CFO Greg Maxwell; and EVP Tim Taylor.</p>
          <p>Presentation material we will be using this morning can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Phillips 66 website along with supplemental financial and operating information.</p>
          <p>Slide 2 contains our Safe Harbor statement. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and our question-and-answer session. Actual results may differ materially from today's comments, factors that could cause these results to differ are included here on the second page, as well as in our filings with the SEC. This slide also contains a reminder that any comments we make regarding the formation of an MLP are not in offer of securities.</p>
          <p>So that said, I'll turn the call over to Greg Garland for some opening comments. Greg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We're off to a good start, strong performance in 2012. We have solid financial and operating results and we continue to deliver on the commitments that we set out to achieve when Phillips 66 was created. We believe that our differentiated portfolio has allowed us to capture a number of market opportunities across the value chain, resulting in significant cash generation and shareholder value creation. I'm really pleased what our employees have been able to accomplish. They've executed the spin flawlessly, they've stood the company up, they've operated well and they've managed keep safety as the top priority. We've had a strong track record of operating excellence and when we talk about that, operating excellence is personal safety, it's process safety, it's environmental excellence, it's reliability, it's cost management. This year was no exception. We've turned in one of the best years ever and Phillips 66 remains a leader in operations excellence. That said, there is always room for improvement and the goal is zero incidents at our facilities, to continue to reduce costs, improve our reliability and our environmental footprint.</p>
          <p>Late last year, we announced our intent to form a master limited partnership, which we expect will help highlight the value of our transportation, logistics and midstream businesses. They'll also serve as an efficient vehicle for funding growth investments in these areas. We also expect to start taking delivery of the first group of our 2,000 newly constructed railcars in early February. In January, we've entered into a five year transportation logistics contract with Global Partners to move about 90 million barrels of the Bakken crude to our Bayway refinery. This agreement provides a reliable long-term alternative to more expensive Brent based crudes.</p>
          <p>On the marine side, we've taken delivery of one to two Jones Act vessels that we chartered. So, all these steps support our plan to put advantage crudes to the front end of our refineries, we've got ways to continue to accelerate advantage crude faster. We've completely backed out imports of U.S. light sweet crude into the Gulf Coast. But we're also taking additional steps to enhance our returns. We're going to remain very disciplined in our approach to capital spending. We'll continue to reduce costs. We'll push yields and we'll continue to increase our export ability.</p>
          <p>Product exports played a larger role in our results this year than last year as market opportunities opened up to us internationally. December was a record month for us in terms of exports. We had over 180,000 barrels a day of exports in the month of December.</p>
          <p>Regarding distributions, we said that we intend to return capital to our shareholders. We've raised the dividend 56% to $1.25, and we've announced $2 billion of share repurchases. In 2012, we bought over 7 million shares for about $350 million. Late last year, we paid down $1 billion of debt. This further strengthens our financial flexibility. It reduces risk and our debt-to-cap is now 25% at year-end.</p>
          <p>So now, I'm going to hand the conversation over to Greg Maxwell. He'll take you through the quarterly results. Greg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we ran well, we benefited from strong refining and chemical margins and we processed more advantage crudes in our domestic refineries. And this enabled us to increase our realized refining crack spreads moving our market capture to 95% in the fourth quarter and this is up from 72% last year.</p>
          <p>On the earnings front, our reported earnings were $708 million or $1.11 per share. Excluding approximately $600 million in special items, adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion or $2.06 a share. On an adjusted basis, earnings for the quarter were up almost 250% compared to last year. If we exclude changes in working capital, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $1.7 billion. Our cash flow generation enabled us to fund our capital program pay over $150 million in dividends and repurchase $245 million of common stock during the quarter. And as Greg mentioned, we reduced our debt by $1 billion from $8 billion to $7 billion and as you'll see on a later slide, we ended the year with a cash balance of $3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, our full year 2012 return on capital employed was 22%, that's up from 14% in 2011 and this improvement was mainly due to higher earnings in our Refining and Marketing and Chemicals segments. Before we leave this slide I'd like to touch on a few key items this quarter.</p>
          <p>First the special items of approximately $600 million included $564 million for the impairment of our equity investment in the Morocco refinery. This impairment was based on significantly lower estimated future refining margins in the region, driven primarily by expected increases in future crude oil pricing over the long-term. As such, we determine that the fair value of our investment in Morocco was lower than our carrying value and that this loss in value was other than temporary.</p>
          <p>Second, excluding special items, our adjusted effective tax rate was 29% this quarter compared to 33% last quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly due to income mix and different statutory tax rates across the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. In other words, compared to last quarter a higher proportion of our earnings this quarter were from foreign jurisdictions with relatively lower tax rates.</p>
          <p>The next slide provides a high level look at our fourth quarter adjusted earnings. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, our adjusted earnings increased by over $900 million to $1.3 billion. As shown Refining and Marketing generated $1.1 billion in adjusted earnings and this excludes the impact of the Melaka refinery impairment as well as Hurricane Sandy related costs, which primarily impacted our Bayway refinery along with some nearby terminals. The majority of the $900 million improvement in our R&amp;M segment came from much stronger refining margins due largely to improved market crack spreads and strong feedstock advantages.</p>
          <p>Moving next to midstream, midstream adjusted earnings were $62 million. About $50 million lower than last year. This decline in earnings primarily reflects the impact of lower NGL prices quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Chemicals earnings were $246 million, which were approximately $100 million higher than the corresponding quarter of 2011. And this is mainly due to higher margins especially in the olefins and polyolefins chain. Excluding repositioning costs and a corporate property impairment, corporate and other costs this quarter were $92 million. The cost variance of $41 million is largely due to interest expense on debt associated with the repositioning that didn't exist in the same quarter last year. I'll cover each of these operating segments in more detail later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter cash flow is shown on slide 6. During the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations, excluding working capital. Changes in working capital negatively impacted cash flow by $400 million with the net change primarily due to tax payments. As shown on the chart we paid down $1 billion of debt. We also funded $900 million of capital expenditures and investments that includes approximately $500 million for our investments in the Sand Hills and Southern Hills pipelines that are being constructed by DCP Midstream. And during the quarter, we returned $400 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>In summary, during the quarter, we generated sufficient cash to fund our capital program along with our dividend and share repurchase programs. And with a $1 billion debt repayment, we took our cash balance down to $3.5 billion at year-end.</p>
          <p>As for our capital structure on slide 11 (sic) [slide 7], our equity has increased almost $2 billion since the second quarter and debt has decreased by $1 billion. This has enabled us to reduce our debt-to-cap ratio to the middle of our targeted range of 20% to 30% and taking into account our $3.5 billion ending cash balance our net debt-to-cap ratio is 14%.</p>
          <p>Next we will cover each of our operating segments in more detail starting with Refining and Marketing on slide 8. In Refining and Marketing our refining realized margin was $13.67 per barrel with a global crude utilization rate of 91% and a clean product yield of 83%.</p>
          <p>Our utilization rate was negatively impacted by turnarounds at the Wood River, Borger, and Los Angeles refineries, as well as Hurricane Sandy related unplanned downtime at our Bayway refinery. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to run more advantaged crudes with 67% of our U U.S. crude slate being advantaged and this compares to 57% in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Our return on capital employed for the R&amp;M segment, which includes over $3 billion in goodwill, improved to 22% this year and this is up from 12%, the 12% return that we had in 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 provides more detail on Refining and Marketing's earnings. Adjusted earnings for R&amp;M were $1.1 billion this quarter, and this is up $927 million from a year ago reflecting improvements in all of our regions, especially in the Gulf Coast in Central Corridor regions.</p>
          <p>Marketing, Specialties and Other were also up driven largely by our international operations. The earnings of all four of our refining regions increased primarily due to improved refining margins. The improvements in refining margins reflects not only higher market crack spreads, but also an improved feedstock advantage especially in the Gulf Coast and the Central Corridor regions. The improvements in feedstock advantage increased earnings in the Gulf Coast by over $200 million and by over $100 million in the Central Corridor.</p>
          <p>Finally, Other refining was up this quarter compared to last year, primarily due to movements of Canadian crude supply to several of our refineries. As we move on to Marketing, Specialties and Other, the U.S. was down by $2 million primarily due to higher taxes and cost and this was partially offset by U.S. &#x2013; higher U.S. marketing margins. Internationally, MSO was up $40 million, mainly as a result of higher margins. The next few slides highlight our performance in refining and provides more detail on Marketing, Specialties and Other.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we can see refining's adjusted earnings increased almost $900 million compared to a year ago. Improved margins were the key driver with higher market cracks and greater feedstock advantages being partially offset by inventory impacts. The inventory impacts were largely driven by gains recognized in 2011 that were tied to asset sales and shutdowns. Lower volumes negatively impacted earnings by $42 million, mainly in the Atlantic Basin and the Central Corridor regions, reflecting unplanned downtime due to Hurricane Sandy and planned turnarounds.</p>
          <p>Operating costs were up slightly reflecting higher utilities and maintenance costs. The Other category includes positive earnings impacts from lower effective tax rates, primarily due to income mix and federal tax adjustments.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our market capture shown on slide 11. On this slide, we compare the global market crack with our realized crack spreads. Our realized margin for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $13.67 per barrel. And this resulted in a market capture of 95%. This is quite a bit higher than the 74% that we've achieved over the last four years. At a high level market capture in the fourth quarter was exceptional as feedstock advantages, product differentials and volume gains largely offset the negative impacts associated with a lowered valued secondary products.</p>
          <p>Let's walk through the details on the slide. The $0.58 configuration adjustment reflects the fact that our clean product yield of 83% is less than the 100% assumed in the market crack. The negative configuration impact was improved this quarter largely due to our strong distillate production, coupled with healthy distillate prices.</p>
          <p>The $5.64 per barrel reduction related to secondary products reflects the fact that these products attracted a sales price that on average were lower than the cost from our benchmark crudes. The positive $3.69 per barrel adjustment for feedstocks stems from running certain crudes and other feedstocks that are priced lower than our benchmark crudes. For example, our feedstock advantage this quarter was primarily related to running foreign heavy sour crudes at our Gulf Coast refineries and Canadian crudes in our refineries in the Central Corridor. In addition, our crude slate has increased to include more shale crudes, primarily Bakken and Eagle.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Other category primarily reflects the impacts of volume gain and product differentials.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 shows the percentage of advantage crude runs at our refineries as well as clean product yields for 2011 and 2012. Many of our refineries have the complexity to run price advantage, Canadian, Bakken and Eagle Ford crudes. Shale crudes are being run in all four of our refinery regions. And in addition, we have access to multiple transportation systems to reliably deliver these crudes to our U.S. refining &#x2013; refineries providing an overall competitive advantage.</p>
          <p>For the year, our U.S. advantage crude slate increased from 52% in 2011 to 62% this quarter &#x2013; this year, and for the month of December this average was up to 70%. We'll discuss Marketing, Specialties and Other or MSO on the next slide.</p>
          <p>MSO generated adjusted earnings of $180 million, which is $38 million higher than the same quarter last year. As shown on the slide, higher margins were the main driver for the increase making up almost $90 million of the variance. Margins improved primarily due to better market conditions and favorable inventory impacts this quarter. Volumes decreased $26 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to reduced production at our Immingham Power Plant in the UK as well as lower U.S. marketing volumes primarily due to lower demand. Volumes were also lower due to downtime at the Borger refinery. Operating costs increased $20 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher environmental and legal costs.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows our per barrel metrics. Refining and Marketing's income per barrel increased this quarter to $4.12 per barrel versus $0.59 a barrel a year ago with cash contributions of $5 per barrel up $3.57 compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, R&amp;M's income per barrel was $4.28. And this is up $1.95 compared to 2011. This completes our review of the Refining &amp; Marketing business segment. Next, we will move to the Midstream segment.</p>
          <p>Our Midstream segment had lower equity earnings from DCP Midstream, largely driven by depressed NGL prices. NGL prices were down 36% compared to last year, although down compared to 2011. Return on capital employed for the year was still strong at 22%. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in capital employed in our Midstream segment. And, as I said earlier, during the fourth quarter, we closed our investments in the Sand Hills and the Southern Hills pipelines that are being constructed by DCP Midstream. And these pipes are scheduled for start up this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows that Midstream's adjusted earnings of $62 million includes $38 million in earnings associated with our interest in DCP Midstream and $24 million for our other Midstream businesses.</p>
          <p>The next slide provides additional branch detail for both DCP Midstream and our other Midstream earnings. As shown on the top portion of the slide, earnings associated with our interest in DCP decreased by $21 million this quarter due primarily to lower NGL prices. This was partially offset by reduction in the depreciation expense that is tied to an overall increase in the remaining useful lives of DCP's assets that was implemented in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Our other Midstream business was down $30 million, primarily driven by positive inventory impacts in 2011, along with higher taxes.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we'll move on to discussion of our Chemicals segment. Our Chemicals segment had another solid quarter, providing earnings of $246 million. Overall, CPChem achieved 90% capacity utilization rate in its O&amp;P segment in the fourth quarter. This was down somewhat from the third quarter due to unplanned downtime at the Saudi Polymers petrochemicals facility. If we exclude this downtime at SP Co, CPChem's utilization rate was near capacity for the quarter. 2012 return on capital employed from our Chemicals segment increased to 31%. This is up from 28% last year and we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in capital employed.</p>
          <p>As shown on slide 19, fourth quarter earnings increased by $98 million compared to the same period last year. This increase in earnings was primarily in olefins and polyolefins due to stronger chain margins. The drivers for this increase was primarily from reduced feedstock cost due to higher industry ethane and propane inventories as well as continued strong demand for ethylene derivatives.</p>
          <p>Looking at CPChem's operating segments on the next slide, olefins and polyolefins generated earnings of $216 million in the fourth quarter. This $97 million increase was due primarily from higher olefins, polyolefins chain margins, partially offset by higher operating costs.</p>
          <p>In addition, quarter-over-quarter marketed sales volumes in O&amp;P were up 8%. Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics earnings increased by 73% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher benzene earnings. This concludes our discussion of the financial and operating results for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Next, I'd like to provide a few outlook items for the first quarter. In Refining and Marketing, for the first quarter, we expect our global utilization rate to be in the low-90s, and our pre-tax turnaround expense to be approximately $100 million.</p>
          <p>In Midstream, we expect our additional direct investments in the Sand Hills and the Southern Hills pipelines to be approximately $120 million in the first quarter. In Chemicals, although there was some initial unplanned downtime with Saudi Polymers petrochemical complex, it is now up and running. Under normal operations, we expect SP Co to return roughly $175 million to $225 million per year to CPChem with our share being 50%.</p>
          <p>Corporate and other costs are expected to be about $40 million a month on an after-tax basis or approximately $120 million for the quarter. And this includes after-tax net interest expense of about $40 million. As for the company's effective tax rate, we expect the rate to be in the low-30s for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding share repurchases, we plan to complete the initial $1 billion of repurchases in 2013, and initiate the second billion-dollar tranche prior to the end of the year. We'll continue to keep you advised on the status of our repurchase program on quarterly earnings calls.</p>
          <p>With regard to our recently announced MLP, we are still on track with our plans to file the S-1 with the SEC by early in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally starting with the first quarter earnings call, we'll provide you with updates on our Optimize 66 initiative. Recall that this initiative includes capturing $200 million in pre-tax cost savings compared to what the costs would have been without implementation of this initiative. This concludes our guidance for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>With that, we'll now open the line for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter. I guess, there's a lot of focus on all the crude that's coming down into the Gulf and obviously you got three refineries down there, Sweeny looks like well-positioned. But can you comment on maybe two aspects; one, what is &#x2013; as you look at the market, the sort of incremental costs, so any constraints on moving crude from say the bottom of Seaway to Lake Charles and then along to Alliance? And then the second question is as we look at tanker rates that are rising rapidly for Jones Act ships. Can you comment a little bit on how to secure low cost shipping access to from the Gulf up to Bayway? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Thanks Ed. Good morning. So, let me make a couple of generic comments and I'll let Tim fill in some of the details around that, so we've backed out all light sweet crude imports into the Gulf Coast. One of the reasons we took the two Jones Act vessels is we thought that was an opportunity. We want to move quickly, there is very few of those vessels that are available. And with the idea of really taking Eagle Ford volumes from Corpus around to Alliance and coming in through a loop system and then going on around to Bayway. So, I mean that was the basic premise that we acquired those vessels for. There is very few of those out there, they are difficult to attain. We think, there are probably 32 or so vessels, they are in service today that are available to do this, most of them are taken or chartered. So, Tim, I know, you want to fill in a little more color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as &#x2013; Ed, as far as the crude movements along the Gulf Coast, still primarily for us it's marine particularly at this point the pipeline capacity going east is going to improve reversal of Ho-Ho and you got the rail facilities at St. James, but for us the primary mode that we've used to increase the shale runs has been through marine movements primarily out of South Texas to the three Gulf Coast refineries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And then just a second question on ethane crackers, you've got negative chatter just coming out of the Gulf on execution issues. Are there any updates in terms of the cost studies that you've done for that cracker and potential timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I would say that we're on track for the cracker, Ed. We will take FID this year yet on that facility. We're continuing to prosecute the engineering, the long-lead items on that &#x2013; we're moving the permitting process forward. And so we'll take FID on that. But in &#x2013; for the costs we'll see as we finish up kind of our pre-engineering if you will on that, where they come in. But we're still thinking it's around the $5 billion range. We've talked a lot about we think if there's four to five grassroots crackers built, we're concerned about execution capability for the contracting community. Are there enough welders, pipe fitters, electricians, et cetera to execute all these projects. And so, one of the reasons we want to be first in the queue is to get the jump on that and make sure that we get our pick of the very best people in the industry to execute the project for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick question on the crude slate that you're running, can you talk about whether there are any practical or logistical limitations within the refining system to how much sweet versus how much heavy crude you can run? What your flexibility parameters are there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We can certainly do that Kate. Good morning. Thanks. So we can run about 350 a day in the Gulf Coast of light sweet crude. And we can push the limits of that. At Sweeny, primarily a heavy refinery, we can run I guess I don't know 60 a day of light sweet there. We've looked at running off sweet at that facility, and we'd have to de-rate the facility by about 20% or so. We know what the investment is to correct that, it's probably less than $50 million at Sweeny for us. So, we'll look at that and watch that. But as you think about the opportunity set, you can't take that as a generic across the entire refining system, because refineries are different, they're configured differently, and so that's just one specific example for Sweeny. But, without question, I think we're up to about 130 a day of shale type crudes that we've run. It's primarily Eagle Ford with some Bakken coming in. And clearly, as we start taking delivery of the 2,000 railcars with the Global deal, we're going to move more Bakken East and West, primarily Bayway and our Ferndale refineries as we try to accelerate the advantaged crude capture. We think we have quite a bit of room left to run in terms of accelerating advantaged crude capture around our refineries.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then just another question on exports. When you look at export opportunity and the growth in exports, are your exported volumes actually enabling you to capture higher prices than you'd get in the domestic market or is it simply the fact that you're able to &#x2013; is it a volume uplift and that's where the benefit from exports is coming from or is it a mix of both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. It's both. It's really &#x2013; it's the volumes going to allow us to run higher operating rates, but we made 47% more net income exporting this year than we did last year because prices were better in the international market, so it is a combination of both.</p>

          <p>My first question involved the comments that Greg Maxwell made a few minutes ago about the impairment at Melaka and specifically the part about higher oil prices being envisioned in the region meaning, was there some type of crude oil procurement arrangement that lapsed or was the comment within the context of a margin outlook or did I mishear? So could you just elaborate on or clarify about what you talked about there, Greg?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I look at it as really the fact that; A, demand in Asia is growing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're putting pressure on both the light and the medium grades which fit that refinery in Melaka and then you've had some effects post tsunami in Japan. So, our fundamental view is that the demand picture in Asia has lowered those differentials, narrowed those differentials and has brought that base crude price up. So, it's primarily a margin issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. And, Tim I may have, the next question maybe for you too. So product demand in North America and Europe was pretty poor last year and it looks like there might have been a modest uptick during November and December. So, because you guys have facilities in both areas, I want to see if you would provide your insight into current product demand in the U.S. and Europe and whether or not you're seeing any improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say that basically demand still lackluster, but it's certainly not completely gone. Clearly, I think we still see flat to declining demand on gasoline distillate, we expect to improve with the economy in North America. Europe, still relatively weak, but based on our refining positions and the nature of our retail market in Central Europe and our Humber refinery we'd say it's focused on specialties, we're really not seeing that to be an issue for us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is actually Mohit Bhardwaj for Faisel Khan. I've got a question on the Gulf Coast crude runs. If you guys could just give us a color on as far as the light crudes were concerned, how much below LLS benchmark those were priced, the crudes that you ran on the Gulf Coast and same for the heavy versus the Maya? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Tim, again. So, basically on the light crudes, coming out of South Texas, I think we would plan on say $5 to $8 a barrel advantage. We have seen LLS begin to move a bit, as that supplies increase. So we think that that will continue to improve that crudes position or slate as well. From the light to heavy differential, that was favorable in this quarter, and we still think that provides substantial uplift with &#x2013; versus the light given our refining configuration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, do you have an estimate on, some of the other barrels which are floating around at least in the fourth quarter versus Maya what the differential was on the heavy side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really haven't got too specifics of that. We do buy a variety of those crudes, and so we're able to capture some of that differential that we've seen.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. I was just wondering further to your split and then in the first Analyst Meeting that you had as a new company, Gregg, what do you feel the market understood well about the company from the Analyst Meeting and what do you think that was kind of misunderstood from the message you were trying to convey? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. Well, so, &#x2013; we were pleased with the first Analyst Meeting. In general, we were consistent with what we've been communicating to the market in terms of our strategy, around improving our returns, growing our higher returning faster growing businesses in Midstream and Chemicals and really laying out a plan and strategy to improve the base returns on refining business through advantage crude capture reducing costs, driving yields and ultimately a 400-basis point improvement in refining. So, I think that that &#x2013; if there was a disappointment that they, it may have been around the MLP announcement and the fact that we couldn't talk about it is as much as we would've liked to or probably as much as you would have liked for us to do, but we just reiterate, we think that, that's a value creating proposition for Phillips 66 shareholders. And, we'll continue to prosecute that this year and we plan to get it done this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I think the number was the $700 million of EBITDA that would be associated with that business, whether or not that was up the high end of the range and low end of the range or a reasonable number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think we've said that we really can't say a whole lot about the EBITDA that we would consider putting in MLP until we get the S-1 filed. So, just have to be patient on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I certainly understand, you got some stuff on NGLs, and NGL pricing being so weak, can you talk about, I know you have great sensitivities and stuff, but can you just remind us again, firstly of the sensitivities now and how they impact you positively or negatively and secondly of how you expect that to change over time? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah. Well, first of all sensitivity, $0.01 a gallon in NGL price is about $4 million of net income back to us. So, as you think across the Midstream space, the Chemicals space, we're a net buyer of NGLs and so we're capturing that value in the Chemicals space, long-term we think that fundamentally the Midstream business is a good place to invest. We've got aggressive growth plans in there, I do think that we're going to be in for a period of volatile pricing in NGLs for the next four or five years until the petrochemical facilities come up, until the export facilities get built for the propane, butane, and heaviers essentially. So, I think you've got this period of time that the demand side needs to kind of catch up with the supply side in the Midstream space, Paul. But I think &#x2013; the other thing you got to think about too is, what you're starting to see is because of the investment, because of the need to clear these new basins that a lot of the new investment is really evolving and moving to more fee-based type contracts around this infrastructure. So, you're going to &#x2013; what're you're going to see is a reduced sensitivity longer-term in the Midstream space as there is more fee-based assets put in service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That was a kind of what I was driving at. So, is there any way you can quantify how that might shift your sensitivity and in what specific timeframe, because obviously if you're talking about only four to five years of oversupply it's kind of a worrying outlook? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Yeah. You'd expect the sensitivity to fall over time in Midstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in the chemical side, it actually goes the other way, as we increase the amount of ethane that we run.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I was trying to be more specific. I was wondering if there was some sort of idea of how much was fee-based and everything else and how it would shift over time and the extent to which it would go down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we talked about DCP having 70% of its contracts on a POP basis historically and we're shifting that to 40%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Its 40%. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if you look at the new pipes we're building whether it's Sand Hills or Southern Hills or some of the other projects we're considering. As Greg said those are fee-based. So, we won't have the exposure there and the &#x2013; traditionally, I guess the gathering and processing business will be a POP type, but that will be a smaller percentage of the total business. So whether or not that sensitivity is 50% of what it is today, five years from now or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question, but ultimately NGL prices are going to recover is our view. And so, I think you're going to have a &#x2013; it still has a good mix of, what I would call, risk to commodity exposure in your natural gas, in your NGL prices, and then the fee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about product exports in your press release and having current capacity of 285,000 barrels a day going up to 370,000 by the end of the year. Could you talk about your fourth quarter product exports? What you were actually exporting in the fourth quarter and maybe how that compares to the fourth quarter of the previous year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the fourth quarter, the &#x2013; we were impacted a little bit with some of the hurricane effects. But overall, exports were up to 180,000 in December. And &#x2013; on average for the year, we were up slightly. So, I see that as probably a growing area for us. I think December reflects what we'll see as the trend. I think the pricing incentives are there and certainly the run rate incentive is there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. You talked about, I guess, that's a incremental increase in export capacity of about 85,000 barrels a day and you talked about 20,000 of that being in Ferndale. The other 65,000 barrels a day, where do you see the opportunity for incremental exports?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So really, we still look at the Gulf Coast as really the region where we would see the logical place for exports, given proximity to markets and the access. So, the West Coast is going to be more incremental for us, but the primary bulk of that change will come in our three Gulf Coast refineries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good, good. Switching the topic to Sweeny, I guess your historical relationship with Seaway I assume there is good access there. Should we think about Sweeny feedstock making a step function improvement with this incremental phase of Seaway coming online in the first quarter of 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Today, Sweeny on our light unit, we're running shale crudes today, and so then it's just about a question of which particular grades make the most sense from the refinery. So, I actually think Sweeny is in really good shape and then it really depends upon the economic substitution that we have for the heavier piece of the unit. So, you're right, Sweeny is in a great location not only from Seaway, but if you think about it, very good access to South Texas crudes, particularly the Eagle Fords crudes and that's where the emphasis has been to this point.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You are backing out light sweet crude in the fourth quarter in the Gulf Coast, and I guess it's only a matter of time for the Gulf Coast industry and making various midstream investments around that, I mean are you considering any condensate splitter or hardware investment versus Midstream to take advantage of that growing and impending glut of light crude, and then somewhat related, I mean do you see your ship assets competing with rail kind of providing you just more optionality at East Coast, or do you see a high utilization or kind of propose &#x2013; kind of both of what I'd say kind of more leased out assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah I'll take it in reverse order. We like the flexibility of rail and ship to move. Clearly, we think there's a cost advantage in moving marine versus rail. But, the opportunity to acquire the Jones Act vessels is limited. So, that's one of the reasons we move quickly on these two ships that we took.</p>
          <p>So, and yes, we would consider an investment. I think that we &#x2013; we would want to see where the spreads really go, where LLS really ends up. We're still kind of quoting $2 to $3 a barrel differential in LLS. It's not a big investment for us, but frankly we still have higher returning projects we think we can invest in, but we wouldn't hesitate to make that investment if the economics warranted it. But, we've got a lot of what I would say small, quick hit type investments we can do in refining that are 30% and 40% return projects that you'll see us do to help those yields, drive costs down, improve access. So, you'll see us do those things, but we're not in a big hurry to make an investment and condensates for them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still have additional capacity to penetrate without that, so that's our first priority and then as we get beyond that point that's when I think we'll begin think about do we need to do something else in the process side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Maybe shift gears to some of those other projects on the Chemicals side. A few questions, maybe you could help me with potential EBITDA uplift based on assumed margin levels from Sweeny fractionation expansion this year? And secondly help me understand better maybe this normal alpha olefins expansion project at Cedar Bayou or at least clear me, kind of evaluate potential impact there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this is Tim. All right, just couple of comments on the Sweeny fraction, it's a debottleneck and the real value comes from increased volume throughput at the fractionation that feeds the cracking complex there, but probably more importantly it allows more ethane into the mix and to capture value that's &#x2013; it's a relatively modest project in terms of capital of $100 million and I would expect returns well above 20% on that. So incrementally, it's a very attractive project. It's just not the same scale as you expect with the cracker.</p>

          <p>So it makes a lot of sense. On the NAO, the project there, if you think about it, we got the one hexane that CPChem has announced that's separate from that announcement, that's a 250,000 ton increment. And what they're looking at with NAO is a debottlenecking expansion of the existing NAO unit there at Cedar Bayou as well. So again, not a major new derivatives complex but, really debottlenecking what's there on the NAO site, so similar I would expect that to be similar to what we are talked about with the frac.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very early in that stage, but it's &#x2013; again it's a relatively modest increase versus a major new plant.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And maybe last if I could sneak one more in, just on rails to kind of come back, take it back to refining. I mean I know you have 2,000 railcars layering in; number one, what's the &#x2013; how should we think about the delivery of that rail fleet, is it all general purpose, any heated coil? And how do you think about in this kind of rail gold rush really, how do you consider transloading investments around your systems to drive optionality versus primarily at this juncture a Bakken &#x2013; the East Coast, Bakken transit? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a great question. So these are general purpose cars, although I will say that we are looking at coiled tube cars for &#x2013; to move Canadian heavy down to the West Coast in addition to this. So, as you think about this, it was originally envisioned as a Bakken play to go East and West without question, where we're investing in infrastructure is at our refineries for unloading if you will and we're using third-party access in the Bakken itself. I don't think we see the need to invest in terms of loading facilities in the Bakken at this point in time. And frankly, the nice thing about the railcars is they can move over time, as the opportunity moves. But our view is that the next five-year window, Bakken crudes will probably move a lot of it by rail going East and West.</p>

          <p>I agree, what do you think the permitting track is for California rail, there has been views that that's going to take a long time, do you have any...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wish I knew the answer to that one. I think that we're pushing it. I think there is some resistance given the heavy nature of the crudes and the carbon footprint of the crudes and AB32, carbon cap and trade, et cetera, et cetera in California, but I think it's an opportunity that certainly is worth exploring.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, fellows, good morning. A follow-up, I guess, on a couple of questions that have been asked, particularly in the West Coast or the Western Pacific to be more exact. If you look at your earnings now the full year is in, last year you did about $84 million adjusted versus $2.5 billion for the whole system. This year it looks about $300 million on $5.2 billion for the whole system. I'm just kind of curious as to strategically how you're thinking about that part of your business on a go-forward basis, given that it seems to be somewhat challenged relative to everything else that's going on in the portfolio? That's my first question and I have a follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hey, Doug. How are you doing? So, the West Coast will &#x2013; we talked about Melaka, so I think we've kind of answered the Melaka piece of it from the Pacific standpoint. It's not strategic for us, non-core asset. California is a challenged place to operate, it's a high-cost environment, there is a lot of things coming at us in California. It's net income positive, it's cash positive, it's single-digit returns. And so it doesn't fit the return profile that we see long-term in the business. So, what are we doing? We're doing everything we can to improve it. So, it's just looking at our costs, it's looking at our configuration. It's looking at how do we get advantaged crudes into these refineries to improve and at the same time, I would say we're studying all options for California in terms of where do we go long-term with the California asset. I don't feel it's a distressed asset, I don't think we have to move tomorrow on it, but I also think that we want to take our time and be thoughtful and make sure that whatever we do in California it creates value for Phillips 66 shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. My follow up is actually a related question. Not to try and predict what happens next, but could you help us understand what kind of inventory you have tied up across those two parts of the portfolio? I guess Melaka and the West Coast and maybe there has been a little bit of chatter about at some point in the next few years you might see some accounting change, these are &#x2013; as it relates the accounting for &#x2013; LIFO accounting for inventory. What kind of cash tax liability might you have or what kind of cash could be released from inventory if you decided to go down the monetization rate? I will leave you there. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, it's Greg Maxwell, we watch this from an inventory perspective and look at the different pieces of legislation that are coming up. From a replacement cost perspective over and above what we have recorded on our books on the inventory level basis, it's about &#x2013; runs about $7.5 billion to $8 billion. And so, one of the things that we saw in the legislation that that would be paid over a 10-year period is the latest we have seen on it. So, basically you could look at the gain on that divided by 10 times 35% sort of give you a rough estimate of what the cash taxes would be on an annual basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, good morning. Congratulations on the results. I had a question for you on debt, obviously it was reduced by about $1 billion this quarter, as I understood it the large portion of the debt balance actually contained a fairly low interest rate and that was one of the things. I think that the initial analyst we had up in New York, you were grabbling with Greg as far as &#x2013; do you pay that down or how do you manage the balance sheet going forward. I'm just curious from here, is you are biased to kind of leave the debt levels where they are, and just distribute the remaining amount to shareholders or maybe just build additional cash or any thoughts there appreciated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks for the question. So, we said at the Analyst Day that we're going to pay down $2 billion of the debt. So, we're going to go from $8 billion to $6 billion that takes us to about 20%, which is the broad end of the range, that still the plan is to pay down another $1 billion of debt. There is no question. It's very attractive financing, but as we look &#x2013; we always like to remind people this was, it is, it always will be a volatile business.</p>
          <p>And that's life in a commodity business and we accept that. We think that we're comfortable operating in that space, but I think you want to have a balance sheet that supports that. So, it reduces risk for the company. In our view, it creates capacity. We're not going to hesitate to level back up if we have to continue our plans or pay dividends or do the things that we need to do.</p>
          <p>And &#x2013; but no question, our view is that the next couple years, mid cycle margins are going to be above historical mid cycle margins, I think, we're going to have a cash optionality. So, I think you'll see us; one, pay a dividend, continue to increase that dividend. You'll see us then use excess cash to take in shares, and we aren't going to take specials off the payable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then second one was really more I guess big picture capital allocation oriented, but as I look at the return on capital employed in your slides, it looks like the R&amp;M numbers moved up to 22%, which is equivalent to what you're getting in the Midstream. I guess, as you make decisions on allocating capital going forward as understood it, R&amp;M was really going to be one of the smaller pieces of the portfolio going forward. I'm just curious does this blow out returns and the downstream kind of changed that theory going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, my view is that refining historically has been kind of 10% to 12% business, let's say. We think we have plans in place through advantage crude capture yields, cost reduction that we can move at 400 basis points. So, it's 15% business going forward for us versus 30% return businesses in Chemicals, and probably Midstream business 15% to 17% returns is what we're looking at that. So, to the extent that we have 30% and 40% return projects in refining, we're going to do those. I think &#x2013; I mean we do get challenged by people all the time, are we under investing &#x2013; under investing in refining. At this point, we don't think so. I don't think there's any opportunities out there we feel that we've missed. In terms of an investment opportunity in refining space, our focus is going to be very disciplined. We're going to restrict capital on the space. We're going to improve returns in the space. And so we're not going to &#x2013; we don't see a change required in our strategy at this point in time.</p>
