          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the ASML 2009 Fourth Quarter and Annual Results Conference Call on January 20, 2010. Throughout today's introduction, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. And after ASML's introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Craig DeYoung. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator and good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at ASML. I'd like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast.</p>
          <p>As the operator mentioned, the subject of today's call is ASML's 2009 fourth quarter and annual results. Co-hosting today's call from our headquarters in Veldhoven, The Netherlands, are Mr. Eric Meurice, ASML's CEO, and Mr. Peter Wennink, ASML's CFO.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and in our fourth quarter results presentation, both of which you may find on our website at www.asml.com. This Safe Harbor statement will apply to this call as well as all associated presentation materials. Let me remind you and advise you that the length of this call will be 60 minutes.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Meurice for a brief introduction. Eric?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Craig. Good afternoon and good morning. Thank you for attending our Q4 2009 results conference call. Peter and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the quarter. And as usual, Peter will start with a review of the Q4 financial performance with added comments on the short-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some further details on our current situation as we close out 2009 and head into 2010. Following the introduction, we will open up for questions.</p>
          <p>So, Peter, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric. As Eric mentioned, I would like to take a moment to share some observations on the events of the last quarter, as well as some details on our fourth quarter results.</p>
          <p>To start with that, our fourth quarter sales were &#x20AC;581 million. This was slightly higher than our sales guidance for the quarter. We shipped a total of 25 systems, 19 of which were new. New system ASP was &#x20AC;19.7 million versus 22.4 in the third quarter, which indicates a substantial blend of immersion and non-immersion tools. We shipped 11 immersion tools and 14 non-immersion tools, reflecting an increased demand from our foundry customers for capacity-related tools. The average selling price of new and used systems combined was &#x20AC;17.3 million and was therefore also lower than in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our service and field option sales were high at close to &#x20AC;150 million. This was primarily driven by productivity upgrades. Such upgrades are not unusual as customers look for incremental capacity when a rise in their product demand suddenly becomes evident.</p>
          <p>And the company's fourth quarter gross margin was 38% versus 34.4% in the third quarter. This reflects an improved coverage of our fixed manufacturing cost, cost reductions, and stronger service and field option sales, the latter generally carrying higher gross margins. We continued our focus on R&amp;D. We've spent 115 million in the fourth quarter, which is by the way the same as our spend in Q3.</p>
          <p>And SG&amp;A came in at 37 million, which is about the same as what we had in Q3. As a result of the aforementioned, operating income improved from 7% in the third quarter to around 12% in Q4. And last quarter of the year, we generated &#x20AC;19 million in net cash. With that, we were able to close out 2009 with a cash balance comfortably over &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Q4 net bookings were strong at 40 systems valued at &#x20AC;956 million, net immersion bookings were 25 systems, 23 were new and two were used and that this demonstrates a continued focus on technology investments driven again by the DRAM and foundry market segments with flash investments just beginning to emerge.</p>
          <p>In addition, we saw 12 new KrF bookings, indicating a continued need for more non-critical systems in support of the leading edge production ramp of our foundry customers.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter bookings pushed our backlog to &#x20AC;1.85 billion, containing 69 systems at DRAM, that being the highest level of the backlog in 10 quarters. Worth highlighting is the fact that there are 51 immersion systems in our backlog, 17 of which are our newest immersion product, the NXT 1950.</p>
          <p>As for the outlook, we continue to increase factory production capacity in order to meet the growing demand, as indicated by our fourth quarter and the anticipated first quarter bookings. However, due to the fact that the normal production lead-time for our more complex and new leading edge products is still fairly long, we will not be able to completely satisfy all demand in the desired delivery time. As a result, some first quarter delivery requests will be shipped early Q2 when our ramp-up capability will have accelerated. And as a result, we expect the first quarter sales to be about 700 million, with the second quarter coming in around &#x20AC;950 million.</p>
          <p>Gross margin in the first quarter is expected to be about 40%. R&amp;D expenses are expected to be &#x20AC;120 million and SG&amp;A 40 million.</p>
          <p>Fourth, furthermore, we expect orders in the first quarter to be at approximately the same level as the fourth quarter of 2009, mainly driven by memory customers and foundry customers again.</p>
          <p>And finally, in respect of 2009 ASML will submit a proposal to the 2010 General Meeting of shareholders to declare an unchanged dividend of $0.20 per share.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn it back over to Eric, who will give us some more views on the upcoming quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. So we close a year of strength, with recovery in sales and strong Q4 systems booking of &#x20AC;956 million, confirming the semiconductor segment upturn. This upturn is currently mainly driven by technology buys from the DRAM sector, by a fairly modest technology set of buys from flash sector, and capacity buys by the first tier foundry at 40 and 45-nanometer nodes. We believe that we will see a continued high level of bookings for the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>A certain number of engines of growth are contributing to this. First, the buildup of 40-nanometer DRAM capacity will continue well into H2, 2010, as the second batch of DRAM players will start ramping then. Second, the long-awaited 30-nanometer flash RAM and 20-nanometer development flash will also start contributing more heavily in Q3 2010. Third, we expect structural foundry build in H2 including the first tier but also the second tier customers.</p>
          <p>With our current 2010 shipment run rate, we have calculated that the litho installed base will support semiconductor unit capacity increase of only 12% in 2010 versus 2009. Upside to this semiconductor unit gross number, as discussed by most industry analysts at this very time, could justify improved lithography shipment run rates during the year.</p>
          <p>In other terms, the structural capacity catch-up that we are seeing today, the technology buys and the potential capacity gap to demand growth support at minimum, the current litho shipment run rate, while certainly not contributing any surplus capacity. With this demand ramp as a background, we are continuing to focus on product development and new product introductions.</p>
          <p>We have now converted all our mid-range TWINSCANs to an upgraded platform with a higher throughput, better overlay and better CD uniformity. We are also ramping our new NXT platform with state-of-the-art performance. We are deploying our holistic lithography product suite and we continue development of the EUV technology.</p>
          <p>Regarding the NXT, our new platform, we now have installed base of five systems and a backlog of 17 systems, 11 in memory sector, five in the IDM sector and one in the foundry sector. Customers will be ramping up these machinery NXTs into volume production in Q2, 2010. Our holistic lithography product suite including the customer accepted software solutions producing higher process yields, is being further enhanced by FlexRay, our flexible illumination system and our YieldStar standalone and inline meteorology systems. These hardware when married with software of the suite provides even better scanner performance and greater factory process control.</p>
          <p>Regarding EUV technology, we're making good system integration progress &#x2013; that along with a continued source performance development, allows us to confirm our ability to ship the first preproduction systems in the second half of 2010, systems for which we plan to close the fixed order very soon. We believe that the renewed industry interest for product and technology translations that we are seeing today, in conjunction with ASML's stronger position, mainly due to improved cost structure but also differentiated and diverse products, has positioned ASML very well for its next significant growth opportunity.</p>
          <p>So on this summary, I would like to leave it to you to ask Peter and I questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. But beforehand, I'd like to ask you to kindly limit your question to one &#x2013; one question with one short follow-up if necessary and if possible. This will allow us to get as many callers in as we can.</p>
          <p>Operator, could we have your instructions and then the first question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Gentlemen, today's first question is from Mr. Didier Scemama. Please state your company name followed by your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's RBS. Thanks for taking for my question. I'd just like to ask a question on the flash memory market and more specifically on SSDs. Just like to have your opinion on basically the impacts of that technology on your revenues. If I'm correct, the adoption of SSDs is quite modest at this point for netbooks and notebooks probably in the low single-digit levels. So what I'm wondering is if SSD's adoption in notebooks and netbooks were to reach something like 10%, what would be the impact in your view on demand for lithography equipment? And related to that, what sort of technology would be required when you talk to your customers to get to sort of inflection point on pricing to really drive adoption of SSDs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good question because SSD is a very large driver. Clearly there has been a bit of a disappointment in some ways that SSD has remained in the areas of I would say 3, 4, 5% mount rate in the PC world. To get to about 10% you would have to have about 1 to 1.5 billion of lithography equipment. The customers I think have started to indicate to us that the mount rate is probably going to increase due to two things. One, they are improving the drivers, the software drivers which I think is more or less related to Windows 7. I understand that it is not yet perfect, but I understand it is improving and therefore will increase the speed of adoption.</p>
          <p>In addition it is true that there is a sort of new agreement that SSD cost target will be so much more supported by 20-nanometer, which is the current development being put in place by the first tier. So, in other terms SSD didn't really contribute anything at this moment into billings, into bookings, and we expect this to be one of the upside opportunities of the second half of 2010 and significantly into 2011 and '12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And in your view when Google announced that their Chrome operating system would be only supported by SSDs. I mean do you think that that could kick start the market or do you think that it's a bit further out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it is certainly another obvious position that says the world will probably get beyond 10%. I think that's the message that the whole industry's expecting. The key question is an economic question really, is exactly when do you have an inflection point and an acceleration point and to that I'm not a specialist of the industry, so I cannot really answer to you. But clearly we expect to go beyond 10% and we look forward to, say, 2 to 3% market share or 2 to 3% mount rate on that, correspond to about 1 billion of lithography. So we feel this is a significant driver of the business and we feel good that it will last next five years or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Gareth Jenkins. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Gareth Jenkins from UBS. Just a quick one on service revenues, very strong in Q4 and I just wondered what the sustainability of this is and obviously related to that, whether the outlook for gross margin is beyond Q1 given the service sales? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The service sales in Q4, particularly strong, which is not uncommon like I said also in the opening comments. Oh and customers have underestimated the capacity ramp. They are looking for upgrades which they have not done in downturns and especially productivity upgrades are very popular, which we tend to relatively quickly. So in the first quarter just to take away some of the outlook pressure this is a very popular product, which actually brought the revenues to about 150 million. Those revenues throughout the year, the first three quarters were less than 100. Normally the normal run rate would be anywhere between those, so between 90 and 150 million, around 115, 120, 125 million, that would be a normal run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just to follow up on that. On the full price margin outlook post Q1 you had very solid gross margins in Q1, I just wondered if you can give us a sense on how we trend through the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we talked about it also on previous calls. The gross margin is a function of course our ability to cover our fixed costs. So the order intake that we saw in the fourth quarter and we guide for the first quarter is a good indicator that fixed cost coverage will not be a major issue going forward.</p>
          <p>As a matter of fact it will contribute to the gross margin. Also the cost reductions that are coming through, which were the result of the cost programs that we had last year, will come through, so the guidance that we gave you, 40% on 700 million, clearly gives you upside when we move to 950. How much that will be, we'll be more specific at the end of Q1, but clearly the move of this in the right direction and the main drivers I just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Gunnar Plagge. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Nomura. Could you talk a little bit about the market in Japan? I mean it looks as if the last three quarters you haven't had a lot of orders, almost no orders. Revenues last four quarters were also close to zero. Then you still have to add 30 million of backlog which I think is mainly Toshiba.</p>
          <p>So maybe first with respect to Toshiba and are we expecting a shipment here soon and could you maybe also qualify whether this is likely XT or NXT and then with regard to Elpida an update would also be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know it is impossible for us to be specific on customers. We'll try to broach an answer that makes sense for you and your modeling. Yes Japan, is really at this moment a DRAM vendor, a Flash vendor and a very very very small market. Also the rest as you know the business of logic is not booming at all at this moment in Japan. So in the DRAM sector, there is definitively a split business between Japan and Taiwan in terms of Elpida and we are happy to have won their confidence. I think that is public and as you know they have announced themselves that they are ramping their production as of Q1. So this production is going to be split between Taiwan and Japan.</p>
          <p>The flash environment in general as we said has been, I would not say disappointed, but slow and this is because it is true that the whole industry has built up significant overcapacity, which took 2009 to be digested and it is highly possible that Toshiba, in fact it is clearly the case of Toshiba. So we have also said that the flash business is going to come back. It was a revenge driven by CC applications we talked about plus additional needs in mobile phones and additional needs in service, and this is starting to build up momentum as of Q2 and that will increase our business in Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally I would like to add that that looking at these regional sales with the importance of global, let's say global &#x2013; I would say alliances especially in the memory world where technology choices are actually made but could be executed in different countries than what I will call real originating technology could come from country A, and could be then made in country B. So you have to be careful with just looking at the regional split, because those designs would actually be made in this let's say joint cooperation structures in other places of the world, and that's definitely the case for the region you just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then on the supply constraints, it seems that you're now at about 1100 flexible, I think you were at 1700 in 2008. So my question really is the supply bottleneck, is that more within ASML or is it more within the supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it is definitely the supply chain although we thank our suppliers for their effort because in reality the constraint is because we have converted all our products to the new products. The mid-range used to be called XT 3 versions, that is internal code, it is now an XT 4 version, the new machine called NXT. So you're talking about having to rebuild from scratch, from zero, a complete supply chain, which usually would take between one year or nine months at least to be set up including inclusive their own CapEx et cetera et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, this is the main constraint. Our business is one of integration where testing is more important and yes, it is easier for us to build up temporary workers or using some of our engineers to do more. So we definitively are far from being the limits &#x2013; the limit is because we are moving up all those new products and it takes time to build up the pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks, that's very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Satya Kumar. Please state your company name followed by your <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, &#x2013; Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse. Quick question on your orders from memory. I presume obviously most of these orders are coming from DRAM. How much of these orders are for technology shrinks versus capacity and at this point do you have a sense of what portion of the installed base in DRAM has already placed orders to shrink, that's in your backlog in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first question is easier to answer. In the DRAM bookings that we got, 100% is technology transition. In fact this is one of the things we've discovered. It seems that now the customers have this capability of using all the installed base in the, what we call the non-critical layers of the new technology, and therefore the only thing they need is the critical layers and that's why they only buy the latest machine, which obviously would be immersion. So in DRAM clearly 100% is in immersion critical layers and non-critical obviously installed base. Regarding the percentages of what remains to be booked by the guys who have already started, I would say we are at 50% of the first tier and we are low on the second tier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I look at your, I mean continuation on the DRAM theme again, if I look at your 2009 shipments to memory, in aggregate that was less than a fourth of your shipments to the sector in 2007 peak year. Obviously DRAM supply growth was constrained and clearly your guiding for consensus for Q1, one of your customers, Nanya, this morning actually lowered their supply growth projections for 2010 because of the lack of equipment availability. Supposing we get another 40 or 50% demand growth for DRAM in 2011. Would we need to start to see capacity orders from DRAM to meet that demand because you're sort of using up all the shrink spend this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in fact, first of all it's very difficult to explain why would a supplier, a customer will be reducing or increasing its output. Maybe because it's litho driven, but it may be that there's other reasons for that, but clearly at this moment everybody is trying to ramp as fast as possible. In my opinion I think the biggest issue that they will have is that they also have to ramp new technologies and processes, these are not only CapEx it's &#x2013; you &#x2013; we do not know about the yield, we do not know about the complexity of making it work, so you are going to have for a period of six, nine months tons of difficulties in the segment of ramping to demand.</p>
          <p>So that in turn will create potential need for additional bookings because some of the guys will have more difficulty to hit the customer needs; the customers will go for the competitors. So you are going to potentially have in fact an acceleration of bookings on some areas to try to win the places where you &#x2013; they cannot deliver.</p>
          <p>Our own constraint is yes, we are indeed putting constraints on our customer at this moment because you will start from scratch and at the moment in this industry where the customers come and say I need to have delivery in three months and we all know the theoretical lead times are nine, so there is obviously some haggling about who's right, wrong, et cetera and the terms we are creating some constraint. But at this moment I would not consider these constraints are life threatening to anybody nor stopping you to buy any nice end products.</p>

          <p>Yeah the node today in DRAM is 40 nano. And in 2011 it's going to be another node, in fact we are at this moment reviewing the requirements for the new nodes and it seems that the DRAM industry is putting itself on a one-year type lead time for new nodes from a original 18 months. So there is something at this moment, which is happening for 2011, a new set of technology.</p>

          <p>It is not clear yet whether that shrink will basically satisfy the bit growth demand in 2011. It is not the case we need new fabs, that's what you were looking for. That's unclear right now, that really depends on the bit growth numbers that we should try to find out how much that could be for 2011. Now those numbers have been going up, means the analysts have over the last two, three months have actually upped their forecast for bit growth and we are currently trying to figure out what that would mean in terms of real additional capacity in terms of new fabs. That's not clear.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I just had a question on the competitive position of the NXT versus Nikon mainly because of the lot of noise in the market associated with some customers trying out the new Nikon tool et cetera. How you see your positioning in terms of what you shipped as well as what you have in terms of orders from the major customers and I have one follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, definitively our competitor is a very valid competitor working on value generation. So our competition is clearly on the capabilities, on the performance of the machine. At this moment both of us are running our machines. I was offering XT and Nikon the 620 to try to meet the customer's requirements. We think that with five installed base and a backlog of 17 with certain numbers of committed production, we have proven to the customer that we've reached the level of performance that fits the needs. We understand that our competitor will continue improving and improving and improving the machine. This looks very, very similar to us to the competition that started two years ago on their 610 and our XT. At the time we were fighting or targeting the same specification.</p>
          <p>Today is about the same situation. The specification is basically the customer's specification. We have to try to make it. It will have to be proven who can make it, which are the products which are at end of the day have more extendibility, more capability, and better cost of ownership. We feel comfortable about that race because we are still using a TWINSCAN concept, which allows a machine to be measuring its way first while it's exposing, which allows in fact you to decide how much you want to measure, which allows you to decide to in fact obtain an extremely good performance of chip resolution.</p>
          <p>Our competitor is using still a serial method by which you measure and then you expose. By doing this, it is logical to understand that if you measure a lot to achieve a very good exposure performance, then you &#x2013; it takes time and then you wait &#x2013; the lens waits until you can expose. So it has a lower throughput and potentially higher cost of ownership. So we are comfortable that our concept is still different than our competitors and allow us to think that what we achieved when we introduced TWINSCAN in 2000 will be projected in the next decade because we are still using a differentiated architecture.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Eric. Just one question, Peter, on the margins. I mean in the previous call you talked about I mean hitting and going towards the 30% margin at the peak, I mean how would we be looking at gross margin then, I mean given 950 million in order intake approximately in the fourth quarter, by the fourth quarter of this year, I mean possibly you could have revenues north of a 1 billion or 1.05 or so, so I mean if you did your numbers sitting today I mean what would we be looking at gross margins at that sort of revenue level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think, clearly you understand that I'm not going to give you any guidance on the fourth quarter gross margins. But to give you an indication we said drivers for the gross margin development were adjustments in the cost structure and a better product mix, especially focused on those products that will enhance the value of our tools, i.e., the holistic litho products, which we are making progress with also in terms of shipments and ordering. That will find its way partially to, let's say, field service and sales but also in the value that we can contribute to the tool.</p>
          <p>Those are the elements next to the higher volume which will give us a better loads of the fixed cost, of which we said also last year that our target is to go, we should, we start moving towards, our focus on five billion, that we won't have a target of 45% gross margin. Now, clearly we are not going to be there from one quarter to the others, going to be a trajectory, it's going to take a bit of time, but when you talk about sales levels you just indicated, clearly the gross margin will be definitely significantly over 40% and it would be heading towards our real target. Whether it would be there in the fourth quarter, it's too early to say, but that's definitely, you know what our target is and we should be heading in that right direction.</p>
          <p>What that would mean for the operating margin you were referring to, clearly we said also in previous calls that that could be heading towards the 30% mark and that is easy if you take, let's say, the five billion at 45% and you subtract our R&amp;D cost and our SG&amp;A cost, you can make that calculation easily. So yeah, clearly the gross margin and the operating margin trajectory is quite clear to us, and higher levels of sales to the level that you just mentioned will definitely help.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citigroup. Thanks. Two things, first of all, if I take your June quarter shipments that you're actually guiding to, and I assume that, you know, with those going to be roughly 25% of wafer fab equipment, which is up fairly sizably versus what it's been the last couple years. So I'm sort of building in some share gain there for litho.</p>
          <p>It implies that the industry is going to spend about 50 billion, so that sort of at a 50 billion CapEx run rate, which is odd because all the companies, if you add up where all the companies are sort of guiding CapEx to, it's more like 35 or 37 billion. So I'm kind of wondering, is it that people are forward buying lithography or is it that the companies just aren't sort of coming clean with how much money that they're going to spend this year? And then I had a follow up. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well definitely, I think, yeah, historically litho have been forward both because lead time is enormous on our side and secondly, it takes also very significant time to qualify your litho tools, so the wafers out takes long time. So yes, it's a timing issue. Secondly, we cannot really comment on your 25% share of litho to the total CapEx, in particular on the quarter. You are now talking about an environment where the customers have been able to only buy equipments which help them on critical layers and using their installed base for non-critical.</p>
          <p>Even for litho, it's kind of new. We used to have a more balanced situation by which a customer would come and say I've got a new fab, to make the fab work I need three, I think normal line would be three or four immersion, five to 10 KrF and five to 10 i-Line and we would take an order for that. That was the original way of doing business about two to three years ago.</p>
          <p>We haven't done that for two to three years. We are only shipping the leading edge. So it may be that your ratios have to be rethought completely in view of this new model. I can't really help you on this one because you are now, need to talk to Applied Material, KLA, et cetera. But for us we are certain that the guidance that we've given correspond to spots in those fabs and if we were not to ship, the customers will definitely, will not be able to build even the same amount of wafers of the new product than they even had in 2009, which would be impossible. So in other terms, you can question whether the run rate will last more than four quarters, but you cannot question that the run rate will not last for two quarters.</p>
          <p>Secondly I think you should look at another ratio if you wanted to do microeconomic ratio, you should take the diffusion rate, litho CapEx divided by sales of semiconductors. And you will see an interesting curve. You will see that the curve was hovering around 3% for a long time, and then it went up in 2007 when the DRAM business got crazy, and it went from 3% to say 3.2, 3.3. And then since 2007 that ratio is down, last year it was 1.5% and this year it may be less than 2 or at 2% if some of the analysts are correct. So you're talking about a significant number, yes, 950 million in the quarter. But if you divide this by the total expectation of the silicon revenue, you're going to be surprised that we are much lower than historical trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess the gap is just so significant that it just sort of indicates that maybe there's going to be a falloff in bookings later on this year. But as a follow-up, it seems like the weaker shipments in March came out of nowhere a bit, and I'm a little surprised because if it's related to the technology platform, it seems like you would have known about that before.</p>
          <p>So, I'm sort of wondering whether there was something that occurred between your meetings with folks during the quarter and now that sort of came out of nowhere that led your, you to be more shipment constrained in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes and no. The discussions for the fourth quarter with customers have been do you want XTs or did you want NXTs. When you usually come up with this question, the customers always want NXTs. And of course, then you get yourself into a mode and say, well, an NXT has a nine-month lead time and XT has a six-month lead time. And then you have a compromise discussion, because of course the customer want an NXT because it has supposedly longer lead time, although they &#x2013; sorry longer lifetime with more expandability, so the customer is ready to pay more money, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, you got that debate. And to be honest it lasts until the last moment usually, in particular because they are excited about the NXT so they want to wait until the last moment to switch between XTs and NXTs. So what's happened, if you will, is that we were expecting or we could have expected some customers to be more let's say realistic and ask for XT shipment in the Q1 timeframe, but in reality we could not deliver the NXT and they asked us to wait, or not wait, they didn't ask us to wait, but they basically agreed to that they had to accept that a certain number of NXTs would not ship in March but would ship in April.</p>
          <p>So now remember an NXT cost 40 million, so you can imagine how many NXTs it makes to have this slight change of expectations Q1 to Q2. So that's basically what happened. I think it is nothing special regarding the trends of business. It is just the timing plus or minus one month on four or five machine.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks so much. It's with Goldman Sachs. I wanted to revisit your theme about being able to support 12% unit growth in the broader industry. And maybe ask a question that was sort of asked before, what sort of DRAM and bit growth you think your installed base can support today?</p>
          <p>In other words how of much an incremental upgrade path do you think people really need to get to some sort of bit growth target that is in line with the historical averages if you look at DRAM and bit growth coming out of a downturn historically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we think that our 12% DRAM, if I am not mistaken, corresponds to about 50% bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>48%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>48% bit gross in DRAM and yeah, that's about it and in there you have also NAND which correspond to a 69% bit growth. So, when you talk about now the excitement about Windows 7, you will hear some analysts talk about more than that now and I'm trying to find out the latest analysis, in fact I don't have it with me, so you may have to ask them. But there is now more interest, more excitement about those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My follow question would be &#x2013; there seems to be some sort of discussion about when or if your own order book perhaps may be peaking at around &#x20AC;1 billion or so. But I was just wondering in your view, given that capacity adds as you just discussed in DRAM at this point is still relatively low, and the same seems to be the case in foundry and then NAND if anything is still relatively dormant.</p>
          <p>So I was just wondering what that means from your point of view in terms of the potential order peak end of cycle because historically speaking of course, your quarterly order peak was not too far from current levels? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is in fact why today for the first time, in fact for me for five years, we have guided six months and we're also guiding the possibility of upside, so that's a way for us to say we believe that there's enough engines of opportunities of growth and what you mentioned about flash now being there already but it should be there and DRAM bit gross is not that big at this moment, et cetera, et cetera, as much opportunities to sustain this type of run rate that we're talking about.</p>
          <p>So, let me try to summarize it differently. If you &#x2013; and it's not us to answer, it's economist to answer. If you believe that we are back into a rebuild up, that there is no more semiconductor cycle. So, you look at your curve, your semiconductor and you were down now and you are putting yourself on, back into a historical curve. If you do that, clearly we're talking about a sustained gross profile for 2010, 2011, 2012. And I do not know if we are going to hover plus or minus the billion or whatever, but you're talking about a very healthy opportunity which is why we has continued talking about our corporate target to reach five billion when &#x2013; in fact during this next cycle.</p>
          <p>Of course if an analyst will tell you, no, this cycle will in fact be impeded by a sort of a "W" curve of some sort, that is, the world is going to have a hiccup due to unemployment et cetera and all the good news or these engines we talked about, the fact that there's tons of applications coming bout, the fact that there has been underinvestment for a long time in some segments like the foundry segment, the fact that as Tim Acuri was, in fact, we were discussing, surprisingly people are buying only the leading edge, they are not buying anything else. That's has to change.</p>
          <p>The fact that there hasn't been any fab lately, but you are starting to see global foundry et cetera, et cetera. So though all those good news are going to be impacted by an economy W curve, then you would have a slightly less aggressive, you won't have the sustainable 1 billion thing, but you probably won't be very far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and also I'd like to add to that, if you make a comparison to previous cycles, like the one that Eric just said, in this particular cycle, there's a lot of emphasis on the leading edge products in which our market share currently is significantly higher than it was in the previous two, three cycles that at least I have seen. So I think there are couple of things that are definitely different here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Philip Scholte at Rabo Securities. A question on your potential resumption of share buybacks because I'm seeing some things on the newswires passing by. Could you maybe update us on this call as to when you will decide on restarting share buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what was said is quite clear that we will have a good year. We'll be profitable, we'll be generating cash. But it could be that in a year like 2010 we see, like we've indicated from Q1 to Q2, we see a growing sales trend, which will &#x2013; the way that we run our business mean that the investments in working capital like in receivables and in inventory will clearly proceed the generation of the cash.</p>
          <p>So it means that you first have to collect it in the end before you can distribute. So that was the only comment that was made. If you think about cash generation, that will be good, but you have to keep in your mind that there is a cash conversion cycle which force us to go through working capital and through receivables in a let's say a year where you could see growing sales. So that would limit let's say the cash generation this year, but would definitely show in 2011. That was only comment made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And the comment on the 1.5 billion cash position, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've always said we have a policy which says we target our cash balance anywhere between 1 and 1.5 billion. So we don't want to go lower than 1, and we don't necessarily need to be higher than 1.5. So there is no change. And that means that if we go higher, we will return the money to the shareholders and which will be a combination of dividends which we announce also today and of share buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But with the shortfall of what may be on operating cost, I was a bit surprised by the sort of ramp up in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A. Can you already comment a bit on your expectations for the second quarter in those costs? Can we expect them to continue to go up?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly decided to put more money into R&amp;D, as you've noticed, this was definite voluntary move, we can afford it and we have some ideas, so we are going to use it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the SG&amp;A was mainly driven by selling-related costs because costs are going up and also a bit of inflation of the existing work force, so it was modest salary increases that that's also part of it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's B of A/Merrill Lynch. I just had a question on pricing. I wondered if there was any pressure on pricing resulting from the constraints you're seeing with the customers or whether there is a pricing you see on the NXT machine was affected in Q4 by the sale of let's say evaluation systems?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in this business pricing is mainly a very long-term negotiation. Often the customer will choose you. He chooses you for a long time. So you price based on the technical performance and that's has happened so there is no technical pricing where we would try to increase the price for one quarter or reduce it depending on availability or pressure.</p>
          <p>So no, we are on the same trends of pricing that we talked about, which basically is targeted at offering the customer the standard cost of ownership improvement per year. We're doing this at this moment and that should allow us to move our gross margin as we said inclusive of the volume effect on every other volume north of 40% as we go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then just as a follow-up, with the capacity spending coming through from the Tier 1 foundries, what's your sense of how much further they can go before they need new shells or is there a risk that we see a pause in that capacity spending when they have to build more capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you have now I would say officially position by global foundry that they are going to have at least one if not two shells. It is my understanding that TSMC has also published their new shell decisions. I think it's a bit complicated to understand because they do the same numbering, and if I'm not mistaken Fab 4 or Fab 14 or whatever it is. But these are new shells discussion or decision. I am not aware of any activity that at UMC obviously, but these are two very large members of the foundry community which have &#x2013; which are going to put shells in business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Mehdi Hosseini from FBR Capital Markets. Two questions, first, if you were not constrained with manufacturing, what would be &#x2013; what would have been your Q1 guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I will be put in jail if I want to answer your question, but I would think the demand &#x2013; the customer would have been happier with 1.2 billion or something, but be cautious with my number, we, life is always a comparison between dreams and reality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, we are always constraining the business because our lead times are so enormous. So, if you ask me the more the question what is the natural need that does not constrain the real output, I think we're not far. Of course we are pissed off about our months there and there because we take comfort out of the equation. But at this point I repeat your sons and grandsons will have their products in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. And I see &#x2013; I look at the past quarter &#x2013; past few quarters like Q4, the actual reported booking came in about 23% above your guidance. I want to know what happened that caused this upside compared to what you provided and could we see the same trend in Q1 primarily because of the increase in lead time why wouldn't memory especially DRAM guys wanting to get into the queue to secure shipment later this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think on the guidance, we give you our best estimate at that moment, a few months is almost like &#x2013; feels like a century from time to time in this business. So it's very difficult to &#x2013; let me go back to Q3 in July and early August we saw no trends in any booking activity really and we just we came back from the holiday period and it was all fire. So these things happen fast, it's difficult to predict.</p>
          <p>We base our estimates on our current contacts with our customers. But as we speak there are days when we have an estimate and e-mails from top executives of our customers comes in and they are changing the demand; these things change and it's &#x2013; and it's &#x2013; and it could be a few tools.</p>
          <p>And that could be like I said, Eric said 42 million, 40 million tools, if they want four extra, it's 150 million. So it's that level of granularity that has an impact. It's &#x2013; and that's basically what it is. So &#x2013; and on what could happen going forward I would like to refer what Eric said earlier. You know, clearly when you look at the three &#x2013; at the three sectors in our business DRAM, Flash, and foundries, or, you know, logic, it was quite clear about where we are and then that we feel there is an upside potential and that upside potential will somewhere down the line will translate into orders. And when that will happen is difficult to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And at this moment there is no overheating in the order book &#x2013; overheating in the sense that you mentioned it which is I am a customer I am getting worried about not having enough capacity. So, I am overbooking or I am booking ahead, that hasn't happened. And we are working very hard that it doesn't happen, and the fact that most of our capacity constraint at this moment is due to an introduction of new products but not capacity constraint per se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's a learning curve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a learning curve. So you get the knowledge because of the delay but you don't get the knowledge because you're just not getting it, in fact all our customers are going to get their product and we're not intending to be limiters at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sure. I am just trying to understand the longevity of the cycle. In one hand the memory guys, DRAM, Flash have all placed orders for only shrink or technology that have yet to come back for capacity; on the other hand as one of the callers have suggested maybe orders have peaked but it seems like two conflicting thought process.</p>
          <p>So, if the memory guys, have yet to come back with the real capacity orders and given the increasing lead time, how should we think about the timing of those, is that just that the Samsungs of the world are waiting to have more confidence on the world economy and begin shipment or something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have unfortunately by good performance, I suppose convinced our key customers that they can come up with very short term reaction, so I do expect in fact when they will have a need for capacity which could happen &#x2013; the example of the foundry guy who is today focusing on 45-nanometer, but can get a capacity order on 65. That will be on very, very short-term lead time, so you will not have a preparation of that, it will happen and we really got to be ready for these things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just also one comment, I mean just over 70% of the backlog is for shipments over the next six months, so if you would see a real overheating that would be a different number, so customers still have what I've said their confidence that we will be able to ramp-up and we have ample capacity in Q3 and in Q4 and we believe the same.</p>
          <p>So they don't need to rush order and double book which by the way for those very expensive tools, we have pretty good encouragements also at the customer side of where those tools are going. So we have also some reasons and some good sources to check whether this is true or whether it's just fantasy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Ladies and Gentlemen I think we have about time for one more caller. So if you are unable to get through and you still have a question, feel free to call the Investor Relations Department and we'll try to help you. And now operator, if we could have the last question or caller please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And today's last question is from Mr. Janardan Menon, go ahead please sir. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, it's Liberum Capital. Just a question, I guess following up on the previous set of questions, which is by when would you expect to get the lead time on the 1950 down to around six, seven months, or rather by when would a customer feel that delivery of this tool is not a sort of bottleneck for this capacity RAM.</p>
          <p>And an associated question is, when you first came out with the 1950, the assumption was that your early customers will be from the NAND flash market, but now it looks like the DRAM industry has gone ahead of NAND flash and placed a lot of orders for this tool.</p>
          <p>So why do you think the NAND flash industry is actually holding back on placing orders for this tool and do you think that the IDM industry, especially microprocessor will also adopt this tool in a fairly wide way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, and yes, so in terms of the lead time for the NXT it &#x2013; I would say it is now normal, but normal means six months and for &#x2013; we expect Q3 to be the time where we are taking as many orders as the customers are ready to give us.</p>
          <p>So we &#x2013; the difficulties I don't say are fully past, because we &#x2013; but remember the machines takes a long time to be tested so most of the problems we have are there already, the machines are there. The build-up for Q3 is at this moment reasonably under control. So Q3 shipment July 1 would be I would say on the standard situation where we don't constrain the market.</p>
          <p>Your question about NAND before DRAM, as I said, the &#x2013; I don't think it is product related, it is when do they need the capacity and I think again the reason why there is no urgency or there was no urgency on NAND in the past six, nine months or so has been because the big players have overinvested and have been digesting a very fairly good set of ASML machine by the way.</p>
          <p>And the next batch is at this very moment being planned and I think it is again applications driven and or volume driven and I think it is because they are &#x2013; had &#x2013; they already, may have been disappointed by the SSDs and are getting the SSDs to reramp back into the Q3 timeframe, so it's application driven, it's not us.</p>
          <p>And as the NXT machine, a good machine for logic in fact we've been told by a certain numbers of leaders of the logic arena that the challenge that the next generation nodes give them in overlay is such that they are very highly worried about process control. And therefore the more tolerance that you have or the less budget that you have for the machine addressed is a fundamental decision making point.</p>
          <p>So we feel extremely happy with this difficulty, I should not say this is in a cynical way but we think the NXT is offering in fact a significant solution to this environment, logic environment which is even worse in requirements than DRAM which is a good use of the NXT. So, the only negative part of logic is it takes longer for them to build up the recipe and to ramp into production. So we would expect R&amp;D to be done now. In fact you've seen in the backlog guys mentioned that we have a lot of IDMs who are in the NXT now in R&amp;D. But those guys will ramp probably production 2011.</p>
