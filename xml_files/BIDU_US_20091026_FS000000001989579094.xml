          <p>Hello, everyone, and welcome to Baidu's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Baidu's earnings release was distributed earlier today, and you can find a copy on our website as well as on newswire services.</p>
          <p>Today, you will hear from Robin Li, Baidu's Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Li, Baidu's Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, Robin and Jennifer will be joined by Peng Ye, our Chief Operating Officer, and Haoyu Shen, Vice President of Business Operations, to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we continue, please note that the discussion today will contain forward-looking statements made under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Baidu does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required under applicable law.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a webcast of this conference call will be available on Baidu's corporate website, at ir.baidu.com.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Throughout the economic challenges in the past year, Baidu has consistently kept our focus on execution and improving monetization, and we are seeing results. The third quarter enjoyed solid growth in both revenues and net income. In addition, large customers are performing well and increasingly allocating more of their budgets to our platform.</p>
          <p>China's Internet market is rapidly growing, and search engine marketing is increasingly important. And Baidu has been working hard to offer more advanced products and tools for users, customers and partners. We delivered a solid result this past quarter. We are in good shape to drive important initiatives in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Phoenix Nest was launched six months ago and has been making good progress on its migration. Revenues from Phoenix Nest at the end of Q3 contributed to over 20% of our total revenue. Among those customers who have adopted Phoenix Nest, the percentage is much high. In addition, we have seen key monetization metrics such as coverage and cost per click trending upwards. We are confident that customer acceptance for Phoenix Nest has reached a critical mass, and we are ready to complete the transition in Q4.</p>
          <p>Having a single platform will allow our customers to focus their resources and better realize the superior benefits offered by Phoenix Nest. Likewise, by having a single bidding platform instead of two, we will be able to free up internal resources and more efficiently drive customer and revenue growth as well as improve monetization.</p>
          <p>While we are confident in our decision and our ability to execute the switch to Phoenix Nest, we do anticipate short term negative revenue impact as some customers may lag behind in ramping up their spending on Phoenix Nest.</p>
          <p>In preparation, we have implemented a customer service outreach program to help ensure a smooth transition. For the duration of the quarter, our internal risk office will be fully occupied by the Phoenix Nest migration.</p>
          <p>Looking to other developments in the third quarter, in order to better monetize our union traffic, we introduced Baidu Union Marketing an upgraded platform for placing contextual links on Baidu Union sites. This product was codenamed Basel which you might have heard of.</p>
          <p>The new Union marketing platform is independent of P4P meaning a customer can run contextual campaigns separately from their paid search campaign. We also launched a number of tools recently to assist our customers and Union members to more effectively take advantage of the online marketing product we offer.</p>
          <p>Baidu Statistics is an advanced tool which allow customers to track and analyze site traffic in order to optimize their online marketing campaigns and increase ROI. And Site Manager is a tool for partners to manage their inventory on their sites. Our intent is to create a more efficient online marketing ecosystem for our customers and partners which Baidu will also benefit from over time.</p>
          <p>Moving to the user front, Project Aladdin an ongoing initiative to mine content from the hidden web is also moving along. The Aladdin open platform has received thousand of applications from webmasters since it was launched, and we have established information exchange interfaces with many of them.</p>
          <p>Aladdin is part of a larger initiative &#x2013; box computing, which will increasingly be the backbone of future Baidu initiatives. The box computing concept is based on our belief that as technology becomes increasingly complex, the user interface will move toward simplification. A person types a command into a box similar to Baidu's search box on any device screen and the computer will process the command and take an appropriate action. The action could be to return a piece of information, run a software application, or connect the person to online services directly. In order to achieve the vision of box computing at Baidu, we have been working with third parties to make content applications accessible through our search box.</p>
          <p>Mobile search is also an area that is increasingly important to us and we are working to extend Baidu's leadership there. You may have heard that we recently announced a partnership with China Unicom, which follows our partnership with China Telecom formed in May. More importantly, we are working hard to develop high quality mobile search products. Using our proprietary transcoder technology and Baidu Palm, which is Baidu's integrated version of mobile search services. Mobile phone users can easily access and enjoy the user-friendly functions of our PC-based services.</p>
          <p>We also launched a mobile search service in Japan, where 80% of Internet users also log on wirelessly. We are continuing to pushing forward innovations and strategic partnerships on this front.</p>
          <p>Today more than ever, Baidu is the number one search engine in China and we are seeing progress on all fronts; technology, user experience, customer offerings and branding, but we believe there is still room for improvement. Going forward, we will continue to enhance search user experience, customer ROI, as well as monetization. We will continue to attract talented people. There are tremendous opportunities in our market and we want to be well positioned to seize them through innovation and execution.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in anticipation of our tenth year anniversary, we will be moving into our newly completed headquarter in Q4, we welcome your visit.</p>
          <p>And now let me turn the call over to Jennifer for financial highlight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. During the third quarter, we remained focused on maintaining strong growth and improving profitability through efficiency management and economies of scale. We'll continue with our balanced approach to controlling cost, while investing in the important initiative and ongoing improvements to our offerings. Specifically for the fourth quarter we'll be allocating marketing budget for the celebration of our tenth anniversary, as well as moving into the new Baidu campus.</p>
          <p>In addition, expenses associated with new hires in R&amp;D and sales, which we acquired towards the end of Q3, will be reflected in Q4 along with the expenses for new hires we plan to make during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at some of the financial highlights for the quarter. The amounts mentioned are in RMB unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>For the third quarter, total revenue were RMB1.279 billion, within guidance, and represents a 39% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Diluted EPS for the third quarter was RMB14.14 or $2.07. This includes two non-reoccurring benefits in other income and income tax expenses amounting to RMB29.6 million. Without these the diluted EPS for the quarter would be RMB13.29 or $1.95.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Baidu had approximately 216,000 active online marketing customers; a 11% increase from the corresponding period in 2008, and a 6% increase from the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the third quarter was approximately RMB 5,900; a 26% increase from the corresponding period in 2008 and a 9% increase from the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition cost, as a component of cost of revenue, was RMB196 million or 15% of total revenues, as compared to 12% in the corresponding period in 2008 and 16% in the second quarter of 2009. The slight sequential decrease over Q2 reflects normal market fluctuations.</p>
          <p>Bandwidth cost and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue both continue to decrease in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. This reflects efficiency improvements as well as increased scalability of investment in capital expenditure. We will continue to invest to ensure we have an efficient infrastructure and sufficient capacity to serve the growing and evolving internet development.</p>
          <p>Selling, general and administrative expenses in Q3 was 198 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. With the ongoing rollout of Phoenix Nest and overall sales expansion, we expect to continue increasing sales head count.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses was 117 million, an increase of 49% over the year-ago period, primarily due to increased head count. Operating profit for the third quarter was RMB521 million, a increase of 42% over Q3 2008, primarily driven by good management of expenses and platform scalability.</p>
          <p>Total head count as of September 30, 2009 was about 7,000. The increase in head count mainly comes from sales and marketing and R&amp;D to support our many initiatives, including Phoenix Nest and Aladdin. We expect to continue increase sales and R&amp;D head count.</p>
          <p>In other income, we received a government grant of 14.3 million in this quarter. Income tax expense was RMB49 million for the third quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 9.1%, the same with the corresponding period in 2008 and compared to 11.8% in the previous quarter. The sequential decline in tax expense is due to a receding tax benefit in this quarter in the amount of 15.3 million for the year 2008. We were rewarded this refund because we obtained a preferential income tax status for one of our subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>Net income was 493 million a 42% increase from the corresponding period in 2008. Basic and diluted EPS for the third quarter of '09 amounted to 14.23 and 14.14 respectively.</p>
          <p>Net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure was RMB514 million, a 41% increase year-over-year. Basic and diluted EPS excluding share based compensation expenses both non-GAAP measures were RMB14.84 and 14.75 respectively.</p>
          <p>As of September 30, 2009, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB4 billion. Net operating cash flow and capital expenditure for the third quarter of '09 were RMB734 million and RMB130 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Now let me provide you our top line guidance for the fourth quarter 2009. As Robin noted, we believe that our customer acceptance for Phoenix Nest has reached the critical mass and we are ready to complete the transition to Phoenix Nest in Q4. Please note that our guidance already takes into consideration the anticipated temporary impact of the switch.</p>
          <p>We currently expect total revenue for the fourth quarter of '09 to be between RMB1.19 billion to RMB1.23 billion, which would represent 32% to 36% year-over-year growth. I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.</p>
          <p>I would now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from the line of James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could you discuss, why you decided to accelerate the full conversion from Baidu Classic to Baidu Professional, to compete it during the fourth quarter rather than compete it next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, James. Yeah, I guess I'll break down the answer into two parts. One is the revenue part. And Robin mentioned in his prepared remarks, about six months ago, we launched the Phoenix Nest openly to our customers, who are seeing the key monetization metrics all go in the right direction. The actual coverage provided by Phoenix Nest is definitely increasing and the CPC, cost per click on the click brought by Phoenix Nest has also been increasing steadily since six months ago. So our monetization metrics, we're happy with where we are.</p>
          <p>And on the operation metrics, which Robin also alluded to in his remarks, on a monthly basis, we're seeing over 70% of our customers are already using Phoenix Nest. And overall, at the end of Q3 on a run rate basis, over 20% of our revenue is already coming from Phoenix Nest. So on both operation metrics and monetization metrics, we're happy with where we are. We feel we're ready.</p>
          <p>Then, I guess why now &#x2013; that's another part of your question. Running two systems puts a lot of pressure and stress on management capacity, on our customers, and also on our customer service staff. So that's one thing. The other thing is it also puts some stress on our system. Running two options is basically suboptimal, because these two systems are artificially separated and segmented. So it will be hard for Phoenix Nest over time to reap its full potential with running two systems. So I think if we move now, we can free up a lot of resources on the management side, and customer service side, and also on customer side to focus on this new superior system, and also for our algorithm it can improve faster so that we have the chance to reap the full potential of Phoenix Nest faster. And we've been saying all along that this is a superior system. And in the past six months it has proved itself. So given all of the above reasons, I think we're ready to move now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if it's a superior system and the monetization is improving, where does the temporary hit to revenue come from? Is it because CPCs are lower on Baidu Professional than Baidu Classic, or is it because you expect some customers to just stop spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The monetization improves a few metrics so on coverage, it gives us more coverage meaning we &#x2013; the system can match more relevant pay links than we can before. So coverage will go up, so naturally click through rates will go up <mark type="inaudible" /> the total impression. And also eventually we think CPC will also go up just because the system that -- the auction system encourages the customers to tell the truth so that they can bid truthfully, eventually it will be better for them to measure their ROI which will lead to them spending from them at the internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also because of the transition we need to prepare for a lot of things especially for the customer service team they basically stopped doing improvements in the traffic addition, which we expect would affect the revenue in a negative way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning. If we can just revisit in terms of the impact from the shift toward the Phoenix, if we weren't going to do that transition all the way over this quarter, do you know what the impact would have been or what you would have guided to for December if that was the case? And I got one follow-up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly we are &#x2013; Gene we're looking at roughly about 10% negative impact on a quarterly basis because of the switch. As Robin mentioned, so there are two parts, leading into December 1, our customer service will be totally focused on working with the moving customers.</p>
          <p>And also, at the time of the switch, we would expect that some of these customers may lag behind. Either they are not ready to move immediately or even for some who move because it's a new system and they might scale back their spending with us. So in total, for this quarter, we think roughly the impact is about 10 percentage points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When does the actual &#x2013; when does the switch flip over to Phoenix Nest? Is it &#x2013; when will we be fully &#x2013; is it going to be gradual throughout the quarter or is it going to be kind of a one-day event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Practically, it will be gradual over the quarter, leading to December 1. We've noticed all of our customers today I think a lot of them will hear about this. We noticed some &#x2013; we noticed our staff yesterday, and most of our customers will hear from our customer support staff staff today and we'll start the moving today. So practically, if you move today, you will have Phoenix Nest spending tomorrow. But December 1 is a clear cutoff date. From December 1, the old system will not be available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. So I guess in that case, if we have a full quarter impact on the new system in Q1, should we take that in consideration when we do our March estimates as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Dick Wei with JP Morgan. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question is that for the Phoenix Nest is there a specific location the display location is concerned, is it going to be different from the current &#x2013; the top head and the right-hand side panel or you also be on the left hand main panel as well, if you can discuss that will be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right we had said all along that Phoenix Nest is a new auction &#x2013; system. It's a new mechanism and it's independent of where <mark type="inaudible" /> displayed. So this switch that we are talking about means Phoenix Nest as a auction system, as a bidding system, as a keyword management system will take over all the inventory we have on our search result page, meaning the main panel will also be powered, if you will, by Phoenix Nest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we have the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Leung with Citigroup. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. My question is also on Phoenix Nest. Given this has been launched for six months I assume that some of the expected negative impact is at least in part based on how the existing customers spend have trended when they switch over to this system. Can you elaborate a little bit more on is the initial impact due to the fewer clicks or customers withholding their budget intentionally? And is there much impact due to the lower cost per click because there is a smaller group of keywords that are available for sale? Or are the customers underbidding because this is kind of a blind close system?</p>
          <p>And can you also elaborate on how these customers trend using Phoenix Nest have trended over the past few months since launch? So in other words have you seen a recovery in their spend kind of towards the later part of these six months? How fast does the spend recover? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a lot of questions loaded together but I guess it's just &#x2013; let me give you an overview of what we're seeing in the past six months. So we mentioned that <mark type="inaudible" /> at the end of Q2, 20% of revenues coming from the Internet but that percentage has been steadily going up since day one. And the other metric was that 70% are on a monthly basis already using Phoenix Nest, that's definitely a metrics that keeps going up.</p>
          <p>And if you look at these two metrics together and then you ask yourself, okay so what's the percentage of spending from Phoenix Nest accounting for those customers who are already using Phoenix Nest that percent as you can imagine is much higher.</p>
          <p>As far as clicks and CPC because not all the customers are bidding on Phoenix Nest yet, and right now the main panel takes priority the CPC in sort of a general sense is still lower than the Classic system but that's for obvious reasons. But again, we are seeing that metric, CPC, going up pretty healthily in the past six months.</p>
          <p>And also the &#x2013; in terms of number of clicks that's growing very fast as well, the CPC as well because the <mark type="inaudible" /> better capability in matching queries with relevant paid links, CPC is also going up at a very healthy rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add a few words. Regarding to the number of keywords available for sale right now they are separated from Classic edition and the Professional edition. After the flip, their &#x2013; the keywords available for sale should be unified and the number of keywords available should not be less, it should actually be more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I ask a quick follow-up, given as you mentioned the inherent monetization potential of the right hand side of the page is less than the main left hand side of the results page, how meaningful do you see kind of this read through on your current six months experience with <mark type="inaudible" /> portion of your results page? How meaningful is that <mark type="inaudible" /> expected impact for the main results page portion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Contribution from the right hand side is still a small percentage of our total revenue. It will probably continue to be the case for a while, although we are working very hard on the right hand side panel to make sure that we serve very relevant paid search links so that it can give us good user experience and good monetization. And we're definitely making progress on that if you &#x2013; I don't know if you noticed in the past six months, if you check out our right hand side panel, it's definitely &#x2013; the appealing quality is definitely improving.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, when we talk about Phoenix Nest, when we talk about the 20% revenue contribution, we're really talking about for the &#x2013; the majority of that is coming from the laptop panel with our search result page which is managed right now by Phoenix Nest.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and good morning. Can I ask two questions, first of all will your move to greater automation using the Phoenix Nest system give you an opportunity to reduce cost or head count or will you just be absorbing your additional staff by not hiring at the same rate?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is I noticed that there was a significant increase in traffic acquisition cost for Baidu Union, does that mean partner deals are becoming more competitive to acquire or are there other factors such as a shift in mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The complete translation to the Phoenix Nest will not directly increase our sales force, because we have noticed that with more customers using our platform, they also need to have better services. As you have noticed the last quarter the ARPU had increased a lot that means the more and more customers can benefit the value of our platform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the question on whether the automation <mark type="inaudible" /> provided by Phoenix Nest  has the potential, given the chance to reduce head count, I think that's conceivable but that's definitely not the main objective of Phoenix Nest. And Phoenix Nest is more I would say a more sophisticated system. So on one hand it's providing more support, on the other hand we probably need customer service people to have &#x2013; to work more intensively with customers to optimize their campaign to reap the benefit of Phoenix Nest.</p>
          <p>And the question on TAC. I think Jeff, you are referring to the year-over-year TAC percentages Actually, if you look on sequential basis it's actually coming down a little bit. There is no question that affiliate business is a quite &#x2013; especially on search side &#x2013; is a quite competitive business and the &#x2013; but if you look at year-over-year basis the increase has been driven by and large by the faster growth of our Union revenue than our organic revenue.</p>
          <p>Our payout ratio although as I said it's a competitive business, our payout ratio has been quite steady and in recent quarter actually came down a little bit, and that explains the sequential decrease of TAC ratio from Q2 to Q3 because we implemented new Union TAC payout policy at the end of Q2, so a lot of <mark type="inaudible" /> flowing through our P&amp;L in Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>That's great. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. My question is still on the Phoenix Nest system. So when we look at the impact to your revenue, temporary right now, does that mean that a lot of the efforts will be focused on converting the usage onto the Phoenix Nest system and then what we will likely see is basically ARPU going &#x2013; still going up steadily but you will loose some of the customers when you look at your two metrics there? And if so when do we see the customer addition becoming positive again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're probably right to think that the switch will impact both ARPU and number of  customers negatively. Number of customers I think just some will not be willing to move as fast so that will have impact on our customers. But if you look on a quarterly basis probably not as much because the switch date is December 1. So I would imaging those customers will keep spending in the first two months.</p>
          <p>And on ARPU I think after December 1 for the customers who already moved, some of them might scale back their spending just because they are not familiar with the system yet, either because of skill or because of will, the ARPU might come down a little bit.</p>
          <p>So Q4 definitely hit by Phoenix Nest, we would fully expect Q1 will be as well. So I think overall we'll just probably take a couple of quarters from the date of switch for the situation to settle down and for us to come back to the normal growth trajectory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from other hand, the &#x2013; our staff will be fully occupied helping customers to migrate the &#x2013; their existing system to Phoenix Nest, that will certainly take some bandwidth from new customers acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if you think about the beauty of market place, the more people bidding for the same thing, you actually have better revenue opportunity for monetization capabilities. Therefore, during the transition as a customer is moving from the Classic edition to the Professional edition, we do expect to do some monetization power because less people bidding on certain keywords in any system.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a follow-up to that, when you talk to your advertising customers, what their feedbacks are in terms of the return or the results after using the Phoenix Nest system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, customers are happy with the return they're getting from the Phoenix Nest. Although we don't have scientific proof or no customers to draw their strict comparisons Phoenix Nest and Classic system to us. On the other hand, because these two systems are running in parallel, there's no apples-to-apples comparison anyway, but I would say, in general, they are happy &#x2013; they're happy with the ROI. They're happy with the tools and data, the extra tools and data we've provided in the new system.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Robin, Jennifer and Haoyu, morning. Let me start with first question and regarding the large customer. And obviously, more large customers have adopt your search engine for their branding initiative. And can you give us some color on the roughly revenue contribution from these larger customer and what are the top advertising categories for these customers? And more importantly and have they given you any chance, what is their rough ROI for search related initiative versus their so-called traditional brand advertising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. Good morning. Normally, we don't give the breakout of the customers. But as you have noticed the key account customers our big customers grow faster than the small and medium enterprises last quarter, especially in the following categories enjoyed much faster growth which are online gaming, e-commerce and auto industry as well. So couple of our customers allocated much more marketing budget in our platform, for example, <mark type="inaudible" /> Perfect World for e-commerce like Amazon China E-Trip, E-Long and also the C-Trip. Also couple of big customers joined us using our platform such as Audi, Mercedes-Benz as well. So those segments grew much more faster than other industries. Couple of reasons for those key account customers allocating more budget to Baidu. We noticed that under the tough economic situation, those big customers pay much more focus on the much efficient ROI marketing platform. Also last quarter, we introduced more marketing tools to them, so that the account understand and appreciate much more the benefit of our platform.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a follow-up question and once you have fully adopted Phoenix Nest system, what kind of impact should we expect for your Baidu Union members and also for your large customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For large customers, I think they tend to be &#x2013; compared with SMEs &#x2013; they tend to be more sophisticated keyword buyer. So there's definitely &#x2013; even till today, we've seen good adoption by the customers. So I would think that that the growth differential between large customers SMEs will probably continue after we switch to Phoenix Nest.</p>
          <p>As far as Union members that's the question. So in &#x2013; as Robin mentioned, I think in his remarks, we are launching this new product we call Baidu Union Marketing, which is a new contextual product, which will gradually replace the old contextual product that we have but the old contextual product is very much coupled with old Classic paid search product. So that will &#x2013; so in essence because it's coupled with the old system. So in essence on switch date the revenue from that product will also get impacted materially.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. I just want to make sure I actually heard you correctly &#x2013; I think you indicated that the move to Phoenix Nest was going to cost probably about 10 points of growth for Q4. If I do the math though that would imply a much lower sequential growth this Q4 than you have historically. So I want to make sure I understand that right and that that's mathematically correct.</p>
          <p>Also just as you think about that transition, do you think the impact will be greater in Q4 or in Q1 thanks?</p>

          <p>Yes, you heard it correctly we did say that on a quarterly &#x2013; for entire Q4, the impact of the switch is 10, roughly 10 percentage points. So if you do that math...</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Jennifer how are you and Robin. I have two questions. My first question is if you can give us a quick comment on the advertising market outlook in fourth quarter and 2009. I guess <mark type="inaudible" /> just mentioned that if we remove that 10% hit, we actually have quite good acceleration on year-on-year growth on the advertising revenues or Baidu's revenues in the fourth quarter. Of course I understand the fourth quarter '08 is a normal quarter but just if you can comment on if we remove on these two temporary factors how do you see the overall market picking up going forward in 2010. Thanks. And I have a follow-up question. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Robin. Let me give it a try. I think we are seeing increasingly a separation of search engine marketing and online branded advertising. What we have seen is that the search engine marketing has become increasingly important and more and more customers &#x2013; especially the larger customers realize that the performance or the return on investment for paid search is much better than any other means of advertising. So we are very happy and we are very confident that the growth prospect for search engine marketing is very good and will be very good for a long time.</p>
          <p>For branded advertising, is has been always a very, very small percentage of our total revenue and we have not seen much movement or growth in the past 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much for the clarification. And my follow-up question is to Jennifer is that, looks like the scalability of the cost structure continues to be very good. Even with the slowing down in revenue growth due to various factors, operating margin has held up and bandwidth and depreciation and TAC has all coming down in term of revenue. I just wonder that this has been going on for a while, just wonder what is the end point that how low can we eventually &#x2013; how scalable this model eventually is? I know this is old question, but I wonder if you have any additional color to shed on that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the good performance on the P&amp;L or margin side is a result of good expense management as well as scalability. We take a very disciplined approach to our cost and we invest prudently for the future benefit.</p>
          <p>I've mentioned many times in the past, the model is inherently, tremendously scalable and so at this point it's not really our focus to target a certain margin percentage. We are still at very early stage of the internet development. So we want to invest and spend prudently to make sure we continue to remain at the leading position on the search engine space.</p>
          <p>Having said that, you do have noticed that our infrastructure and equipment scalability has exhibited for many quarters as well as the bandwidth side. The team is doing a good job to efficiently utilize our infrastructure and the equipment and to optimize the infrastructure the way we &#x2013; the overall architecture works.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we'll continue to make investment in CapEx. We'll continue to make investment in important initiatives like Aladdin, like Phoenix Nest and those require people investment. So our focus is more long-term. It's not margin management, it's focusing on driving the growth and maintaining a disciplined approach to run an efficient company.</p>

          <p>Hi, morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you update us on the top five industry groups? And also can you give us some color on these top five groups regarding their response on the performance of Phoenix Nest.

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The top five factors continues to be the same there: healthcare, machinery, education, franchising and general travel in that order. As far as, I think what we mention before was in general the B2C sectors are growing faster than the B2B sectors and that continues to be true in Q3. And I think actually the launch or the switch of Phoenix Nest will continue to push that trend even more just because the B2C just by nature &#x2013; B2C sectors, they will stand to benefit more from the benefits offered by Phoenix Nest, because they will have more choices on keywords, they will have better tools to manage, more keywords &#x2013; because they tend to have more keywords to purchase than the B2B sectors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one quick follow-up. So overall these top five customer group are they spending more than 20% or less than 20% of total revenue on Phoenix Nest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have exact numbers, but I think these are not &#x2013; some of these are B2B, some of these are B2C. I would guess the B2C sectors, customers in that sector &#x2013; in those sectors are spending more, meaning more than 20% of the revenue on Phoenix Nest, in general. But again, I don't have exact numbers.</p>

          <p>Hi. My first question is regarding the seasonality of Q1. I remember that historically Q1 exhibit weak seasonality. And also you just mentioned that Phoenix Nest forecast date is December 1. So actually in 4Q we are not going to see the full quarter revenue impact but in Q1 we will see the full quarter. So in that case, given the two reasons I just mentioned, should we expect to expect the sequential decline for Q1 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, do you agree with the two points I just mentioned?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point being seasonality and Q1 will see full quarter impact, yes, those are true.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also could you maybe give some color on the new Baidu Union marketing Baidu? How that will affect the Union revenue and also how that will affect the TAC ratio, and how different that is from the historical P4P Union marketing tool?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so the new product we offer is the actual product. Within Baidu Union, within our affiliate business, we have two types of business. One is search related. One is search. We basically &#x2013; our partners basically bring traffic to us and we share paid search revenue with them. And the other is contextual. So historically contextual has been a smaller, a much smaller percentage of our revenue. So this new product is upgraded from the old contextual products that we have existing today, which will be unavailable on December 1 together with the old paid search product, because they are very much coupled together.</p>
          <p>As far as payout, the payout on contextual is in general higher than the payout on search because it's not search, right, traffic, the content is owned by the third party publishers. And so as we grow the <mark type="inaudible" /> going forward because of the mix in our affiliate business might change and the TAC ratio on contextual is higher you can potentially see the growth of TAC ratio, but I don't think that's going to happen in short term because the contextual part will be challenged by the switch and also at the end of the day it's a very small percentage of our revenue anyway today.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning guys. Just a couple of questions. The first one is actually on the cost side. I'm wondering if Jennifer can share with us more about the cost related to the new headquarters, for examples would there be any continuous depreciation cost and if so what that amount could be? thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Eddie. The Baidu campus on a net, net basis does not impact P&amp;L much. Today we do rent office spaces and so therefore we pay rent, and going forward we move into Baidu campus and we will recognize depreciation on the P&amp;L. So with carrying cost and the depreciation net-net, it's about the same as we are seeing today, so not much cost impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got that. My second question just a quick question on click-through rate. I am wondering if you guys can share with us on the trends of click-through rates in the past quarter and given the various changes in backend systems, should we expect any material change in the click-through rates in the upcoming, say, few quarters? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The click-through rates on the top panel, the top left panel and the right panel have been going up because more and more paid links in those spaces are actually managed by Phoenix Nest system which is a better -- relevant system. So &#x2013; but that profit &#x2013; so that growth has been gradual, so I think that will probably continue in the next few quarters. But I don't think you will see a dramatic increase.</p>

And I've heard that you will increase the investing on the marketing activities in the fourth quarter and going forward. So shall we expect that the gross margin, operating margin could possibly turn down in the next couple of quarters, at least before the revenue can go up benefiting from the new system?</p>
          <p>And the second question is rather clear, <mark type="inaudible" /> I hear that revenue side where you teamed with Telecom and Unicom but I read from local news that China Telecom chose another local third partner <mark type="inaudible" /> to be its strategic partner on the wireless side.

          <p>On the first question, our margin is very sensitive to revenue. So we guided for the Q4 reflecting the temporary impact of Phoenix Nest and we will maintain continue spending for the long-term benefit. So margin will just naturally be the way it is.</p>
          <p>Going into Q1 normally we do have seasonal quarters and Q1 is probably one of the lower quarters within the year and it has been the case. So you do see margins variations quarter-over-quarter, but as I said we don't focus on margin we focus on long-term, the revenue growth and running an efficient company. So margin will just naturally be the fall-off of that.</p>

          <p>This is Robin regarding to the mobile search partnership, I haven't heard about the deal you mentioned with a third company &#x2013; between the third company and China Telecom. What we know is that we had a search partnership with China Telecom was announced in May that we are served our search result to the China Telecom users, mobile users.</p>

          <p>Yeah, as Robin mentioned before establishing a partnership with operators is one thing but developing a very good, excellent customer service and also the products is the other focus we need to make the effort on.</p>

          <p>Jennifer just to clarify in regards to the marketing spend for the fourth quarter you mentioned should we expect this to be up on a RMB basis quarter on quarter or are we thinking that the spend you have planned for the new building anniversary etcetera replaces what you spent on the world forum during the third quarter?</p>
          <p>And CapEx seems to have ticked up a little bit during the third quarter, what is your outlook for the balance of the year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>We do expect a step-up of SG&amp;A expenses for Q4, so when you look at it we're &#x2013; basically two main things are happening; one is we are moving into the Baidu. We take a lot of pride in moving into the new building. We'll do a celebration and it also happens to be Baidu's 10th anniversary, so we'll do a lot of funding activities surrounding these main events.</p>
          <p>So marketing expenses will be higher &#x2013; will be higher than Q3 and we're also planning to hire &#x2013; continue to hire sales and R&amp;D talents going into Q4. I did mention in the script that a lot of the head count increases occurred towards the end of the quarter, so you will see the full expense impact going into Q4 plus some new hires. So SG&amp;A expenses will have a step up from Q3 level.</p>
          <p>On CapEx I have mentioned in the past that 2009 should be no less than 2008 and you do see, I have also said in the past that the CapEx is pretty chunky. So Q3 there is a step-up and I anticipate Q4 will be a sizable CapEx expenditure as well.</p>

          <p>Well, I understand many of you had concerns regarding to the switch or flip to Phoenix Nest. I want to assure you that this is a strategic decision made by the management. We did careful calculation and we think 12 months from now when we look back we would be happy we did the switch sooner rather than later. So we truly believe that Phoenix Nest is a superior monetization system and time will tell that we are making right decisions and right moves.</p>
          <p>Once again, thank you for joining us today and please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.</p>
