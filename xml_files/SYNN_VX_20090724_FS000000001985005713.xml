        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to this presentation of Syngenta's First Half 2009 Results. The presentation will be given by Michael Mack, CEO and John Ramsay, CFO and afterwards you can ask questions either by e-mail or by pressing star 1 on your phone.</p>
          <p>Before we start let me redo the usual cautionary statement. The following presentation contains forward looking statements which can be identified by terminology such as 'expect', 'would', 'will', 'potential', 'plans', 'on track' and similar expressions. Such statements may be subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. We refer you to Syngenta's publicly available filings with the U.S. SEC for information about these risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>And with that let me hand you over to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. When we last spoke in April, our season was just getting underway. I talked a bit about what for this industry are annual uncertainties about planting intentions, commodity prices, and also the weather which of course always make the outcome of these seasons so difficult to predict. And sure enough, in the second quarter, our business was influenced by unhelpful weather which combined with volatile crop prices generated almost weekly revisions to global crop forecasts. This made life more difficult for growers too, particularly compared with 2008 which was basically ideal in every way.</p>
          <p>So it's against this backdrop that I'm pleased with the first half results we've just announced. Although currencies have affected reported earnings, we were both able to grow our sales at constant exchange rates as well as to improve the underlying profitability. This reflected our success on pricing in both Crop Protection and Seeds, which has again reaffirmed the value of our technology even at lower crop prices. The conditions may be different but we believe that Syngenta in 2009 just as in 2008 continues to outperform.</p>
          <p>At the start of the year, there was some concern over credit availability for growers. This has proven to be pretty much a non-issue in developed markets, but in some of the emerging markets currency instability did contribute to liquidity shortages and heightened risk. So in light of this, we've been maintaining rigorous risk management which has had the effect of reducing sales, although in terms of grower demand for our products things haven't fundamentally changed.</p>
          <p>Rapid technology adoption continues in the Asia Pacific region where growers were mainly unaffected by credit constraints and we were able to grow our sales strongly. You only have to look at what is happening in emerging Asian countries to see that the underlying drivers for our industry remain solidly intact. In the short-term, we're cautiously optimistic on the prospects for the Latin American season starting later this quarter and that is one of the factors behind our positive second half outlook.</p>
          <p>But for more detail on our first half performance as well as on the outlook let me now hand you over to John Ramsay. John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike. Starting then with a summary of the results, sales in the first half rose by 2% at constant exchange rates. As well as managing the uncertain market conditions which Mike just mentioned, we're particularly pleased with our achievement on price, up 8% across the group and ahead of the target we set this time last year.</p>
          <p>We're also satisfied with the risk management focus, which we maintained throughout the first half. While it had the effect of reducing sales in a number of emerging markets, it has enabled us to preserve the quality of our balance sheet. At constant exchange rates, EBITDA was up 4% at $2 billion despite the impact of higher raw material costs. The underlying improvement was masked by currency, but profitability in constant exchange rates improved in both businesses and notably in Seeds. Reflecting currency movements, earnings per share was 8% lower at $15.18.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the sales progression chart, you can see that the appreciation of the dollar reduced sales by $765 million, more than 10%. Volumes were lower in Crop Protection and Seeds, but this was more than offset by price increases. Pricing increased sales by $596 million or 8%. The rate of increase in emerging markets was greater as this next slide shows.</p>
          <p>When we talk about dollar appreciation, the impact has been particularly dramatic against emerging market currencies in Eastern Europe and Asia. We responded rapidly to this situation which emerged in the fourth quarter of 2008 and have raised prices on average by some 16% in Eastern Europe and 11% in emerging Asia, offsetting more than 70% of the total currency impact on sales in those territories. Latin America is not shown in the chart because in these countries, our sales are largely dollarized. We absorbed the entire impact of currency devaluations through price and in Latin America came through with a price decline for the first half excluding glyphosate of just 2%.</p>
          <p>But of course, currency instability has been only part of the story in these countries contributing along with the economic and financial uncertainty to heightening credit risk. We know these markets well and have continued to implement rigorous credit management in order to safeguard our balance sheet. And that is the main reason why you see sales declines in these markets in the first half although weather also had a significant impact. This slide shows the combined Crop Protection and Seeds first half sales variance compared to 2008. The largest variance from last year was in Latin America where the severe drought in the south of the region and risk management measures resulted in volumes being down by 15%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the other regions, higher pricing allowed us to achieve growth in Western Europe despite unhelpful weather. It was a similar picture in NAFTA with weather conditions delaying the start of the season, but we achieved modest volume growth as well as significant price increases. In Asia Pacific, the currencies may have faltered, but liquidity was not a constraint and we saw abundant opportunities for technology expansion.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the overall performance in Crop Protection, overall for the business prices were up 7% or 8% excluding glyphosate; volumes were 6% lower in the first half due to the late spring as well as the risk management measures. As mentioned, these affected primarily Eastern Europe and Latin America while in NAFTA and Asia Pacific we saw strong growth. EBITDA at constant exchange rates were slightly higher and the margin improved in constant currency by 30 basis points to 36.6%. A $290 million increase in raw material costs was more than offset by price. I expect savings in raw material costs in the second half and we'll return to this later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Seeds, Seeds sales were up by 7% with volume 4% lower and price up by 11% more than offsetting the impact of higher grower costs and reflecting the increasing value of our offer.</p>
          <p>As in Crop Protection, growth was strong in both NAFTA and Asia Pacific. EBITDA was up by 31% at constant exchange rates and the margin improved to over 19%. Given the weighting of this business towards the first half, you can see that we are on track to achieve a margin target of eight to 9% for the full year in 2009 leading to 15% in 2011.</p>
          <p>So on to the next slide, which explains the major movements in operating income. The reduction in operating income to $1.8 billion was attributable to a negative currency impact of $333 million and an adverse impact of $290 million from higher raw material costs in Crop Protection.</p>
          <p>I will say more about currency and raw materials in a moment mitigating these adverse impacts was an improvement in business performance of $431 million coming mainly from price offsetting volume reductions. But also contributing to improved business performance was a saving and function expenses of 6% in constant currency after making additional spend in identifiable growth projects of $65 million in the first half.</p>
          <p>So let me now comment on currencies and raw materials and their estimated impact on the outlook for the second half. Starting with currencies, on this chart you can see the movements of our most important currencies against the dollar. In the second half of 2008 and again in the first quarter this year these currencies depreciated significantly against the dollar and for the most of Eastern European and emerging Asian currencies, hedging is prohibitively expensive. This underlies the negative impact of $333 million on operating income that I showed you on the previous chart.</p>
          <p>The net currency effect after offsetting associated price increases in emerging markets was around $140 million. In the second quarter of this year, all the currencies shown have recovered some of the declines. As a result, the exchange rate comparison for the second half should be more favorable. I estimate the second half currency impact on operating income still to be negative, but limited to around $60 million and I anticipate that there will be some offset by further associated market price increases. With regard to the impact on our developed market cost base, which as you know is significant in Swiss francs, sterling, and euro this is largely covered through hedging.</p>
          <p>There is an additional element you should consider when looking at the second half, in the fourth quarter of last year, we took a significant hit at the net financial expense level in the income statement owing to the revaluation of emerging market receivables and I do not expect this to recur in 2009.</p>
          <p>With the next slide a few comments about raw material costs. In our Crop Protection business around 75% of our cost of goods sold is variable made up mainly of raw material purchases, many of which are in someway oil related. Most raw materials are purchased through longer term supply contracts with pricing normally agreed on 12-month basis. It therefore takes some time for us to feel the benefit of a lower oil price.</p>
          <p>Another thing you need to remember is that this is a seasonal business with over 60% of our sales in the first half. We manufacture in advance of the main season and so in the first half of 2009 we were selling products manufactured in 2008 at the time of peak oil prices; that explains the negative impact of $290 million from raw materials. In the second half of the year, the benefit of lower oil prices will start to feed through and I anticipate that this will be in the region of $140 million.</p>
          <p>Turning now to net income for the first half. Operating income as reported was 12% lower at $1.8 billion. Net financial expense was slightly higher at $46 million. And for the full year, I estimate that financial expenses will be below the 2008 level at around $130 million assuming no repeat of the currency volatility that I referred to earlier. The tax rate at 19% was lower than in the first half of 2008 following successful tax optimization measures, and expect a similar rate for the full year. Looking forward, the tax rate is likely to return to the low to mid 20s for 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Net income of $1.4 billion translates to earnings per share of $15.18.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was $79 million. As usual in the first half, we had a net outflow on working capital reflecting the seasonality of the business with May and June typically being the months of peak working capital. I expect the business would generate significant free cash flow in the second half. Capital expenditure is higher than in previous years because of our capacity expansion program and I will come back to that in a moment.</p>
          <p>But first take a look at working capital, average trade working capital as a percentage of sales does show a noticeable increase compared with last year, when inventories were at exceptionally low levels. Compared with previous years, however, the ratio is not unduly high and on a period end basis it is stable. While we do plan to bring inventory levels down, we're very satisfied with what we've achieved on receivables, which clearly bears witness to the success of our risk management measures. This is particularly due to the modules we have in place in Latin America and which we are in the early stages of extending to Eastern Europe. Our receivables' performance is reflected in end June DSOs of around 100 days; little change from a year ago.</p>
          <p>The next slide shows you that our capital investment will peak in 2009. We are currently investing in two blockbuster compounds ACTARA/CRUISER and AMISTAR with the new capacity now expected to come on stream earlier than expected in the second quarter of 2010. We maintain our forecast peak sales potential for these two products of $3.5 billion representing a doubling of the year 2008 full year sales. The scale of our manufacturing for both will give us a clear competitive advantage in two high margin segments.</p>
          <p>Moving to balance sheet financing. We continue to have ready access to the capital markets and have in the first half of this year issued commercial paper in both Europe and in the US. Over in June, we saw an opportunity to increase our longer term funding and made a highly successful 500 million Eurobond issue with the 2014 maturity. This nicely filled the gap in our maturity profile, which is evenly spread to 2015 with further long-term finance beyond that. Taking into account our expectation of second half cash flow, we will finish the year with net gearing within the target range of 25 to 35%.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude with a few words on the second half outlook. For us what counts in the second half is Latin America, and the season there does not get underway until September. But given current soybean prices and current exchange rates, the majority of Brazilian soybean farmers are making attractive profits. And as you have seen, we've been managing risk tightly in these markets, and as a result go into the new season with an excellent receivables record.</p>
          <p>And with regard to second half profitability, I have shown you how both currencies and raw materials will be more favorable in the second half. These factors lead us to target growth and earnings in the second half resulting in full year earnings per share close to the record level achieved in 2008.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me hand you back to Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks John. I'm now going to give you an update of the key developments in each of our businesses, starting first with Corp Protection. This slide shows you the detail of our performance by product line and I'm just going to pick out a couple of highlights. Firstly the excellent performance of our Selective Herbicides where we achieved price increases pretty much along across the board with strong volume growth on cereals and soybean. Non-Selectives were also up with TOUCHDOWN showing volume growth and slightly higher pricing.</p>
          <p>Fungicide and Insecticide sales were both lower despite price increases. A number of factors that work here including the weather but remember that both are important in Latin America and so they were particularly affected by our credit management there.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our new products which had sales of $241 million in the first half up 28%. Sales of these products are principally weighted toward the first half and the slide shows you the difference between where we are today and the target peak sales of over $1 billion, illustrating the considerable potential still ahead. Both DURIVO and REVUS are seeing rapid rollout in new markets. With DURIVO now also available in Vegetables following its successful launch on rice last year. AVICTA is currently sold only on U.S. cotton, but its launch on corn in the U.S. and soybean in Brazil will bring additional sales potential of over $300 million.</p>
          <p>The next slide then shows you a bit more about the AVICTA opportunity. You can see why we are particularly excited about our launch of AVICTA next year. Nematodes are an unsolved problem in corn and the map on the left clearly shows their prevalence in most corn growing states. In fact, we estimate that approximately 80% of corn acres are currently affected. Moreover, the effect of infestations can worsen if the plant is under stress such as drought and incest or disease pressure, which is often the case in the Southern U.S.</p>
          <p>Our solution will be of particular value to the very large number of corn growers who currently experience nematode pressure whether they realize it or not, and it will offer them an average yield benefit of almost nine bushels an acre and an even greater yield benefit where the pressure is even more intense.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we've been working with growers to increase their awareness of the damage that this unseen below-the-ground pest can actually have. We plan to launch AVICTA as a broad acre solution and have conducted more than a 1000 large plaintive trials over the entire Corn Belt.</p>
          <p>Glyphosate has become an essential component of the portfolio reflecting increasing GM acres in some countries combined with demand for minimum tillage practices. In the U.S., we have leading programs with glyphosate and have been active in addressing weed resistances notably through the introduction of the three-way combination product HELIX. In this rather volatile product segment, we have been closely managing both price and costs with the aim of protecting our gross margin and let me be clear TOUCHDOWN has never been a major contributor to our earnings. In the first half, when sales were higher than last year, it accounted for 7% of total Crop Protection sales, but only 3% of gross profit. So the bottom line is that our overall exposure is limited in absolute terms to the changing price environment we're now experiencing.</p>
          <p>Use of glyphosate in the U.S. has expanded enormously, but nature has a way of fighting back and weed resistance is increasing throughout the U.S. There are now at least nine major resistant weeds. The main problem being broad leaves, such that at least in the South, growers are beginning to think of glyphosate as a solution for grass weeds only. Syngenta is in the unique position to tackle this emerging problem with six soybean herbicides in our offer in addition to TOUCHDOWN. Among these, Flexstar is particularly effective on hard to control broad-leaved weeds, and we're now marketing it as a combination product with glyphosate.</p>
          <p>Overall, we're seeing a resurgence in our soybean herbicide sales and we believe the number of acres treated could triple to cover around a third of total soybean acreage, representing a market opportunity of around $300 million.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Seed Care where our success has been driven by CRUISER, which continues to show double-digit growth across all regions. It has become the established leading brand in soybean and we see numerous opportunities for further growth across many crops and geographies. For example, our breakthrough Plene technology for sugarcane in Brazil will involve the use of CRUISER to treat sugarcane segments before planting. Our capacity expansion for thiamethoxam currently underway will enable us to fully exploit these opportunities.</p>
          <p>CRUISER is also starting to be used on rice in Asia-Pacific, where it is delivering a yield benefit of around 10% and is just one part of our growing rice business propelled this year by the introduction of DURIVO in a number of markets including China. In rice fungicides, SCORE continues to expand and like CRUISER is giving a proven boost to yields. In total, we are targeting rice sales of around $750 million by 2014.</p>
          <p>Our Crop Protection pipeline has peak sales potential of over $2 billion with first launches of INVINSA and isopyrazam formerly 520 targeted for next year. The late development compounds 524 and 449 now also have chemical names, sedaxane and bicyclopyrone, and both are progressing well.</p>
          <p>What distinguishes our pipeline from the competition is the average sales potential of each product as well as the broad range of crops in applications. It will enable us to make significant progress in enhancing plant performance as you see on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Our broad product portfolio continues to be at the heart of our strategy, allowing us to provide new and innovative technology specifically tailored to the needs of customers in local markets. We are redefining the benefits of crop protection beyond pest control and crop care, and our focus on crop enhancement will open up new opportunities for growers to obtain even higher yields, which is surely the best argument for the continued growth of our Crop Protection business.</p>
          <p>So now let's move over to Seeds. Growth in the first half was led by corn and soybean in NAFTA and Asia Pacific offsetting the impact of lower acreage in Europe and Latin America. Diverse field crops staged a strong recovery in the second quarter led by sunflower in Eastern Europe and by further growth in glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet in the U.S. We also had continuing growth in vegetables, notably in the higher value segments. Our flowers performance was helped by the consolidation of Goldsmith and Yoder although the underlying sales were lower because of the economic environment. All these businesses are important to us and all will contribute to the continued improvement of Seeds' profitability. But with the next few slides, let me give you an update of what has been happening in corn and soybean.</p>
          <p>John already showed you the improvement in our Seeds margin in the first half. This reflected the rollout of our proprietary triple stack, which has commanded a price premium over the rest of our portfolio. We still have a way to go though in bringing the traits together with our lead germplasm, but we already have a unique competitive advantage in our ability to enrich our offer with proprietary seed treatment. The quality of our chemical portfolio gives us additional traction at the distributor level and we can now build on that with enhanced multi-stack options. But for us, what matters is not simply the average number of traits per product, but how these traits meet the different agronomic needs of the market.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you a little bit more now about that. The map you see shows three of the key problems confronting you as corn growers today, water stress, lepidopteran pressure, and high rootworm pressure. The existing GM solutions on the market go some way toward dealing with the last two, but more needs to be done if yields are to be fully maximized. And there are no solutions currently on the market to address the water issue.</p>
          <p>I'd mentioned weed resistance a couple of times already and it is particularly apparent in the area shown here. I already showed you that Syngenta is uniquely placed to combat this through our Crop Protection portfolio and will also have solutions in Seeds as you will see in a moment. Nematodes, as I said, are prevalent in most corn growing states, but AVICTA will be of particular value for growers in the regions you see here.</p>
          <p>We are building a comprehensive traits pipeline for corn with a full array of technical solutions to address grower needs. Our offer has long since included Liberty Link, a second motive action for herbicide tolerance, which is already incorporated in our triple stack.</p>
          <p>We plan to launch both Agrisure Viptera, an innovative new trait for broad lepidopteran control, and AVICTA on corn in time for the 2010 season. We're solidly on track to introduce a native trait for drought tolerance in 2011 and following our recent cross-licensing agreement with Dow AgroSciences, we will be in a position in 2011 to offer a dual mode of action above the ground. We will also add dual mode of action below the ground in 2012 with FORCE insecticide as an existing complementary solution.</p>
          <p>I hope I have conveyed to you that the U.S. corn market is not one, but many markets, and that we now have the capacity to provide tailored solutions across all of them. Our output trait Corn Amylase which is now branded Enogen is yet another unique opportunity which Syngenta will bring to corn growers. There are currently some 150 ethanol plants in the U.S., most of which source their corn from within a 40-mile radius of the plant. Enogen corn is a breakthrough technology currently in its third successful plant trial and will offer ethanol producers a significant cost advantage of between 0.08 and $0.15 per gallon. Enogen is in the final stages of the regulatory process and we believe that it will play a vital role in improving productivity at a critical time for the ethanol industry.</p>
          <p>As I said for us, grower choice means offering a complete range of solutions tailored to agronomic and market needs. The summary pipeline you see here including refuge reduction options as well as Avicta, has total peak sales potential of over 1.4 billion and shows the significant future value that can be captured in our corn business.</p>
          <p>Although there are fewer traits in soybean at present, some of the issues are the same, as is the case of glyphosate resistance. We will be launching second-generation herbicide tolerance from next year, and are following that up with a number of native trait insects and disease solutions. The peak sales potential of our soybean business then is over $0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Among the exciting opportunities we have in soybean is our new aphid management system incorporating native traits and CRUISER Seed Care, and this will be launched in the U.S. next year. We offer a similar program for cyst nematodes and already have natural resistance genes in over half our portfolio. Longer term, we plan to follow this with a second generation GM solution.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to go through every tick point on this slide. The point though is to note the breadth and diversity of Syngenta's Seed portfolio. I've talked mainly today about corn and soybean in the U.S., but we are also rapidly expanding our GM offer in Latin America. And our potential in the other field crops is also substantial, covering oilseeds, notably sunflower in Eastern Europe, sugar beet, wheat, barley, and rice.</p>
          <p>In vegetables, we are using our marker-assisted breeding expertise to constantly enhance our range, further expanded through acquisitions which have also been a feature of what is now a world leading Flowers business. Our presence in each of these different crops is amplified by our unique ability to leverage common technology platforms.</p>
          <p>The diversity of our portfolio is mirrored by our global presence, which is becoming increasingly broad-based owing to our ongoing commitment to emerging markets. Alongside the expansion of our corn and soybean portfolio, further growth in our high margin Vegetable and Diverse Field Crop businesses will contribute to further improvement in profitability.</p>
          <p>As our businesses grow, we are increasingly realizing economies of scale and efficiency gains. Taken together, this means that we are firmly on track to achieve our 15% EBITDA margin target for the Seeds business in 2011 and we are confident going well beyond that in subsequent years.</p>
          <p>So to sum it all up, in the first half of 2009, we've responded rapidly to an uncertain environment while continuing to build our business for the future. This means maintaining our target level of R&amp;D spend while continuing investment in new capacity. Our ability to sustain and even accelerate the pace of innovation of past years is illustrated by the pipelines we've shown you today which have a combined value of $4 billion. While we have managed our credit carefully this year, we have in no way reduced our commitment to emerging markets where our leading positions will enable us to play a pivotal role in realizing their future growth potential.</p>
          <p>As I said at the start of the presentation, the fundamentals for our industry are unchanged. The strength of our portfolio and global presence, underpinned by the quality of our balance sheet mean that we continue to look ahead with confidence.</p>
          <p>That concludes the presentation and we're now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thanks very much. Can you try and define for us the adverse impact on sales of your tighter credit management policies? Can you give us an indication assuming you make no portfolio changes or acquisitions or what you think the net debt is going to be at the year-end?</p>
          <p>And within the Seeds business, you talked about peak sales but can you talk a little bit about profitability of those and how much of these products will have royalties attached that you would have to pay third parties? Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on risk management is &#x2013; and it's quite difficult to give an absolute number, but if you &#x2013; just looking at some of the parameters, we have a total volume variance between Crop Protection and Seeds of about 450 million which you can see from the presentation. About 70% of that is in emerging markets, about just over 300 million of that volume there is in emerging markets. And that's a combination of weather and risk management. The two get rather intermingled, of course. The weather affects the profitability and they're difficult to differentiate. But, I mean, you might say that something like 60% of that is risk management, 40% is weather as an estimate.</p>
          <p>So far as the net debt's concerned, it will depend very much on acquisitions, of course, which it's difficult to be absolutely sure which of those that we may be working on come through, but I anticipate the net debt being a little bit higher than it was at the end of 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, perhaps if you don't make any acquisitions, what you think the net debt would be, so, just to give us an idea of that? But, in terms of the second-generation soy, my understanding that's just an in-licensed trait, so I wonder what is the benefit to you of that given, I would guess, the majority of the trait income would be given to Monsanto. But just of those, you've got a total here, peak sales of nearly $2 billion. How much of that is your technology, how much of that is in-licensed, just so I can get an idea of the magnitude of, if you like, EBIT benefit from this potential?</p>

          <p>Well, first of all, I can't comment specifically on the agreement, but you would &#x2013; you should expect that we share in the value that we create from all of the licenses that we undertake and we do have &#x2013; the second generation technology in soybean in the U.S. is one option. Of course, we continue to have first generation technology as well and our business is growing down in LatAm [Latin America] but we've been able over the years to grow our soybean business and continue to &#x2013; it's a profitable business. But John, I don't know if the other &#x2013; the debt one -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike. Good morning, John. Good morning, Jennifer. I've got three questions and one comment. The first question, the gross margin, it's about the EBITDA margin. The Seeds business is up 300 basis points, H1'09 versus H1'08. I was a bit surprised to see the mix, the gross margin is up 100 basis points and cost below gross margin down 200. I was expecting more of a progression as to the gross margin. Is it fair to say that you have expanded the margin by just clawing back a little bit on SG&amp;A, R&amp;D? Would you say the margin progression that you're targeting towards, 15%, is largely driven by the gross margin? Can you give us some confidence there? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the performance of the European Crop Protection business. The second quarter obviously difficult, volumes down 12. As you go into the second half, would you say your comparables with regards to winter wheat will be difficult, will it be a difficult season for the early wheat or cereal season in Europe just in looking at the comparables versus the last year where you had, I think, 4% volume growth in the second half?</p>
          <p>And the third question is regarding, I know it's early days on whether you've already put up list prices for Crop Protection for 2010, and what your sort of &#x2013; what your early shots are with regard to that going into 2010? And then maybe last thing just a comment, and I hope you don't mind, it would be great to have the glyphosate chart when glyphosate prices are rising, not only when it's falling. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, your comment is withstanding. I'll address the price one first on Crop Protection. A year ago this time, we said that we were going to target four to six price &#x2013; a 4 to 6% price increase across our business, and you can see this &#x2013; our results this year were 8% for the first half, 7% in Crop Protection, and 11% in Seeds. We're terrifically pleased on having over-delivered on that. When we first made that target last year, it was an inflationary environment for oil. That's changed quite a bit. We continue to target selective price increases in &#x2013; for products and markets where they make sense. It is a different environment looking into 2010 and beyond, again more deflationary, but we continue to look for any and all opportunities to get price hikes where the value of the technology can enable it.</p>
          <p>Your second question about performance of EAME, our Europe, Africa, Middle East business in the first half, it's here that we've had particularly unhelpful weather, different weather in Russia than it has been in places like France and Germany, but I'm not going to go through a weather report there. It just wasn't particularly helpful. Second half of the year is the smaller half of course for us in Crop Protection, and the growers still seem to be making decent money, good access to credit, and I would see the second half of the year as being normal. We don't foresee, particularly, any strong headwinds for growers as they get ready for what's for them would be the 2010 wheat crop.</p>
          <p>John, the question about the EBITDA margin in Seeds year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the question is what &#x2013; you're a bit surprised that the gross margin is not increasing as much. I mean, that's largely just a timing issue associated with a little bit of timing of 2008 royalty income and also some &#x2013; the transition expenses in the Flowers acquisition. So that will flow through and by the end of the year, we should see somewhere around 100 basis points improvement in the gross margin in Seeds.</p>
          <p>And yes, the drive in Seeds is about the gross margin improvement, so as the portfolio transitions through that, into 2011, we will see that improving further. We've contributed some expense savings in 2009, just purely because of the uncertain conditions, but underlying that, the R&amp;D investment in Seeds is progressing and is up substantially within the 2009 numbers.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Thomas. Our next question, Rhian Tucker at Credit Suisse. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm going to take three questions as well. The first one is just looking at volume decline in Crop Protection, down 6%. It seems to me that your volumes are &#x2013; the volume declines are accelerating sequentially. Can you explain to us what was so much worse in Q2 than Q1? I know you had a late start to the season, but did that really hit the Q2 more than it hit Q1 or was credit risk that much worse?</p>
          <p>Following on from that, just looking at the exchange rate effect on the Crop Protection margin, you actually recorded kind of steady margins on a constant exchange rate basis, but down strongly on a reported basis. Was that due to a transactional currency effect and if so, which currencies?</p>
          <p>Final question on volumes as well, obviously Latin America was one of the weakest areas in both Crop Protection and Seeds. What lies behind your confidence that Q3 and Q4 will be any better if you're still cutting back on credit risk and taking a kind of long view on the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first let's talk about the LATAM one. Some of LATAM was driven of course by the drought down in Argentina and on the margin cutting back on some credit as part of that financial crisis started to take hold. But as we look at the second half of the year, the key elements that we need in place to have what I'll describe as a normal year in &#x2013; for the Brazilian soybean business, are largely in place, which is an exchange rate of the real to the dollar that enables the farmers to plant with confidence and a soybean commodity price that enables them to again plant their crop with confidence. Brazil's been pretty good at providing credit to growers. Most of our portfolio, and it is the leading portfolio by the way, is aimed at the large growers. So, we're just counting on what I guess would be termed a normal season and it doesn't start for four to six weeks, but what we can see is that the elements that we would need largely are in place.</p>
          <p>Just your first question, Rhian, about the &#x2013; about Crop Protection being down in the second quarter; yes, agreed. Where we had a weather impact, it was in the second quarter, it was a &#x2013; different weather played out in different parts of the Northern Hemisphere. It was late in the U.S. and that meant that some of the pre-emergent herbicides just didn't get laid down. Very dry in Russia, which means the wheat pressure isn't as strong as it otherwise would be. The fungicide applications in the Western part weren't as strong, because farmers just didn't need to get them down as much as they did last year. But every once in a while, you do have a situation where things come together with a bit more synchronicity than, because usually we've got different seasons and different markets playing off one another. This year in the North, things just were less than ideal compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>The credit question that you ask did play the most pronounced influence in the Eastern part of Europe, Russia, and the Ukraine, and that is where we had to constrain some of our sales. John, the transactional exchange rate question, can you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think your point, Rhian, is about the gross margin, particularly in Crop Protection. Let me just &#x2013; at the first half, we got the benefit of price increases and you can say at 7% price increase, you're adding about 300 basis points to the gross margin. Detracting from that, you've got a something like 290 million raw material increase and that is &#x2013; sorry, 300 basis points on price adding to the gross margin. The raw material cost is detracting at the rate of 600 basis points, so $290 million is taking 600 basis points. So we're seeing the gross margin in Crop Protection down about 180 basis points on the basis of those two items.</p>
          <p>Now, what's going to happen is we're going to go into the second half and we're going to get the benefit of lower raw material costs, and by the end of the year I think we'll have somewhere around about a net 150 million impact offsetting that 290 &#x2013; 140 offsetting the 290. So at the end of the year, I expect again the underlying effect on gross margin in Crop Protection to be positive, maybe over 100 basis points as an estimate. But currency &#x2013; currency is detracting from that, but underlying we'll see an improvement.</p>
          <p>If I might just go back and just add a little bit more onto the Q3, Q4 question because within what I've just said, is we're anticipating lower raw material costs in the second half. We are also anticipating lower net financial expense because we took a hit in the fourth quarter of last year with the currency volatility. And those two factors, I think in addition to the fact the Latin American prospects, I think, have moved beyond the drought, have moved beyond the crops that were of poor profitability in the first half of the year, we're looking at a soybean season.</p>
          <p>And at this present time, early indications are for a good season. We're not being overly bullish there. We are anticipating just a flat second half in Latin America compared with last year but that will take us comfortably to our target for the full year.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I was afraid you misunderstood my question. I was looking at the difference between the constant exchange rate EBITDA margin and the reported EBITDA margin, which was nearly 2% different. So I'm wondering what caused that difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The currency. It's entirely currency effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, was it a transactional currency effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, it's a translational currency effect of taking foreign earned income back into dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But that foreign earned income should have the same currency effect on the sales is it does on the EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily because the constitution of the cost of goods is different from your sales income. So we could be selling in Brazilian real or Russian ruble, but the majority of the costs in the raw materials are Chinese yuan or dollars or Swiss francs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there was no one major currency or two major currencies that were responsible for that? It was across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Across the board. I mean, you got to remember what we had in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this is unprecedented. I don't think, at any time I can remember, every single currency, perhaps the Japanese yen is only exception, but every single currency in the world going in one direction against the dollar. Usually you find ups and downs, but everything went against the dollar as we know because of the financial situation. And we have quite a tremendous mix of currencies making up our profile and that's the effect.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, morning, Mike. Couple of questions, can I start with Seeds? Going back to your comments and your enthusiasm on the margin progression medium-term, I just wonder if you could spell out what the decision this week from the EPA on Monsanto's refuge reduction means for your competitive position? So what would your response be to that 5% refuge reduction versus your own position at the moment? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And second question is probably a question for John. Looking at the balance sheet, your inventories are up from what I calculate 29% year-on-year, your ratio has gone up probably about 400 basis points. How do I think about that? I mean, is there some influence there other than the obvious, which is unsold product? I'm just trying to assess how much inventory could be in the Crop Protection system, not just for Syngenta?</p>
          <p>And sorry, just a final question on your guidance, could you be any more specific on what approaching last year means? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll take the Seeds question then -- first, Andrew, first of all there was nothing about the announcement this week that was a surprise to us. We anticipated that. And this was that farmers are interested in the idea of refuge reduction was part of what was behind our decision to take a license for Herculex last year, which we announced early, I guess we announced that in February of this year or March perhaps. So, we have our own refuge reduction solution, part of it coming in 2011 and the rest of it coming in 2012.</p>
          <p>If you look at, my reading of the announcement said, it's going to be introduced on a few small million of acres next year. And the point though of our pipeline and the point of my slide I shared today is it's not one solution that growers are after. There is a lot of different markets. So again, I wouldn't want to comment on the competitive offer and how the Smartstack is going to be positioned.</p>
          <p>But if you just look at what the pressures that growers face, it's a lot of different things. And our decision is to go at the market in a really tailored way because that's how it's to be sliced up. We're going to have a refuge reduction offer above and below the ground in all of the different parts of the corn market that value that.</p>
          <p>John, over to you on the how close is close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the last question on what we actually mean by the close term is trying to anticipate exactly where one's going to pitch, given the degrees of variability in any business. And indeed in this one and the degree of variability in currencies, and so on, and so forth is quite difficult. I think close means as near as, darn it, the same level as last year. We were previously anticipating we might be a bit above and now we anticipate we might be a bit down. We are trying to give the best guidance we possibly can, subject to considerable variation in the numbers. So, in terms of the differences, it's not going to be meaningful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you know, Andrew, put this in context of where we were in 2007, just 24 months ago. I mean we've taken this business to a whole new level. In 2008, our full year earnings were 1.5 billion, and just a couple of years ago 872 billion, 872 million rather. And so the business has substantially moved ahead. The price increases have taken it to a new level, the technology has, and getting close to where we were in 2008, which was a record year, is what really has driven us, characterizing us being pleased with the performance. The second question, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is on inventories, yes.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question on inventories, I mean, the point there is that we're coming through the second quarter, which has been a bit of a pig in relation to weather. And we've been left with the inventory because of the stock holding period. Just to give you an order of magnitude, we were round about 31% of sales. We'd like that to be about 27, 28% of sales. And we'll be targeting to bring it down as we go towards the end of the year. But that's a consequence of the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one or two points of clarification. In terms of the significant hit you took last year in Q4 in the revaluation, can you remind me what that was at a sort of EBIT level, please?</p>
          <p>Can you also talk about sort of market share developments between the Crop Protection and the Seeds business and give us your sense as to what you think you've seen in the first half of the year given a somewhat more prudent approach to the emerging markets?</p>
          <p>And just finally, I mean if we make some of the adjustments you talked about for the second half, is it possible your earnings could be actually positive in the second half of the year? And that's what I have, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just take the market share one, and, John, you can pick up the &#x2013; there were actually three financial questions. On market share, it's still too early to tell. I noted in some of the press clippings just yesterday that for example in the U.S. people are talking about revisions to acreage. So I can't know with certainty and then I wouldn't want to guess.</p>
          <p>I doubt that we will have gained any market share in our U.S. corn or soybean business because that is still a portfolio in transition. I believe we've got some good momentum in Latin America. Looking toward Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific, I feel like the momentum of the company both in CP and Seeds is positioned for outperformance. So in that one area where we are still building, U.S. corn and soybean, the portfolio and the transformation underway there, virtually the rest of the world, I think, we're in a good spot. John, the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the question, both questions relate to the second half or quarter four. The effect of the currency volatility on the net financial expense line was such that the difference between this year and last year will be 50 million. So, we will be 50 million less net financial expense than we were last year, which will contribute to the second half performance.</p>
          <p>In terms of the positive outlook in second half, then it does result in growth in net income which is different from where it was in the second half of 2008, where it was slightly negative anticipating growth. Part of that is the currency volatility point I've just mentioned, but also the raw material savings which will come through, added to the market features associated with Latin America which Mike has already explained.</p>
          <p>Asia is going to continue. About 45% of Asia sales and 60% of our seed care business is in the second half. So you start to be able to narrow the range of estimates of outcomes down when you take those factors into account.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to Andrew's point earlier on, on the sort of earnings guidance, I mean is it still possible that you could deliver earnings up year-on-year if things go kind of well for you in the second half of the year or are you kind of 100% ruling that out now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not 100% ruling it out by any stretch of the imagination. We're just trying to give you our best view given the ranges that we're talking with, talking about. If things go particularly well, then we could do better. I mean, currencies, goodness knows, I mean if the dollar continues to drift down, then that will contribute as well. But, no, we're not ruling it out. We are trying to give you the best view.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning. Jean De Watteville, Nomura. Three questions, first one is on strobilurin. Actually there is two side of that question. Short-term, I remember last year in Q4, you had spectacular sales in Latin America, and I understood that was largely thanks to the strong performance of AMISTAR. And my question really is that how confident are you in the level of inventories of AMISTAR in Latin America right now and how confident are you to beat that very challenging base effect at the end of this year?</p>
          <p>Longer term, it's still in Latin America for strobilurin, I understand the product is getting a patent in Brazil next year. I wonder if you could confirm that and highlight a bit what would be the protection of your franchise strategy in that market? So, that's for strobilurin.</p>
          <p>Two other questions, one on Seeds clarification. We know this year you should have benefited from discontinued royalty payments to Monsanto on Bt11. I think to Thomas' questions you answered that there were some delays in royalty payments. I just wanted to understand whether that benefit, you have already enjoyed the benefit in H1 or it's something we should expect later on?</p>
          <p>And lastly pricing, I understand from some sources that the price decline of glyphosate is now spreading to other commodity herbicides, and I particularly understand that's the case for atrazine, which is quite important in your portfolio. I was just wondering if you could bring some light on that topic? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I will try to get to all these really briefly. There is quite a few questioners that are in the queue and keen to address those. So briefly, first of all on azoxystrobin, I think our confidence in azoxystrobin is best exemplified by our capacity expansion. This is a product that not only is highly efficacious on soybean but it's got great applications on rice. And this is truly a blockbuster compound. But it's a blockbuster compound for which we also have the low cost manufacturing position.</p>
          <p>And I hasten to point out that Syngenta has long since had what I regard as really high quality post-patent strategies for these things. And by the way, azoxystrobin does come off patent in a staggered fashion over the next five, six, seven years in different countries around the world, but we feel very confident. And of course we would, for us to have put the capacity expansion in place, we've got solid plans on how to complete the leverage of the quality of that product.</p>
          <p>Which leads me to answering your atrazine question because atrazine, we are still some 50 years later, we are still the worldwide leader in terms of atrazine. And it's a large volume compound, but it has long since become a contributing compound. We sell a lot of it to third parties and we're low cost manufacturers. And it's not anything like glyphosate in terms of it's price volatilities. So that's an example of a foundation product that was invented a long time ago and continues to be used in mixtures all around the world.</p>
          <p>The question on pricing and Bt11 royalties, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is that royalties are not going to have a material impact on the total Seeds margin. The distortion effect I was referring to was mainly around the smaller amount of licensing, which was a one off and not going to affect the second half. And indeed the fact that for the full year margin, you're comparing small numbers against a large number. The major impact is the extra cost we're bearing in the Flowers business. So, the answer to your question is it shouldn't be any impact to worry about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for your question there, Jean. And next question is to Rim Bennani at Exane. Good morning, Rim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. I have, well, two questions if I may, one around Latin America and the other one around Eastern Europe. The first one LATAM, one of your peers has cited volume growth in H2 for chemicals. Is this something possible and what's kind of your best guess in terms of volume growth\acreages into H2 in LATAM?</p>
          <p>Second, still you're citing no substantial price rises in H2. Can you give us a bit more color by product line and differentiating potentially Crop Protection and Seeds, where you think you could have still price rises in H2, and why and when negotiations are actually starting. Could you also concern, LATAM &#x2013; I'm sorry, bit of a long question, could you concern that there is more credit versus cash this year versus last year tied to the Latin American business or not? And well second part of the question is on Eastern Europe. Could we get a bit of an update how business performed Q2 versus Q1, has there been a stabilization anywhere, a further deterioration of the business, and what are you seeing from the cereal campaign that had &#x2013; find from your distributors or even farmers ahead of the cereal campaign there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, sure. First LATAM, I did take note of a quote from, I guess, what you called a colleague or peer, but that volumes are going to be up in H2 in LATAM. Our outlook is not predicated on that. So, if volumes are up, that would be great. We have a leading product line, and we got a leading market share, so we would welcome that. We are not counting on that.</p>
          <p>Your next question has &#x2013; was around credit versus cash down there in LATAM and we got quite a bit of our business in, particularly in Brazil, that's done on the basis of barter and those barter arrangements are largely already in place with the distributors as we get ready to get underway, the distributors and the growers. And so, this gives us a bit of visibility on the LATAM season and so we think we've got an optic on this cash versus credit position, and again our outlook is predicated, as John said earlier, on Brazil being a bit of a normal season and neither substantially up nor substantially down.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe, Q1 versus Q2, I would say it is stable. The front part of the year, Q1 first of all, was a very &#x2013; it stayed cold and a lot of snow for quite some time into the year, but it has been a situation where the availability of credit just has been very difficult, but it hasn't gotten worse. And as we look to the second half of the year and the front end of the 2010 season, our outlook is predicated on that being stable. It's not predicated on somehow a lot of cash or credit flowing into the system.</p>
          <p>John, anything to add or subtract to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just as a general point, the market has got more availability of financing than it did last year in Brazil. I think that's coming through from a number of sources and we can see that on the ground.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the pricing H2 versus H1, further price appreciation, we don't have &#x2013; we don't have much significant new pricing baked in but there is going to be some carry forward from the momentum that we established in the second half of 2008. John, can you quantify that some?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very much. The prices that we have achieved in the first half, you'll anticipating not losing that, and &#x2013; but the question of new price increases will be very much on a specific targeted basis. And we are not building much new price increases into our guidance for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So thanks for that, Rim. The next question to Virginie Boucher-Ferte at Deutsche Bank. Good morning, Virginie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good morning. Thank you. I've got three quick questions. First of all, looking into H1 2010, you must have a fairly good idea of your raw material cost given the 12 months contract. Could you please give us some guidance on the likely raw material benefit in H1 2010 as you've done for H2?</p>
          <p>My second question is on pricing in emerging markets. I understand it's too early to talk about pricing going into next year and further price increases, but could you please talk a little bit more on emerging market price increases and the way it goes? I presume that the local price increases to harmonize pricing can't be achieved in one season. So should we expect further local price increases in H2 and H1 next year assuming currencies remain broadly stable?</p>
          <p>And finally, that's on your new Crop Protection capacity expansion program. Would you be able to give us some idea of the top-line contribution of the new capacity for next year, as you've rolled a timing of start-up ahead by one quarter? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John, the raw material and pricing? First on the raw material impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the raw material &#x2013; the benefit of the raw material costs, the reduction in raw material costs will feed through into 2010. I'm reluctant to put a number on it, Virginie, just at this time because it will depend on year-end inventories and how much you carry forward, but we'll update later on that. But it will be beneficial.</p>
          <p>The emerging market prices, typically the experience there has been largely, the last time that we did this with any degree of force was in the Asian crisis and it did take two years to recover the currency devaluation. However, this is actually a much more volatile situation. We need to watch the currencies carefully because some of the currencies are coming back quite substantially and customers are not going to stand continuing to pay prices that were predicated on exchange rates previously if the currency has come back. So, we have to watch that space quite carefully between now and the beginning of the next season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Virginie, your third question was if &#x2013; was as the first part of the capacity expansion comes online in 2010, will it be of any help to 2010? The answer to that is it would be marginal. Much of that capacity, of course, that we're manufacturing in the end of 2010 is going to be to build inventory for the season, the following season. So expect most of the benefit of these expansions to begin in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your objective of that being earnings accretive from 2010 or very slightly earnings accretive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it will be accretive in 2010, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question to Karan Khemani at Cazenove. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. A few questions from my side. Considering the market share gains achieved by focused glyphosate and other generics plays in Asia, have you retailored or altered your acquisition strategy to put some of these companies on your radars as well especially in light of Monsanto possibly indicating that their glyphosate portfolio is now non-core to their group?</p>
          <p>My second question is considering the increase in R&amp;D relatively as a percentage of sales in Seeds, do you feel that you're still on track with your 15% EBITDA margin target, and if you ask what is the timeframe of that and has that changed? My third question is regarding your currency risk. Is your earnings at risk model value of about 200 million maximum loss for this year also applicable to next year as well, and obviously I think you'll be benefiting from lower raw materials. So your earnings at risk or the raw material side of things, what is your cost of carry of that hedge, if you actually post a gain on that front because of lower raw materials? And finally, can you give us a more concrete forecast for 2010? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the glyphosate, the answer is &#x2013; I think the short answer is no. We have a great &#x2013; I think we've a great glyphosate strategy. We have a number of long-term suppliers. Glyphosate is an important part of our portfolio but we made the decision some years ago to not be a primary manufacturer of glyphosate, I think that was a wise decision and one that continues to put us in a strong position to have yet alongside unique combination mixtures to offer glyphosate in all the key markets. But, we don't feel a need to be a manufacturer of that ourselves.</p>
          <p>Your second question on Seeds R&amp;D, we think we shared with you, of course, the pipeline that we have here. I believe that our inventiveness is as good as anybody in the space. I mean, what we've been able to bring to market under a &#x2013; since the company was formed, particularly over the last 36 months, I think is testimony to Syngenta's ability to put this technology together. This technology does have a lot of portability between the crops themselves. And as you can see, we are in a big breadth of crops. So I'm real pleased with the technology portfolio and the technology platform that we're building in Seeds.</p>
          <p>Your final question about 2010, it's early to make a call on 2010 beyond to say that the &#x2013; beyond to say that the overall financial crisis seems to be behind us and the fundamentals for this business remain broadly in place. Syngenta, outperformance last year, we believe we're going to still be headed for outperformance this year. And I would have no reason to believe it's not going to be the case in 2010.</p>
          <p>John, on the issue of earnings at risk owing to raw materials, and any of the perspectives you might have on 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Mike. Yes, the question I think &#x2013; the first part of the question was relating to the net currency loss. As I've said, we have somewhere about 330 bottom line currency loss in the first half. We've offset that with emerging market price increases to give us a net figure of about $140 million. I've also said that I anticipate second half gross currency impact on the bottom line to be about $60 million, but anticipating some further emerging market price increase to offset that. So I guess, into a range of 150 to 200 at current outlook. And exchange rates vary, closer to the 150 than 200, between 150 and 200 net impact.</p>
          <p>In terms of 2010, if current exchange rates stay at the current level, then there will be a benefit next year because we'll have the benefit of that all through the major part of the first half which is when the currencies have their major impact.</p>
          <p>Again on raw materials, I don't want to be tied down to a number for 2010 because it will depend on year-end inventory levels, but we will see benefit associated with the lower raw material cost coming through into 2010 on a year-on-year basis compared with 2009.</p>
          <p>In addition to the 2010 market outlook that Mike gave, I'll just reinforce those structural factors. The first thing, as I've mentioned, the raw materials should be beneficial. Currencies, assuming current outlook, should be beneficial. We should see further Seeds margin expansion. And just to reinforce the answer to the previous question about there should be some accretion from the capacity expansion in 2010 as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question then to Neil Tyler at J.P. Morgan. Good morning, Neil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Just a couple of questions, please. I'm sorry if I've missed this but, John, as in previous quarters, are you able to split out what the currency inflation effect was within your Crop Protection pricing number for the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And second quick question is just on the Enogen product. You mentioned you're waiting for USDA approval. Do you have any guidance on what timeline we should expect for that? And the final question is I wonder if you're willing to pass comment on USDA's current yield forecast for a variety of grains? It seemed to be comparatively optimistic given some of the effects that you yourselves are experiencing in your markets with regard to weather and the late start for planting season and lower inputs. So, I wonder if you could share perhaps your views with us briefly on what you feel about those yield forecasts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Enogen, the file is being reviewed. And it's always difficult to take a guess on this, other than it's in the final stages of review. Could be days, could be weeks, could be months. But we can't know that with any certainty. I don't actually have a view on how the USDA is going to call this thing.</p>
          <p>There has been as much bumping up and down on the outlook for corn versus soybean, some of it driven by pricing, some of it driven by weather. But we do know that this thing is always plus or minus a couple of million acres. And at the end of the day, it doesn't drive a big part of the Syngenta P&amp;L given the global nature of this business.</p>
          <p>John, the first question about quarter-on-quarter currency impact on CP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. If I may, Neil, just to answer your question, if I may on the half rather than the quarter, because the numbers are clearer in my mind. But in relation to the pricing impact, we had 400 million of price increase in Crop Protection, about half of that, 200 million, is emerging markets. And we estimate about 125 million of that is directly related to putting prices up in response to the currency effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So and unfortunately we only have time for one more question, and that goes to Ron K&#xF6;hler at MainFirst Bank. Good morning, Ronald.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, hi. A question again on price increases on Seeds actually, the 11% you showed us, how do you actually calculate the mix effect of upgrading your portfolio inside of these price increases? Meaning were these real net price effect or were mix effect a part of this 11% contribution?</p>
          <p>Second question is also on pricing in Crop Protection. Obviously, you showed us a slide, Latin American prices dollarized are down by minus 2% year-on-year, but nevertheless you pointed toward flattish prices. Do you mean then you will catch up for dollarized prices or if the currencies down you made your assumption of getting more positive? Where do you get the confidence of getting prices at least stabilized in Latin America?</p>
          <p>And the third question, could you give us a kind of update on Dow, where you're standing? Are you still in the bidding round, so to say? Or have you changed anything from your last wording here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I'll take the last question first. And I can't and won't comment specifically on any potential transaction beyond to say we are not, Syngenta is not currently in active negotiations for the acquisition, for a large acquisition, and I'll leave it at that.</p>
          <p>The pricing, John, of corn seed. First of all, it's not a mix effect, but pricing of corn seed in the U.S....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the short answer is we're trying to exclude mix from that pricing number. That should be pure pricing. I'm not sure if I fully understood the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the seed price, actually, the seed prices, a part of that of course is driven by the fact that the underlying cost to grow the seed has increased as well. So, you've got the growers that grow our incoming product, corn and soybean growers have a higher price. We have to pay a higher price to them to grow our seeds. So the whole industry experienced some degree of price increase in seeds because of the commodity impact on the underlying cost.</p>
          <p>And your LatAm question, can you one more time restate it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there was a point in your slide on currency and pricing effect, you said you had dollarized price decrease in the first half here in Latin America of minus 2%. And obviously if I rightly read you, your kind of guiding to flat pricing or potentially even selective price increases in the second half here. And Latin America is a dominating part of Crop Protection. Then how does that fit with this minus two you reported for the first half year? So where is your optimism coming of getting better pricing environment than in the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not anticipating or guiding much price increase in Latin America in the second half. We're not doing that. What we're anticipating is looking at opportunity for pricing but we are not building that into the numbers. The point is that the exchange rates have moved more favorably and there should be some impact in that when you're pricing effectively in dollars. But underlying price increases, we are not being particularly bullish on in the second half for Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You had price decreases in the first half, and I actually believe there are a lot of inventory build up in Latin America currently. Obviously we had a weak season in Europe, people shipping stuff, and there is a risk of even more price decreases, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is the possibility but there will be a positive impact from the currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Ronald, thank you for that. And for the rest of you that were waiting, I apologize that we weren't able to address all of your questions, but I will take that as a proxy for a lot of continued interest in the sector and the company. And as I said in our outlook statement, we look forward to the future with a lot of confidence. So, look forward to chatting with you again in three months time. Thank you very much</p>
