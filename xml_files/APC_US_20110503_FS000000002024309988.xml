          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tom and I will be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will be conducting a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the presentation over to John Colglazier, please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone. And I'm really glad you could join us today for Anadarko's first quarter conference call. I'll remind you that today's presentation will contain our best and most reasonable estimates and information. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss today. You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings, and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release and on our Web site. And as we do each quarter, we have included additional information in our quarterly operations report that is available on our Web site. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, who will discuss our first quarter results. Jim is joined by other members of our executive management team who will be available to answer your questions later in the call. Jim?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The operational performance of our assets and teams in the first quarter 2011 was excellent. It continues to demonstrate the quality and depth of the portfolio that's been assembled. The first quarter set yet another record for sales volumes with the average sales of 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We also announced a $1.6 billion joint venture with Korea National Oil Company in the Eagleford, highlighting the tremendous embedded value of our position in this shale play. The deepwater exploration progress continued with three discoveries and three successful appraisal wells announced during the quarter. We also achieved meaningful improvement in quarter-over-quarter lease operating expenses. And we announced the acquisition of the Wattenberg Processing Plant, the significant benefits of which will be discussed in more detail in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Focusing first upon the operational performance for the quarter, the record sales volumes of 62 million barrels of oil equivalent were at the high end of guidance. And liquids made up an increasing portion of these sales volumes at about 42% for the quarter. Lease operating expense also improved by about 13% per BOE compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. These achievements contributed to a 12% sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDAX per BOE. The record sales volumes included significant increases in production from our shales, specifically the Marcellus and liquids-rich Eagleford plays and from our first oil lifting at the Jubilee field, offshore Ghana.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Eagleford shale, where sales volumes increased by 30% quarter-over-quarter, we secured additional takeaway capacity for both crude oil and natural gas through multiple long-term pipeline and handling agreements. Capitalizing the greater than 100% current rates of return in this play, we ramped up activity to 10 operated rigs, have expanded our infrastructure and service agreements, and are well-positioned to continue delivering strong growth.</p>
          <p>We are also very pleased to welcome KNOC as a partner in the Eagleford shale, after recently closing our joint venture. Through the partnership, KNOC will fund up to 100% of capital costs for the remainder of this year and up to 90% thereafter until the carry is exhausted, which will likely be year end 2013. As they do this, they warrant a third of Anadarko's interest in the play.</p>
          <p>Included in last night's earnings release was news that KNOC also exercised its option to acquire an approximate 25% interest in the associated midstream assets in the Eagleford. We are eager to work alongside our new partner and our hope to expand this relationship in the future.</p>
          <p>Turning to Marcellus Shale, we've currently operated eight rigs and continue to expand infrastructure on pace with our development activities. Sales volumes increased by about 82% over the previous quarter and we recently established record gross sales volumes of almost 450 million cubic feet per day, from approximately 95 producing wells. Our emerging growth plays in the Permian Basin of West Texas also demonstrated significant sales volume due to increases during the quarter. In the Bone Spring, gross sales volumes nearly doubled over the fourth quarter 2010 to almost 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, comprised of more than 75% liquids. In the shallower Avalon Shale, some of our recent wells have tested at rates of between 800 and 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, also with a high liquid cut. Evaluation of the Avalon Shale and the Wolfcamp opportunity is ongoing.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Rockies, the Wattenberg Field in greater Denver-Julesburg Basin core area continues to expand. The Wattenberg team achieved another new sales volume record during the quarter, as they continued to maximize the robust economics of the field and capitalize on its important liquids yield, which represents about 75% of the value stream.</p>
          <p>Also in the region, we continue to test the vast potential of the horizontal Niobrara opportunity where we hold about 1.3 million net acres, much of it economically advantaged by our land grant ownership. We're seeing strong results in our operated program in the play and we added an additional horizontal rig during the quarter in order to accelerate these activities. Given our premier position in the emerging Niobrara opportunity and the continued growth in the Wattenberg Field,  we recently acquired full ownership of the Wattenberg Processing Plant by purchasing BP's 93% stake.</p>
          <p>This purchase further aligns our midstream and upstream assets in this core area. We expect to extract additional value from the plant through modifications and future expansions that will improve run times and significantly increase capacity and liquid recoveries. We also plan to optimize our fields in order to improve margins, increase estimated ultimate recoveries and enhance efficiencies. The plant, combined with our facility at Fort Lupton and Western Gas Partners' recently purchased Platte Valley Plant, provides us with a significant portion of the processing capacity in the greater DJ Basin. The Wattenberg Plant should also be an excellent candidate for a future acquisition by Western Gas Partners.</p>
          <p>Further west in the Greater Natural Buttes area, sales volumes increased by about 7% over the fourth quarter. The field set a new single-day gross production record of 456 million cubic feet equivalent per day, with an approximate 30% liquids content. During the quarter, the Greater Natural Buttes team drilled 11 Mesaverde wells that also were deepened to the Blackhawk interval. The early results from this program are encouraging as the Blackhawk program provides additional running room and incremental recoveries of more than 700 million cubic feet equivalent per well, at an estimated development cost of less than $0.42 per Mcfe.</p>
          <p>Also worth noting in Wyoming's Wamsutter Field is that we've set a weekly gross production record of approximately 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. We provided additional detail on these and other assets in our first quarter Operations Report that is available on our Web site.</p>
          <p>In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we have continued to keep both of our contracted rigs active as we move projects forward, while working to acquire drilling permits that will allow us to resume exploration and appraisal activities. At Caesar/Tonga, the project team continues to pursue parallel paths toward a riser solution, advancing the development toward first oil in 2012.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we successfully flow-tested two wells that each demonstrated very strong rates of more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day, with completion activities underway on the third well. As we previously announced, once the completion is finished, we plan to move the rig to West Africa late in the second quarter to begin our 2011 exploration and appraisal program in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p>
          <p>At the Lucius Field in the Gulf of Mexico, we have a rig on location to conduct an extended well test during the second quarter. We expect the test to provide us with valuable insight into the reservoir's permeability, lateral extent, communication and aquifer support that will assist in the design of the facility and top size. In the meantime, our project teams continue to advance development planning and front-end engineering studies at Lucius.</p>
          <p>Turning to our international mega-projects, as you know, we achieved a major milestone in the quarter one with our first lifting from the Jubilee Field offshore Ghana. Current production from this world-class field is more than 70,000 barrels of oil per day. And the partnership continues to ramp up production toward 120,000 barrels per day of capacity by the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we've experienced no disruptions in Algeria, and construction is progressing well at the El Merk project. The overall project is about 75% complete and we anticipate major facilities completion and significant production rates around the end of 2012. As you've seen in our press releases, our exploration teams delivered another strong quarter with three significant deepwater discoveries and three successful offshore appraisal wells.</p>
          <p>Turning to Ghana and the West Cape Three Points Block where we hold a 31% interest, we announced both a Teak-1 and Teak-2 discoveries during the quarter. Teak-1 encountered more than 240 net feet of oil, condensate and natural gas pay in Cretaceous-age reservoirs. The Teak-2 discovery well was drilled between the Teak-1 well location and the Jubilee unit boundary and encountered 90 feet of oil, condensate and natural gas pay. The partnership is evaluating plans to appraise both discoveries later this year. Also on the West Cape Three Points Block, the partnership is currently drilling the Banda prospect to the east of the previously announced Odum discovery. Once Banda is complete, the partnership plans to mobilize the rig to drill in the nearby Makore prospect, southeast of the Jubilee unit.</p>
          <p>On the adjacent Deepwater Tano block, where we hold an 18% working interest, we participated in three successful appraisal wells during the quarter in the Tweneboa/Enyenra complex, and a fourth successful well at Tweneboa-4 was announced by the operator subsequent to quarter's end. The rig is now on location at the Tweneboa-2 well to conduct a drillstem test. The Tweneboa/Enyenra complex has the potential to be as large as Jubilee and the partnership is continuing an active appraisal program to advance the complex toward an expected declaration of commerciality later this year.</p>
          <p>In February, we announced another major discovery in Mozambique in the Rovuma Basin. Tubarao is the fourth significant natural gas accumulation discovered in this frontier deepwater basin, where we hold approximately 2.6 million acres. Tubarao encountered more than 110 net feet of natural gas pay and opened a new play style, which further strengthened our confidence in our geological and geophysical models of the basin. Anadarko operates Tubarao with a 36.5% working interest.</p>
          <p>Further north in the Windjammer, Barquentine and Lagosta complex, we are continuing to evaluate commercial solutions and advance this future mega-project. We are currently conducting coring operations, and in coming months we expect to begin appraisal activities that include multiple drillstem tests in the complex. We are also acquiring new 3D seismic data in the basin and plan to bring in another rig to drill additional exploration wells, beginning in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier in this call, we plan to mobilize a rig from the Gulf of Mexico to West Africa later this quarter to begin our exploration and appraisal drilling program offshore Sierra Leone and Liberia. Plans include drilling the Montserrado prospect in Block-15 offshore Liberia, where we are the operator with a 57.5% working interest. We also plan to utilize the rig to drill the Jupiter prospect offshore Sierra Leone and an appraisal well in our Mercury discovery. Both of these wells are located in Block 07B-10, which we operate with a 65% working interest.</p>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico exploration program, we have been encouraged by some of the movement we have seen in recent weeks regarding well permits. We are one of the few companies who has joined both the Helix Well Containment Group and the Marine Well Containment Company and we are optimistic that we will be able to receive the necessary permits to resume our exploration and appraisal drilling programs in the Gulf during the second half of this year, as we budgeted.</p>
          <p>With regard to the BP oil spill of last year, we stand by our stated position, which continues to be supported by the findings of various independent investigations. Consistent with past quarters, we've again included disclosures regarding this event in our first quarter 10-Q filing with the SEC.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial results for the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.43 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which first quarter net income would have been about $0.29 per share higher, resulting in adjusted net income of $0.72 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned previously, we generated strong discretionary cash flow of nearly $1.7 billion during the first quarter. This was about $90 million more than our total capital expenditures of $1.6 billion, which included consolidation of approximately $370 million in spending at our Western Gas Partners, our publicly traded midstream LLP. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.5 billion of cash on hand and maintained significant additional liquidity through our undrawn five-year $5 billion credit facility.</p>
          <p>Our full-year capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.6 billion, not including expenditures of Western Gas Partners. The $600 million increase in this number from February's estimate was discussed at the March, Howard Weil Investor Conference and simply reflects the purchase of the Wattenberg Processing Plant that we discussed earlier in the call.</p>
          <p>With the strong first quarter results, the company continues its positive momentum as we move closer to achieving the five-year objectives that we presented in March of 2010. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we are expecting sales volumes to be in a range of 60 million to 62 million barrels of oil equivalent. This will keep us on target to meet our full-year goal of 244 million to 248 million barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>In summary, our shales and emerging liquids-rich growth plays are generating excellent results, returns and value. We have ample running room and continue to extract substantial value from the core operating areas throughout our base assets. Jubilee is performing well and our other sanctioned mega projects continue to advance toward first production. We expect to continue a very active offshore exploration and appraisal program, providing significant value upside for our shareholders. And we are continuing to work to safely resume exploration and appraisal activities in the Gulf of Mexico during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>With that, Tom, we'll open up the line for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Subash Chandra with Jefferies. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions. I guess beginning with the Rockies and the liquids going on out there and the growth expected. Are there any limiting factors in handling the NGL supply growth out of that basin this year? Or into 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is Chuck. What we're doing now is from Greater Natural Buttes and Wattenberg, which is our two large liquid production areas, we're selling condensate and oil in through the White Cliffs Pipeline in Wattenberg and with trucks in our Greater Natural Buttes and our natural gas liquids are headed to both Conway and Mont Belvieu. We have contracts in place to make those movements and feel good about our expansion capacity out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Marcellus, this rate of growth both from Anadarko as well as industry, lots of, I think, something like three Bs a day of new takeaway. How is this gas going to be absorbed in the next couple of years? And do you see an export market in Canada developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Scott Moore from Marketing. That gas will be consumed in local power generation, as well as reduction and imports as our guys come up from the Southeast and the Midwest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So offsetting other U.S. gas? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a final one. So, this whole lizard issue in the Permian, any thoughts on how that plays out? Is this serious this go-around? Or is this a non-event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Subash, can you repeat that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, the endangered species in &#x2013; I forget the name of the lizard out there &#x2013; that's making its way through U.S. Wildlife and Fish Commission. And it looks like it overlaps Ward County. And so, where you have three rigs active, so curious about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that's what we're doing and of course, we're monitoring the situation and as always we take all the regulations and environmental hazards into account and make our development plans. And we'll deal with it as we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. A final one if I could, sorry. The sweet spots in the Marcellus, how many rigs do you think you'll run throughout this year and going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll run around eight drilling rigs and one or two spudders and then in the JV area, the Chesapeake's running around 15. And so combined, 23 to 25 rigs or thereabouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I think I'm going to try a couple in West Africa. I'm not sure there are too many lizards out there, but we'll see how we get on. The &#x2013; Ghana, obviously, as you mentioned the potential declaration of commerciality in West Tano. Can you talk about, I believe Kosmos has talked about a potential submission of Mahogany? Can you just talk about what the current prognosis is for how many developments you ultimately see there? And if you could touch on, perhaps, the Tweneboa/Enyenra gas versus oil debate, as to how that might impact the development concept? And I've got a couple of follow-ups, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Doug, this is Chuck. With regard to Ghana, on the Tweneboa side, we anticipate an FPSO as has been mentioned in several of the newspapers and rags. Tullow is progressing that with really good speed. We hope to have a decision by year end as to the final development program. The oil and gas mix is still being evaluated with regard to our appraisal program. It looks like a very economic development in any regard.</p>
          <p>With regard to Mahogany East, that's a subsea development that we intend to tie back to Jubilee as space becomes available. Kosmos is the operator of that. We evaluated a number of different alternatives and landed on the subsea system. There's still an outside chance in the event of additional development that something may have just substantially bigger that we could do something else, but right now, the partnership's pointed directly at a subsea system.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Chuck. Should we think, then, about extending the plateau of the Jubilee development? Is that how we should think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the way we're seeing it right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with regard to the remainder of it, it'll &#x2013; we're having a lot of success, as you know ,with our exploration and appraisal program, north and east of the platform. The FPSO at Teak and others, we have the oil discovery &#x2013; I'm sorry, we have the Odum discovery east of there, so all that is being put together and evaluated for additional developments, pending the result of the appraisal and exploration programs that are ongoing now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Doug, just to remind you, we're presently on Banda and we'll see what we have there and then we're going to move down to Makore. And that looks to be an interesting prospect particularly with the news that came out of the Hess Block recently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is Teak potentially a stand-alone development? And if you could maybe speak to the Teak-2, in terms of the implications for maybe slightly changing unitization of the Jubilee field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Teak could be a stand-alone development. We need to get out there and drill the appraisal wells, so we don't know at this point. But certainly, it has the implications that it could be.  And, of course, when you put Odum and some of the others that we anticipate coming into it, then you've got the makings of a standalone. But that's going to require a lot of drilling and that's where we're focused on this year. As to the Teak-2 and the unitization, I might ask Chuck to deal with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the unit is put together and they've taken expansion. We have some information that we're certainly in the same zones and we're evaluating what the pressure information and that will tell us. But what our suspicion will happen is, as we go along and start gas injection and production from Jubilee up in that quadrant, we'll determine whether to put together or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. So, I've just got a couple of quick follow-ups, if I may. Just staying with West Africa very quickly. I guess my favorite question, the farm &#x2013; the potential farm-down of your 65% working interest. Any thoughts there before you really start to get after some of those wells? And given that Cote d'Ivoire seems to have settled down a little bit, are you planning to get back there? And I'll leave it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the farm-down, we have concluded the farm-down of 10% of our working interest. That's all we wanted to lay off. We signed that last Friday, so that's in place, and will help on the ongoing activity. That's specifically in Liberia and Sierra Leone. And then on the Cote d'Ivoire, we do have prospects that we would like to get into and drill. Originally, we had planned a five-well program in West Africa, including two in Cote d'Ivoire. We're paying close attention to how the situation is developing in Cote d'Ivoire, and as things stabilize and we have confidence that our people can work safely in-country, we'll be looking at when we can drill those wells. Right now, we do not have them at the end of the three-well program in Sierra Leone and Liberia.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just following in Ghana and West Cape Three Points, the exploration phase ends in July. Banda, Makore, Dahoma Updip, will they all be drilled before the exploration phase ends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, that's the plan, to get all those drilled, and then to, based on whatever we find, roll those into an appraisal phase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, as you think about the undeveloped parts of the block, there's an ability to negotiate a new petroleum agreement. Is there any update on the status for that new petroleum agreement? And any idea of prospects or prospectivity on that block?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think by the time we drill, finish Banda, finish drill Makore and Updip Dahoma, that we will pretty much have evaluated what we see as the good prospectivity of the block. Then it'll be really focused on the appraisal phase. We've got Teak to appraise, we already have an appraisal in Odum, and then, any other success that we have here at those three exploratory wells will require additional appraisal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, as you think about Deepwater Tano exploration, as you bring these projects into development, you have until 2013 for the exploration phase there. Can you talk about the number of prospects that you think you'll test on the exploratory side at Deepwater Tano over that timeframe? Just a rough number would be useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We probably have two to three more exploratory wells to drill over there and then, based on the appraisal drilling, we seem to be finding additional sands at different levels beyond what we're appraising, and those need to be further delineated. So that may drive some additional activity. But right now, we see two to three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, in Mozambique, as you think about going to the south and testing potentially any oil concepts, can you walk through the risk profile now that you've found an oil source but not reservoir? What do you think about the prospectivity is for oil in Mozambique?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, we're shooting a 3Der. We just finished shooting a 3D in the southern portion of the block; and if you have the maps that we put in our IR reports, it's extending the existing 3D to the block boundary. That's in the processing center now and we should have that third quarter sometime. That's going to tell us a lot about the prospectivity and the risk.</p>
          <p>Right now what we know is: there's a petroleum system down there that's generating liquid hydrocarbons, but we did not find the liquid hydrocarbons in quality reservoirs. So we need to see on the 3D the quality reservoirs, which we do think we can utilize some of the techniques we've developed up north, that are very good at identifying good sands, and then try to match up the source kitchen and migration routes into those sands. That'll give us a real good handle on the risk profile then. But until we get that 3D in, we're working from a very sparse grid of 2D beyond where our existing data-set was, and so it'll be towards the end of this year before we really can answer that question with any confidence.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Real quickly, in the Niobrara, you guys added an extra rig there, heaps of acreage, great returns out of the play. What are limiting factors from accelerating that? And I know you're moving to four, but where could that ultimately go from a development standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, this is Chuck. The &#x2013; if you look at the Niobrara closely, what you see is the center of the Niobrara is sitting squarely over Wattenberg. And we're actively developing the Niobrara in both the horizontal and vertical sense in and around Wattenberg and expanding out to the north with the industry. And the industries, along with us, are taking a lot of effort to evaluate and delineate the potential of Niobrara and we're in the midst of that.</p>
          <p>One or two of the three rigs we currently have is doing work north of the Wattenberg Field proper. And what we expect to see happening is based upon results, we could see that expand quite considerably.  But it's going to take great results before we make those decisions and we're doing a lot of evaluation work. You know we're having a very extensive land position, I think it's around 1.3 million acres combined. And so, it's going to take us a while to really evaluate what we have. And it even can move up into the southern part of River Basin area, which we have a nice land position as well. So it's going to be a while before we can really answer that question directly, but we certainly see the potential to grow extensively in the area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then, focusing on some stuff you shared with us back a bit that was on efficiency gains, the Eagleford, Marcellus, Bone Springs, et cetera. Are efficiency gains baked into your forward production guidance? And, I guess, maybe even on top of that is, if we look at the increased EURs on a per-well basis across most of your land plays, are those also baked into &#x2013; is there some of that baked into your forward production guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, not really, I guess, is the answer. What we do is make a reasonable estimate of what our position looks now and then we put a bunch of engineers to work trying to find a way to improve that. And so, that's our best estimate as we sit here today. We're constantly doing experimentation to evaluate the opportunity to gain efficiency, either speed or cost. And as we realize those we put them into our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess then, the follow-on to that would be, what are you guys seeing in the last quarter in terms of upticks? Or is that exceeding expectations? In the past, you'd mentioned that you thought you were maybe in later innings in the Eagleford in terms of efficiency gains but early innings in the Marcellus. Any kind of color you can give us in terms of where we might see step-shift changes going forward would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that still holds true. We &#x2013; if you go back out to the Maverick-Eagleford area, we've recently drilled a well in 8.4 days, which is improving substantially from a historical performance. In the Marcellus, we still have some room to work, we think. We've now got down to our averages in the order of 17 to 18 days in the most recent drilling. So we're very excited about that and we think we can improve upon it, but we haven't. We're just &#x2013; it's a hard row to hoe and we're working on it every day to make it better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just last follow-on question to that. If efficiency gains are getting better, obviously on a recovery, on a per-well basis, or returns on a per-well basis, that insulates you from service cost increase. But if efficiencies are getting better, you're drilling more wells and aggregate service costs go higher. Is that something we should be thinking about with respect to CapEx going forward on the year? Could there be a bias higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not planning on that. Our goal is to at least offset the cost inflation we see with efficiency. And then, use our capital program for the most economical wells we have. And so we'll move it around to adjust right where we need to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk to what you're seeing on New Zealand? And how the exploration opportunity there competes relative to other areas in the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian. This is Bob. Yeah, we really like what we're seeing in New Zealand. We've got a 3D in the Canterbury Basin over what we call our Carrick and Caravel prospects. That has a 2D line that ties up onto the shelf. And that is important in that 2D line also ties into a well that was drilled, tested about 10 million a day of gas and 2,300 barrels of condensate. And when you come and look at these prospects, we're looking for the same reservoir edibles that were encountered on that shelf wall, come through a syncline and then back up on a big four-way structure. And when it's that big, it's like 90,000 acres of four-way closure. So it's very significant.</p>
          <p>And then, because it's about 7 million, 8 million acres out there, we think we've got tremendous amount of follow-on potential. So we've shot some 2D. We're out there shooting now. I think we just finished the 2D actually acquisition side of it to help define that follow-on potential. So that's the Canterbury Basin.</p>
          <p>And then we have the Block in the deepwater Taranaki, of course. The Taranaki Basin is an established petroleum system. Nobody's really tested the deepwater in a very methodical way. And again, our acreage position's very significant up there. So we acquired 2D last year. We defined --  we've mapped that now. We've defined some prospects up there. And so our plans moving forward are to drill two wells, one in the Canterbury, one in the Taranaki Basin.</p>
          <p>We're out talking to &#x2013; talking about getting rigs and discussing the availability. It does look like there are rigs available. The move, of course, is going to be a big issue. And what we're trying to do is line up other operators in New Zealand to help share that mobilization. So we've got a lot of work to do before we actually sign the rig and get to drilling. But right now, we're targeting towards the end of the year, early 2012, if all that comes together. If not, it'd be a year later. And as to how they compete in our portfolio, they compete very well. The fiscal terms in New Zealand are extremely attractive. And then, as I described the potential, we see very good potential there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then secondly, on West Africa in Jubilee with Phase I now on, can you just talk about how you're thinking about future phases and costs relative to the first Jubilee fill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're actively completing all the Phase I wells and the production's ramped up. We're now in excess of 70,000 barrels a day, so the field's doing extremely well. We still have four, five additional producers, injectors to complete. And once that's completed, we envision a Phase IA which is primarily infill wells to fill in this general area that we're developing. And then after that is done, which it should be some time next year, we would potentially expand to the remainder of the field there. And it's just to knock it out as we see production results and allow the &#x2013; you know in reservoir speak, the production to talk to us and lead us to where we need to do further development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On a cost side, Chuck, you expect that anything that's a subsea back is actually going to be as economic or better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it'd probably be better because all the infrastructure's in place. When we put in the subsea system, we allowed for additional drilling slots in the subsea manifolds. And so it's pretty much just drill the wells and put them online. There's no additional subsea or top-sense hardware necessary.</p>

But we also realize that our investors would like us to consider some sort of approach that's perhaps a compromise from that. And so, you know, it's a very complicated process, with multiple parties in the litigation. And while we may be interested in settling, individual parties at various points on down the road here, it's indeterminate until we see some groupings get together to try to get this done.

BP has disclosed our 10-Q that we filed yesterday, that provided a notice of dispute as a period of time within which management representatives can get together, see if we can resolve the disputes amongst us. If after that time has expired and a cooling-off period we don't, then it's up to the parties whether or not to invoke arbitration. It's not a clear-cut deal.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we see structural cost increases in all of the basins that are very high, based on the shale plays. However, much like our drilling and completion programs, we're working very hard with our field organizations to find efficiencies in our operations and improve that lease operating structure. And you know, effectively, we've been benefited by the fact that we have had very few, if any, significant deepwater workovers in this quarter, so that's helped the overall cost structure as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up, Chuck, on your Eagleford and Marcellus comments, that you're drilling wells in 8.4 and 17 to 18 days. How long is it taking you to actually drill to complete, to actually put on production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we have &#x2013; it's varying, frankly, across the entire plays because of the infrastructure that's available to us. In the center of our Maverick development, we can put them on very quickly, and we've had production inside of 40, 45 days from spud. If you're out on the remote areas of the field, it can take upwards of twice that.</p>
          <p>In the Marcellus, it's the same way. If you're able to drill &#x2013; when we drill wells in a developed area where outlying connections are on pads, we can connect them very quickly. If we drill wells in new and expanding areas, it takes some time to get pipelines installed and it could be upwards of six months in some areas. So it varies across the field.</p>
