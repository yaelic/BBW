          <p>Good morning. Before Brian Moynihan and Joe Price begin their comments, let me remind you that this presentation does contain some forward-looking statements regarding our both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. These factors include, among other things, changes in economic conditions, changes in interest rates, competitive pressures within the financial services industry, and legislative or regulatory requirements that may affect our businesses. For additional factors, please see our press release and SEC documents.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us on this busy day on our earnings call. Over the past couple years, I've met or spoken to many of you regarding the various businesses that I've run within Bank of America. And in my new role as CEO, I would tell that I'm honored to serve this company, its customers, associates, and importantly its shareholders. I firmly believe that we've built one of the best franchises in the industry, if not the best, with the ability to serve customers and clients of all types on a global basis.</p>
          <p>My team and I plan on leveraging our leading market positions with capabilities that we believe match or exceed our competitors. Our goal is to refocus our efforts here at Bank of America, refocus our efforts and our attention on those core capabilities that will make Bank of America a winner in the years ahead, drawing on our long tradition of operational excellence and strong execution.</p>
          <p>I know there are several banks and several companies reporting this morning, so I know that you're anxious to get directly to the numbers.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of 2009, Bank of America had a net loss of $194 million before the $5 billion impact of preferred dividends and repayment of TARP, which results in a loss of about $0.60 per diluted share. Included in the $5 billion was $4.6 billion related to TARP preferred stock, including the 4 billion associated with repurchasing the TARP preferred as the book value of our preferreds was less than the amount paid.</p>
          <p>For the full year of 2009 before preferred dividends, net income was $6.3 billion or a loss of $0.29 per diluted share after deducting preferred dividends and TARP repayments. TARP dividends and the TARP repayment for all of 2009 represented $0.94 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>The financial crisis has taken its toll on our company in many ways during 2009. With respect to our investment by the government, during 2009 we repaid the $45 billion of preferred stock. We paid dividends of $2.6 billion. We paid termination fees on the proposed asset wrap of $425 million. We paid about $3 billion in various insurance fees, including our normal FDIC expense, and we prepaid billions in FDIC premiums.</p>
          <p>In addition, we issued the government warrants to buy 122 million and 150 million shares of our company at $30.79 and $13.30 respectively.</p>
          <p>In summary, these are heavy costs and represented just some of the challenges that our associates had to contend with in 2009 as they competed in the market. But with these behind us, we clearly look forward to 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving to the revenue, total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 on an FTE basis was in excess of $25 billion while pre-tax pre-provision income was approximately $9 billion even after the impact of some unusual items that Joe will detail a little bit later.</p>
          <p>There were several positive trends in the quarter. First, credit quality appears to be stabilizing, if not improving. Net credit losses in dollar terms decreased 1.6 billion from the third quarter of 2009, supporting our comments in October that overall credit costs were peaking. Second, the capital markets environment reflect the strong investment banking revenue, up substantially from our third quarter, which was already a strong quarter in the business, and we retained our second place position in that business. Next, results in our Global Wealth and Investment Management team continued to prove strong asset management fees and brokerage income driven by improving markets and increased client activity. In addition, the number of our financial advisors has stabilized at 15,000.</p>
          <p>Across our franchise, new deposit generation maintained its positive momentum, with overall total corporate-wide average deposits up nearly $6 billion despite the substantial drop of $15 billion in wholesale funding. In addition, we continue to meet and exceed many of the milestones around both Merrill's and Countrywide's integrations.</p>
          <p>Now unfortunately, any earnings impacting these positives are more than offset by the continued high level of credit costs, lower customer activity due to the economic environment, and some other items that have been headwinds most of the year 2009.</p>
          <p>Total credit extended in the fourth quarter was $177 billion, including commercial renewals, versus $184 billion during the third quarter, as growth in our commercial areas was more than offset by lower mortgage production. The largest components of this production for the fourth quarter were $87 billion in first mortgages, down from 96 billion in the third quarter, 66 billion in non-real estate commercial, $11 billion in commercial real estate. The remaining 13 billion included $9 billion in other consumer retail loans and $4 billion in small business loans.</p>
          <p>Despite these new extensions, loan balances overall declined, mostly due to charge-offs, lower consumer spending, lower commercial client activity, and a resurgence in the capital markets allowing larger corporate clients to issue bonds and equity replacing loans as a source for funding. We note that our companies or our clients continue to be very cautious and we're not yet seeing a typical level of business activity for a recovery.</p>
          <p>As we move to provision expense, in the fourth quarter, it decreased from the third quarter by 1.6 billion, driven by lower net charge-offs. Credit costs included a $1.7 billion addition to reserves versus $2.1 billion in the third quarter. Roughly half of that reserve increase in the quarter was driven by a change in reserve coverage in consumer credit card to a full 12 months.</p>
          <p>Let me make a few comments about the current economic environment. For almost six months now, many major economic indicators have been improving at the national and global levels, which hopefully indicates that we've reached the bottom of the cycle. Our economic team here at Bank of America currently forecasts global growth in 2010 above 4%, led by emerging markets and growth in US GDP of about 3%.</p>
          <p>Embedded in that aggregate outlook are our views on four economic indicators we believe highly correlate to future economic performance; first, the labor market. We believe we can anticipate positive job growth during the first half of 2010. But even with that, the number of unemployed will remain very large for quite some time and extend the drag on consumer spending and overall economic growth.</p>
          <p>Second, in the housing market, although home prices in the largest 20 markets have posted back-to-back monthly price increases for the past few months, the potential new round of foreclosure supply represents some downside risk to that stability.</p>
          <p>Third on household net worth, the recovery in the equity markets and stabilization of home prices have led to recovery in total household wealth over the past several months. But consumer balance sheets, especially those of less affluent customers, remain under stress.</p>
          <p>Fourth in manufacturing, there is an ongoing recovery in US manufacturing that's benefiting from a firming global economy, as you can see in the recent ISM survey results.</p>
          <p>So all this tells you while things are improving slowly, the US economy remains fragile. For our company, the recovery and strong performance in our market sensitive businesses offer diversification to offset the core credit headwinds we continue to face in our core commercial and consumer lending businesses.</p>
          <p>Although we believe we saw the peak in the third quarter, net loss levels remain elevated for the next several quarters. Additions to reserve have come down, and although there may be some additions in some business lines in the first half of 2010, overall we believe at the corporate level significant additions to reserves are hopefully over. While we still have several quarters before we can discuss actual normalized earnings, we believe the economy is stabilizing, markets are opening, and customer sentiment is improving.</p>
          <p>Now at this point, let me turn it over to Joe for additional color and commentary on the numbers. Joe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brian. Over the next few minutes, I plan to cover the performance of each of our businesses, credit quality, the margin, and some other topics including some comments about 2010. But before getting into the business results, let me highlight the large items that impacted earnings in the fourth quarter, and you can see these on slide six.</p>
          <p>As most of you are aware, structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch are marked to market under the fair-value option. This resulted in a hit to earnings of 1.6 billion, 4.9 billion for the whole year on a pre-tax basis, primarily due to the narrowing of Merrill Lynch credit spreads. If you remember, the mark was a negative 1.8 billion in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now as a reminder, the impact of marks on our structured notes does not impact Tier 1 capital. Looking forward, while most of the negative marks should be behind us, the Merrill Lynch spreads are still outside Bank of America's, but not by much. Additionally, our spreads are clearly outside pre-disruption levels.</p>
          <p>On the credit valuation side, the adjustments on derivative liabilities, and this is principally in our trading businesses, resulted in a negative impact of 186 million versus a negative impact of 713 million in the third quarter. Our Global Markets revenue absorbed additional write-downs this quarter of 1.1 billion due to legacy positions versus a net positive of 218 million in the third quarter. Included here on the commercial real estate side, we took a charge of approximately 850 million. The remaining 250 million of marks were spread over leveraged finance, structured credit trading, CDO exposure, and auction rate securities.</p>
          <p>Equity investment income included the pre tax benefit of 1.1 billion, which was a write-up related to our BlackRock ownership, driven by their equity issuance in connection with the BGI acquisition. In non-interest expense, we recorded over 500 million for litigation related matters.</p>
          <p>And the fourth quarter tax rate or the tax benefit of a loss was higher than statutory due to tax benefits on certain foreign subsidiary restructurings in connection with our merger activities as well as benefits from tax audit settlements. For 2010, we expect the effective rate to trend closer to statutory, less 1 to 2 billion in what I'd call recurring benefits absent any unusual items or changes in tax rules.</p>
          <p>Now let me quickly touch upon some of the highlights in each of the businesses this quarter. In our</p>
          <p>Deposits segment, and this is on slide eight, earnings were 595 million in the quarter, down approximately 200 million from the third quarter. Net interest income of 1.8 billion was relatively flat with the third quarter while non-interest income of 1.7 billion decreased 257 million, due mainly to the actions we highlighted in October around overdraft fee policy changes. We estimate the impact was about 160 million, in line with what we conveyed to you in October, with the rest of the decline coming from normal seasonality and to some extent customers better managing their cash flows. Non-interest expense of 2.4 billion was flat to the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now on slide nine, you can see average retail deposit levels for the quarter excluding Countrywide were up almost 12 billion or almost 2% from the third quarter, which we believe is quite strong. We continue to see a products mix shift from CDs to higher margin liquid products, with checking products now representing 43% of the retail deposit balances. Merrill Lynch continues to show momentum as financial advisors provide the customers with benefits of an expanded product suite through cross-selling.</p>
          <p>Global Card Services, and this is on slide 10, we had a loss of $1 billion, in line with third quarter results. Revenue was down 2% from third quarter due to lower net interest income and fees. And although provision was almost flat or down 51 million, managed net losses were down approximately 920 million. The provision was impacted by an increase in the consumer credit card reserve coverage to 12 months, and that was about 800 million; and reserve additions for maturing securitizations, and that totaled about 550 million. These increases were partially offset by reductions in reserves for improvement in the domestic portfolios, and I'll come back and give you a little more on credit in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Average managed consumer credit cards outstandings were down 3.5% from the third quarter to 163 billion.</p>
          <p>Now an encouraging note, and this is on a per average account basis, retail spending on credit card was up 8%, and debit was up 5% for the holiday season versus last year. We also continue to add new accounts, 586,000 new domestic retail and small business credit card accounts in the quarter, with credit lines totaling approximately $4 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, home loans and insurance, and you can see this on slide 11, experienced production levels slightly below third quarter activity but included better MSR hedging results. As a result, total revenue for the quarter was 3.8 billion, up 382 million from third quarter levels.</p>
          <p>Production income decreased 55 million as higher margins were offset by lower production volume and secondary market gains. Now this is also the line item where we record reps and warranties expense, which was up a little this quarter as well.</p>
          <p>Servicing income increased 447 million, primarily due to better MSR performance net of hedge results. Now the capitalization rate for the consumer mortgage MSR asset, and that's versus a combined consumer and commercial you might see reported in the industry, ended the quarter at 113 basis points versus 102 basis points in the third quarter as interest rates were higher at the end of the quarter, lowering prepayment risk.</p>
          <p>Provision decreased 647 million to 2.2 billion while net charge-offs decreased 462 million to 1.5 billion. Additions to the reserve of 748 million for the quarter were down 185 million, with most of the reserve addition associated with our home equity purchased impaired portfolio.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter first mortgage fundings for the corporation were 87 billion, down 9% from the third quarter or 96 billion, which was reflective of the rate environment. Approximately 42% of these fundings were for home purchases versus approximately 39% in the third quarter. Now we continued to maintain strong market share during the quarter, which we estimate to be in the 23 to 24% range.</p>
          <p>Now given the industry outlook for refinance and purchase transactions indicated by the Mortgage Bankers Association for 2010 volume of 1.3 trillion, about 40% less than last year, we'd expect lower production levels over the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management, and you can see this on slide 13, they earned 1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 1.1 billion from third quarter levels, due mainly to the BlackRock gain and lower provision. Asset management fees and brokerage income were up 75 million due to market valuations, but more importantly increased sales and transactional activity offset by various other items. In addition, there were no charges for supporting the cash funds versus the approximately 135 million of support in the third quarter. As a reminder, Columbia's money market funds no longer have exposure to structured investment vehicles.</p>
          <p>Now provision was down approximately 460 million due to an improved credit outlook for the consumer real estate side in the absence of a large fraud loss in the third quarter. Assets under management ended the quarter at 750 billion, up 10 billion from the end of September, as the improvement in the market and positive flows generated by the advisors were partially offset by continued outflows in the Columbia cash complex. We ended the quarter with over 15,000 financial advisors, up slightly from the end of September, and with improved retention trends throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>Also as you already know, we finalized details on the sale of the long-term asset management business of Columbia to Ameriprise, and that's expected to close in the second quarter this year. Using the low end of the range we disclosed, we believe this will have minimal P&amp;L impact, but we expect to monetize nearly 800 million of goodwill intangibles, thereby improving capital slightly.</p>
          <p>Now Global Banking, and you can see this on slide 14, and remember that this encompasses our Commercial Bank, Corporate Bank, and Investment Bank, had an increase in earnings of 224 million versus the third quarter due mainly to improved Investment Banking income and lower credit costs. Although commercial and corporate clients are being cautious given the economy and loan demand is down, we continue to see improving liquidity in the credit markets with credit spreads and market prices more reflective of the underlying risk.</p>
          <p>Provision expense decreased 12% to 2.1 billion while net charge-offs decreased 18% to 1.4 billion. Now we did continue to add to reserves during the current quarter, 627 million, mainly associated with commercial real estate, slightly higher than the addition in the third quarter. Average loans as reported for the quarter were down 4% from the third quarter as clients continued to aggressively manage working capital and operating capacity levels. In doing so, clients continue to take advantage of the robust bond markets to manage bank debt levels and build cash in anticipation of a stronger economy. As a result, we saw average deposit levels increase 15 billion or almost 7% from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Now investment banking fees across markets and banking were up 746 million, and this is detailed on slide 15, to 2.1 billion before the elimination of self-led deals. The combined Bank of America/Merrill Lynch franchise ranked number two in global and US investment banking fees in 2009.</p>
          <p>Global Markets, and you can see this on slide 16, earned 1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, down almost 1 billion from the third quarter. Lower sales and trading results combined with higher write-downs on legacy assets drove the decrease.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 17, sales and trading revenue in the fourth quarter was 2.2 billion versus 5.3 billion in the third quarter. Now absent the legacy asset charges or on a more business-as-usual basis, we saw 3.3 billion, reflecting the normal seasonal slowdown. Both fixed income and equity income declined although rates in currencies and commodities within fixed income held up well. Lower market volatility, a reduction in risk appetite of customers especially in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, and the normal seasonal slowdown contributed to the decline in revenue. However, we've seen a typical strong start to January on the back of a seasonally slow December.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expense was down 11% from the prior quarter due to lower incentive comp. And we detail on slide 18 a number of the most pertinent legacy exposures in the Capital Markets business, and further detail is provided for you in the supplement. As I noted earlier, the charges we took this quarter were centered in the commercial real estate area. And from a legacy or pre-disruption asset standpoint we remain the most focused on commercial real estate and monoline credit default swaps, as you might imagine.</p>
          <p>Not included in the six business segments is equity investment income of approximately 800 million in the fourth quarter due mainly to improved market valuations. In addition, on a consolidated basis we had security gains for approximately $1 billion, partially offset by impairment charges on non-agency RMBS of approximately 200 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me switch to credit quality, and that starts on slide 20. We told you last quarter that we thought we were close to the peak in total net losses and it appears that that's the case. It feels to us like we're moving from stability to an actual improvement. But obviously given the weak economy, we remain cautious. In the fourth quarter, we saw improvement in almost all categories including delinquencies, excluding our Ginnie Mae repurchases which I'll discuss in a minute, losses, and criticized levels. Consumer credit losses continue to show the flow through an improved early-stage delinquencies earlier in the year in the unsecured lending portfolios and some stabilization in consumer real estate. Commercial portfolios reported lower charge-offs as a result of slower deterioration and slightly improved asset valuations, although commercial real estate will continue to lag the consumer recovery.</p>
          <p>The rate of downward risk migration into criticized loans is clearly slowing. Fourth quarter provision of 10.1 billion exceeded net charge-offs, reflecting the addition of 1.7 billion to the reserve, which was lower than the addition of 2.1 billion in the third quarter. Consumer reserve additions were 1.3 billion. And approximately 800 million related to increasing our reserve coverage on consumer credit card to 12 months. About 550 million was added for card securitization that matured and came on the balance sheet during the quarter. We also added approximately 540 million associated with the Countrywide purchased impaired portfolio. And in consumer real estate loans, we increased reserves by 270 million. These increases were offset by reductions in other products where delinquencies continue to improve.</p>
          <p>Now on the commercial side, we added 560 million for commercial real estate, primarily for non-homebuilder, and reduced reserves in small business by 280 million as credit quality continued to improve, partially due to stricter lending criteria that we implemented earlier in the year. Our allowance for loan and lease losses now stands at 37.2 billion or 4.16% of our loan and lease portfolio. Our reserve for unfunded commitments is 1.5 billion, bringing total reserves to 38.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now I'll give you more details in a minute, but based on an estimated addition of 11 billion in reserves related to the adoption of FAS 166 and 167 effective January 1 of this year, our credit reserve on a pro forma basis would be just under 50 billion, improving our reserve coverage of 4.16% by 60 to 65 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now on a held basis, net charge-offs across almost all of our businesses in the quarter decreased 1.2 billion or 42 basis points from third quarter levels to 3.71% of the portfolio or 8.4 billion. On a managed basis, overall net losses in the quarter decreased 1.6 billion to 11.3 billion. And of the 1.6 billion decrease, the consumer decrease was 77% or about 1.25 billion. Even though loss rates were down this quarter, the loss rates are somewhat distorted by reductions in balances, so that's why I continue to talk in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Credit card represents 54% of total managed consumer losses. And as you can see on slide 22, managed consumer credit card net losses were 4.9 billion compared to 5.5 billion in the third quarter. Losses decreased due to a drop in early-stage delinquencies in the second quarter of '09. If you couple that with the 180 day charge-off policy, you can see what drove the reduction.</p>
          <p>Thirty-plus delinquencies in consumer credit card decreased 541 million, the third consecutive quarterly drop, leading to the reserve actions that I mentioned earlier. Now obviously one quarter doesn't make a trend, but we feel much letter about the loss levels this quarter and that they signal stabilization if not an improvement trend. Now a delayed recovery of the US economy beyond our expectations or unforeseen events could obviously keep pressure on the performance.</p>
          <p>Credit quality in our Consumer Real Estate business appears to have stabilized, giving that home equity charge-offs were down, even excluding one-time items, in the third quarter. Before I get into the individual Consumer Real Estate products, let me remind you of a couple of important drivers, as I have the last couple of quarters. Total consumer NPAs, which are highlighted on slide 23, increased 1.3 billion in the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 1.9 billion in the third quarter and now total 22.3 billion. This is primarily comprised of consumer real estate with the lion's share being first mortgages.</p>
          <p>Now there are a number of things affecting this portfolio, but as a reminder we generally place consumer real estate on non-performing at 90 days past due and take charge-offs at 180 days, at which time we write the loans down to appraised value. We perform quarterly valuation refreshes, taking additional write-downs as needed. We also have troubled debt restructurings, or TDRs, which we explained last quarter. They're reflected as NPAs even though most were not 90 days past due when the restructuring or modification was made.</p>
          <p>Now although our efforts are to responsibly keep borrowers in their homes and paying as we think that reduces the overall cost, the impact is that the NPA number is elevated. However, once a loan has been evaluated under all our various programs, if no other alternatives exist, the loan will be released into foreclosure or charged down.</p>
          <p>Now our residential mortgage portfolio, and I'm on slide 24 now, showed net losses of 1.2 billion or 207 basis points, in line with the third quarter. Thirty-plus delinquencies increased approximately 72 million before the impact from repurchasing delinquent government insured loans from securitizations, and that would be less than we would have seasonally expected. Repurchasing delinquent government insured loans from securitizations added 9.4 billion to the 90-plus day delinquency levels, although they're still insured. We repurchased these loans for economic reasons since we can finance them at a cheaper rate on the balance sheet, and our risk exposure is the same whether with a servicer or holder of these assets since they're insured.</p>
          <p>Now on the non-performing asset front, we saw an increase of 1.2 billion, less than the 2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the third quarter in a row of declining new non-performing loans and higher cures. Of the 17.7 billion of residential mortgage NPAs, TDRs make up 17%. About 60% or 10.7 billion of the NPAs are greater than 180 days past due and have been written down to appraised values, which is considered when we reevaluate our reserve adequacy.</p>
          <p>Now I should also note that we saw continued stabilization in severity and improvement in the average size of charge-offs this quarter. Our reserve levels were slightly increased on this portfolio during the quarter and represent 1.9% of period end balances versus 1.87% in September. Now when we think of dollar loss levels as most likely peaked, given the weakness in the economy and the continued pressure on home prices, we could see further deterioration in this portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now switching specifically to home equity, and I'm back on slide 25, net charge-offs decreased 410 million to 1.6 billion in the fourth quarter. This is the second quarter in a row with decreases after adjusting last quarter for the accelerated charge-offs related to an adjustment to our loss severity due to the protracted nature of collections under some insurance contracts. The drop was a bit greater than we expected, driven by improvement in later stage delinquency performance. So we're a little skeptical that we can hold at this dollar level because prior to December, we would have told you that we didn't expect losses to peak until well into 2010. We'll have to see how this one plays out, but don't be surprised to see it bounce around a little before we see sustained quarter-over-quarter improvement.</p>
          <p>Now 30-plus delinquencies were flat, again better than seasonal expectations. Non-performing assets and home equity, principally loans greater than 90 days past due, were essentially flat at 3.9 billion. 44% of our NPAs were TDRs where we believe we've improved the likelihood of repayment. And just over 80% of the non-performing home equity loan modifications in the fourth quarter of '09 were performing at the time of reclassification into TDRs.</p>
          <p>Now in addition, about 20% or approximately 790 million of the NPAs were greater than 180 days past due and had been written down to appraised values. We increased reserves for this portfolio to 10.2 billion or 6.81% of ending balances, and that's 5.29% excluding the purchased impaired loans due to further deterioration in the purchased impaired portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 26, we provide details on our direct and indirect loans, which includes the auto and other dealer related portfolios as well as consumer lending. Net charge-offs in direct and indirect decreased 11% to 1.3 billion or 5.2% of the portfolio. We saw the expected decrease of about 184 million in consumer lending charge-offs and expect that trend to continue due to the improvements in delinquent amounts.</p>
          <p>Slide 27 shows the details of the purchased impaired Countrywide portfolio, where charge-offs were lower this quarter. Last quarter we added 1.3 billion due to continued deterioration. The addition this quarter of 540 million relates to further deterioration as well as a reassessment of modification benefits as we gain more experience with customers going through the modification process. Now as we did last quarter, we provided more details on the slide for you, so I won't go through that anymore.</p>
          <p>Now in looking forward, I'd say this portfolio's valuation, and remember the purchased impaired portfolio is a life-of-lien reserved portfolio, is most sensitive to HPI [Home Price Index] and our success under the modification programs. We would also expect the lion's share of charge-offs to come through in the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Now switching to our commercial portfolios, and you can see this on slide 30, net charge-offs decreased in the quarter to 2.3 billion or 278 basis points, down in dollar terms about 14% from the third quarter or 7% excluding approximately 190 million in fraud related losses in the third quarter. Net losses in our $18 billion small business portfolio, which are reported as commercial loan losses, decreased 112 million to 684 million compared to increases in the past quarter. Small business losses look to have peaked as indicated by several linked-quarter declines in 30-plus delinquencies as well as 90-plus delinquencies, which are down 11%.</p>
          <p>Now excluding small business, commercial net charge-offs decreased 249 million from the third quarter to 1.6 billion, representing a charge-off ratio of 205 basis points. The losses in the quarter were split 53% non-real estate and 47% real estate.</p>
          <p>Within commercial real estate, net charge-offs decreased 128 million to 745 million, representing a charge-off ratio of 4.15%. Homebuilder losses constituted 37% of commercial real estate losses and were down 26% from the third quarter. Non-homebuilder losses were down 6%, reflecting decreases in multi-family rentals and commercial land, offset somewhat by increases in retail and office. Now we wouldn't expect losses to peak in this portfolio until well into the year, if not near the end of this year. The losses will be a little lumpy and bounce around, so we don't read much into the decline this quarter, especially given the non-homebuilder deterioration.</p>
          <p>Now commercial NPAs, and this is detailed on slide 31, rose 607 million, down 39% from last quarter to 13.5 billion. 84% of the increase was due to commercial real estate, driven by non-homebuilder exposures, mainly retail, commercial, land, multi-family rentals, and multi-use. Homebuilders dropped again this quarter by 7%.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you little color behind the makeup of our commercial NPAs. Commercial real estate makes up about 60% of the balance or about 8.1 billion, with about 3.2 billion or 40% being homebuilders. Outside commercial real estate NPA, balances are concentrated in housing related and consumer dependent portfolios within commercial domestic. The most significant of these industries are commercial services and supplies, and here think realtors, employment agencies, office supplies, et cetera, at 5% of the total commercial NPAs; followed by individuals and trusts at 4% and media at three. No other industry comprised greater than 2%.</p>
          <p>Approximately 90% of the commercial NPAs are collateralized, and approximately 35% are contractually current. Total commercial NPAs are carried at about 75% of original value before considering loan loss reserves.</p>
          <p>Now on a pretty encouraging note, reservable criticized utilized exposure in our commercial book actually decreased 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter compared to an increase of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, and is the first decrease since 2006. This decrease reflected declines in commercial non-real estate, both domestic and foreign, offset somewhat by an increase in real estate. This increase in commercial real estate to 23.8 billion was driven mainly by increases in office, multi-family rentals, and hotels and motels. Now as I mentioned earlier, we added the commercial reserves in the fourth quarter, of which almost all was related to commercial real estate. Total commercial reserve coverage at the end of December increased to 2.96% of loans with real estate coverage being 5.14%.</p>
          <p>Now let's move off credit quality and talk about net interest income, and here I'm on slide 34. Compared to third quarter on a managed and FTE basis, net interest income was up 50 million. Managed core NII increased a little better than expected by approximately 140 million, while market-based NII decreased about 90 million. The core NII increase was driven by several factors, including less of a credit drag, principally due to the improvements we saw in credit card performance, improved hedge results, increased deposit balances, and the lack of a few one-time negative items in the third quarter. Now offsets were lower loan levels and some initial impacts of not repricing for risk in the card book. The core net interest margin on a managed basis increased seven basis points to 3.74%.</p>
          <p>Now in looking forward, remember we took down the discretionary portfolio during 2009 and also experienced pay-downs. Loan demand has been weak and we would expect it to stay that way until business and consumer confidence improve. And as I just mentioned, we've lost some ability to reprice for risk in the card book. These factors would suggest we'll see a decline in core managed net interest income this year from 2009 based on the current forward curve. Now also remember you always get a negative first quarter impact due to fewer days in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now on the positive side, once we see the economy strengthen and rates begin to increase beyond what's in the forwards, we should see less credit drag, strong earning asset growth, and deposit cost benefits. To that point, our interest rate risk position continues to be asset sensitive, as you see from the bubble charts on slide 35, where we benefit as rates rise and are exposed as rates decline. That position is relatively unchanged from how we were positioned at the end of September. Keep in mind these impacts are based off changes to the forward curve and are relative to our base forecast. Now while we remain cautious about the economy, we continue to believe an asset sensitive position makes sense, especially given the low absolute level of rates.</p>
          <p>Now let me say a few things about capital, and you can see this on slide 38. The Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of December was 10.4%, down 206 basis points from the third quarter, due mainly to our repayment of TARP. However, the equity raise associated with the TARP increased Tier 1 common 138 basis points to 7.81%, while our tangible common ratio increased to 5.57%. Now as a reminder, the appreciation above our current carrying value for BlackRock or the China Construction Bank is included in capital.</p>
          <p>Preferred dividends this quarter were 5 billion of which 4.66 billion was associated with TARP, including the negative impact of repayment or 54% per share &#x2013; per quarter given no tax benefit. Excluding TARP, preferred dividends during the quarter were 340 million, which is approximately the level we should experience going forward, and liquidity remains strong.</p>
          <p>Now since we raised significant amounts of equity and were quite active in the debt markets during the second and third quarters, we didn't do any benchmark deals during the fourth quarter. And as of December 31, our time to required funding metric, the amount of time that the parent company can meet its debt obligations without new issuance, was 25 months.</p>
          <p>Unsecured long-term parent company debt maturities in 2010, including those from debt at the legacy Merrill Lynch &amp; Company's holding company, will be approximately 46 billion spread over the course of the year. We'll continue to be opportunistic in assessing the debt markets in 2010, but probably will not match maturities given our funding base and the asset levels.</p>
          <p>Now impacting both capital reserves effective January 1, 2010 will be the adoption of FAS 166 and 167, as I referenced earlier, and I'm on slide 40 now. Now as most of you know, this involves the consolidation of certain assets that are currently carried off the balance sheet. In short, an adjustment will be made to the first quarter to the balance sheet that increases assets and the allowance for loan losses and decreases capital for the allowance increase. Other than geography, there's no impact to the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Currently our best approximation is a net incremental increase in assets of approximately 100 billion. The largest component of this amount is a net increase of 67 billion due to consolidation of the credit card trust, comprised of a $90 billion increase in credit card receivables less securitization assets already on our balance sheet, and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Other components to the increase include 5 billion of home equity receivables and approximately 28 billion from consolidation of other special purpose entities including our multi-seller conduits. Risk weighted assets are currently expected to increase only 14 billion as many of the credit card assets were already included in our calculation.</p>
          <p>Also remember we have a deferred tax asset limitation for Tier 1, so the full reserve charge pretty much hits capital. The additional allowance for loan losses is expected to be approximately 10.7 billion, 10 billion for credit card and 700 million for home equity, while the impact of regulatory capital is expected to be a reduction of approximately 10 billion including the deferred tax limitation.</p>
          <p>Now Tier 1 and Tier 1 common impact is expected to be a reduction of approximately 70 to 75 basis points while the impact to tangible common is expected to be a reduction of approximately 50 basis points. These estimates are on a fully phased in basis. The bank regulators have made optional a phase-in approach but the benefits aren't very big. Now this is a little heavier than we previously indicated due to the change in our credit reserving policy for credit cards that I mentioned earlier and a change in the capital rules affecting our conduits. Now as the credit card loans come back on balance sheet, we're reserving at 12 months which increased the impact of adoption on Tier 1 by I'd say about 15 basis points.</p>
          <p>We can also now drop the held versus managed discussion, and you can see this back on slide seven. The impact of bringing card securitizations on the balance sheet in 2009 would have added 9.3 billion to net interest income, 2.1 billion to non-interest income, and increased provision or charge-offs by about 11.4 billion. Again, the impact nets to zero but the geography changes. And as a reminder, we'll issue 1.7 billion in common stock to associates as part of year-end compensation and 3 billion through the sale of assets which will increase capital.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2010 and in line with my earlier comments and Brian's remarks, we believe we are past the peak in total credit cost, which is great news for us. I believe 2010 will be a tale of two periods, the first being gradual improvement in the economy, and the second being a more significant improvement in consumer and commercial activity. During the first period, we believe we'll see slow but continued improvements in overall credit quality with provision and charge-offs dropping after adjusting for the impact of FAS 166 and 167, but this is obviously dependent on continued improvement in the economy.</p>
          <p>Now even though the economy appears to have stabilized, the ultimate level of credit losses and reserve actions will be dependent on whether the stabilization is sustained as well as the duration of the credit cycle. But as Brian mentioned, assuming future economic performance is consistent with our outlook, we do believe significant reserve additions are over. However, certain segments in the commercial area are still deteriorating and probably won't stabilize and turn until late in the year at best.</p>
          <p>Now there will probably be continued reserve additions for at least six months in commercial real estate and some lingering reserve additions in residential real estate. Revenue levels at best will be volatile as the headwinds of a shrinking loan portfolio, the CARD [Credit card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure] Act, Reg E, and higher mortgage rates. More specifically, the CARD Act, will manifest itself throughout the year in net interest income as the act impacts our ability to risk base reprice credit cards and in card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. Overall after mitigation strategies, we still believe the impact will be some 800 million after tax related to consumer credit card in the US. We felt a little of this in the fourth quarter but it will ramp up in 2010.</p>
          <p>Likewise, we believe Reg E will impact service charges starting in the middle of the third quarter of 2010 for changes beyond those we instituted in 2009. We're still sizing the impact net of mitigation and how we'll think customers will behave, and consequently we'll provide more guidance in the future.</p>
          <p>Offsetting these headwinds should be lower provision, expense control, and potential growth in other businesses like investment brokerage services, investment banking, trading, and commercial banking. But again, this is heavily dependent on market recovery.</p>
          <p>Whatever the scenario, we believe we're in position quite well to take advantage of whatever the global economy offers. Now much of our performance will correlate with the domestic economy but will also be influenced by the global economy.</p>
          <p>With that, let me open it up for questions and I thank you for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. So the deposits have been pretty good, all things considered. Can you give us a little clue on what you're doing on the asset side as there is obviously limited loan demand and your capital and liquidity ratios are pretty good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn, obviously the asset side is correlated to the economy, and so you're correct. We're seeing a downdraft clearly because just of charge-offs in one matter. But loan demand is still weak. We are beginning to see, quite frankly in some of the commercial regions, a little pickup in the pipelines, but I'd call it little and early but you're beginning to see a little bit of that. The consumer businesses continue to have decreases and probably will again until you see a little more consumer confidence come around. It leaves us with the discretionary portfolio, and we did add to the discretionary portfolio through securities this quarter some, but we've got to remain reasonably cautious about where the curve is at this time. And so you did see some of that come in. But we'll be very measured as we do that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think, Glenn, the simple way to think about it is as the economy continues to improve, you'll see better fundamental loan demand, and the issue before that is we are going to reflect the economy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll add some and we did in this quarter. We added some with longer duration mortgage-based stuff, but we also added some shorter duration. But if you think about the prepayments occurring in the mortgage book and the other longer duration assets that are going off, so we have some ability to replace some of that without giving us too much OCI risk, if you want to think of it that way.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned before, given the liquidity base and given the asset side of the balance sheet, don't expect us to replace maturities completely now. We need to stay active and we will stay active, and there are some attractiveness to the rate environment, et cetera, from that standpoint. But the way you should look at it is if you go back to my remarks, you'll see we gave the actual numbers of what's coming due. We'll continue to let some of that drift down as opposed to full replacement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then I don't know if there's much you can say in the prepared remarks. You told us that the <mark type="inaudible" /> charge was a little higher, but there seems to be a mounting concern that those numbers start to add up. Is there any help that you can give us in terms of sizing the amount of claims against you from the various counterparties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously I don't want to go into the details on specific clients or customers or insurers from that standpoint. But think of it as, and we have gone through this not recently but some of the earlier days right after the acquisition of Countrywide, there are several buckets. There are claims that come back from the GSEs. There are claims that come back from purchasers of loans; think of that as private transaction. And there are monoline wrap things.</p>
          <p>We continue to work each of those based on the claims that are presented. I'd be disingenuous if I didn't say people were throwing everything over the wall they can because they are in a view of trying to get something back. But look, this is a loan-by-loan detailed review of the facts and circumstances, whether it's curable, whether the loan has been performing for an extended period, all the practices and those things, and we reserve for it on a FAS 5 basis. Think of it as quarterly we book in the hundreds of millions dollar number, which is I think I've mentioned before netted against the production income. We'll continue to do that. But look, this is not a quick process. This is a multiyear extended process looking at individual credits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that answer. As you go through it and as you start to have some experience on where replacements are needed versus cases you win, does that give you a good enough window into the future to be boosting reserves other than what the current billing is? In other words, you don't disclose to us what the size of say the past originations and sales in question are or the reserves are. But people basically want to get a feel from you of whether or not you feel you're well enough reserved or if this is going to be a persisting and mounting issue over the coming eight quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think the way to think about it is Countrywide had a reserve. We adjusted that in purchase accounting. We've been adding to it quarterly or dealing with it quarterly with the expenses each quarter since then, and we'll continue to manage it that way. Yes, we do get more experience every quarter as we go through the individual loans. Remember though that we've had some pretty tough consumer real estate portfolios that have been wrapped by insurers. We exited a business back in '01 that we went through some of the same kind of exercises with. So the same team that has done that, those workouts, which I might add continue today from back then, and that's what I was talking about, the protracted nature of how this process works, or the ones on it.</p>
          <p>And so we do have quite a bit of experience in how to estimate on a FAS 5 basis. I'd only characterize the reserve that we are carrying is in the billions, so we feel pretty good about where we stand. But look, we'll continue to get claims and we'll continue to work through it and it doesn't go away overnight.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess first on the credit side, Joe, you provided a lot of comments regarding specific loan buckets. It seems like some are trending up still. A number aren't <mark type="inaudible" /> here. But as we think about total charge-off on a managed basis heading into 1Q, do we get a little tick up overall and then start to trend down from there, or how should we think about the managed charge-offs quarter to quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, I must tell you, you've got to go back and think product by product because, as I mentioned before, commercial real estate, especially non-homebuilder, will be somewhat lumpy and episodic. Other components of the commercial side, especially small business, feels like it's on a downward trajectory. Core domestic, as you saw reservable criticized drop is an indicator that things feel more stable in that side. But obviously they're economic dependent.</p>
          <p>On the consumer side, again I'd tell you to go back and look by product. Card, we saw a pretty good change. We've seen probably a little more drop in delinquencies but not quite at the same pace of the drop earlier. So that ought to factor into your thinking. And then on real estate, we feel pretty good about the levels that we're experiencing. But as I said in the comments, home equity is probably doing a little better than we might have expected, so it wouldn't surprise us to see that bounce around. And then the foreclosure market or the houses coming on the marketplace potentially have an effect, although we feel we've got that as considered as we could given the knowledge that we've got.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've said that they remain elevated. I think you have to be careful about the speed at which the recovery works through the portfolio in terms of quarter-to-quarter linkage. But the overall balances in the most troubled portfolios that come down and the overall progress the teams have made in collections efforts is better. So you just keep that in balance because the underlying economy is still not healed and unemployment is still high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then, Brian, a bigger picture question for you. We've seen you make a couple of changes to the senior management team. But as we think about the core businesses, any meaningful changes or deeper dives that you're taking now in terms of the products, the way that you deliver to customers, or even the customers that you're targeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The business model is sound. In other words, the core customer basis on the consumer side, whether mass market consumers and high net worth and affluent consumers and then the small business, medium businesses, large business, and then the investor community. That business model is sound, intermediating for our corporate clients to the investors, so don't look for us to make any changes. We've got a couple dispositions we have to make. But in terms of the core business model, it's sound. It operates. The market shares are there. Just taking this massive customer base and taking the product capabilities and putting them together in better and better ways and driving it, whether it's a company or whether it's individual, so don't look for any major changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess as a follow-up, in terms of the size of the balance sheet, given that you're adding some securities here, it seems like you're comfortable with the overall size plus or minus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it will bounce around. We talk about &#x2013; across our large balance sheet, we're talking about relatively minor adjustments, and then it will bounce around. There's no need to grow &#x2013; we have enough room to grow the core loans when they start to grow and within the size for a while just based on where we are. But don't expect it to bounce around, to move dramatically either way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A quick question on capital ratios; given the changes you outlined with regard to 166 and 167, and then you obviously indicated continuing to build capital ratios with the common stock issuance and the $3 billion asset sale, that still seems like it's going to bring us a little bit short of the 8.5% Tier 1 common ratio that you talked about when you did your equity offering. Have you had any follow-up discussions with the regulators as to where capital ratios need to get in 2010 in light of your new outlook on 166 and 167? And should we think of the capital actions that you've outlined for 2010 as all that's required or could there be more that's required?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we don't talk specifically about conversations with regulators, or can't. So think of it more as the way we look at the company and we manage. We're pretty much in line with our expectations of capital now. Clearly when we made the decision here in closing the books to change the reserve level coverage for card, that had an impact on the &#x2013; compared to the pro forma that we would have showed you that was purely based on 9/30.</p>
          <p>The outlook on capital, you've got a lot of things coming at you. You've got the market risk rules. You've got the Basel II pieces. You've got I call it the December 17 proposals, a lot to work through over time. In the near term, we think all of those are manageable and considered in the way we look at capital and how we came up with what we felt comfortable with in the raise from that standpoint, obviously supplemented by these few things still to get executed. So no, at this point, no major contemplation of any other actions other than those unless something falls out, as Brian said, as we look at the aggregate company for things from that standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So until we see some kind of additional clarity from regulators on capital ratios, you wouldn't expect any additional actions other than the things you've already outlined?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, a couple of questions. One is on the rescission loans that was discussed a little bit earlier. Could I just understand how you think about what kind of NPL should fall out of these loans that you're buying? Are these all going to NPLs? Are the roll rates 100% to NPLs, or what kind of experience have you had? And to what degree are you reserving for these as you buy them versus as they perform relative to expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about the insured loans that I referenced in the delinquency numbers, Betsy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, think of those as government insured, so they are performing past due, not non-performing past due. So what I was trying to do is, if you pull our delinquency stats or if you look at them, you'll see a pretty big jump in the 30 and 90 and first mortgage past due performing. And I didn't want you to get misled by that, so I was simply explaining what that was. So those are insured, so they would in theory not carry a reserve. I mean we obviously, when you look at our reserve coverage numbers there in the loans, and so they kind of I guess in essence distort that a tad. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not that big.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, because you expect the insurance to pay?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right, and then on the loans that you're buying from private investors et cetera that might not be wrapped, I mean same kind of question. Are you reserving point in time of purchase? Are you reserving as they perform relative to your expectations? Just give us some sense on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you mean basically a rep and warranty question...</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Few and far between; if you think about the hierarchy of reps and warranties, think of them as probably would be in the &#x2013; quite frankly they're probably the clearest, and GSEs &#x2013; monolines are next. And then in private sales, the reps and warranties generally by this time are somewhat unenforceable, not from a data standpoint but just from a lack of time and they've run out. So I wouldn't put that one on your radar screen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then you discussed the coming capital actions which will add to common Tier 1 like the issuance of stock and the asset sales that you're anticipating as well as warrants, right? I think there are some warrants outstanding that are in the money. Could you give us some sense as to whether or not that's going to be action that you take this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The warrants here, you're talking about the ones associated with TARP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, those are warrants that I think we said in a press release when we did the TARP announcement and the payback that we would not intend to repurchase those. So those presumably would be sold by the government when they're ready to do that. We have certain registration activities we have to go through to help them do that, but they'll do that at their own call. And then you wouldn't see a capital impact of that obviously until those were either exercised or some kind of occurrence by whoever ultimately holds those.</p>
          <p>The other asset sales clearly that we have committed to increase capital by $3 billion, that process we're underway in a review consistent with what we've talked about before to identify the appropriate either businesses and/or discretionary assets to make that claim. So those are the real two big things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the simple thing on the government warrants is it won't be any capital hit to us because they'll be in somebody else's hands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, some of it's in the money so I'm just surprised that you haven't &#x2013; the actions haven't started yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean the Treasury hasn't sold them per se. Once they sell them, they're in the money if somebody wants to exercise them. In other words, it won't be triggered by us I guess is the point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I understand that. Brian, could you just give us a sense of how you are going to be managing your team? What are the marching orders that you're going to be delivering to your group? Is it more top line, bottom line, market share, net new business? Could you give us a sense of your priorities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look across the businesses, they have different priorities. Obviously in Sallie and Tom's area, the top line is there to get and they've got to drive at that, and so they're going to drive more of a top line driven with expenses matching and on a rational basis.</p>
          <p>If you look on the consumer side, Joe and Barbara and the teams below them, having worked over there, that's more matching. Really we're so big in the consumer business so the revenue growth will be measured and matching a good expense management capability against that and really dealing with, in both card and deposits, the changes and trying to figure out ways to recover some of those changes either through deposit pricing or other ways.</p>
          <p>So the challenges are different, but the way I'm going to drive the team is consistent. We'll recognize the opportunities and challenges and drive the businesses, these six or seven major businesses and customer groups along differentiated lines and carefully driven. But we as a company will be grinding through, because of our size, revenue that will not outdistance the economy by a lot just because we're so big, and we've got to be realistic about it. That means managing expenses in businesses that <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. Brian, last year Ken Lewis talked about a pre-tax, pre-provision number of around $45 billion for 2009, which you basically came in that 45 &#x2013; $50 billion number, and we know it's very volatile. But can you give us any guidance of where you think that number is going to shake out in 2010? And does it change now that you bring on the managed credit card portfolio, and how much does it change by?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd give you the guidance of what we see in the fourth quarter, which is on the fourth or fifth page in here, but we're not going to give guidance about that for 2010. And I think the question of whether your view or other analysts' view of how you included the managed versus non-managed presentation, I think that something will shake out here. So Lee and Kevin and I think some others will make sure people see how the 167, et cetera, comes through. But I think all of you should make sure we understand that because there is a major difference in the card business contribution on a <mark type="inaudible" /> card basis that way.</p>
          <p>Overall frankly though in the card business, remember that we'll bring over time and periods of time, that charge will come down. That business will always have a &#x2013; it's big and a charge-off rate that approaches what would be a normal environment, but there will still be &#x2013; you can't discount that there will always be a relatively large dollar amount of charge-offs even in good times going through that business just because of the nature of it.</p>
          <p>So I think that with your sophistication as you look at this, you'll bring the managed in and then you'll figure out a normalized basis. Long answer to say we won't put that on the table for 2010 but clarity on guidance will help manage what we give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then can you just really touch base real quick on your cash position? You were at about $120 billion. It's something a lot of people are looking at and hoping you can bring this back into the portfolio at some point and get a decent spread on. Or is it something that the regulators &#x2013; I know you don't want to talk about regulators per se, but you saw the Basel accords, the Basel white paper I guess that talked about that banks should hold a lot higher liquidity. Is that something you're preparing for with this $120 billion of cash or plus? Or do you think you can bring that back in and deploy that on the portfolio at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think we probably don't think of it just as cash because we think of it more as how do you manage the liquidity. And the liquidity can be redeployment into highly liquid repo-able securities that have withstood these kind of downturns. So there's an opportunity to manage it from that standpoint.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we've done though here recently, clearly the payoff of TARP net of the equity raise was a use of cash. But we also see wholesale funding come down as retail deposits have gone up. We've let the debt footprint run off a little bit, and we have redeployed some, as I referenced earlier, in securities. But clearly the balance sheet is not the way it was at one time if you look at all the combined entities.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I'd probably say I don't focus again as much on the individual line item as I do the overall liquidity. You are correct that the world has changed, and I don't think people are going to run &#x2013; anyone is going to run the kind of liquidity levels you saw before the disruption, so we will have "elevated liquidity," but don't think of it as having to stay in cash is probably the best way to think about it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was going to ask you guys about your loan modification experience and recidivism rates. I see in your non-performing asset activity, there's a large increase in the return to performing status in your consumer loans that went from 1 billion to roughly 2.2 billion. Can you talk about what drove that number, the large increase of return to performing status and your experience with low mod and recidivism rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we tried to give you &#x2013; and this wouldn't be all loan mods by any means &#x2013; but we tried to give you the TDR numbers when, if you look in that slide package of both home equity and first mortgage, we tried to give you the experience of what is paying to modified terms so you can actually see that. Actually we feel pretty good about it, and think of those as having to be six months of performance either leading up to the modification size, they would have been current leading into it, or if they are put in non-performing at modification having to &#x2013; or had been on non-performing they'll have to have six months of performance before they actually go. So think of the stats that I gave you in those two slides as being indicative of our view of a big subset being the TDRs.</p>
          <p>And then I think on an overall basis, we would say that the modifications done over the last few quarters probably will have better reperformance than those done early on because the early-on ones, especially let's call it early on in '08, may not have had quite the level of borrower relief embedded in them, so I think it will get better over time is the way we're looking at it.</p>

          <p>Mike, without giving specific percentages because it's going to be different in middle markets, but the point is that commercial clients are drawing at the lowest levels we've seen in a long time because they just don't have the demand and that's something that has stabilized, but that's where they sit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>They have the capacity to borrow, assuming on the borrowing restriction they may have to build inventory receivables and stuff to actually get the capacity, but the structure is there for them to borrow if they had the demand.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>I think they are looking at the economy. When we talk to them, they're looking at the economy the same way we are, saying it feels better but until I see some fundamental demand build up, I'm not going to hire or build up inventories in expectation of sales.</p>
          <p>Now the inter &#x2013; the global companies are a little bit better because the international piece is a little stronger, but they're just cautious. They're cautious on employment levels and they've done a very, very good job as a group to get themselves underneath this economy and they're not going to blow it now, so they're being very cautious.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the big picture question, Brian, since it's the first call since you were CEO, there are a couple questions that went in this direction, but when I think of Hugh McColl in the '90s, he wanted to build the biggest bank in America. That was his goal. When I think of Ken Lewis the last decade, he wanted to create one of the most optimized banks and the most efficient banks. As we think about what you want to achieve in a big picture sense, are you able to articulate really what you want to achieve or will that take some more time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think from a broad basis, the mission will be to be the best financial services firm in the world and balance between the goals of Hugh and Ken and others, which is we've got to make sure that we really do a great job with the consumers and customers and clients overall and the consumers right now. That's a little difficult because of the economy, but balance between the customers and the associates and the shareholders. So it's not a different thing; it's just that we are at a point where we don't have to think about do we need a product or service. We're just at a point that we have to execute. And I know that sounds simple to say. It's hard to do, but it is absolutely critical and we'll generate a lot of cash out of this franchise as the economy recovers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last follow-up, the balance between customers, associates, and shareholders, is that balance changing? Is it changing so much, it might hurt your ability to compete? You might add a fourth category, the government and the regulators too. How is that balance changing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you think about the industry, we are adjusting to the &#x2013; Mike, as you know, the rating changes and the CARD Act. And so as those questions come in, we have to figure out and our job as management's to figure out is how we're going to get you a good return on your capital and your investment given those challenges. We have very bright people. We have very good franchises, a great customer base. It's not going to be an insurmountable hurdle, but the rules have changed and we've got to take that into account. But the belief, Matt is that I think that customer behaviors change and the impact on some of the things we did over the last ten years on the customer didn't come out the way they did in tougher economic times, and we have to reconfigure them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What are your opportunities for expense leverage in 2010 and beyond? And Joe, is the fourth quarter expense a good run rate for 2010, and could you remind us what kind of cost savings you might have incrementally from that run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Think about the &#x2013; I think I mentioned that we had some heavy litigation costs. Remember in the third quarter we had the wrap costs to exit the proposed wrap, so that's one item that's floating in there. You also have some continued leverage coming out of the acquisitions. But quite frankly, we got more this year out of Merrill Lynch's expense base than we might have anticipated. And until the "systems changes" come in which would be &#x2013; think of them as later next year rather than earlier, you may be at a run rate here for a few quarters on expense saves that doesn't take another leg up until a little bit later into next year.</p>
          <p>You also &#x2013; obviously you have let's call it revenue driven expense items, so Tom's business and others that were down this quarter would have had a lower expense component compared to that. It goes back to Brian's point about how we're managing those businesses and which ones we're pushing. But those are all the dynamics working on us. Obviously remember Q1 always has this weird animal with FAS 123-R that levels out, but that will be elevated with a larger Markets platform this year, this year being 2010, things of that nature. So that's the backdrop you're working under.</p>
          <p>I think to the point of the individual businesses, if you go back to Brian's comments about how he's managing the company, clearly on some of the businesses there, we'll be looking for very tight expense control given the dynamics of the revenue side. Others hopefully will drive revenue up that will have expense growth associated with it from that standpoint. So I think that you've got a reasonable base if you take those things into consideration to work with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I apologize if you mentioned it. Do you have any color on the comp ratio in the Investment Bank in the fourth quarter and any impact from changes in the mix of compensation between cash and stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should think of us as migrating towards the Bank of America policy, which traditionally would have had a heavier deferred component than maybe the Merrill one at certain times in their history. Think of the add-on this year. Although it's all expensed in the current year for the TARP repayment contribution by the associates being 1.7 billion, that would be an added on top of your normal comp payout deferred portion versus current. Now they're entitled to that stock day one, so you get to expense it, but you can't transfer it until later from that standpoint. So that would be the way to think about the mix.</p>
          <p>In terms of the ratios, we don't give the specific ratios for just the Markets business. You can look at Tom's individual business line, but you've got to remember part of the Investment Bank was in the Banking group, et cetera, but we don't give the specifics for that particular unit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then last follow-up, Joe, a quick review of the puts and takes on your margin outlook. What are the sources of incremental downside pressure you mentioned going into '10? And don't you have some offset from maybe a relief of interest reversals as we get out further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually had this quarter &#x2013; that was one of the items that drove us to a little better than expected performance this quarter in the margin. I'd say the credit drag on the margin dropped by about 1.5 billion. Think of it as closer to 1 billion this quarter and it was about 1.150 billion. I'm rounding but generally speaking. That will continue to abate as credit quality gets better, although you may have seen, as I mentioned just talking about charge-offs, you may have seen a bigger improvement in card last quarter if you just track delinquencies than you might see here going forward at least in the near term. But that will be a positive. We have lower loan levels flat out, and then some of those are in your higher margin levels. We have a lower discretionary book year over year again as opposed to linked quarter. That will have a drag on us. And then the repricing of risk in the card book will be something we have to manage through.</p>
          <p>On the other side though, clearly as we move into a higher rate environment, you see the benefit of our deposit base flip from stability, which is how you see it today, to lower funding cost coming out of this thing, so that's a positive clearly as the economy begins to recover. You get the loan growth back and all those other factors and we'll be able to reassess the discretionary side also as we come into more strength in the economy.</p>

          <p>We'll take our final question from the site with Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. If you could give a little more color about how the actions that you've taken in terms of loan modifications and other forbearance have affected charge-offs now and how you think that pattern might be reflected in the next couple of quarters, and how we should think about that with respect to the reserve over the first half or several quarters of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think on the charge-off side, modifications, as I referenced earlier, Moshe, you've got to have performance, subsequent performance to keep them from continuing to deteriorate from a delinquency standpoint. And so I would say the only effects they've had on actual charge-offs are where we've had actual performance that kept them out of those buckets that would roll into the charge-off delinquency status. It's hard to theorize on had we not made the modification, exactly how many would or wouldn't have gone. So that's a difficult thing to view.</p>
          <p>From a reserving standpoint, you're correct. You can think about it more. You saw the action we took on the impaired portfolio. Part of the charges this quarter was a reassessment as we've gotten more familiar with customer behavior; i.e., how many customers actually take the modification, how many of them flush the gamers through the system, get to the real people that need them, et cetera, so that's one of the reasons you saw us take reserve action there. We're probably carrying a little more reserve in a couple of the other consumer real estate products in anticipation of continued some level of redefault in our projections and things like that. So that's the conceptual way but I don't have any numbers to put around it for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it seems reasonable that &#x2013; I don't want to say excess reserves but that the reserves have certainly at least built in for that activity. And to the extent it isn't worse, then there should be at worst adequate reserves and potentially some excess to be recovered.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
