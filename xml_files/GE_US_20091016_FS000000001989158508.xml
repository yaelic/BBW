        <plist>
          <p>Great, Trevor, thanks, good morning everyone. Just going to the first page on the overview, I think GE had another solid quarter. The global environment is improving, but we're expecting a gradual recovery. For the quarter, we earned $2.5 billion, $0.22 per share, down 51%, really driven by Capital Finance. I think the good news is the Industrial segment profit was up 4%. Infrastructure, Media, and C&amp;I all had positive earnings. Capital Finance was positive at $263 million, down 87%, basically driven by a favorable tax credit as expected. We had aggressive cost out. We had another $0.05 per share of restructuring and other charges in Q3.</p>
          <p>I think particularly noteworthy was solid execution in the quarter. We had cash flow of 4.4 billion. Our year-to-date CFOA [Cash Flow from Operating Activities] is now 11.5 billion, up 1%. And we're positioned for greater than $15 billion of Industrial sales for the year. We've got lots of cash on the balance sheet. We had really substantial margin expansion, up 260 basis points. Our infrastructure orders declined by 18%, but backlog increased, and we had good orders growth sequentially. Capital Finance reserves continued to expand in the quarter, and we're still investing in the long term. Our R&amp;D spend is tracking to be higher in '09 versus '08. We did several small acquisitions and we continue to invest in the long-term growth of the company.</p>
          <p>The environment has definitely improved in the third quarter. We had a couple factors as we ended the year, a dramatic financial crisis. That's definitely better. The credit markets are improving. Pricing on new lending is attractive, but losses still remain high; and Keith will go through that in a bit here.</p>
          <p>We expected a difficult recession. I think that has really bottomed. We see signs of life; the appliance market improving sequentially, orders strengthening, scatter pricing at NBC better. Delinquencies are leveling off, but there's still a lot of excess capacity and we're going to deal with high unemployment. And there is global growth; the emerging markets remain relatively strong and there's growth out there to be had, so the environment definitely improved in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Earlier in the year, we set out on some key priorities to execute as we went through this recession. The first one was to stabilize Capital Finance. We think our funding is well ahead of plan. Our capital ratios are improving. We've got good margins, and we're going to work through a difficult real estate cycle. All the other businesses in GE Capital are profitable except for real estate, and that's the one we're really going to have to work through.</p>
          <p>We wanted to outperform in a tough economy by focusing on backlog and services, getting global market share, expanding margins, and that's really performing as expected. We wanted to strengthen the balance sheet through strong cash generation and to maximize financial flexibility, and we'd say that's much improved versus where we were in previous this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to GE Capital, we really have made significant progress to make GE Capital safe and secure. We've shown this chart to you on a repetitive basis this year. On long-term debt funding, we basically have pre-funded almost all of 2010. We feel great about that. Our commercial paper at GECS is really at our goal of $50 billion.</p>
          <p>Our leverage continues to decline. In the fourth quarter of '08, we were at 7.7-to-1 leverage. We're now at 5.7-to-1. All of our ratios have improved. Our Tier 1 common ratio is now at 7.5%. And importantly, the equity at GECS has increased to $71 billion. And we've been able to shrink GE Capital ahead of plan. We now are putting out there an even more reduced balance sheet plan for the fourth quarter. This has a negative impact on GE Capital revenue, but we think it's really consistent with our strategy and approach, so strong execution through the crisis ahead of plan on all metrics.</p>
          <p>Looking at the Industrial side, I think some good news in that our backlog grew by $5 billion in the third quarter. If you look at equipment, our orders improved about $700 million sequentially quarter over quarter. Our service orders were up 3%, driven by strength in energy with Smart Grid. And our backlog in services grew by $5 billion. We think that the trend on orders, particularly equipment orders, will be up sequentially year over year &#x2013; or up sequentially from the third quarter again in the fourth quarter when we look at our backlog and what's in our funnel. So, we really do look at the second quarter as potentially the low spot on equipment orders. And keep in mind that these results don't include some big commitments we received in energy in Kuwait and in aircraft engines with American Airlines. So, I think when you look at the total backlog of $174 billion, that should give our investors, I think, some comfort in terms of the visibility we've got for the future.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on Industrial revenues. Last December, we set out some key initiatives and key priorities as we went through this year. The first one is to protect backlog, and really the backlog is up $4 billion versus the beginning of the year. Cancellations remain extremely low, and again, we think this is a great job done by our Commercial teams.</p>
          <p>We wanted to focus on growth in emerging markets, and this shows you some of the progress we're making in China, India, Eastern Europe. We're winning big orders in the Middle East, and we continue to think that emerging markets represent real strength for the company going forward.</p>
          <p>We're launching more new products in 2009. Our R&amp;D spend is up. We feel good about our share position overall. We're extending product lines. We've got big initiatives in healthcare and clean energy. We've got some new product launches that are gaining hold and growing our adjacencies. So, this continues to be a big focus.</p>
          <p>And the stimulus really hasn't shown up yet. We expect to ramp up in the fourth quarter in 2010. You'll see in the fourth quarter some wind commitments coming out of the stimulus. We have more orders in the funnel on Smart Grid. Healthcare IT we expect to pick up in Q4 and some big global rail projects that are funded by other governments we're quite encouraged about as well.</p>
          <p>I think importantly, the Services model remains intact. The service revenue is solid. The backlog of CSAs [Customized Service Agreements] continues to grow. Our margins continue to expand. We had nine new aviation CSAs in the quarter. Healthcare is growing the service business in China and India. Our Oil &amp; Gas service backlog has grown, and even in transportation, we're seeing some of the segments have some upward trends. So total backlog is at $174 billion; it's a record high. We've got good visibility on those backlog orders, and we feel good about how we're positioned.</p>
          <p>We continue to execute well in 2009 and we think we're well positioned for-2010. Our margins grew by 260 basis points in the quarter up to 16.3%, and they grew across all the major segments. We had contribution margin rate expansion, a positive value gap of price versus cost. Service margins expanded. And keep in mind that we did have a 100 basis point expansion &#x2013; I know I'm repeating -with the Olympics. But even without that, this was excellent performance by the teams and we're on track for growth for the year.</p>
          <p>We continue to reduce base cost throughout the year. We've done significant restructuring to date, and our third quarter base costs were down 10%, and we've got more ideas for restructuring. We've got a funnel of about $2 billion plus on ideas, all with a two-year payback. We announced some in the third quarter in lighting and transportation. We've got another 700 million being reviewed for potential fourth-quarter and 2010 execution. So we think this gives us some good momentum going into 2010.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Industrial cash flow is a big highlight for the company in the quarter. We generated $4.4 billion of industrial CFOA in the quarter. It puts us up 1% in Industrial CFOA year-to-date. This strong focus that we've had on working capital is really working throughout the company, so we feel great about that.</p>
          <p>Just in terms of where we stand, we've got consolidated cash of $61 billion on the balance sheet right now. And importantly, I think when you look at our quarterly CFOA less the reduced dividend, it allows us to grow the cash at the parent substantially quarter after quarter after quarter, which we think is quite appealing for the company as we go forward. So CFOA is on track for greater than $15 billion for the year. I think last December, we said we'd be between 14 and $16 billion. We think this really speaks well for the execution of the team and positions us well for the future.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Keith to go through the third quarter performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff, good morning everyone. I'd like to start with a summary of the third quarter. On the left side is the summary for continuing operations. Revenues of 37.8 billion were down 20%. That's as we expected.</p>
          <p>Industrial sales of 25.1 billion were down 13. You saw in the press release, organic growth was &#x2013; in Industrial was down nine. Financial Services revenue at 12.7 billion, down 30; I'll explain more of that when I get to the Financial Services page. We earned $2.5 billion in net income, which was down 45%. And for earnings per share, we earned $0.22. That does include the cost of our preferred dividend. As Jeff covered, total cash flow from operating activities was $11.5 billion, which was a great result through the three quarters.</p>
          <p>And, in terms of taxes, I'll separate this between the GE and the GE Capital rates. The GE rate for the quarter at 22%, it's down about six points over last year due to higher global benefits from our lower-taxed European operations industrially. Year to date, the GE rate is 26%. That's somewhat above our current estimate of a GE tax rate of a low- to mid-20s for the year, so we would expect a lower GE rate in the fourth quarter to bring the total year down to that level.</p>
          <p>For GE Capital, because there's a large tax benefit and a pre-tax loss, this is a negative divided by a negative. We have a high positive rate for the quarter. The larger tax benefit in the quarter is mainly due to lower pre-tax income. If you look year-over-year, GEC'S pre-tax income is down 2.6 billion; and at a regular tax rate, that's 900 million of lower taxes, which more than explains the change in the rate in the quarter. The credit in GE Capital drives the consolidated rate to a negative 7% third quarter year-to-date.</p>
          <p>On the right side, you can see the segment results. Our infrastructure businesses had 3.3 billion of segment profit, which was flat with last year. NBCU segment profit was up 13%. I'll explain the benefits from the A&amp;E transaction on the next page. GE Capital Finance earned 263 million, including the favorable tax credits. And C&amp;I had a nice quarter, 117 million of segment profit, more than double last year. Overall segment profit was down 26%, and the difference reflects the restructuring completed in the quarter between the 26% and the 45% in earnings.</p>
          <p>So let me go into the details of the businesses in a few pages, but before I get into the businesses, I'll just cover some of the third-quarter items that impacted our results. First, we had $0.05 of restructuring and other charges that were recorded in corporate. We continue to invest in lowering our cost structure, and the pre-tax charges were aligned by business as follows. It's not on the page. I'll just give you some of the numbers. Tech infrastructure was 234 million of lower cost programs; C&amp;I, 161 million, continued restructuring, a lot of work on reducing our incandescent footprint. Energy infrastructure, 77 million; Capital Finance, 57 million; and the balance was in corporate.</p>
          <p>The second items, we had $0.06 of marks, after-tax marks and impairments in GE Capital. If you look at the details of the largest items, we had $0.02 of impairments in our commercial real estate business. We had $0.01 in GECAS [General Electric Commercial Aviation Services] in our annual valuation review. We had $0.01 for additional FGIC [Financial Guaranty Insurance Company] write-offs, where basically the FGIC investments are down to somewhere around $15 million now. And we had $0.01 in treasury ineffectiveness in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And then finally in NBCU, we had some pluses and minuses in NBCU. First, we did realize a gain from the sale of a little more than a third of our ownership stake in A&amp;E. A&amp;E, as you know, combined with Lifetime in the quarter, and that gain was 283 million after tax at the GE level. That was partially offset by a write-down of: first, NBC's stake in ND TV, which is an Indian entertainment investment. We also had our share of an impairment on the value of The Weather Channel, plus we had some programming asset write-downs. The net impact of those items was 89 million positive after tax included in the NBC segment results. That's a penny positive on a net of the four items.</p>
          <p>Year to date through Q3, we've executed $1.9 billion of restructuring, as I just said, and we continue to reduce our cost structure going forward.</p>
          <p>Let's start with a few pages on Capital Finance. Mike Neal and the team continue to execute well in a very challenging environment. For Q3, the revenues at 12.2 billion were down 30%. That's driven by our assets being down $70 billion year over year. It's also driven by the impact from deconsolidating Penske, which was about six points of revenue decline in the quarter. And we also had lower revenues because we have lower gains, principally in real estate and also from lower interest rates with our floating rate book.</p>
          <p>Capital Finance earned 263 million. That was down 87%, driven by the higher credit costs. I'll cover that in more detail, lower gains, and the impact of again shrinking the business.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start on the right side and then I'll cover the businesses. Our most recent update was July 28. And from that meeting, a few of the key categories of items we covered, first funding. Our funding is in even better shape. Jeff showed you we've now completed about 90% of our pre-funding for 2010, which is great to have done. We need to do less than $5 billion for the remainder of this year. And when you look at the profile going forward right now and if you go back to the July schedules, we're only planning on doing $20 billion of long-term debt in all of 2010. So the funding is in great shape.</p>
          <p>Originations continue to be attractive. We underwrote $7 billion of commercial volume in the third quarter at about a 3.3 return on investment, so that continues to remain very positive. Losses, third quarter year-to-date losses and impairments are 9.3 billion. And if you just annualize that rate, they would be about 12.3 billion or about 700 million lower than the Fed base case we presented in March. I'll cover real estate in a separate page.</p>
          <p>We increased loss reserves, 757 million in the quarter, and our coverage is up over 2%. And we continue to be ahead of our plan on all the cost-out metrics. We started the year, as you know, with a target of over $2 billion, and we're tracking close to $3.7 billion for the total year for costs out.</p>
          <p>So if a few comments about the businesses on the left side. First, our Consumer business delivered 434 million in net income. That's down 45%. That's driven by the higher credit costs. A few of the pieces, North America private label credit card businesses earned 118 million, even with 6.5 billion of lower assets year over year. Our global banks earned 151 million despite higher credit costs. And our restructuring operations including the UK home lending earned 125 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The real estate business obviously had a very tough quarter. We lost 538 million versus earning 244 million last year, so this explains the biggest decline in our earnings. We had 559 million of pre-tax credit costs and another 285 million of pre-tax marks and impairments. The majority of the credit costs are for reserve strengthening versus losses, and reserves are up 458 million from Q2. I'll cover more on real estate, as I said in a few pages.</p>
          <p>Our commercial lending and leasing business earned 135 million, which was down 65%, again as a result of higher credit costs and lower core income as the assets here are down 34 billion versus last year.</p>
          <p>GECAS had another strong quarter. They earned 191 million, and that included the impact of the third quarter impairments of 74 million. And we ended third quarter with one aircraft on the ground, so the portfolio remains in good shape.</p>
          <p>Energy Financial Services earned 41 million, down 87% from last year, driven by lower gains.</p>
          <p>Two final points on GE Capital in total before I flip the page; first, we've had a lot of discussions about GE Capital during the last four months because of the proposed regulatory changes. As you know, there have been a lot of positive developments in this area, and we're highly confident that GE's ownership of GE Capital will be grandfathered. However, those discussions led to questions around whether GE had a strong enough commitment to GE Capital. You know the explicit commitment that GE has with GE Capital is the fixed charge covenant agreement. During the last year, we received questions about whether GE or GE Capital could terminate that agreement at any time, whether the three years was long enough.</p>
          <p>Based on our analysis of the agreement and a review of other companies' agreements, we are modifying the fixed charge covenant agreement. We're going to extend the term to five years from three, and we're putting in a clause that over 50% of the long-term debt holders would have to approve any future negative modifications to that. We think these changes appropriately address any concerns regarding our strong commitment to GE Capital, so we'll put out some information about that to give you the words of how we're modifying the agreement.</p>
          <p>The last point is in our continued commitment to transparency, we have scheduled another GE Capital update. Right now, we've got it on for December 8, and Trevor will get the details out to everyone.</p>
          <p>So a little bit about the portfolio quality on non-earnings; on the left side is the commercial equipment finance data. Thirty-plus day delinquencies for the equipment businesses are up 23 basis points in Q3 versus Q2. We saw increases of 37 basis points in the Americas in core mid-market accounts. That's partially offset by lower delinquencies on 30-plus in both Europe and Asia. If you look, the commercial non-earnings were up 41 basis points. Again, that's driven by the mid-market accounts where we have collateral coverage, and I'll cover more on non-earnings in two pages.</p>
          <p>On the right side is the consumer data. This continues to develop into the two different stories based on the type of exposure, the mortgage and the non-mortgage. We broke out these two types because the loss dynamics are so different. We're secured on the mortgage side. For 30-plus delinquencies, you can see the delinquencies have leveled off for both mortgage and non-mortgage, which is good news. Non-mortgage delinquency is driven by North America, which was up 31 basis points in the third quarter. That's about half the normal seasonal increase we usually see from 2Q to 3Q.</p>
          <p>In the UK, 30-plus delinquency actually declined nine basis points to 24.7% on the mortgage book. It's a high level but at least the trajectory has changed. And we continue to see improvement in home prices in the UK, and we're realizing gains versus our marks on the properties we repossess and sell.</p>
          <p>For consumer non-earnings, the actual dollars are down about $100 million versus Q2 at 6.5 billion. However, the percent is up slightly as the consumer assets are down slightly.</p>
          <p>Next is an update on reserve coverage. We had another good quarter for reserve strengthening. Our provision for loss was 2.9 billion in Q3. And with the write-offs flattening in Q2, we increased our reserves by 757 million in the quarter. You can see that both commercial and consumer increased the reserves. The reserve increase in commercial was 593 million. About 450 million of that was for commercial real estate. And overall the coverage increased by 30 basis points versus the second quarter.</p>
          <p>For consumer, the reserves were up 164 million and coverage went up 20 basis points. And for mortgages in the consumer book, the coverage is also up, and we're realizing 115% proceeds versus our foreclosure marks on the real estate that we own in the mortgage book; continued strengthening of reserve levels, another good quarter, coverage up over 2%.</p>
          <p>Next is an update on non-earning assets and reserve coverage. These are the same charts that Jeff Bornstein, our CFO from GE Capital, covered in March and July at the update meetings. Since we've used these several times this year, I'm not going to go through all the bars on the charts, but I thought I'd just cover a few of the points on the update.</p>
          <p>On the left side for commercial, our reserves at the end of Q3 are up to 189% coverage on our estimated loss exposure. Again, that's up from 173% in Q2. We continue to track and analyze the actual results versus our estimates for recovery, and our assumptions continue to hold as we update the actuals each quarter. On the right side, we continue to have almost two times coverage on our non-mortgage loss exposure, so principally the private label credit card and other secured consumer loans. And our mortgage reserves are up to 206% of the loss exposure versus 173% in Q2. And Jeff will cover more of this &#x2013; Jeff Bornstein will cover more of this again in detail at the December 8 update.</p>
          <p>Finally, an update on commercial real estate; I already covered their earnings in the quarter, but here's more information on the business. On the left side is information about the debt book; 30-day plus delinquencies on the debt book are up slightly to 4.19%. This is right in line with other bank real estate portfolios if you exclude the impact of development construction, which we don't have. Non-earnings of 1.3 billion in real estate debt were flat from Q2 to Q3.</p>
          <p>And in the third quarter, we performed a valuation review of our entire debt portfolio using relevant third-party data. The result of that review was an increase in specific reserves of 562 million. If the loan to value is more than 100% and there's a refinancing event in the next 24 months, we basically put up reserves at 100% loan-to-value level, even if the property is current and cash paying. Though for 77% of the loans which we reserved in 3Q, the properties are paying current. If you look at the total debt service coverage for the total portfolio is about 2.5 times. And with the reserve increases this quarter, our coverage went up to 2.3%.</p>
          <p>On the right side, some of the metrics for the equity book, third quarter net operating income is in line with our original outlook, close to $1.2 billion 3Q year to date. We have had some gains in the year, but they are below plan. In the third quarter, we sold 72 properties for an after-tax gain of $51 million, but that's clearly less than last year.</p>
          <p>Impairments are running above plan. As I said, we have had several hundred million dollars of impairments in the real estate book in the quarter. Occupancy is in line with our estimates, and the team has done a good job of re-leasing space. In the third quarter, we had 7.3 million square feet expire, and we re-leased 7 million of that in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So overall, if you look at the real estate business, our total credit losses and impairments are 1.5 billion through three quarters. And if you look at the segment, it's tracking closer to the Fed adverse case, but again well within the boundaries of what we laid out for the risk in real estate and the potential losses in the March stress case. So I feel like the team is operating pretty well in a pretty tough environment and the risks are understood and manageable.</p>
          <p>I'll shift out of Capital now and just cover the other businesses. First is NBC. For the quarter, revenues of 4.1 billion were down 20%. We're comparing to last year, which had over 1 billion of revenues for the Beijing Olympics; so if you adjust for the Olympics, revenues were basically flat year over year. Segment profit of 732 million was up 13%. In the first and second quarter, we showed you that reported variances were not as bad as they looked for Q3. I'll adjust for the gain if that goes the other way. On the box on the top right, you can see our reported V of 13%. If you adjust for the net benefit of the A&amp;E/Lifetime transaction gain and impairments, which I covered on the third quarter item space, the operations variance would be down 9% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of going around the business performance, I'll start with cable. Cable just continues to perform extremely well. The revenues of 1.2 billion were up 8%. Op profit of 552 million was up 11%. USA led the way as the number one cable channel for the 13th consecutive quarter. It had strong revenues and profit growth. SyFy, CNBC, Bravo were also all up.</p>
          <p>If you go to broadcast, revenues of 1.4 billion were flat ex the Olympics last year. And op profit was up about 4% ex the Olympics. Four weeks in, The Jay Leno Show is exceeding our ratings estimates, as are Conan and Fallon, so we're happy with the ten o'clock and the late night performance. And we're three weeks into the new season and our prime ratings are on our estimates. And as Jeff said, fourth quarter scatter is up double digits in prime and up over 20% on cable, so those show some signs of life, as he mentioned.</p>
          <p>On the right side, the film business had a very tough third quarter. Revenues of 1 billion were down 20%, and op profit was off by over 120 million. We had tough comparisons to last year plus less than expected box office performance this year. And the parks were down 14% in op profit, as expected in this environment. And finally on digital, hulu continues to perform. It was the number two video site in the quarter. And I covered the impact of the gain and the impairments that we had in the business. So if you look at the third quarter year to date, NBCU reported op profit of 1.7 billion, down 27%, in line with the industry.</p>
          <p>Next is Technology Infrastructure. John Rice and the team delivered revenues of 10.2 billion, down 11%, and segment profit of 1.7 billion was down 8%. You can see the business results on the bottom left. The quarter was driven by another strong result in aviation, offset by continued pressure in healthcare and transportation.</p>
          <p>Aviation, I'll go through some details. The third quarter orders of 4.5 billion were slightly ahead of 2Q. They were down 19% year over year. Major equipment orders of 1.9 billion were down 37%. We had $1 billion of commercial engine orders and 900 million of military orders. And the strong backlog here continues to bode well for the future. The major equipment backlog ended the quarter at 20.7 billion. It's only down 1% versus last year and down 3% from Q2.</p>
          <p>Service orders in total were up 1%. Commercial spares of 18.6 million a day were down about 8%, and this was offset by a parts distribution order we had with Aviall to get the total orders up. And commercial overhauls were down 4% in the quarter. Revenue was down 6%. We shipped 456 commercial engines, which were down 16%; partially offset by 253 military engines, which were up 38%, a similar profile to what we had all year. And service revenue was down 2%, reflecting the impact of the lower spares shipments.</p>
          <p>On that revenue, op profit was up 16%. We had four points of margin growth here, driven by pricing, which was up 4%, and services productivity, which was partially offset by the lower volume that I mentioned. As we look forward with the slowing service rates, orders rates, and the lower engine deliveries, we wouldn't expect to continue to outperform at these levels, but they've had a great year so far.</p>
          <p>Healthcare reported orders of 3.9 billion were down 9%, down 7% organically. You can read about this every day about the pressures in the healthcare market. Equipment orders were down 13. In the US, the orders on equipment were down 21. And non-US, the orders were down eight or 4%, FX adjusted, some impact from the dollar in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The pressure was pretty much across all the product lines. CT/MR, X-ray, healthcare IT [HCIT], clinical systems were down double digits. Life Sciences was flat, and Services was up 5. If you exclude the HCIT impact, China DI orders were a bright spot, up 28%. With those orders, revenue was down 9%. Equipment was down 11 and services were down six, but flat organically. So op profit of 508 was down 20%, driven by the lower volume, some price pressure, and negative productivity.</p>
          <p>When you look at the environment here between the economy and the legislative uncertainty, this just continues to be a really tough healthcare environment. We are going to have an analyst meeting. We're pulling up at the RSNA [Radiological Society of North America] meeting, and it will be held in New York City next Tuesday. Trevor and JoAnna can get you the details on that, so we will give a nice review of the healthcare business next week.</p>
          <p>For Transportation, third quarter orders of 637 million were down 38%. Equipment orders remain very challenging and the North American railroads have significant overcapacity. There are still about 5,000 locomotives parked. That does impact service orders, which were down 43%. And in the quarter, revenues were down 23, driven by both equipment revenue being down and service revenue being down. Op profit was down 31, driven by those volume declines.</p>
          <p>The entire Tech Infrastructure segment is really executing a strong cost-out program in a tough environment. One other bright spot about this if you break out the services businesses here, service op profit was up 10% for the segment in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally, Energy; John Krenicki and the energy infrastructure team had another very strong quarter. Revenues of 8.9 billion were down 9%. Segment profit of 1.6 billion was up 11%. You can see the business results on the bottom left for both Energy and Oil &amp; Gas delivery, double-digit growth. Energy had $6.5 billion of orders. They were down 25% versus last year but flat with Q2. And equipment orders, if you look quarter over quarter from Q2 to Q3, they were up 15%, so it reflects the dynamic that Jeff talked about on orders.</p>
          <p>Thermal orders of 1.1 billion were down 46%. We received orders for 23 gas turbines versus 33 last year in third quarter. That included 15 units for the Iraq order, about $600 million. We still have 25 more units to book for the Iraq order, which is probably going to be in 2010. Thermal backlog at 7.1 billion is down 1% from Q2.</p>
          <p>Wind, we had 1.3 billion of orders. That's down 43%, but again up 2.5 times from Q2. The wind backlog stands at $3.8 billion. The good news, in the third quarter the stimulus investment tax credit guidelines were finalized, and that will help with new wind orders as we look forward.</p>
          <p>Service orders were up 9%, driven by energy services up 16, partially offset by water and nuclear service orders, which were down five. So revenue for the business was down 11%, driven by that lower thermal volume. We shipped 16 gas turbines in the quarter versus 50 last year, but pricing was up 4%. We shipped 935 wind turbines versus a little over 1,000 last year, with pricing up 5%. And service revenues were up 9%, driven by the growth in contractual services and transactional sales. So op profit was very strong, up 11%, driven by that strong pricing and services growth, partially offset by the lower equipment volume.</p>
          <p>Oil &amp; Gas also had another solid quarter. Oil &amp; Gas is seeing some good pickup in orders. Orders of 2.1 billion were up 1%, up 7% when you adjust for the impact of exchange. Equipment orders of 1.3 billion were up 6% and up 13% ex-FX, driven by $500 million of LNG orders for the Gorgon project in Australia.</p>
          <p>We're seeing a lot more discussion about large orders in the LNG segment, so that's good news going forward. The equipment backlog of 6.9 billion was up over 400 million versus the second quarter, and service orders were down 5% but flat ex-FX. Revenues in the quarter were up 3%, driven by strong volume. We had good petrochemical and refinery equipment deliveries, and service revenues were down 2%. In total, the op profit was up 11%, driven by that volume growth and the price; so overall, another great quarter from the Energy Infrastructure team.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, Keith, thanks. Now returning to the 2009 framework and just recapping where we are year to date, if you look down the list, infrastructure which is both energy and technology put together, year to date we're up about 3%, in line with really our expectations. And we continue to have good backlog and service strength in that segment. NBC has been performing in line with their industry but below our original expectations. We said that GE Capital would be profitable for the year, and third quarter year to date we've earned $2 billion. C&amp;I is actually better than expectations. We expect strong positive growth in both 3Q and 4Q.</p>
          <p>If you look at third quarter, we've earned $0.75 while substantially restructuring and investing in lowering the costs of the company, and we are trying to do more restructuring in the fourth quarter. So we're executing well against our framework and we want to keep improving our position for 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize, on the last page, the global environment has definitely improved. It has definitely gotten better. We're expecting a gradual recovery but we see more interest in even long cycle orders today and things like that. So the feel is definitely better.</p>
          <p>Overall, we've got very solid operating execution versus our outlook for this year. We've dramatically strengthened funding at balance sheet and the balance sheet of GE Capital. The GE parent is really accumulating cash, and the work we've done on Industrial cash has been significant. So we really feel great about achieving our safe and secure objective that we had really set out earlier in the year. We've got a highly valuable $174 billion Industrial backlog. I think the service model is really standing the test of time through this down cycle, and equipment margin expansion has really been proven throughout this year. So we've got capital available to play offense and we will continue to invest for long-term growth, and I think we're well positioned for the environment that we expect for 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So with that, Trevor, let me turn it back to and you and let's take some questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just first, a question on some of the details on GE Capital. Do you guys have the interest income number handy from the income statement? I know we don't get the breakdown of revenues until the 10-Q, but was just wondering if you have that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you that in the 10-Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You talk about the $700 million of improved margin going forward. How quickly should we expect that to work its way through the income statement? I guess I'm just wondering what are the net interest dynamics that we should expect as this freshly-priced book rolls on over the next I guess year-and-a-half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the 700 million you're referring to in the chart, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's actually the cost to carry the extra cash we're carrying. That's a drag, not a positive, so that's the quantification of the cost of having this extra cash in advance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned along the lines of 3.5% or 3.3% ROI. How quickly do we start to see that because clearly, revenues were weaker this quarter? That may have been impairments or losses, but I'm just wondering how we should think about the net interest margin going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're going to continue to see that on a &#x2013; quarter over quarter will continue to be under pressure. When we're underwriting $7 billion of new commercial volume at 3.3 ROI against a commercial book of $300 billion of assets, it's going to take a while for that to blend in and have a positive. We do expect to continue to see pressure on net interest margin for the foreseeable future here. I don't know when it's going to turn, but it's a positive in terms of new pricing we're putting in. But if you think about the magnitude of it, it's going to take a while for it to have an impact, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just the moving parts on real estate from the loss you had last quarter to the loss you had this quarter. Is that all impairments or is there something else that was pressuring that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think if you look at the real estate page that I went through, there were two components. First, we did have a couple hundred million dollars of impairments. And the second is we had about 550 million of increased reserves. And as I said, we went through a complete review of the debt portfolio in the quarter. That happens twice a year, in the first and the third quarters. I think we're through that for the fourth quarter for the debt portfolio. We'll have to see as we look at the total value of the equity portfolio in the fourth quarter what that does for impairments. But, I think the reserves that we posted in the third quarter would have been extraordinary or above what the normal run rate is just based on the fact that it's a 100% review property by property using new third-party assumptions. And obviously updating from the first to the third quarter, the environment didn't get better in that period, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and then one last question. You guys didn't mention the guidance for new equipment revenues next year down 10 to 15. Are we still sticking by that or is there any change on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think that's a good number for next year. I think the activity in the third quarter just bolsters that, if anything, the fact that the orders have come back. And so, I think that's still a good assumption for next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning, Scott.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The 2.8% coverage number is definitely a sequential improvement, but where does that number need to go? Do you have a target? Is it just something that you talk about with the auditors once a quarter? It's tough to put context around it just because if you look at the banks, they use much, much higher numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've got to take a look at the details of the information that Jeff Bornstein presented when we compare ourselves to the banks. We have a dramatically different book in terms of our consumer versus commercial mix, in terms of our global mix, and certainly in terms of the types of assets we have in the real estate business. Those would be the three major reasons for a difference between their total provision percent and ours.</p>
          <p>We do not have a specific number. We put the reserves out that we need to based on the embedded losses on the book every quarter per the accounting. We had originally set out this year and said that we thought that the reserve coverage would go over 2% as part of the total year, and we've achieved that through the third quarter. So, there is not a specific number. We review our reserves every quarter with our auditors, and we don't have a specific number. It's based on how is the portfolio performing, what are delinquencies doing, what are non-earnings doing, and what reserves do we need based on the book performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just to follow up on that a little bit, you're building book value, which is good. But some would argue that you have an opportunity as you're building book value to really take up provisioning up and be extra conservative. You can always obviously reverse down the road if it improved the other way. I guess what I don't understand is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I live in a world with accounting guidelines and rules and we follow them to the T. I can tell you that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I totally understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not an exercise of we'll just book some extra reserves. There's a very thorough process and a very thorough review that goes into this every quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I get it, except the banks seem to be able to find a way to add a couple billion dollars here and there to reserves. Are they working on different accounting rules, or is it just that you find yourselves to be more conservative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not going to comment on what the banks do versus what we do. I just know that what we do is we follow a very rigorous process every quarter. We've got a lot of oversight on it, and we're trying to make sure that we're getting it right every quarter. The teams have every incentive to make sure they get it right, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add to that, Scott. I think the transparency around GE Capital, we believe in that; another meeting in December after July and March. And so we want our investors to see what we're doing and what the assumptions are and stuff like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I get it. I'm trying to reconcile the difference. Last quick question here, backlog is up 4 billion. It looks like &#x2013; do you guys calculate a book-to-bill number? It looks like it would still be fairly negative even though backlog is up. Is there just some sort of number that you tend to use? Another way to ask the question is when would you expect book-to-bill to be approaching one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you looked at the orders chart that we showed you in here today, you can see if you separate equipment from services, Scott, you can just look at the services &#x2013; or the equipment revenues versus equipment orders. The backlog on equipment went down $1 billion, so you're in the 85% book-to-bill on an equipment basis, something like that. I think we've got to see what the fourth quarter looks like. As Jeff showed you, we think sequentially the fourth quarter is going to have higher equipment orders. Originally, earlier in the year, we thought we could end the year with somewhere around a $45 billion backlog. It could be better.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wonder if we could just talk about the portfolio a little bit. Obviously, I'm sure your hands are tied somewhat around what you can say around NBCU. But Jeff, just looking at the big landscape here, right, today you've shown a recommitment to GE Capital or reaffirmed the commitment. We've got the very [incredible] sounding speculation on NBC. There's talk of the AREVA T&amp;D assets. There's talk of security. It's a complicated company. There are always a lot of balls in the air, but it looks like there's a lot more balls in the air than normal right now. I just wonder if you could give us some view of how we should think about the portfolio say three or four years from now, really what the company might look like, and the path to get there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, again let me just try to put it in context because I want us to stay focused on what's known. I would say if you think about GE, we've got a strong, long-lasting commitment to infrastructure. You see talk about AREVA and other investments we've made there, and that's very important for the company going forward. I think with GE Capital, the vision we've expressed is that GE Capital is going to be smaller, more focused, high-return, connected to the core, things like that; and we continue to execute along those lines.</p>
          <p>A lot of the speculation has been on NBCU. And in some way, shape, or form, there has been speculation around NBCU for a long time. The way I would say it is the company has got a lot of cash, so we're in great shape overall. NBCU is a great franchise that has consistently delivered income growth and cash pre-recession. It has been a solid performer. I think we've always evaluated our portfolio. And I think in the context of what I've talked about that we expect this to be a reset world and it's a good time to be thoughtful about the portfolio, I really do mean that.</p>
          <p>In the case of NBCU, Vivendi has been a great partner. They've got a window every year to really review their options for NBC. And this year, we just wanted to be ready for several scenarios. One might be an IPO or another strategic partnership like the one that we've actually had with Vivendi. I don't have a specific pronouncement or a specific need for cash. And look, in many ways we plan to operate NBCU over the long term or partner if that accelerates the growth of the franchise.</p>
          <p>I just think &#x2013; I wouldn't look at this as that much more than what we've done in the past. I think GE Capital we've talked about and I think Infrastructure we've talked about. And NBC is the one that's receiving the most attention right now. And to a certain extent, that's logical just given the process that Vivendi goes through each year.</p>

          <p>As, we think about the potential to perhaps do more M&amp;A over time, I think you'd probably agree that the M&amp;A track record on the buy side of things has been mixed over the last 5 to 7 years or so. I just wonder as you think about moving forward from here, is there a change in focus, a change in how you measure these sorts of things planning for synergies, planning for growth? Just anything that we can get our arms around when we think about the next wave of capital allocation?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I would say, Jeff, that we want to be disciplined around the capital that we have. I think if you look at the franchises we have in aviation and healthcare and the big infrastructure businesses that we have, we've got good, strong, core teams that can execute on these plans. Again, I think if we look at some of the ones that we've been mentioning around like the AREVA distribution business, we've got a great, strong core team that can execute on a transaction like that. So look, we just want to be disciplined around all the investing that we do and there's nothing different about that.</p>
          <p>I would say net-net though, we're going to generate a lot of cash industrially. We've got a lot of cash on the balance sheet that we've put in place to protect GE Capital. I don't think we need to do deals to grow the company in the future. We've got a great organic growth process, and we're only going to do them if they generate attractive returns for our investors. And in some way, shape or form, Jeff, that has been the philosophy we've always had.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Keith, I want to start with provisioning. Is it your sense just based on market dynamics that this 2.8 number appears to be something of a cresting trend? Because I know if you go back to some these meetings, you had thought provisions based on the commercial book were likely to rise through 2010. I'm just wondering based on the loss experience stability and the economy where that basically sits now, particularly given the strength in coverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a great question that we're also thinking through. If you look, they're up a little bit, the provisions in the third quarter versus the second quarter. It does include quite a bit of provisioning for the real estate business. And if you look at the GE Money business, the provisions are actually down a little bit based on the book shrinking and where delinquencies are globally. So I don't know; we'll have to see how unemployment goes.</p>
          <p>I think the real estate losses on the debt book, the provisioning seemed high versus a normal quarter to me. The fact that delinquencies are up a little bit in the core commercial book would say that you're probably going to have to look at additional provisions there still going forward. And it depends on unemployment on the consumer book, but I think I feel like we're at a pretty good rate here. We're within a band anyway of what the provisions are going to be. And it's going to depend on unemployment and it's going to depend on what happens in the commercial cycle here.</p>
          <p>I think real estate is one that's going to be over a long period of time. Whether we're dealing with the debt book here, we had a big increase in reserves in the third quarter. I'm not sure those are going to turn into losses. I think a lot of people are basically going to protect their equity in those properties eventually. And another factor that I think about are things like the timing of when you realize losses. If you look at the beginning of the year in our investment securities portfolio and the insurance business, we had huge unrealized losses. That has gotten better by $3 billion in nine months.</p>
          <p>So I think we're at a decent provisioning run rate. I think there's going to be some higher unemployment we'd anticipate. We'll see how that affects the consumer book, probably continued pressure in the mid-market book. I think that real estate would come down on a normal run rate for the provisions. We'll have to see where impairments go on the equity side. And if you look, our 2010 framework, John, that we laid out on the base case and the adverse stress case for 2010, essentially the losses are pretty similar. Losses and impairments in aggregate are similar to the 2009 book. So we may be peaking but we're not planning on losses going down dramatically in the next year or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. As we think of capital in the framework going forward; so let's just presume there's some stability in lots of different areas with a few question marks. Your tax credits are $0.27 &#x2013; $0.28 year to date versus the $0.74 the company has put up. Is the way to think &#x2013; I'm trying to wrap my mind around the way to think about this, that the starting point once capital is normalized and begins to return to profitability, do you have to make up that $0.30 year to date, $0.27 &#x2013; $0.28 year-to-date deficit to then begin to grow the company's earnings from there, or do the credits gradually bleed off? How does that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the best way to think about it is under the current legislative tax regime in the Financial Services earnings, there's probably about around 500 million a quarter of credits related to our ability to invest in low-tax investments or in countries with lower tax or benefits from our structural financing. We've said all along there's probably about $2 billion a year of a structural tax benefit between GE and GE Capital globally, and so the question is will legislation change.</p>
          <p>I think the fact that the credits in 2009 that are higher than that reflect the higher pre-tax losses. I don't know whatever those are going to be based on the losses and impairments that we have in GE Capital. We can absorb those with the GE earnings, that's not a problem. But hopefully what our goal is that the losses go down as you go forward here. I think you've got a structural amount that's a benefit that will stay in place based on the current legislative regime, and then you have extraordinary credits based on the losses that we're going through in this credit cycle, and hopefully those won't be needed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. And just, Keith, you talked about the fixed charge covenant. Can you remind us if you look at where things are today, right, and your expected trend of whether we talk provisions or whatever, what amount of money does the parent have to inject or may have to inject into capital, just all else equal, based on what you see today next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, as you know, it's a 10% cushion against the fixed charges in GE Capital. So roughly if GE Capital had $20 billion of interest costs, you'd have to earn $2 billion pre-tax. In 2009, we've injected $9.5 billion of equity already. We don't anticipate any scenario where in 2010, you'd put any more capital in based on the fixed charge covenant agreement. In 2010, if GE Capital performs in a similar manner to 2009, and we laid that out at the July meeting, we would anticipate somewhere between at the base case somewhere close to 2 billion up to 7 billion of capital that might be required in 2011. So I don't think there's any capital required in '10. And again it's going to depend on how GE Capital's performance unfolds in 2010.</p>

          <p>A couple more questions on Capital. So the guidance remains for GE Capital Finance to be profitable in the fourth quarter, but you have $2 billion in earnings year to date. So in theory, you could lose up to 2 billion. Can we just narrow a little bit the framework for thinking about the fourth quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've said GE Capital is going to be profitable for the year. We're not forecasting any quarterly guidance, Chris. I don't know why I would.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then cancellations and equipment and services orders were called insignificant. Are you seeing anything by way of push-ups that could actually be a tailwind in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know about a tailwind in 2010. As we said, we had around 200 million of cancellations in the quarter. It was about half in aviation and half in healthcare. I think on the energy side, on the Oil &amp; Gas side, I don't see it. I know the fact that the production tax credit has now been finalized and that you're getting a Department of Energy tax rebate for the wind project, that's going to a real help to the industry, I would say.</p>
          <p>We're going to get some finalization around healthcare legislation I think. And once that's finalized and people understand the rules, that's going to be a help to the whole industry and a help to our business. You're seeing some pretty good activity in Oil &amp; Gas globally. I think that's a positive. I think in the aviation space, we would anticipate that the air framers are going to push out some of the production runs that they have, and you'd have to anticipate lower equipment deliveries in 2010, so I don't know if that's a new headwind. I think that's something that we're anticipating that we'll be planning on, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but services, push-outs, you haven't really seen much of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're seeing it in the aviation spares rate. You see the aviation spare rate go from about 10% up in the first half down to 8% in the third quarter. I think people are definitely trying to conserve their cash and push their maintenance events to the latest possible point for them. Locomotives, again with all the parked locomotives, you can see that in the locomotive business, and energy is going the other way. I think people are really utilizing their equipment &#x2013; over-utilizing their equipment. And with gas prices where they are, that has been the go-to place for incremental power generation, and that's a positive for that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and last one. Can you estimate you long you have this built-in services backlog growth from the prior equipment cycle emanating from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I think if there's one indicator, I'd say we have grown our aircraft engine install base so dramatically over the last 15 years that 40% of the engines in the fleet haven't even hit their first maintenance event. It's just a massive install base. As there are flight hours, there will be service revenues; and again, you're not going to predict a quarter. But if you look forward, that's an incredible install base that's going to generate a lot of cash flow for us.</p>
          <p>The second thing I think about is the F turbine technology from the bubble, from the 2000 period, they're all coming into their second maintenance cycle, which is a heavier maintenance cycle than the first one. We built a massive install base of F technology, and they're using those units very aggressively, so that's a positive as well. Those would be the two biggest indicators I think about for the medium term and long term. Those are very positive for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that natural gas pricing being low really favors our energy installed base in a massive way.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I just want to have another couple questions on GE Capital. First, am I correct in interpreting the prior answers then that your expectations for peak charge-offs are in 2010, middle half or second/third, or how are you thinking about that again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope that's right. In the environment we see today, I would think that you're running at a rate that's pretty high. You're going to have a little pressure from unemployment. I don't know how will that change the consumer loss provisions. Right now, they actually went down a little bit in the quarter and that charge-offs were down a little bit in dollars because the portfolio &#x2013; the consumer is definitely retrenching a little bit, delevering.</p>
          <p>I think on the commercial side, continued pressure in the mid-market for us for a period of time; you saw non-earnings go up 700 million. Is it dramatically different? I don't think so. And then I think the one question is how long and over what period of time will this real estate cycle play out. I hope that happens the way you outlined it. In all our long-term modeling, we know that &#x2013; is it 2010?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Delinquencies are leveling; you just look at the charts. I would say even in real estate, there has been 50 or $60 billion raised by REITs and other funds. We see some of that starting to bleed through in other markets. There's liquidity and I think delinquencies seem to be leveling, but it's hard to call exactly, Steven, when that's going to take place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that when we look at this portfolio just with the passage of time, somewhere between 2011 and 2012, these loss provisions are not going to be at these levels. A normal loss provision at a $650 billion balance sheet here was around $3.5 billion. We've got to work our way through it, but this is going to turn and it's going to be positive for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And with markets stabilizing, losses trending better than the Fed base case, why not deploy more cash into the market where you're getting great pricing? And how are you thinking about that in terms of the right level of conservatism as opposed to letting capital have a little more leeway in parts of the business that you like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike and the team have a green light on their core commercial finance activity, on the middle market activity, on the things that are connected to GE. There's no question that we've got a green light on that. And on things that are not core and on things that we're going to have as a smaller percentage of the portfolio going forward, we're being very disciplined on it even if there's an opportunity. I think it's around what do we define as the core of GE Capital and what's important to us where we have a competitive advantage going forward. They have a green light.</p>
          <p>Right now, there's not an abundance of demand for CapEx. I think people are cautious in the mid-market. We do have the capital. We are putting it to work there. But again, you've got to have really more demand to say oh gee, let's triple down on some of these areas. So I think it's going to take a little bit of the economy swing to be able to really put more capital to work in some of the core parts. In other parts, we're being very supportive and aggressive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Industrial side, the organic growth rate was I think down 8% versus down 5% last quarter. I think I'm correct in that. Is that getting &#x2013; as you think about that getting worse, how does that turn looking forward, and how much of it is pricing offset by pricing actions that you've taken in this quarter, particularly early in places like aviation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing as we said was pretty positive. I think Jeff mentioned it. If you look at the dynamics of orders versus shipments and the backlog position that we think we'll end the year with, and if you can have Industrial revenue down 10 to 15%, you're going to have organic revenue declines in 2010. I don't have a quarterly profile of that, but as an overall view for the year, that would be a framework that &#x2013; we're just about to go into our budget sessions. We're going to go in and do detailed operating reviews with all the teams, and we'll have a better update of that for you in December. Right now, that comment that we had about revenue being down 10 to 15 on the Industrial side is the way we think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I'd say, Steven, a lot of what drives that is long-cycle businesses. We were outperforming let's say early in the downturn. I think the thing that has been pretty consistent has been services, and that again I think provides, always provides the really underpinning for our Industrial profitability. And that I think has performed pretty well through this entire cycle.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a great point when you look at the equipment services mix. If you think about the last three years we've been talking about, building the install base, and we had negative op profit because the equipment growth was growing three times faster than the services revenue, that has really turned in 2009. We'll probably continue in 2010. The revenue in equipment third quarter year to date is down 11, and the revenue in service is basically flat, and the op profit is positive in services. I think it shows the strength of this install base and the services model.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm wondering if you can help calibrate some math here, Keith. On your prior commentary of Industrial operating profit ex C&amp;I, ex-restructuring flat '09 versus '08, I guess I'm not hearing anything to change that framework. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the total year, it's pretty close. Remember the one thing you've got to add in there is the Industrial taxes because the Industrial segment profits on a pre-tax basis, so that's a little complicated. But overall, third quarter year to date is down seven. But in the fourth quarter last year we had quite a bit of restructuring. And on a total year basis, we're going to be probably close. It will depend on how much restructuring we do in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess just thinking on a pre-restructuring basis, which I think is the way the framework was calibrated previously, I think that implies you have to look at the year to date on that and back that out and what the fourth quarter sequential improvement implies, and you're typically up very sharply in Industrial profit 4Q versus 3Q, but it looks like 1.5 billion sequential improvement. I'm just wondering if I got my math right there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about the energy infrastructure plus tech plus NBC category, not the restructuring category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I thought the framework of flat ex-restructuring, ex-C&amp;I.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We showed you that. If you look at 3Q year to date, it's up 3% for the infrastructure businesses. And then media has performed less favorably than what we thought this year. It's clear and overall, right now 3Q year to date, we're down three. I think we're not giving guidance on a quarterly basis or on an annual basis. We'll see how the thing plays out. You can see the framework 3Q year to date where we are, and we'll have to see how it plays out in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess then a similar question, talking about GE Capital pre-provision, pre-tax, if we go back to the slide in the July presentation and one that Jeff rolled out at Electrical Product Group's conference, under the Fed base case, pre-provision, pre-tax, 11.1 billion; on the adverse case, 9.2 billion. If you think about what you've done year to date on that, and maybe I'm not clear as to where impairments fall in that discussion, but it suggests under the adverse case pre-provision moves to 3 billion in 4Q and under the base case, it would be 5 billion. Can you just clarify how we should be thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not exactly sure which basis you're going off of. Basically for the Fed base case for the total year, we had about a 400 million pre-tax pre-provision loss at GE Capital Finance. I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm thinking before credit costs I guess, Keith. So it's 11.1 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pre-tax pre-provision, we had a $400 million loss for the year in the Fed base case. And if you look, that doesn't include the costs associated with the capital at corporate, which is probably about 700 million, and then the fact that we're a lot smaller than we were expected to be; it's probably another 500 million on that on that 3Q year to date.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I want to reiterate one thing Keith said is that we are shrinking GE Capital faster than we had planned. We think that's on strategy. And as we do that, the GE Capital revenues decline accordingly. And so I think these are things we're doing proactively that are on strategy where we view this as being a positive execution point.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Hey, Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on that point, I certainly understand the long-term strategic reasons for shrinking GE Capital. Earlier on this call, we were hearing about credit costs are likely to remain relatively high at least for next year. And beyond that, it's a separate issue. Any concern that this less ability to handle those losses with smaller pre-tax pre-provision earnings base going forward, and it could be partially counterproductive to do that and shrink the portfolio this quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think we can manage through both pieces. Jeff Bornstein laid out the 2010 cases, and we know the size of GE Capital that we're talking about in there and we're planning on doing that. I think you've seen some the positives for us in terms of the lower costs. That has certainly been better than what we laid out. We started with two and we're getting close to 3.5 to $4 billion of improvement in SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We do have some benefits from some of the acquisitions we've done like the BAC transaction. That's a positive in terms of the total earnings for the company, and we're going to have to work our way through the losses and impairments. We think we can do that based on the size of GE Capital and manage this thing in a very safe and secure way. We'll give you more details of that in the December meeting. Like I said, we're just going to go into the operating plan for next year with all the teams, and Jeff and Mike Neal and Bill Cary and that team are going to do that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And shifting over to the energy business, not surprisingly, a lot of the order activity recently seems to be coming from the Middle East. How do you see things playing out in the United States for both gas turbines and wind given the regulatory uncertainty? It seems like there's going to be some stimulus boost next year, particularly on the wind side, the PTC extension. But is a real rebound in a sustained way there really dependent on what happens to the economy or is it Federal energy policy that's really the big question going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />, but I think it's both to a certain extent.  Energy is just one of those businesses that looks a little bit at the economy and also public policy at the same time. I think wind is certainly going to be helped in the next 18 months by the stimulus and the production tax credit and things like that. I think the great news for us is that in almost every scenario, gas is going to be a winner. I think the finds of shale gas and the basic cost makes it, let's put it the fuel of choice environmentally by our customers, and so we're seeing some good activity around gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think wind also, the production tax credit, as we said, there's definitely a demand for it. We need the economy to pick up a little bit in terms of energy demand in total, but I think you're going to see some pickup there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, you'll see from us in the fourth quarter a couple sizable commitments on wind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and a similar somewhat question on the medical side. I'm sure we'll hear more about this Tuesday, and we've heard quite a bit about the emerging markets opportunities. But in the United States, again you've got economic and regulatory uncertainty. But with healthcare reform being considered in Congress, how concerned are you that the headwinds at least on the imaging side are going to wind up more permanent as opposed to &#x2013; with energy, it seems very temporary and it will get better. We just need some certainty. With healthcare though, do you see a different set of risks there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, You guys are going to hear a lot on this next week. I think in healthcare, we're in some of the most difficult times right now, I would say, just because it's all unknown. It's up in the air. You have the combination to your point of capital markets plus the tough economy plus regulatory uncertainty. What I would say is, and you'll hear this from John next week, in theory if there's some kind of reform, the volume, in theory, should pick up. There will be a negative whether it's reimbursements or some negatives in there. And then, wherever the stimulus goes in areas of healthcare or IT, and how those all wash through I think remains to be seen. The installed base age of just basic imaging equipment is at the highest point today than at any time in our history. Over some period of time, that washes through.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let's get back to blocking and tackling here. You guys talked about pricing being a benefit in a couple of areas. I was wondering if you're really talking about pricing that has been embedded in backlog that was put in place in the market a year or so ago and what the outlook for pricing would be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The price numbers that I gave associated with revenue were for actual sales. If you look across the businesses, energy, new orders that I mentioned, the price index was up 4%. If you look at aviation, the price is up 2%. I think the one place where we're seeing continued price pressure is healthcare; that was down about 3%. I think if you look at energy, Oil &amp; Gas, aviation, we're still seeing good pricing and it requires good technology. It requires to us continue to invest in technology and have the products that people need. That's what's going on globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. On the cash flow number, you gave us a year-to-date walk but not specifically the third quarter walk. At least I didn't see it. How do we get to the free cash number of 4.4? We're looking at &#x2013; did <mark type="inaudible" /> turn around for you? Was it inventory tightness? What drove the free cash number up there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look in the quarter, we had net income plus depreciation plus some timing of tax payments plus working capital. If you put the four elements together, it's $4.4 billion, and we only had 1.1 billion of dividend payment. This is the first quarter, as you know, where we had to cut the dividend. We did it. It's going to be helpful to the company in total, but now we're going to start accumulating that cash. And I think the teams &#x2013; we have an operating council, Bob, where we're meeting every month. We are looking at every element of working capital for every business. We have commitments and targets. We have plans and programs, and we have a lot of oversight and review on it, and the teams are doing a hell of a job on it. For the year, we've had a $3 billion year-over-year impact on progress, and we've offset that with our working capital benefit.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year-over-year in terms of cash flow, the progress balances themselves and stayed relatively flat. We've offset that with receivables and inventory and payables work, and I think it's really helped.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple quick follow-ons. I just want to dig into the energy services growth, order growth this quarter is 15% up. You talked about some utilization on the gas turbines and the install fleets coming for second overhaul. Do you think that's sustainable? Do you think double-digit growth is sustainable given some of the trends you highlighted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third quarter for the total energy business was up nine. And as I said, services were up 16. They've built an incredible install base. We are coming into a better cycle on the F turbine technology in terms of continued maintenance. They've got a good CSA backlog, the customized service agreement backlog, and strong global contracts. I think if you have high single-digit revenue on a period of time here, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. And then on the consumer delinquencies, again the trend there is very encouraging. Given that the outlook for 2010, given for the base case economic forecast for unemployment, do you think this is a speed bump in a trend, or do you view this is something more sustainable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I sit with the teams, as I sit with the teams who are working on the consumer business and I'd separate it between the mortgages and the rest of the unsecured portfolio, I think the team in the U.S. here has done a hell of a job. We reacted early. We cut the credit lines that were open to buy. We've increased our standards in terms of who gets credit. We've got a very disciplined approval process. We have improved our collection process. And the U.S. consumer is retrenching. I think our entry into delinquency continues to show very favorably once you get into delinquency. If someone has an individual financial problem of employment, healthcare, they tend to end up going right through to write-off, but the entry rates are good. I think we do expect unemployment to go higher. That will have its related impact with us, but I feel very good about the progress we've made here. And to me, it depends here on macroeconomics and what's going to happen on unemployment in the U.S., but the business is running well.</p>
          <p>The mortgage business, I think we've made a lot of progress. I think we've seen the delinquencies stabilize in the U.K. That's the biggest portfolio obviously. And I think the house price information in the U.K. is very positive. We are doing a good job of collections and managing the accounts. If we have to go into foreclosure, we do it. We mark those things &#x2013; at 364 days, we mark it to the market value and we're realizing a 15% gain above those market values on houses to get to that point. I think the loss framework is well-understood; and again, the delinquencies rolling over on the mortgage book are very positive for us. It's at a high level. We're going to have pressure, and we're going to work through it, but I feel pretty good about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, your interest in AREVA is interesting. How do we view this? Do we view this as somewhat opportunistic, a <mark type="inaudible" /> asset on the market? You would be remiss to express interest, or have you come to the conclusion that the C&amp;D or a bigger presence in C&amp;D is critical to GE going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, again I think we like the energy space. I think the whole notion around Smart Grid and emerging markets changes the dynamics around this industry. And this is an opportunity that's out there that we should really review very seriously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just finally, Keith, it seems hypothetically that GE Capital pre-tax losses and the profile of the losses are the same year on year in 2010. Would you expect a similar tax credit versus this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned earlier I think there's an amount that's relatively structural that's close to 500 million a quarter that we would expect to continue. I think if you have pre-tax losses that can be absorbed by GE, those will be absorbed and that's not a problem. This year, you remember in the first quarter we had a one-time decision to permanently reinvest some of our overseas earnings. I don't know whether that would occur again. That was a one-time item of $700 million. And if you look in the Q, we are negotiating and working on settling our open years with the IRS, and those could have a positive impact. I don't know when those would hit. They could settle in 2010, maybe being a partial offset to the one-time item that we had this year. There's a lot of uncertainty. I don't know how to predict it, but those are the categories of things that I think about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Can you guys walk through the margin improvement that you're seeing in the infrastructure segments and quantify the benefits that you might be seeing from some of the previous restructuring activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you &#x2013; two places I'd look at are the charts early in the pitch. The number one place where you see the benefits of the restructuring that we've done is on page eight. Base costs are going to be down 10% this year. It went from 44 billion to 40 billion. That is a lot of work that the teams have done across the company to reduce our head count, to consolidate operations, to get common back offices, to reduce our cost footprint. So I think that clearly the restructuring that we've done in prior periods and that we've invested in this year which is outlined in the chart is paying off.</p>
          <p>In terms of the margin improvement on op profit, the base costs have certainly been a part of that. But in addition, it's the equipment services mix. And on a year-over-year basis through three quarters, about 60 basis points of that improvement in margin comes from the fact that the equipment services mix has turned, as I went through a little earlier.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, thank you. One last question, did you guys do any real estate transactions in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we actually sold some properties. We sold about 72 properties for an after-tax gain of 51 million, if that's what you mean. I'm not sure of what other transactions we did.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any purchases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no purchasing going on in the real estate space right now. The team is totally focused on managing this portfolio. We do have some obligations in some of the partnerships where we may have to provide capital on a schedule, and we had some of that, but real estate was basically flat quarter two to quarter three.</p>

          <p>Got you, thank you.</p>

          <p>Okay, all right. Thanks, Dan.</p>
