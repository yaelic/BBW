          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for attending this presentation, either those one who you are here in London or those who just connected through the Web cast. We always appreciate very much your interest in joining ourselves for those presentation.</p>
          <p>Are with me today as always Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada and Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro, the CEO and Chief Operating Officer of the company. My speech will be divided in four sections. Initially I will describe the main highlights of the 2009. Afterwards Pepe S&#xE1;inz will analyze the result in detail and give a quick review of the group financial position. To finish, I will draw numbers of the conclusions and before starting the questions you may have.</p>
          <p>In 2009, IBERDROLA performance proved that the focus of growth in clean energy's international diversification followed along the last years has the right to follow. In one of the most difficult years experienced in last decades, the company has continued to achieve improved results with EBITDA up 6.3% and recurring profit 7.2%. IBERDROLA bet on wind energy has strengthened further our production mix, driving 1.1 rise in output despite the weak demand evolution. Thanks of the, to the investment made the last year, the Renovables international businesses have continued to drive the group increasing results.</p>
          <p>In this sense, both businesses have obtained a combined 11% growth in EBITDA that offset the flat evolution of the Spanish traditional energy business, affected by low prices in the wholesale market and low demand.</p>
          <p>In 2009, IBERDROLA maintained its deep commitment to a strong financial position. In one of the most difficult environments ever seen in the market, the group show its flexibility and anticipation and increased its financial solidity through the reduction of investment and improvement of its debt profile.</p>
          <p>Of all that, together with 11% increase registered in operating cash flow, has led to an improvement of financial ratios. On the basis of the evolution of result and the group strong financial position, the Board has decide to present to the Annual Shareholders Meeting a proposal to maintain last year's remuneration per share.</p>
          <p>In 2009, the company output exceed 140,000 gigawatt hours production, increased by 1.1% outperforming demand evolution. It was possible, as I mentioned before, thanks to the contribution of renovable energy, which increased by 26% and offset the combined 2% decrease registered in other technologies.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight the strong performance of wind energy in the fourth quarter of the year, in which its contribution to the total production reached 17%, becoming the second technology by output. By the way, yesterday was the record in Spain of production of wind. We bet on the records yesterday. Close to the whole production of yesterday, the share out of IBERDROLA yesterday in the whole Spanish market was 42% of the total electricity produced, which only in the case of wind was over 74 gigawatt hours in the day, so which is the record &#x2013; absolute record. We will talk later now on that.</p>
          <p>The main driver is increased weather output at the group wind farms in the United States with a 63% versus the fourth quarter of 2008 in Spain with 28% increase. As a result of this, overall world production reversed the trend shown in the first nine months and show an increase in the first time in 2009.</p>
          <p>I will also like to mention the level of hydro reserves in Spain, with as of December amounting 6,000 gigawatt hours plus a 33% increase over the 2008 end-year and highly continued to increase in the first two months 2010, driving a 120% increase in hydro production in the first months of the year.</p>
          <p>The group as well has already in this increasing production continues as well. Yesterday as well we produced close to 100 gigawatt hours of hydro in Spain yesterday. And the reserve of the total group has already increased by more than 2,000 gigawatt hours toward the previous year. So altogether, it's close to 4,000 gigawatt hours more than the previous year, accounting those one which has been producing, not counting the one in production. It's in the dumps in this moment.</p>
          <p>In 2009, the group has maintained its effort to improve operating efficiency, which has resulted a 4.1 increase in net operating expenses, excluding IBERDROLA, United States.</p>
          <p>In this respect, I would like to highlight the evolution of three businesses: Energy business in Spain, which achieved 2% improvement mainly by led by cost saving in networks; RENOVABLES, which is combining its ambitious capacity expansion plan with a clear focus on efficiency are shown by the 16% fall in the expenses per megawatt installed; and finally, ScottishPower has reduced its cost by 8% in sterling.</p>
          <p>As regard to IBERDROLA United States, let me remind the consolidated 2008 figures included only the cost corresponded to the fourth quarter. This explained the 10% increase in the total net operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Later today, we will elaborate in further detail the various initiatives we are putting in place in order to increase the efficiency in our network businesses in the state then during the day will be already in details explained.</p>
          <p>The resilient performance of the group business activities together with effort made to keep cost under control have driven EBITDA up to 6.3% to &#x20AC;6.815 million, a figure that would increase almost &#x20AC;7 billion, excluding the part of currency evolution. Thanks to the investment make along the last decade, IBERDROLA has built up a solid business model, in which regulated business and Renovables activities contribute over two-thirds of the total EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The results we are presenting today are the best possible evidence of how IBERDROLA's low-risk model provide a growing stream of cash flows even in the current macro rate scenario. In this sense, even if we exclude the incremental effect of IBERDROLA U.S. in the group accounts, EBITDA grows by 1.3% on the &#x2013; or 3% in local currency.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet, management in 2009 IBERDROLA has increased effort to presell its financial strength through a variety of measures. Firstly, we focus in tight control of  investment, which in gross terms decreased over 30% to 4.2 billion. If we subtract the &#x20AC;1.7 billion of final divestment and the &#x20AC;400 million gradually received from United States we'll reach a net investment of &#x20AC;2.1 billion, 66% lower of the previous year figure. This proves once again the ability to adapt investment profile to the macro scenario in a very, very short period of time.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we kept on working on the optimization of the group financial structure. We obtained funds from the capital market of almost &#x20AC;1.5 billion, including &#xA3;500 million the mid-growth in the British market and $2 billion in the U.S. market. We closed the year with a liquidity position of nine billion, if we reduce our leverage from 50 to 46% in a like-for-like basis. This together with a Group's strong generation of operating cash flow which increased by 11% to &#x20AC;4.9 billion has allowed IBERDROLA to improve its key financial ratios with a stand comfortably in the threshold defined for the A rated company.</p>
          <p>And finally net profit amounting 2.824 million with 7.4 growth in recurrent terms above the five to seven increase estimated three months ago. I will pass now the word to S&#xE1;inz Armada who will explain the result in detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We shall now proceed to analyze the most important aspects of the 2009 income statement, the operating performance of the different businesses and the group's financial situation. The income statement of IBERDROLA has been affected by the integration of IBERDROLA USA for the whole 2009 versus the fourth quarter in 2008. Our P&amp;L account in a difficult year, as the Chairman has presented, shows growth in all the top lines, driving net recurrent profit 7.2% up to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. The &#x20AC;333 million for the non-recurring profit is what makes our reported net profit to fall slightly despite the good operating performance.</p>
          <p>Gross margin advanced 7.9% to &#x20AC;10.8 billion, driven by the growth in renewables and the regulated business, especially the consolidation of IBERDROLA USA. The basic margin that reflects the net effect of emission rights recorded in the income statement as an expense rose 6.3% to &#x20AC;11.1 billion.</p>
          <p>As the Chairman has already pointed out, net operating expenses rose 9.8% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion. But excluding the contribution of IBERDROLA USA, expenses are down 4.1%. This reduction is driven by the efficiency plan that the group has put in place, in place helped by the FX impact. Excluding the FX impact, the reduction is close to 2%.</p>
          <p>Net personnel expenses excluding IBERDROLA USA fell 4.1% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion, 2% excluding the FX impact. Net external services excluding IBERDROLA USA fell 4.2% to &#x20AC;1.6 billion and 2% on a recurrent basis.</p>
          <p>The group's reported EBITDA rose 6.3% to &#x20AC;6.8 billion. Having the FX impact which, took away from EBITDA &#x20AC;156 million, the growth would have been 8.7%. So in a like-for-like basis, excluding IBERDROLA USA nine months additional consolidation, the  EBITDA would have still been up 3.1%. This shows the strength and resilience of the IBERDROLA business model even in 2009 adverse business environment.</p>
          <p>We will now analyze EBITDA in our different businesses. Starting with the liberalized business in Spain which includes generation, the supply business and non-regulated gas, the production fell 5.9%, less than the system in the ordinary regime, which fell 13.4%, affected by the 20% increase in the output of the special regime and by a 4.5% fall in the month.</p>
          <p>IBERDROLA's out-performance in the ordinary regime production is due to the 5.4% growth in hydro that partially offsets the decrease in nuclear and in the combined cycle production that fell around 8% each.</p>
          <p>As the Chairman has said, the production numbers in this first two months of 2010 are much better. The pool average price in the Spanish system fell 43% during 2009, from &#x20AC;64 per megawatt hour to 37.</p>
          <p>We will note that the price obtained by IBERDROLA in all these markets fell much less, only 21% to &#x20AC;55 per megawatt hour. This price is the wholesale price and does not include the supply margin. This is thanks to the fact that most of our output is sold in bilateral contracts which have reference to the forward prices.</p>
          <p>IBERDROLA average unitary fuel cost decreased 26% to &#x20AC;21 per megawatt hour due to the lower price reviews in the gas contracts. This average fuel cost cannot be match by our competitors due to our lower cost mix. This competitive advantage will be much more evident in 2010 as the hydro conditions are much better this year.</p>
          <p>75% of 2010 production, around 50 terawatt hours, has already been sold forward in the market at an over &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour. This price, as mentioned before, reflects the wholesale price, but does not include the supply margin.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the Spanish liberalized business fell 12.4% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion due to the lower generation income affected by the energy prices and the mentioned 4.5% fall in demand. This was partially offset by the &#x20AC;297 million lower CO2 levies and the greater supply activity. As a consequence of this greater activity, operating expenses rose 10% to &#x20AC;775 million.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in this Spanish regulated business grew almost 13% to &#x20AC;1.1 billion, rising faster than the gross margin, 4.9%, due to net operating expenses 5.9% fall as the area continues to improve its efficiency. The increase in gross margin to &#x20AC;1.7 billion is the consequence of the increase in regulated activities' contribution in accordance to the tariff Royal Decree for 2009.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, in Q4, following the new ministerial order, there has been a provisional &#x20AC;60 million adjustment in the distribution margin in Spain. This adjustment could be partially recovered in 2010, as Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro will later comment.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in renewables increased 11.8% to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. This is a 26% rise in the output that offsets 9.3% falling prices. The falling prices will not happen in 2010, as it was driven by the Spanish operations that have its price hedged since July 2009 for 2010 and the first half of 2011. As a consequence of this already in 2009 second half, prices rose 8% compared to the first half. In addition, in the U.S. 90% of the megawatts in construction have already Pips signed at better prices than the average of the previous years.</p>
          <p>The output growth is in line with increasing operating capacity that rose 2,184 megawatts to end '09 with 10,284 megawatts in operation. Expenses grew only 8.2% as OpEx per megawatt &#x2013; operating megawatt &#x2013; fell 16.4%. It has been critical for IBERDROLA renewables the support of the U.S. administration and after investing $1.6 billion in the U.S. market in 2009 it has been able to get $577 million of grants which will allow the Group to continue growing fast in this country.</p>
          <p>ScottishPower EBITDA in British pounds grew close to 8% to &#xA3;1.3 billion. As the 7.7% reduction in operating expenses reversed a 2.6% fall in basic margin to a 7.9% growth in EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The improvement in net operating expenses is due to the efficiency improvements implemented particularly in the retail business. In Euros EBITDA declined 3.5% to &#x20AC;1.45 billion after a negative exchange rate impact of a &#x20AC;165 million. By business, wholesale and retail contributed &#x20AC;731 million. In local currency EBITDA was up 11% due to greater average margins in electricity in 2009.</p>
          <p>Networks contributed &#x20AC;663 million. In local currency EBITDA fell only 1% due to lower energy distributed around 4%. IBERDROLA USA has contributed &#x20AC;450 million close to the group EBITDA under IFRS accounting. Being 2009, the first full year of consolidation, in 2008 only fourth quarter was incorporated into the accounts.</p>
          <p>2009 has been for IBERDROLA USA a year of cleaning up, starting efficiency measures and asking to renegotiate the New York rate case. All this activity has had a strong impact on the 2009 numbers, reducing a 553 million recurring EBITDA contribution to the final number of 451. As IBERDROLA US has been assuming different charge-offs being the most important ones are following.</p>
          <p>29 million related to past issues on regulatory fronts that had been charged against the 2009 P&amp;L. 24 million of personal restructuring related to the change of most of IBERDROLA US senior management team, the starting of early retirement plans and the funding of pension plans as later will be commented by the IBERDROLA U.S. management team. Other charge-offs have to do with the update of property taxes, storms and other items. The gap between U.S. accounting and IFRS has decreased from the 98 million reported in Q3 to 26 due to the recovery of non by possible charges of stone damages. Nevertheless not all has been recovered and other issues have arising to maintain a negative gap of 26 million.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in Latin America fell 3.7% to &#x20AC;860 million which has been &#x2013; which was better than the 5.5% decrease seen in the gross margins, thanks to the positive performance of net operating expenses which improved 12.5%. Performances in Brazil and Mexico deferred. Brazil contributed &#x20AC;502 million to EBITDA down 1% due, to the 3.1% depreciation of the real against the euro.</p>
          <p>In local currency, EBITDA grew 1.8% thanks to the 4% rise in the month at the distribution companies. The efficiency measures and the lower expenses, which offset the negative impact caused by the lower tariff review of the different distribution companies for 2008 and 2012 and the disposal of some hydro assets have been some of the other negative impacts.</p>
          <p>Mexico contributed 357 million to the EBITDA, down 7.9%. The Exchange rate affect is positive with a year-on-year revaluation of the dollar of 5.2%, but the EBITDA was affected mainly by the sale of assets and the negative impact of tariff reviews in Guatemala.</p>
          <p>EBITDA from non-energy business fell 7.7% to &#x20AC;336 million due to the lower activity in the real-estate division in the whole year, but recovering slightly in the fourth quarter after disposals of two buildings. The engineering business contributed most of the group gross margin with 48% of the total but it's also responsible of the increase in operating expenses.</p>
          <p>Group EBIT grew 5.8% to &#x20AC;4.5 billion, almost in line with EBITDA growth. Depreciation, amortizations and provisions growth, 7.2% to &#x20AC;2.3 billion. Depreciation amortization total &#x20AC;2.2 billion up 15.4%. This includes &#x20AC;191 million IBERDROLA USA and PPAs of &#x20AC;221 million.</p>
          <p>Provisions fell 55% to &#x20AC;111 million, thanks to the fact that the bad debt in the group have been much lower than expected. Bad debts in the U.K as matter of fact have been lower than in 2008.</p>
          <p>Total group net financial result grows 8.1% to minus &#x20AC;1.1 billion. This increase in the result is the result of the higher average balance of debt 22% more in 2008 mainly due to the increase, the increased average debt generated from the purchase of IBERDROLA USA, which was incorporated in the group only in October 2008. This higher debt has been partially compensated by a 0.5 decrease in the cost of debt for the group from 5 to 4.5%.</p>
          <p>Recurring profit before taxes was up 3.7%. In 2009 some &#x20AC;225 million of capital gains were recorded, &#x20AC;330 million less than the previous year, reducing by 59% the contribution from non-recurrent results to the P&amp;L, thus driving profit before taxes down 5.3% to &#x20AC;3.6 billion. Reported net profit fell 1.3% to &#x20AC;2,824 million. This decline is lower than the reported profit before taxes given the lower effective tax rate finally achieved by the group of around 20% compared to around 23% in '08. This is due to the recovery of fiscal provisions that were taken related to the ScottishPower Group acquisition and that have been resolved favorably.</p>
          <p>To end this part of the presentation, I want to stress the fact that operating cash flow increased by 11.2% to almost &#x20AC;5 billion, proving the strength of the business model of IBERDROLA in a difficult year like 2009.</p>
          <p>Although I will present in more detail the financial position of the group, I will pass four slide reviewing the financial profile. Tariff deficit included in IBERDROLA balance sheet as of December 2009 was slightly over &#x20AC;3.6 billion. During '09, IBERDROLA has generated about 7.3 billion of funds, managing actively our balance sheet to maintain debt under control. This financial optimization measures adopted by the group in 2009 and the strict control of the investment program has been key for this purpose.</p>
          <p>In addition to the 1.4 billion of divestment announced, plus the 416 million of grants we have raised additionally close to &#x20AC;300 million by divesting 2.7% of EDP. No further divestments of EDP are contemplated in the short term. All this adds to &#x20AC;2.1 billion or 85% of the divestment plan announced last year. As we always said, the rights issue was part of a much broader plan that allowed to raise &#x20AC;3.4 billion of proceeds in the group in 2009.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, adjusted net debt excluding tariff deficit and adjusted to the early payment, dividend payment, and as you know we advanced a couple of days for fiscal purposes, is down 1.1 billion to levels below the 25 billion mark that we said it was going to be the target of the group to be then between 26 and 25.</p>
          <p>Even now in the tariff deficit, debt has not grown in '09 compared to '08. Equity at December 2009 totaled &#x20AC;29 billion, 3.3 billion more growing close to 13%. Adjusted leverage was therefore 46%, 4.1 percentage points lower than the 50% recorded at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>So the reduction in net debt, the cash flow growth and improvement of the equity position has led the company to exceed all the 2009 solvency targets. FFO over net debt it's around 20%, one percentage point over than the 19% minimum target. FFO over interest is 4.7 times. Retained cash flow over net debt is 13.5%. And leverage, as I mentioned, is four percentage points below last year.</p>
          <p>To conclude the presentation, the Chairman will now address you in the last few slides.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pepe. The result that we are presenting today shows once again the ability of IBERDROLA to obtain increased result even in the very difficult macroeconomic scenario. In the middle of the most significant economic crisis since the Second World War, which according with international agency may have driven global activity in month to decrease for the first time ever recorded, IBERDROLA increases slightly thanks to the growth of Renovable production especially in the United States.</p>
          <p>The current macro environment demands an additional effort to keep operating costs under control. Hence we have increased our focus on efficiency in 2009, obtaining 4.1% improvement in net operating expense in like-for-like terms.</p>
          <p>As a result of increase in business activities in cost control, EBITDA rose by 6.3% and operating cash flow was up by 11.2%. This strong cash flow generation together with this continuous focus on optimizing its balance sheet position has driven a significant improvement of financial ratios, with comfortably stand in the range corresponding to A-rated companies.</p>
          <p>Net profit exceeds &#x20AC;2.8 billion or a 7.2% increase in recurrent terms. This has led the Board of Director to propose to the General Meeting of shareholders to maintain last year's remuneration per share.</p>
          <p>I would like to finish outlining some of the key trends we perceive in the group performance in 2010. Our current assumption results from regulated businesses will show a neutral-to-positive trend in Spain and Latin America and will improve in U.K. and United States. As consequence of regulatory reviews, they will impact result from the second quarter in the case of U.K. and from the end of the third quarter in United States.</p>
          <p>Regular renewables will maintained its growth trend with a rising EBITDA of around 20% driven by the built up of 1,550 megawatts and the expected evolution of price stability, especially in United States where PPAs has already been signed, over 90% of the megawatts under construction.</p>
          <p>In other words, noting that these businesses will continue to benefit from grants in United States market for close to &#x20AC;430 million in 2010 according with our estimates.</p>
          <p>As regard to liberalized businesses, we have staked a neutral evolution, resulting from the combination of the performance of activity into the main market. In Spain, the signals of demand recovery, especially in the month of February, together with the evolution of hydro production in the first two month &#x2013; as I mentioned before increased by 120% &#x2013; and the level of hydro reserves, we have increased by 30%, reached close to eight terawatt hours, make us feel optimistic about the evolution in this country.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile in the U.K., could suffer tougher situation as a result of increasing weighted-average cost in the wholesale market and a price pressure in the retail market. We'll continue to focus in efficiency, which as you all know we measure through the ratio of net operating expenses to gross margin.</p>
          <p>We expect to see improvement in all businesses and very especial in United States, where we have already launched several initiatives, as has been mentioned, that deliver a personnel reduction between 15 and 20%, as well as significant improvement in external services.</p>
          <p>The group financial position is expected to be maintained or improved, driven by the securitization of the tariff deficit, we estimate will be collected by the spring, and the control of investment, which we will remain in line with the cash flow generated. All this will allow the group to reduce its financial cost.</p>
          <p>Given the combination as a positive operating evolution and improvement in the financial results, net recurring profit will increase, which will allow to propose at least to maintain shareholder remuneration at 2009 levels. You can be sure that all women and men of IBERDROLA, we will continue to work in order to maximize those result in benefiting all our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and now we start replying to your questions.</p>

          <p>Thanks, it's Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. Thanks. I have couple of questions. The first one is, can you comment for 2010 on the outlook for the generation and supply business in Spain and in particular could you touch base on the profitability and the utilization rates of your combined cycles? Any opportunity from ancillary services and so on?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on coal generation, can you talk about any opportunity you have in supply margins that we have not been considering in the past? And lastly, what do you think is going to be the impact on the decree on domestic coal on the profitability of this business on a ongoing basis?</p>
          <p>Second question, very quickly on recurring earnings, could you tell us what you expect the tax rate to be for 2010? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think the first question related to output of the Spanish generation and supply. Paco C&#xF3;rcoles is here, the General Director of power generation in Spain can reply to this one.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I can say a few words now and we can wait 'til the second part of the session, because we will go deeper in all those topics you mentioned. So concerning profitability of supply, we must say that we are probably the utility with higher levels of efficiency in our back office and the management of our contract with less than probably &#x20AC;20 per contract.</p>
          <p>So this give us about, roughly speaking, about &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour of margins in the supply business. And concerning the utilization of CCGTs on the ancillary services, I do prefer to go into the second part because we have extensive material that can explain in detail how everything is going on. So, if you don't mind, we will wait 'til couple of hours or a half hour.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are expecting around a 25% tax rate, up from the 20% this year, more or less.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Chairman, excuse me. There was a last question concerning the effect of the coal, domestic coal, so it is going to be neutral, because coal is going to be changed coal-by-coal, so the domestic coal, providing everything is approved and everything is on line after in the second half of the year. This is going to be against the imported coal, so the effects on the market is going to be almost nothing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Matija Gergolet from Goldman Sachs. First question on the tariff deficit. I think a year ago, you were thinking, you were guiding that could you securitize the tariff deficit during 2009. Now you seem confident that you can do it by spring, so why &#x2013; by June, I would guess &#x2013; can you just basically elaborate on what gives you the confidence that in the coming months we should have actually an acceleration in the whole process?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on your forward sales, so if you can just tell us, if you don't mind, just, if you have also anything sold forward for 2011 already? If you could just repeat what you had also for 2010, please?</p>
          <p>And last thing, on the gas business, in the &#x2013; well, in the past you used to provide also some data or some color on your gas trading operations, where you used to make some margin. Could you tell us if, in '09 numbers, you have had any positive margin from gas supply including international trading? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the trading efficiency, we have Pedro Azagra who is just coming here. He is already working the whole day with administration. He can really give us some news. As far as I know, the Royal Decree is completed and that has been already approved by almost all the states, has already passed through all the stages. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic Spanish process is too slow, but I think as far as I know its ready &#x2013; I don't know if you said you have any news within the Consejo de Estado in this moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, it's finished in the Ministry of Industry in what is called the SGT, which is the, like the legal part of a ministry. It has changed its form and is ready. It has to be now prepared by the SGT of the Ministry of Economy, which we expect to be done, if not today, by the end of this week. And then, because it's a joint decree proposed by both the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Economy, then the Ministry of the Prime Minister, they have yet to go a procedimental &#x2013; a type of a joint proposal to be sent to the Consejo de Estado.</p>
          <p>And the feedback we have had from the Treasury and the Ministry of Industry and the Prime Minster office yesterday is basically they expect to do that next week, to send to the Consejo de Estado. From Consejo de Estado, they are asking for urgent procedure, which will be then two weeks. So they expecting within three weeks from now to be ready, to sent it to the ministries' cabinet. That's the timing we are working on right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I recognize that unfortunately the process is too slow, but I think all the things we'd say, we say it in Spanish, Que las cosas de palacio van despacio. The things &#x2013; so unfortunately, that is the reality. The things are too slow. I think that is moving, but the papers are moving not in the state as we are moving in the industry.</p>
          <p>In the industry &#x2013; especially in the legal industry &#x2013; we move at 300,000 kilometers per second. So unfortunately that is not happening already in the papers in the administration.</p>
          <p>So I think related to two questions, the sales, forward sales in the gas, I don't know if Paco Holee would like to now and just now? Oh, you have already been &#x2013; presentation in, afterwards? I think if you are, if you don't mind, perhaps, Paco has already prepared, Paco Corc&#xF3;les, a very deep analysis of all the gas businesses and varied analysis on the forward businesses, so perhaps it's better to wait. And you don't mind, afterward he will already &#x2013; using his presentation of those things.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just want to ask couple of questions. One on Energy East: have we seen there's some non-recurring items and some accounting differences, but would you say that you are disappointed with the performance of Energy East since you acquired? I know there is a, probably an action plan, and you will take us through it in the next few presentations.</p>
          <p>On distribution: in principle, demand is down and also, well I think inflation was also down. I still haven't understood properly why is it so strong? And I think the revenues for next year that the Ministry has put out, are also increasing quite a lot, which, if you applied the formulas, you would expect some slowdown in those revenues, so why are they so positive?</p>
          <p>And finally on domestic, on the domestic coal issue, which the decree law has been approved, but is sort of in suspension. I wanted to ask you whether &#x2013; some of the press comments that we seen, that the utilities are against that decree law, whether they are correct? Because although I would say that it's a gross meddling into the market mechanism, on the other hand, it seems to give you an implicit capacity payment for coal stations that today are not operating and therefore could be a net positive for the utilities, maybe not for the tariff deficit? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think on the United States businesses, well, we are not disappointed. I think we are just starting doing what we expect to be done in the moment we are going to do. So I think we have already been for a few months learning what is inside and from September onwards we'll start already making a plan of increasing efficiency. When we bought, we know.</p>
          <p>It's well known that the most utilities, American utilities, they are not the best in class in terms of efficiency. And I think we knows then one of our strength is to transform companies which are not efficient in a very efficient operation, and that is precisely what we are starting to do. I think in this moment, there are very big plans. Last year, we started the cost cutting, as has been already mentioned.</p>
          <p>In this moment, I can tell you in the first two months afterwards as well Amparo had boot camp is going to explain in the first month of the year has already been more than 200 redundancies. They are another announce another 300, 400 redundancies. Their plans very strict to reducing staff, and plans very strict to reduce cost of external services. So that is ongoing.</p>
          <p>There are very clear plans and very ambitious, and I think this company is going to provide with &#x2013; together with the regulatory review which is going on &#x2013; I think it's going to give a very positive surprises in the future, so I have no doubt.</p>
          <p>So, but I think what we bought, we knows what we are buying and we were already tied up. During certain times, we are not allowed to do certain things and when we, we are able to do, I think we'll start doing. And with it, from September onwards, management has been changed, organization has been changed. Redundancy has started. Cost cutting has been already produced. New people is already coming. So all those things is going on. You will see most of these new staff which is here present in front of me now, which they are going to really present to you what are their plans for this company in the future and Amparo can already ratify what he's been doing in this precise moment.</p>
          <p>Related to the other two questions, you can already reply to, related to the distribution and the coal one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Javier Suarez, Unicredit. Two questions. The first one is on the slide number 18, you mentioned that 75% of the production for 2010 has been already &#x2013; have been already been sold at &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour. I guess that this is including all the production including renewal synergies. I was wondering if you can give us the percentage of the sales expected for 2010 under the ordinary regime that has been sold and indication on the prices?</p>
          <p>And a second question related to this is how do you see the capacity of the company rolling forward  the contract at this level of prices with the current level of wholesale prices in Spain?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the balance sheet. The company has make an effort on the cost cutting and the strengthening of the balance sheet, I guess that for 2010 and onwards the efforts on cost cutting seems to the significant, but if the situation is getting worse and worse and do you need to reduce CapEx, the question is in which area do you think that the company might like, more likely to reduce CapEx if needed? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the first question, Paco, can you reply please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the figure for 2010, our 50 terawatts hour has been already sold to an average price of &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour. And this &#x20AC;50 per megawatt certainly is not the price of each of one of the kilowatt hour that are included in the 50. So it's an average, it's a combination of different prices, quite different prices.</p>
          <p>Some of them sold to the spot markets and other one to the reserve markets and probably doubling the prices. So, in one hour perhaps, we will be able to explain in detail all the different components of this &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour. So now taking about 2011, we must say that approximately something between 60 and 70% of the energy probably could be maintained because the churn rate of our portfolio give us a confidence that we must assume that about 60-something, 70% of the energy is already sold.</p>
          <p>Level of prices? Same level, there is no quite differences because with this so small or so low spot prices the differences on the wholesale are not affected and the combination of ancillary services are not affected by those prices. So you can see now 20 or &#x20AC;15 per megawatt in the day-ahead price, which means nothing. It's just a reference of a very, very special moment with a lot of hydro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add that all this kind of question related to the net in Spain are going to be answered on the session of liberalized business, so feel sure that you will find answer to all of this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think in the second question, as Ignacio mentioned, is going to be reply afterward, but I think, yes, I think &#x2013; I have already in a special slide which explained from the total investment we are planning to make from 2010 to 2012 how much of those is committed and how much is not committed. And there you will see which one we have the flexibility, which is close, nearly close to the half of the total investment can already been, already delay or postpone or not done. So I think it's, that all those thing is in one part the size of light, then you will see later on. I think you have not repeating the same thing.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Jose, next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello good morning. Hi it's Jose Lopez from HSBC. I have a question about the liberalized business in Spain, the supply business. I'm looking at the latest report from the regulator and it says that the average assumed cost in the last supply tariff was about &#x20AC;54 per megawatt. This is the settlement data and, nevertheless, the average acquisition cost of suppliers selling at this tariff was between 41 and &#x20AC;44 per megawatt hour. So obviously there has been some transfer of margin to this side of the business. Do you see the situation as persisting in 2010 or do you do think there might be some regulatory pressure to redefine what the assumed cost of the energy component of this tariff will be in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paco, again, your reply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somebody has to pay me overtime. Now again the apparent transfer of price or margin is not so big because the real cost for the leverage or tariff is not 41. 41 is just the forward price but forward price needs more components to go to the something that can be delivered to the customer, so 41 plus other things arrives to a similar levels of margins in the leverage or tariff as in the free market and this could be something around 4 &#x2013; &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour. The difference between 54 you mentioned and 41 is not just margin. It's just four, five margin and the rest is &#x2013; are &#x2013; different components that we will see in certain minutes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning this is Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I have two questions. I would like to understand from the cost reduction you have done in 2009, how much of it is actually volume driven and how much are costs that you have effectively taken out of the platform and will not come back? And then, my second question goes along the securitization of the tariff deficit, if there would be, for any bureaucratic reasons or whatever, further delays in the securitization into the second half of the year, are you getting any pressure from the rating agencies to deliver on further disposals? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] We will prepare this question. You wait to have a look through that. And the second one, the later meantime they prepare this number for you.</p>
          <p>On the securitization, so what I can tell you is what is Pedro Azagra is saying. I think in the moment, the Consejo de Estado has already approved this one. There are not any reason why that will not go directly to the market. It's already an agent, nominated and being paid for the system for the government, for making all the securitization, and it has a bureaucratic process with certain advisements which this agent is already prepared for doing these things.</p>
          <p>So I think the transfer, and everybody likes to move as quickly as possible with the only limitation of the timing with the bureaucratic process takes, but in the moment that is passing through is &#x2013; it is passing through. I think up to now there has been, already been draft in the papers from this moment, while the papers is drafted and approve is just go to the markets and I think the agents, nominated agents, they are delighted to make this, that is their business.</p>
          <p>So you know the group of banks which have already now assistant to the government in this process, they will like to make this securitization as soon as possible. So I think it's a &#x2013; I'm sorry on  that, but I think that is the bureaucratic process.</p>
          <p>And another question related cost, or you preparing your reply?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Bruno Silva, BPI. I have a question on generation in Spain, if you could give us some flavor with the evidence you have so far this year, what would be the spark and that spreads you could see considering the average selling price you have mentioned of 50, &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour or something. And second question, you also mentioned in the presentation that you are wouldn't be selling more EDP shares in the short term. Why is that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think, first of all, I would like that you understand our business in Spain. So I think we are not much worry about the dark spread or the clean spread. We are worry about &#x2013; because all is a spread for us. I think yesterday, then we got 42% of the total electricity produced in Spain. 90 or 95% of our production has 100% spread. So with &#x20AC;50 spread because otherwise with no variable renewable cost.</p>
          <p>So that's why I think &#x2013; this, Paco, you'll reply on this, but I think we are not much worry about what is the spread because our spread is the total price in most of the cases, particularly in the days with wind blows, in the days when there are a lot of rain, and the days when nuclear power plant is already fully operating, as it was yesterday. So the rest is absolutely working in a basis, but nevertheless, Paco, you can already explain this, which is the number of another's, not ours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the CCGTs have exploded with about no less than &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour spread, technically speaking the right spread, I mean the difference between the price and the variable cost. And probably another five for accounting for investment capacity payments. So five, and if you include those for capacity payment, 10.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pepe? Can you explain more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for several reasons. The first one is that now the prices of EDP are very low, so we are, we don't think that this is an attractive price. But the most important, the most &#x2013; so we are expecting EDP to, as most of the analysts, to get to higher levels.</p>
          <p>Most important also than that, because for an industrial company, it's difficult to time to market, is the fact that we have, we made a plan for 2009. We took the different measures. One of the measures was this one. Now we are in ratios of FFO over net debt of around 20%.</p>
          <p>We feel comfortable. We have adjusted our investments to the balance sheet structures, so right now we don't need to do it. So we are not planning to do anything in EDP. In addition to that, we now feel very comfortable at this 6.7% stake that we have right now. So there are three powerful reasons for not to sell the shares.</p>
