        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luke. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2012 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's website at Emerson.com. A replay of this conference call will be available on the website after the call, for the next three months.</p>
          <p>I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call presentation.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter sales were down 4% to $5.3 billion, caused by several near-term challenges. A supply chain disruption caused by the Thailand flooding impacted results by approximately $300 million. U.S. telecommunications carriers deferred investments awaiting the outcome of potential industry consolidation. HVAC OEMs in the U.S. and China pushed inventories very low on economic uncertainty, and there was broad European economic weakness.</p>
          <p>Operating profit margin declined 220 basis points from the prior year quarter to 13.2%, which is primarily driven by volume deleverage. Earnings per share of $0.50 was down 21% from the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow increased 4% versus the prior year quarter to $334 million. Our balance sheet strength continues to enable us to invest in growth opportunities. Despite the pressure on Q1 from numerous near-term head winds, our outlook for 2012 remains favorable.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the P&amp;L summary. Net and underlying sales were down 4% with negligible impact from currency, acquisitions and divestures. Operating profit declined 18% as the magnitude of sales decline and resulting unfavorable mix drove substantial volume deleverage. Net earnings were down 23%. We repurchased 4.8 million shares for $226 million, and EPS declined 21% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Next slide, underlying sales by geography. Gross performance was affected by the previously mentioned challenges. Underlying sales in the U.S. decreased 4%. Europe was flat. Asia was down 8%, with China down 13%. Latin America increased 3%. Canada increased 6%. And the Middle East and Africa was down 4%, resulting in underlying and net sales down 4%.</p>
          <p>Slide five, profitability detail. Gross profit margin of 38.7% declined 40 basis points. A favorable price and material inflation relationship partially offset the volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. Operating profit margin of 13.2% decreased 220 basis points. Currency transaction losses of $14 million and higher restructuring of $6 million were partially offset by amortization of $9 million. Pre-tax margin of 10.4% declined 250 basis points.</p>
          <p>Slide 6, cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 4% in the quarter, as lower investment and working capital offset the earnings decline. Investment in technology and growth programs continued as capital expenditures increased to $130 million. Free cash flow was down 15%. Trade working capital as a percent of sales increased to 19.1%, as inventory performance was affected by the Thailand flooding; and sales, timing and mix impacted receivables.</p>
          <p>Next slide, business segment earnings. Business segment margin of 12.7% dropped 270 basis points, as volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, and higher materials costs more than offset price increases and cost reduction actions. Corporate spend was down $23 million, as favorable stock compensation expense and acquisition costs in the prior year offset a $19 million charge to eliminate a retiree medical liability.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 8, Process Management results. Process Management net and underlying sales declined 1%, with the U.S. flat, Asia down 8%, Europe up 6%, Latin America down 3%, and Middle East and Africa down 6%. The Thailand flooding supply chain disruption had a broad business and geographic impact. Strong orders growth in the quarter of 15% across all businesses and geographies as oil and gas investment remains robust.</p>
          <p>Segment margin of 12.4% declined 640 basis points as significant deleverage and unfavorable business mix and the Thailand flooding impact, including costs incurred to resolve the supply chain disruption affected results. Growth investments were maintained, as the business outlook remains positive. $12 million of unfavorable currency transactions also affected earnings. The supply chain disruption has been substantially resolved, and the full-year impact should be minimal. Strong backlog and order trends support a favorable outlook for the remainder of 2012.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net and underlying sales increased 2% with the U.S. flat, Asia up 2%, Europe up 5%, Latin America up 17%, and Middle East and Africa up 14%. Growth was led by the fluid automation, power generating alternators and electrical distribution businesses. U.S. results were affected by softness in the hermetic motors business. Weakness continues in the solar and wind energy business, as governments have reduced renewable energy subsidies. We do not expect recovery in this business in the near term. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points to 14.8%, as a favorable price cost relationship was more than offset by unfavorable mix and other cost increases. Demand for capital goods should remain stable across most end markets, but we expect increasing weakness in Europe.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, Network Power. Network Power net and underlying sales declined 10%, with the U.S. down 17%, Asia down 6%, Europe down 10%, Latin America down 5%, and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Sales volume was affected by several factors including deferred spending by U.S. telecommunications carriers; difficult prior comparisons and project timing in the global data center business; Thailand flooding impact on broader electronics components channels; and continued aggressive product line rationalization in embedded computing and power business.</p>
          <p>Segment margin of 8.2% decreased 272 basis points driven by volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and higher restructuring which was partially offset by cost reduction benefits. There are one-time Chloride acquisition costs of $15 million in the prior year. Telecommunications carrier investment is expected to accelerate in 2012, and order trends in Network Power show signs of improvement.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net and underlying sales decreased 9%, with the U.S. down 5%, Asia down 21%, Europe down 11%, Latin America up 23%, and Middle East and Africa down 29%. U.S. residential markets were down on weak economics and channel inventory reductions. There was a significant softening in the China air conditioning OEM demand. Europe was weak as well. The global refrigeration business continued stable growth, led by strong improvement in transportation. Segment margin declined 260 basis points to 13.6%. Higher material costs were mostly offset by price increases, and volume deleverage exceeded cost improvement actions. A modest U.S. recovery is expected in the second half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, Tools and Storage. Tools and Storage net sales increased 2%, while underlying sales grew 5%, and the divested heating products business deducted 3%. U.S. was up 6%, Asia up 1%, Europe up 1%, Latin America up 17%, and the Middle East and Africa up 12%. Nonresidential construction in the U.S. drove demand across the segment with strength in the professional tools and commercial storage businesses. Segment margin of 21.2% increased 40 basis points, as price increases offset higher materials cost, and cost reductions, volume leverage and mix from the divesture benefited results. Tools and Storage had solid execution as commercial construction activity increased, and the U.S. residential end market should improve as we move through 2012.</p>
          <p>Next slide, 2012 outlook. It was a challenging start to 2012, but full-year expectations remain positive, with strong backlog and positive order trends in capital goods end markets and expectations for headwinds to improve as 2012 progresses. However, the European economy has weakened further with no sign of recovery. Based on current economic conditions, our revised 2012 outlook is as follows: underlying sales and orders up 4% to 6%; reported sales up 2% to 4%; operating profit margin approximately 18% and pre-tax margin approximately 15.5%; restructuring expense approximately $125 million; tax rate approximately 31%; earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.60; operating cash flow approximately $3.5 billion; and capital expenditures approximately $700 million.</p>
          <p>We will provide a detailed review of 2012 expectations and strategic plans at our annual investor conference on February 14 in New York.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to David Farr.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pat. And I welcome everybody this morning. I thank you for joining us, I truly appreciate it. Yes, we had a very challenging quarter. And as we discussed in December, there was a lot of moving parts. And we still expect a record year in sales, profit margins, net earnings, cash flow, free cash flow, and 20%-plus return on total capital.</p>
          <p>The management team, the organization, people across this company clearly know we have created a huge hole that we have to dig out of in the rest of this year. But we feel confident that we can do it. We reviewed the detailed plan with a board this morning, had a lot of discussions around this issue. And we're focused on getting the job done.</p>
          <p>Today, I want to do something a little bit different. We have a very unusual situation with an abrupt start in the first quarter. So what I want to go through, I'm actually going to take you through slides, which you'll be able to see, if you have your computer up. I will talk through the slides. There are not hard copies out there but you'll be able to see it.</p>
          <p>We finished the year very strongly in 2011. Fourth quarter was up to $6.5 billion in sales. It was up 12%, quarter-over-quarter. The whole year, the underlying sales were 11%, and the fourth quarter was 9%. But clearly as we moved into this first quarter, we had some sudden challenges, extremely unusual external environment that hit us very quickly. I'm not here about complaining, I just want to give you some insight as to what is really going on. Just a little more transparency, so you have a better understanding what's going on when we talk next week in New York at our investors conference.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the chart, our sales dropped in the first quarter to $5.3 billion from $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter and below $5.5 billion last year. And historically we always have a seasonal pattern and that's why our first quarter is the weakest and we build up and then drop. This year was an extraordinary, extraordinary drop and so let's talk a little about that. As we discussed, and mentioned it both in August, and in November, and then again December, we see the European environment extremely challenging. In fact I would call Europe in a recession for most of our businesses. And it hit all the key businesses from Process, Network Power, Industrial, and Climate Technology. The Thai floods hit us pretty hard in Process Management and Network Power. I'll talk a little further about that.  The telecom, the merger &#x2013; attempted merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile clearly created a slowdown in spending for many months across our telecom and IT space which are overlapping in a couple of places. And then we had an extraordinary, I would say inventory slowdown correction in Climate Technology both in Europe, North America, and then also China.</p>
          <p>So we had a lot going on, normally we have a couple things, but there was an extraordinary amount of time, and I have to say that we saw some of it coming but it was far deeper and more impact to our business than we had anticipated clearly.  And hence, we had the phone call in December to give you some insight into it.</p>
          <p>We had clearly three of our businesses down year-over-year with Process Management; we had Network Power down; we had Industrial Automation not down but still impacted by it; Climate Technology is down and then our Tools and Storage business go down. And we had an impact of $300 million from the Thailand flood, the European recession, and unexpected HVAC inventory correction.  So we went into the quarter feeling pretty good about it ,and we got hit pretty hard.</p>
          <p>One of the things I'm going to show you and I'll show you again next week, is the leading indicators of G7 have gone quite negative, driven primarily by Europe and also by Japan. The U.S. has held up and therefore what we've seen right now is we're seeing fairly large segments of our marketplace actually go into a recession type of mode. And I would say that Europe is all for intents and purpose in Europe historically when this number goes below 1.4% negative, it shows that we're going to have a recession in multiple markets, not all markets.  But many of the markets.</p>
          <p>If you take a look at Europe, the European number has gone extremely negative, down 4.8%.  And this has been going on now for several months.  This is clearly leading from our conclusion, what we see in our own business, recession in Europe or basically no growth but a very difficult environment for Europe.</p>
          <p>I find that I feel better about Europe today than I did a couple months ago because of the actions being taken by their governments, and the actions being taken by the banks, and the financial community to try to bring stability and funding to the marketplace. So even though we see this today, and we see a recession, we are still going to say that we have underlying growth in Europe in 2012.  It may only be 1% or 3%, but we're still expecting some underlying growth as we go forward into 2012.</p>
          <p>But taking a look at a little bit more detail in Process and Thailand floods.  People ask, how could this be such a big impact?  The issue is, you lose a $100 circuit board and it goes into our systems business, it goes into our coils, mirrors, it goes into Rosemount transmitters, and you can see we missed sales of 300,000 or 7000 or 1,500, businesses as you know we're very profitable in.  We made the decision to continue to build, run our plants.  You can see the inventory built in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our actual orders were up, around 19% for the quarter.  And 15%, 19% for the quarter, around that range.  And we had spent a lot of money to make sure we mitigated this and fixed the supply chain.  We had a mistake clearly allowing one of our key suppliers to be in a floodplain and that won't happen again.  And we've moved a lot of supply; it's up and running. And over the next I'd say six to nine months we will recover these sales because the orders are out there and we'll recover the sales and we'll recover profitability.</p>
          <p>So clearly the deleverage impact of this, we're looking at our more profitable businesses.  We actually spent a lot of money to support our customer base. We are the global leader in Process Management and we made the decision to spend money, and invest to protect our customers even though we were shocking them relative to the overall supply base issue.  So we made that commitment and we spent, we worked with our customers and we did whatever possible to help them in the short-term to get some of the product out the door.  Even with this disruption, our product &#x2013; basically sales in Process Management were basically flat for the quarter, even with a very difficult supply chain network.</p>
          <p>And Network Power, the same thing happened.  We have many of our customers, less of our supply base but many of our customers making components and products; we had people in the IT industry also impacted and it created, if you're selling a whole package, it created a whole disruption relative to the Thailand flood impact to our end market, to our customers, to our short-term customers and also in the end customers down the channel.</p>
          <p>So this business I believe will slowly come back.  It's clearly &#x2013; is it all going to come back? I think that's the question I have on the table right now and I don't think the answer is yes, it all will come back.  Given the slowdown you're seeing around the world both in Europe, also a little bit in Asia in China and Japan, I think a part of this unwinding of inventory and obviously some of our customers took back inventory and that took inventory down.  It's a function of the slowing global economy.  The U.S. I believe will continue to go forward and see investments and what we saw in some of the delays in our &#x2013; what I'd call our Network Power systems business, the data centers, both in the IT world and also in the telecom world, we believe that will continue to go forward.</p>
          <p>So we think that that will slowly recover.  On the telecom side we saw a dramatic drop-off in the second half of this year. In the key telecom areas, the AT&amp;Ts, Verizon, Nokia and Samsung, they cut back their capital.  The issue here clearly is with the merger and the disruption if potentially AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, there's capacity that was coming in and the industry was trying to change and react to that.  That created a basically gridlock stoppage of customer spending, which backs up quickly on to us.</p>
          <p>That will also come back as AT&amp;T puts that capacity back on line.  And they are going to put new capacity on line.  I believe that will also take at least 6 to 9, maybe even 12 months for us to unwind and I'm not looking for a huge surge in telecom spending in 2012; maybe a slight positive, maybe basically flat telecom spending.  So the market will recover.  But it's going to take its time.  I think the Process market will recover faster, because the actual orders within the industry.</p>
          <p>The other impact we saw in the IT industry, as you know we saw PC shipments were down, and for the first time in 2011. I expect from quarter 4, 2011 to quarter 1, 2012 they were down double-digit, 12%.  We look at IT spending still being positive but slowing down.  I think there's a been a negative impact out there. And overall, there's definitely a clear slowing, but the growth will return and we're already starting to see that in the current orders that we have currently on the books in January.</p>
          <p>You look at Climate Technology, they got hit &#x2013; Ed Purvis' business got hit around the world.  The residential business in China, the markets were down 30-plus percent, as the Chinese government tried to contract investments and try to slow down the economy.  Also redeploying the excesses in maybe some of the real estate and light commercial.  And I do not expect that business to come back much in 2012.  I believe the China government will continue to control what's going on in the housing market. I believe that you'll see stimulus going on in China in certain markets.  I'm not expecting us to see a major rebound, though some improvement in China second half, but not anywhere close to recovery what's impacted us in the last 6 months in that marketplace.  Same thing in Europe, the early stages, our business in climate goes down sooner than anybody else.  It started going down in the middle of last year.  And it's now stabilized at a lower level.  But the recession in Europe will keep that business, I believe, reasonably weak and with a mild recovery, if anything at all, in 2012.</p>
          <p>In the U.S, we had this situation with the &#x2013; obviously, the refrigerant issues from R22 the year before. That has had some changing going on.  So the buildup last year was not the same as this year.  We're seeing the inventories being taken down both at the end marketplace and into our customer base, at all time lows, and we've had a very warm summer &#x2013; or winter, I'm sorry. Feels like summer, but winter &#x2013; relative to the heating season, so that's also impacted that market.</p>
          <p>So overall Climate Technology has had a very difficult four-month period.  January orders in Climate Technology have continued to deteriorate.  One of the things we're seeing and a chart that I was showing here right now, is that we're seeing the marketplace is really continuing to go from 2006 to 2009 to 2010, is that basically our customers, the OEMs are now waiting and waiting and waiting to the very last second to order.  And so this month, January orders were down 22% again in Climate Technology.  So a very specific number, but they have not improved yet.</p>
          <p>You can see that historically, around 20% of our sales are in the first quarter.  Five years ago it was more like 28%, 29%.  Now it's now under 20%.  It bounces way up and comes way back down.  So basically with the refrigerant issues coming on, with the energy credits ending 12/31/11 and then also the OEMs really focusing hard on inventory and waiting to the last second, we have a situation here right now that we are going to have to manage a lot tighter and make sure we react to it but it is going to definitely be a more seasonal business than we historically had.  We can adjust, the only big issue is we will have our plants shut down here for a while and the OEMs if they wait too long will have consequences relative to what they can get because they're going to wait until the very last second and you just don't bring compressor plants up which are reasonably sophisticated high capital intensive plants up very quickly and make sure you maintain the quality which is very important to us.</p>
          <p>So as you go and look at where we are today, our backlog built, significantly, in the first quarter.  We are sitting at record backlogs right now, at $6.7 billion.  We had a positive order month in January. Our early indication we got a quick snap of this, is plus 7%, approximately 7% on a fixed rate basis.  Our underlying orders for December on a fixed rate basis were down around 4%.  So we've seen a turnaround already in the month of January everywhere except for the Climate Technology.  Network Power systems and embedded power positive; our Process guys still holding well.</p>
          <p>The Tools and Storage business doing well.  Even a little bit in IA improvement.  So we have seen a little bit of bounce back, hopefully that will continue as we move forward. As we report later this month on the underlying orders for the month, the three-month roll, it's possible that it could actually be negative on GAAP basis because of the dollar impact and also because we're dropping off a very positive, I believe October and we had a negative December.</p>
          <p>But I'm very pleased to see that we've actually seen an underlying improvement relative to our orders and our backlog sitting at the highest level that we've ever seen and we've added $800 million to backlog.  So we have the business.</p>
          <p>If you look at next week, and I'm talking about 2012, we now look at an underlying growth around 4% to 6%.  We see the emerging markets will continue to slow down a little bit; still grow but slower.  We remain positive about the U.S, especially in the non-res and an improvement coming on the residential.  I'd expect very little growth in the economic environment in Europe.  I do expect us to see a little bit of growth because of our export through Germany into Eastern Europe also and Asia and also into Middle East. And our typical European business in Germany looks pretty good right now.  But overall, I do not see a lot of strength coming out of Europe.  If you look at the underlying growth right now 4% to 6%, the currency impact is around negative 2%, so hence that's where the 2% to 4% comes from on a reported sales basis.</p>
          <p>So I wanted to give you a little bit more insight.  We'll clearly get into where our strategy is relative to 2012, coming up next week.  We have our challenges here in the first quarter.  We have things in focus, we've got &#x2013; we're working very hard relative to recovering the backlog and replacing the supply change issue that we face on the &#x2013; because of Thailand. We have seen order pick back up in key markets, but Climate will come when it comes, and I think it will see improvement in the early stages &#x2013; or the second half of 2012 here in North America.</p>
          <p>We are &#x2013; obviously with the businesses that are struggling, we are taking the cost actions necessary to contain our cost.  We're going to keep costs extremely tight until I really see this recovery happen.  Because we feel even with the tough start, we're going to go forward and have record levels of sales, profit margins, profit earnings, EPS, cash flow, and a 20-plus percent return on total capital.  The management team, the executives, and all the people around the world, the 130-some odd thousand odd people are working hard to get this recovery back on track after a very difficult first quarter.  We're clearly disappointed at our execution in the first quarter.  We're not looking for excuses; we're not looking for any tears here.  We are where we are and we're going to move forward and deliver what I believe is a record performance for -- in 2012.</p>
          <p>Next week, I'm looking forward to seeing everybody at the conference.  It's going to be very crowded.  I think we have at least 165 people; hopefully everyone will show up.  Hopefully people didn't order things and have a lot of no-shows, and then we've two people there.  But so be it.  I'll talk to those two people personally.</p>
          <p>My feeling is, is an important communication. We have an interesting strategy, I want to update the 2010 to 2015 time period.  We are seeing some different approaches to the strategy.  Our insight to what we see changing and what we're going to do differently and it's not a same-old, same-old strategy.  It's the view we see today given the global dynamics that we'll be facing and a slower mature market growth, a slower emerging market growth, and how is Emerson going to drive its underlying growth which I believe we can do.</p>
          <p>So I look forward to that.  It's always a lot of fun to debate and to field the questions, and look forward to seeing everybody and again, I want to thank everyone around the world of Emerson.  It was not a pretty quarter.  It was a challenging quarter.  We made money.  Our operating cash flow increased.  We are continuing to invest in technology and to drive our growth and I believe that we'll bounce back and deliver a very good year in 2012.</p>
          <p>With that, with the few minutes we have left, I'll be glad to answer some questions, but I wanted to spend time and a little different approach here today by having some charts and explaining those, so you have a little more of a detail as we go into next week and you think about what's going on in the dynamic world we live in today.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much.  And, Pat, let's open the floor.</p>

          <p>One thing about Mr. Farr and IT capabilities, we have a few things upper hand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to give you insight; you didn't need to have copies of that stuff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know.  Hey, so, just a question first on Process, the idea of kind of deleveraging and everything. I understand you spent some additional money running around, right?  But your sales in Process are actually flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so maybe a little more color on how you have such a large profit decline on sales.  And is the profit in backlog now somehow hindered by what you had to do to kind of get through this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jeff, that's a good question.  It's not easy to understand.  The businesses that we couldn't ship on are businesses that are very profitable for us.  They have very high GPs, so we ran the facilities, we kept people online even though we couldn't book sales.  So clearly I'm not worried about the profitability in the backlog.  I personally believe that &#x2013; we will talk about this next week, but we will have record levels of profitability across Process, even with the difficult first quarter.</p>
          <p>The key issue there is when you continue to maintain the build, you're not shipping some of your most -the most profitable businesses, or products.  And you're continuing to invest in that technology and stuff, you actually have a significant deleverage.  And the numbers make sense from our standpoint.  And so I don't see anything unusual there.  I do expect them to leverage nicely, and come back and deliver record levels of profitability for the remaining parts of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you also just spend an additional minute or so on what's going on in the embedded businesses, competitively and from a price standpoint, where you are on kind of your restructure of those businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm going to give you &#x2013; the Network Power segment, next Tuesday will be the biggest segment in the talk.  Because I look at the Process strategy, some of that strategy is pretty tight; we know where we're going and then we'll give a quick update.</p>
          <p>But the Network Power business, I'm going to break it down into the three pieces that we look at in this business.  The systems business is doing pretty well.  We had some disruption and relative to delivery because of the end customers couldn't get everything so they pushed off some slowdown.  The Telco business was greatly disrupted with what was going on, the AT&amp;T potential acquisition of T-Mobile.</p>
          <p>And embedded we saw dramatic, dramatic impact relative to the customers not able to build the product, so they just stopped ordering the product and we saw a dramatic drop-off in profitability and deleverage and we're going through a very, very aggressive repositioning right now within that business to recover that profitability.  Because I personally do not believe that business is going to come back much, I don't see the underlying growth, expectation of those customers at all that robust.</p>
          <p>So I'm playing a year right now that I think we're going to see we'll recover some of the growth but overall I think we could have down sales growth in that segment and we have to get this profitability back to where it should go.  So we're going through a very aggressive restructuring at this point in time.  And you'll see our restructuring numbers start picking back up a little bit faster here in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We will spend somewhere between $125 million and $135 million of restructuring primarily driven around Europe and also the work we're doing in embedded and the embedded power business.  We'll talk more about this and the whole evaluation we're going through right now, Jeff, next Tuesday, but there's a lot of action going on in that business to recover what we really fell behind this three months.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie Capital.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can you provide an update on Chloride and where you are in the restructuring, cost synergies and how that's tracking to plan after seeing the softness in telecom, data center and just Europe in general.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The overall Chloride integration is going, I would say, very well.  We are &#x2013; we have a lot of restructuring underway this year.  We did what I would call the general sales and the overhead last year and now we're actually getting into the infrastructure part.  I will show you next week that from a performance standpoint we are ahead, slightly ahead of our savings, and performance, I'm pleased with the Chloride integration at this point in time.</p>
          <p>Yeah, we have a little bit of slowdown in the marketplace; that happens at any time. But overall the integration and the effort underway, I'm very pleased with and I would say both Chloride and Avocent we are ahead.  The one issue we did get hit real hard on in this quarter, in the first quarter, was Avocent. Avocent is into the server marketplace which really got hit hard in the fourth calendar quarter, our first quarter and Avocent's sales really came down extremely hard in the fourth quarter and they deleveraged quite significantly.  They have actually started seeing improvement already in orders and shipments in the month of January as people have gone back online to start buying again.</p>
          <p>So overall, I'm very happy with Chloride and Avocent. The pace is good and they're getting the job done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the residential side we've been seeing early signs of potential recovery in the U.S. residential construction market.  Where would that impact your business?  Where might that positively surprise you versus your expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we're going to have, in what we call the Tools and Storage business, you're going to see they had a pretty good first quarter, the order pace is pretty good right now.  They've had good order pace.  I think that will be the continued positive, which we see that is in the -- primarily in the repair. We've seen a good upgrade in the repair upgrade marketplace in North America.</p>
          <p>On the Copeland side, Climate Technologies side, we'll start seeing that later this year, as the construction, they're also &#x2013; and as people move into the cooling season, so I would expect that to be more in the second half.  Right now we are banking on some recovery but not much a recovery and with the level of inventories where they are right now, that could be the one upside we see in the second half.  I think we'll continue to see momentum and positive performance in the Tools and Storage business, because of residential.  I agree that recovery in residential is underway, and I think you're going to see probably 5% to 7% underlying residential GFI growth in the United States this year.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Steven Winoker of Sanford and Bernstein.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good afternoon. That was &#x2013; those slides were very helpful.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just Industrial Automation, the margin side, I know you called it out. We have got revenue up and margins down.  And you talked about cost containment and relative to pricing and additional investment for growth.  Can you maybe provide a little more color here so that I can just sort of think about what the leverage was here, and was it just an unprofitable mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one &#x2013; there's two things.  One of the big issues on material is when our price increases come through, and it's been a fairly high net material inflation area &#x2013; time period, we've got the prices to cover the material costs, but it dilutes our margin.  And so this initial phase right here, up front what happens is the price has gone through and we get that margin dilution relative to &#x2013; because we don't cover margin, we're just covering that material cost.  That hurts us quite a bit.</p>
          <p>So from the standpoint overall as a company, we had positive green price costs for the whole company, approximately $20 million now, it's about $18 million positive.  So this is the first quarter after four quarters it will be a negative. We've got the price cost coverage, but we don't make margin on the high inflationary time period.  It's not something we build into our contracts.  That hurt us from that standpoint.</p>
          <p>The other area in Industrial Automation is with a drop-off in particular &#x2013; continued drop-off in solar and wind we've seen a significant deleverage.  We have a lot of restructuring going on underneath that way because we do not see that market coming back.</p>
          <p>Industrial Automation had an record level of profitability last year. I believe they will set another record level of profitability this year because the cost actions are underway. We will absorb this, this price cost as we go forward here and we get our productivity going.  So I feel very good about Industrial Automation.  Some of the markets will be good; some of the markets will not be good.  Again, we'll give you a little bit more insight into that next week, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just back to that first question on Process.  When you're filling out the backlog now, your capacity utilization and the plants as you go forward, how are you thinking about that backlog fitting in?  Are you just scaling that thing up all across the board and running full out? <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:37)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you notice that one chart, we actually built a lot of inventory in the first quarter.  So right now, from a Process Automation standpoint, we're going to spend around $700 million of capital this year.  And we're going to &#x2013; a big chunk of that is going to be going into Process.  We are going to have to invest in capacity.  I mean we're driving towards an $8 billion Process Management business this year.  And we're going &#x2013; our orders are very strong and we need to increase our global capacity.  And so you're going to see us having to continue to spend money in Process in capital. Right now we are okay because we made a decision even though with the disruption to go ahead and build inventory.  So you have control valves out there without the electronics in it, we have pressure transmitters, we have flow devices.</p>
          <p>And so we have actually built the product. It's sitting in warehouses, and now we're going to come back later and put the assembly in there.  If we hadn't done that we would never be able to get this caught up this year.  So we made the decision to go ahead and spend the money, cost extra money, inventory it, because we know with the orders sitting where they are and the backlog sitting where it is, we have the capability of shipping that stuff assuming we get the electronic boards in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Dave, again how big &#x2013; how much inventory did you build for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We built &#x2013; in the Process world I had the chart there &#x2013; I'll give you the exact number. I had it broken out.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Steve.  We built $130 million.  So we had inventory at year end, I'll give you $575 million, and we're now over $700 million.  That's a lot of inventory.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Good afternoon, Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, so just on the electronic pieces, I guess, do you now have the components you need?  I mean, when do you think you can resume shipping instruments with electronics out of Process?  I mean, is this all going to come back in a hurry, is it going to kind of spread out through the year?  How do you see it happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are already starting to see the shipment &#x2013; I mean, in the month of January, I know the sales in January.  We saw the shipments and some of the instrumentation actually come on, so we're seeing that in the simpler product, the instrumentation product, the flow devices, the pressure, the temperature devices.  The larger devices, I would say the control valve, the more complicated ones, they will take &#x2013; that's going to take 6 to 8 months.</p>
          <p>So we are starting to get a flow of electronic boards.  We're allocating where the boards are going &#x2013; they're not all the same boards, but we're allocating based on our customer pressure points.  And we're dealing with that issue right now.  So you're going to see a continuing improvement.  You'll see our second quarter sales in Process go up unless we have another shock somewhere. I really don't need another shock.  And then you're going to start seeing the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, sequentially getting better.  And as we move out, so it's &#x2013; they're not all going to show up at one time.  We're staging them out because that's the only way we can deal with it. But they are starting to flow already. I saw the benefit already in January, in some of the more easier products to get into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then on the restructuring of embedded power, I mean, some of this is Thai-related stuff, too.  But it sounds like you see more of a permanent change there.  Can you talk about some of the nature of the restructuring you're going after and what the payback period is like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The restructuring &#x2013; we're going to start getting payback this year, and it is going to be within a 12-month period starting right now.  This is a very near-term, short-term things we're doing.  I'm just making a call in there.  I listen to a lot of our customers on their conference calls.  Some of the them said that the recovery, everything was going to come flying back.  Some said not.  I'm in the opinion right now of given the slowdown in Europe, the slowdown in Japan, the slowdown in Asia, and in the marketplace, the dynamics going across the marketplace for some of this customer base, I think the market will be a lot slower for some of what I'd call core electronic market space in 2012.</p>
          <p>And I think a little bit of inventory had been built with the Japanese issue we just had 6 months earlier, and so I think a lot of that got washed out.  So I don't see all of it coming back.  If I look at &#x2013; I mean, we look at &#x2013; we lost about $100 million in what I would say, $100 million to $150 million in certain parts of these businesses, I would say we probably get half of that back and that's it.  That's just my call right now, knowing the space that I know.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, I was hoping you would take us through Europe in a little bit more color regarding the individual businesses, because you were flat for the quarter, you're speaking as though you still could get positive growth. Process and Industrial Automation both had better quarters in Europe, so just take us through what the tone is of the customers and your visibility that still gives you a sense that you'll outperform the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the Process business did have a decent quarter.  I think they have a high level of backlog. That business will continue to start shipping when they get the components. So I think Process will do pretty well.  I am concerned about the underlying industrial business of Industrial Automation.  I think Industrial Automation in Europe is going to struggle this year.  I think that business will weaken as the year goes on.</p>
          <p>In the last two months we actually started seeing the stability in the Climate Technology business in Europe. They are the early indicator, if &#x2013; they went down last year, so they had a couple tough quarters last year.  The first quarter was tough.  I'm seeing stability in that order pace.  And based on the fact that Germany is still doing reasonably well.  We're still seeing that improvement, and I think Climate Technology will have a better year as it progresses.</p>
          <p>The other area is our Tools and Storage, we're starting to, and we're continuing to see some investments going on within the European business, and that space is not big.  But I think Process will be good.  I think Climate Technology will start to recover.  I think the Tools and Storage business we do well.  I think the industrial &#x2013; industrial part of Industrial Automation is not going to do well.  I think some parts of Industrial Automation that are exported out of Europe will do okay.</p>
          <p>But overall I mean, you've got to remember Europe last year for us was 11% underlying growth.  This year I think we'll probably be somewhere around that zero, 1%, 2% type of growth.  So it's not going to be a pure negative, but it's definitely &#x2013; we've got the backlog to show we're going to have some growth there.  That's the way I look at it and feel it right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  And then just &#x2013; I might have missed this, but on the impact on Thailand, originally it was a $300 million or $400 million hit.  And it looks like it came in towards the lower end of that.  Was that just being conservative, or how did that actually play out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I made a commitment, and Frank's here with me, we made a commitment to the Audit Committee that we would not just throw everything in a big catchall and say hey, shit, it's Thailand.  And I just &#x2013; I'm not supposed to swear, but I did anyway. We made a decision, we looked very carefully at what type of products we're not able to ship and that, and our best estimate right now, the best is $300 million.</p>
          <p>The other parts we believe, from the Climate standpoint, and the recession slowdown, so we went through and we categorized it for the Audit Committee because they wanted to make sure that we weren't playing games. Let's be honest. They want to make sure we know what we're doing here and not just use this as a big copout.  So we did the best we could relative to the products, the customers, and we clearly mapped out between the Network Power, the Process business, basically what we could see coming out of &#x2013; from our standpoint, out of Thailand.  And it worked.</p>
          <p>And so that's where we are right now.  It's around $300 million, plus or minus $10 million, $15 million, and the rest came out of just the other activities.  That's why I mapped out that one matrix where we saw the various pieces of the impact around the world.  And that's how it is.</p>

          <p>Hello Julian.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I guess my first question was obviously you've had a lot of strange issues as you say in your fiscal Q1.  If we look at the gross margin, though, that's been down year-on-year, for kind of 3 or 4 quarters in a row.  And I guess, if I look at your guidance for the year of an 18% margin, we assume that SG&amp;A grows about 3% for the year as it did in Q1. That implies for the balance of the year your gross margin has to go up maybe 70, 80 basis points.  And so I guess, given than it fell when revenues were up, 6, 9 months ago and given it fell when revenues were down in the December quarter, what is it you think that's really swinging on the gross margin that gets it growing again year-on-year from this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest issue is price-cost.  Last year we had very negative price-cost; that really hurt our GP margin in a big way.  Even though the first quarter was tough, our GP was not that bad relative to what we lost overall.  So I would say the big issue for us is price cost.  We were green in the first quarter; that makes a big difference for us.  We expect to be green next year, which will help us relative to our recovery of GP.  And so that's the number one issue, Julian that we are tracking internally. If we can deliver that, then our GP margin will go toward that 40% GP, and we'll have that recovery.  Last year we got hit very, very hard at that level and that really hurt us.  So that is the number one issue.  Being green right now and we got obviously three more quarters.  That's the key issue for us. Number one.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the cost base generally.  Looking at your CapEx guidance and what you spent in Q1, that's about flat year-on-year for the next three quarters, what's going on with &#x2013; your restructuring is going up a little bit, I think it's $30 million versus the previous guidance.  And your OpEx, the SG&amp;A, as I say, that was up in Q1, even with down revenues.  So what is happening on the SG&amp;A line?  I mean; that going to stay at sort of $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, or are you going to try and take some of that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The SG&amp;A &#x2013; from the standpoint of spending, we started curtailing spending and will continue to curtail spending.  I expect our SG&amp;A to be on a percent of sales slightly down when the year finishes as we get that growth coming back.  On the capital standpoint, but there's not going &#x2013; we are being very careful, we are taking some cutbacks I would say overall in spending right now because of our concern of the slowdown particularly in Europe and some slowdown spending in Asia.</p>
          <p>But overall, nothing draconian because our cost structure is in pretty good shape.  It's just that we're going to be very careful of where we increase it and for the businesses that are struggling right now, there will be very significant cutbacks in the Climate Technology, embedded power computing.  Those businesses will have significant cuts relative to their overall spending because their business is not there right now.</p>
          <p>Relative to capital, we're going to spend around $700 million.  We actually cut it back a little bit. In some of the businesses that are struggling, I don't see the growth rate; we've cut back our underlying growth rate.  So we're going to be taking some capacity out that we had planned in originally, except for Process, which is going to need it.  So there's a little shifting going around relative to capacity.  So I would expect us to spend less capital than I thought we were going to spend three months ago, but we're going to be spending around $700 million, which is still under 3% of our total sales.  Overall the cost structure of the company is in pretty good shape though we're going to trim and the capital plans are going to be cut back a little bit but overall I think we're in pretty good shape.</p>

          <p>Hey Dave. So you mentioned earlier on that you still think that this will be a record year Process Management profitability.  Does that still mean that you think even though you've got a tough on-Q, that you can still do 20%-plus margins this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Awesome.  Great.  And any way of scaling what the impact of the Thai floods was?  Because if you just look at the sales, and deleverage on the sales, you get about $0.15.  But sounds like there are other costs as well.  Do you have that number to mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I've not gone in and spent a lot of time having the guys track what we had to spend to meet with customers, to redirect stuff, air ship stuff.  I mean, right now that business is in a crisis mode.  We are the global leader and I told the guys, spend what it takes to get this business back on track, back up in line.  That's far more important to us. With bookings,  orders coming, in 15%, 18% and we're expecting to drive towards an $8 billion number this year.  We need to figure out how to get the shipments going again.  So they did a lot of extra spending and I'm not &#x2013; I have a lot of confidence in that management team that they don't waste and they got the job done.  Because it's important for us to take care of that customer base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sure.  And then we spent a lot of time talking about Climates and Network Power but we haven't spent very much time talking about Industrial Automation and we did see a big drop-off from 4Q to 1Q.  And you talked about solar, wind, and I think hermetics as the big driver of the downside.  But can you maybe just talk a bit more about that Dave? How much of this is inventory, how much is CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From our standpoint, the hermetic business is obviously tied to our compressor business being dropped off that hard.  The big issue for us that we're seeing in Industrial Automation is the slowdown we're seeing in Europe right now, in the underlying &#x2013; what they call the pure industrial, the industrial motors and drive type stuff, we are seeing some slowdown in that area in the core business.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing a slowdown; we saw a slowdown in China in the first quarter. As China really started dialing back on spending money, we saw the industrial marketplace really slow down a little bit.  I do expect that to pick back up because that is going to be an area I think the Chinese government will focus their money relative to their stimulus they're going to put in place.</p>
          <p>I'm a little bit less positive about the housing and residential and the light commercial area but I think in the industrial area, as companies continue to spend, to go after the growth as that stimulus comes in, I think you're going to see that money spending there.  But the overall industrial marketplace, both in Europe and in Asia, we saw that weaken that first quarter, but we're seeing some signs of picking back up.  So I feel okay.  There are segments in there that are struggling but those segments that will do very well.  So it's going to be a mixed bag this year.  Very lower growth, but I believe as we'll talk about next week, they'll be setting record levels of profitability.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Might need them, I don't know.  Hey, I wanted to come back to the Process Management margin discussion with regards to the implications for the longer term from what you're saying.  I think the implications are that you're going to be kind of 50% incrementals for the balance of the year, and there was this earlier discussion, hey, as you get deeper into the cycle, you shift more to solutions, that dampens the incrementals. We've got a lot of investment to do to make sure we're in position for the long-term there.</p>
          <p>As we think about the 2013, 2014 picture for Process margins, what are the implications of the kind of profile that is really implied by this last three quarter guidance on Process?  Is it you're just seeing the underlying is stronger, you're doing a better job on productivity than you thought, pricing is a little stronger and that can carry forward?  Or how would you like to us think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's one thing that's going.  The price cost is turning so that's helping us right now.  That's a slight positive.  Even for Process.  I wouldn't say we can say we're executing better because we just had a little challenging quarter here.  So I wouldn't say we're executing better, from that standpoint, from a productivity.  We have not seen a shift yet into the big projects, which will eventually kick in probably in 2013, 2014, relative to some of the dilution on the overall P&amp;L structure as some of these big projects start shipping.</p>
          <p>We have seen a continuing, I would say upgrading of spending what we call brownfield type expansions.  And brownfields are a less competitive market space than greenfield, which are extremely competitive.  So right now the mix is still going our way and that I think that is going to help us in the second half of this year.  We'll see how that order book goes in the second half of this year and that will tell me, Terry, how that is going to look as we go into 2013.  But this right now I see no fundamental reason why we can't maintain fairly high levels of profitability and continue to make the investments we need.  But I don't see any reason why we can't do that but the mix could change in the second half of this year relative to orders.  We've got to wait for those orders to come in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I guess the next question is trying to get a feel for the key levers in your mind between the new high end and low end of the EPS guidance range for the year.  And from the standpoint of organic growth around that question, it sounds like with the January up 7% orders, and some of your commentary to earlier questions, that the organic pattern, full over the next three quarters, you're seeing is relatively, the same, 6%, 7%, 8%, I guess is what you need to get to the high end of the 4% to 6%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have we got that about right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes you do. The key issue &#x2013; you're going to see the key issue for us is unfortunately we're rear-end loaded this year and that is not something I like from a growth standpoint.  The key lever for us right now there, is underlying growth.  If &#x2013; I mean, from the cost structure we are driving to get the cost structure in line.  We're taking the actions we need to.  And we are, from my standpoint, so we can get that 5-plus percent underlying growth.  Then we'll be at the high end.  If we start going &#x2013; if underlying growth starts slipping down, we'll be fighting down toward that low end on EPS.</p>
          <p>It's going to be &#x2013; it's underlying growth. This company knows how to deliver profitability and getting the costs in line.  It is going be that underlying growth.  After the first quarter, the price cost is in good shape.  If I can deliver another positive price cost in the second quarter, I'll take that one off the table.  Right now I would say can we continue the positive green price cost, and then underlying growth. Those are the two levers I'm watching and tracking extremely closely right now relative to this company.</p>

          <p>Hi guys, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know you don't give quarterly guidance.  But obviously, the last three months, quarterly guidance has kind of a key sticking point here.  And I think to maybe just move beyond the focus on that, is there any way you can kind of give us a little bit of color on how we should think about the second quarter, given all these &#x2013; the multitude of moving parts?  I think that normal seasonality, if you adjust the first quarter would give you something in the $0.80 range.  Can you give us any kind of over/under on that?  Or just any color on the second quarter would be I think helpful for people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I think the key issue for us is the recovery in sales.  As I think I've said to Terry, I think the key issue for us is the recovery of what our underlying growth is and starting to get after some of that backlog.  We are expecting our sales to be up for the quarter.  And right now, I think from the standpoint the question is how fast that recovery happens.  And that is going to be the key issue.  And for that it's hard for me to say what our earnings per share is.  And again unfortunately we are going to be rear end unloaded this year because of the recovery of the sales and backlog, and that is going be a very difficult thing, and I'm going to have to keep my board updated on a month-by-month basis from this standpoint.</p>
          <p>But all I can tell you right now, it's all going to be coming off our sales pace, and if we get a good sales pace, then we should see start seeing a recovery in our OP margin, and then we're going to see an increase in the restructuring.  But you should start seeing a recovery in the earnings, and I expect a positive, obviously positive growth in earnings, a positive growth in sales, but it's not going to get back into the pace that we need to get that second half done. And so I'm hoping we can do a better job here, but that's the best I can give you right now. That's how I feel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess that just kind of leads me to my next question, which is just the visibility you have.  I mean you went through a bunch of fundamental, I guess macro issues whatever you want to call them in the quarter.  But despite kind of the January order comments, whether it's telecom, whether it's Climate &#x2013; Process I think is its own animal, which you guys are &#x2013; that's kind of understandable.  Whether it's Industrial Automation, it still has pretty tough comps in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>It's just unclear to me how you guys envision this kind of ramp in second half sales.  A lot of the telco guys are talking about things not coming back until later in 2012. So I'm just wondering, how do we kind of get to that &#x2013; what are you watching for?  Is it &#x2013; Europe, you said was going to remain tough. Is it China that we're really banking on here?  What is the &#x2013; is the U.S. economy?  It's just unclear to me what really comes back in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not banking on much of a telco recovery.  I'm not banking on much of a Climate Technology recovery, though I am banking on some recovery in Climate Technology.  We're expecting recovery plus some growth from the Process guys.  I am banking on some recovery in the Industrial Automation in particular in Asia-Pacific and some of the other markets stabilizing and improving. So I do have a little bit of recovery coming on there in Industrial Automation.</p>
          <p>I'm expecting an improved performance out of our Tools and Storage business, better than we have been running there.  So I expect that to be positive.  But definitely I don't see much telco.  I also expect some recovery in the embedded power computing, and we're seeing that but we're not going to recover back everything we lost.  So that's how we see it right now.  There's clearly a lot of moving parts in this thing and that's why, as I said to somebody earlier, said how do we deal with that range?  If our underlying growth rate starts slipping down, then I will be at the lower range of that EPS clearly.</p>
          <p>But I mean, I think if the order pace keeps coming in by the segments as we saw in January, and we see that again in February and March, then we're going see that visibility we need. But right now the ball is around execution, getting that backlog down, and getting some recovery pace in I would say North America residential, and a continuing strong pace in non-res in North America..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last quick question just on Process side, I think Jeff asked a good question around the margin being down, despite the flat sales. You talked about mix a little bit.  But CapEx in that business was running at about 2% of sales, basically for the entire cycle last cycle. It bumped up to 2.8% of sales last year, and now you're saying it's going to be &#x2013; it's a pretty significant part of the healthy increase you're seeing in the first quarter and maybe throughout the year.  Does this get &#x2013; does this kind of get to the point that &#x2013; 20% plus margin is great this year, I agree.  I think you have to do that to hit your guidance.  But does this get to the point where like, you have to kind of begin to throw more investment and money at this business?  So given the competitive landscape is just a lot different than it was last cycle, or why are we throwing so much more money at the business early this cycle than we were last cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the last cycle I took capacity offline, and I took it offline, and I did not redeploy it.  I took it offline because I wanted to move it into where the growth was going to be.  And so now the growth is starting to happen, and I'm starting &#x2013; I'm starting to redeploy that capacity and where that growth is going to come from &#x2013; Middle East, India, Asia, China, parts of Latin America.  That is the issue.  We took capacity offline, and we did not redeploy it.  I used the capacity and milked that and now I'm putting capacity in.  I don't see we have to have some extraordinary amount of higher levels of capital spending.  I think the Process guys are probably going to be around that 3% level.  It could run down to 2%, but it's not going to be an extraordinary number here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, hey, Dave.  Just based on your relatively upbeat comments, relatively upbeat comments towards non-resi &#x2013; or toward residential construction and then some of what the Tools business is seeing on the non-resi side.  Isn't this sort of &#x2013; aren't these sort of decent lead indicators for Climate that all else equal you could perhaps argue was actually at a cycle bottom?  I mean the business almost seems to be locked and loaded.  I'm just curious on your thoughts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the leading indicators, you look at all the numbers, your statement is 110% correct.  Now, we've got to see it happen.  And the other issue is a lot of capacity, and there is a lot of product being taken offline right now.  And we are taking our capacity down at this point in time.  We're taking plants down because the orders are not there.  And so in order to protect our deleverage the best we can, we are actually taking out costs at this point in time and putting &#x2013; turning the lights out. And so, our customer base expects us to be able to turn on a dime and hire 500,000 people, whatever it takes, they better be thinking about that.  That's all I can tell them.  Because I'm furloughing my plants right now.  They've been warned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so does that &#x2013; I was wondering about that actually, as it pertains to the rest of the channel.  Does that, to a degree, give you leverage, whether it be on pricing or otherwise when the cycle actually turns?  Is it a bit of a compounding effect that you don't necessarily need big turns in these end markets to actually get a big profit contribution for this business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we actually get the orders, and the shipments, the answer is yes, because it's not going to be a pricing standpoint because we lock up agreements with them for 12, 18-month time periods.  It's just a function of they are playing this so tight right now, that they are expecting a large compressor plant that's fairly sophisticated, to turn on and get going, and so my warning to all the customers out there in this area is they got to be very careful because I'm furloughing my plants right now because their demand has dropped off so dramatically that I have no reason to keep my workers in the plant working.  Period.  They have been warned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm also just wondering, big picture, with respect to lessons learned perhaps from Thailand.  Are there implications as you look out, as CEO of Emerson and your global operations, you're clearly a well entrenched company in all of these different emerging markets.  Are there implications for perhaps other call it geographic supply chain concentrations that you're going to be trying to work through, or is really Thailand just an isolated event?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think it's isolated.  I think that we looked at a couple things happen.  One, we shouldn't allow a major supplier in a floodplain, which that was one thing &#x2013; that's one flag.  We don't allow our plants to be built in floodplains, so why allow one of our major suppliers to have a plant built in a floodplain is beyond me.  My fault.</p>
          <p>I would say, John, that we are taking a look across all the major suppliers, and seeing, going through the backup plan, are the plants in a risky spot.  We don't locate plants in an earthquake zone.  We're going through right now; this is a wake-up call for us.  We've had two whacks here. We got one whack upside the head in Japan and we get a whack up with the Thailand.  So now it's okay, I'm not going to go for the third one because the third strike and I should be out, type of situation.</p>
          <p>So I'm looking at right now from the supply chain, are we the setting ourselves up in a situation where we're asking for more problems.  We're looking at that from the standpoint of just safety, from an environmental standpoint of concentration, and backup.  So we're stressing a lot of places around here because I plan to learn from both of these events and you never can foresee everything but I want to mitigate this because this was a very damaging thing.  And it's not just us. The whole electronics industry got hit by it pretty hard.  And so we as an industry need to think about that.</p>

          <p>Thank you everybody. I want to &#x2013; again I want to thank everybody today.  It was a different approach, I wanted to give you a little more insight to what's happened the last three or four months.  I hope that helps you.  I wanted that off the table so we got into next week, I'm looking forward to talk about strategy, looking forward to talk about what I see out there right now from the standpoint of our end markets and how we're going to tack differently.  We're going to have to make some different moves from a strategy standpoint.  And we'll talk about those.  And then we'll give you some quick insights relative to the various business. Some of the businesses are just a matter of executing some stuff.  Some of them are a little more obviously insights that we're going to have to spend time on.</p>
          <p>So we're looking forward to it; looking forward to seeing everybody both an investor standpoint and the sell side standpoint.  Appreciate everybody with all the patience and again I want to thank all the employees around the world, working their way through this very challenging time for the company because we intend to recover and have a record year in 2012.  Thank you very much.  Bye.</p>
