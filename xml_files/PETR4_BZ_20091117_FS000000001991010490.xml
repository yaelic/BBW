      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to our conference call to discuss third quarter 2009 results.  We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the Slide Two.  We will make forward-looking statements, which are identified by the use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Petrobras management and on information currently available to the Company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results in accordance with Brazilian GAAP.  At this moment we are unable to discuss any issues relating to the U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO and Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa.  He will comment on the Company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss third quarter results.  These results reflect the combination of steadily rising international oil price, higher sales volume, slightly lower price for products sold in Brazil, stable operating costs, and the strengthening of the real.  The provisioning of the settlement related to the special participation tax for Marlim field partially offset our positive result.</p>
          <p>Going to the Slide Three, during the second quarter, total oil and gas production was up 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially.  International production increased as a result of higher production in Nigeria, offset by declines in Venezuela and Bolivia.</p>
          <p>In Brazil we have now reached the milestone of exceeding two million barrels of oil production per day for two consecutive months.  Year-over-year growth in production of oil in Brazil would have been higher except for the shutting in of 69,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily of gas capacity due to the limited domestic demand.</p>
          <p>Next, the next slide is an update of the production units installed in the first quarter of this year.  The three units produced around one half of their capacity during the third quarter, which is consistent with -- of the production wells being connected.</p>
          <p>As additional wells are completed; these units will continue to ramp up, offsetting natural decline rates and increasing production.  In that result, we continue with activities we have previously announced.  Results continue to meet or exceed our expectations.</p>
          <p>In Guar&#xE1;, the recent concluded formation test indicated estimated recoverable reserves of one to two billion barrels of oil equivalent and well productivity that could exceed 50,000 barrels per day.  The formation test in the Northeast Tupi has confirmed our prior estimate of five to eight billion barrels of recoverable oil.  The extended well test of Tupi is back on line and we have increased production to 20,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Next, include new wells in the preparation for the Tupi pilot and new exploratory wells in the BM-S-9, 10 and 11.  Our activities will be supported by the arrival of three new rigs that shall arrive in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to some key operating data that influenced our quarterly result.  In this slide, you will see the average price of Brent increased from $59 to $68 per barrel.  At the same time, the light-heavy spread decreased from 10 to $4 per barrel.</p>
          <p>The lower spread increased income for our E&amp;P segment, while reducing downstream earnings.  To the extent we process our own heavy crude oil, the spread does not make a difference to our overall earnings.  However, because we export 500,000 barrels per day of heavy oil, while importing 400 barrels per day of light oil, the Company's margin are positively impacted by the lower spread.</p>
          <p>Lifting costs remain stable, despite the price of Brent increasing by $25 per barrel during the last two quarters.  Lifting costs, excluding production taxes, only increased by $1.  Even this is largely explained by the strengthening of real against dollar.</p>
          <p>Next, the reduction of gasoline and diesel price in June and the strengthening of real reduced our average realization price in reais during the quarter.  Our average sales price in dollar increased by 5.4%.  Our pricing policy has benefited both the consumer and Petrobras by avoiding the volatility of international markets, achieving parity between the two markets over time.</p>
          <p>Brazilian GDP growth bottomed during the first quarter of this year and has rebounded sharply since.  The Brazilian market for oil products and natural gas has tracked the performance of the economy with consumption now growing.  Diesel is recovering in line with GDP growth, as is the case with many of our other products.  Gasoline consumption is lower as a result of increasing consumption with ethanol.</p>
          <p>Natural gas sales to the industrial sectors are improving, but this growth has been offset by continued lack of demand for gas for the thermoelectric sector.  Higher oil production improvement to our refining system and reduced demand had contributed to a substantial improvement in our trade balance.</p>
          <p>As we continue to reduce products imports by increasing our domestic capacity to produce these products, we improved our overall margin.  For the nine months analysis, year-over-year we have swung towards substantial net export position and improved our trade surplus by $3.6 billion during the period.</p>
          <p>Before turning to financial results, it's useful to explain top average in inventory costs on our cost of goods sold.  During periods of rising prices the average cost of goods sold for the period is below what it would have been if costs were recognized concurrently with the period.</p>
          <p>Conversely, during the period of declining price, costs are higher than they otherwise would have been.  Essentially when prices are rising it is tailwind results.  When prices are declining it becomes a headwind.  In this slide, you will see that in the third quarter the benefit from lower costs due to average inventory was R$621 million, while in the second quarter the benefit was R$323 million.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to financial results.  Net revenue increased as a result of higher sales volume and higher price for our goods, offset by lower average realization prices in Brazil.  Higher costs for imports partially offset by inventory average led to a higher cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>The provisioning for a special participation tax related to Marlim production, higher costs from greater sales volume and the expenses associated with new international operations and charges related to annual salary increase led to higher operating costs.  The result was an operating income of 26%.</p>
          <p>In a reversal of the prior two quarters, lower operating income was largely offset by positive financial expenses.  The lower pace of revaluation of the real against the dollar reduced financial expense or exchange variation related to our net asset position on foreign subsidiaries, while disbursement of the BNDES loan index to dollars created a substantial gain and net monetary variation.</p>
          <p>The decrease in minority interest expenses from R$1.9 billion to R$928 million is also a result of the real's slowing appreciation.  Also affect the sequential financial result was the R$533 million improvement in the financial expense from commercial hedges.</p>
          <p>Hedging gains or losses are largely offset by higher or lower costs of goods during the period, which in turn decreases or increases the operating income.  For the third quarter, operating income was decreased relative to the second quarter because of the positive financial results from the hedge in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Income tax in the third quarter was higher because of higher deduction for interest on capital, greater recuperation of financial credits related to exploration activities and fiscal losses abroad in the second quarter.  The net profit for the quarter was R$7.3 billion, a decline of 5.6 from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>Higher international price compounded by the decrease in the light-heavy differential contributed positively to our Brazilian Exploration and Production segment's earnings.  Higher cost of goods sold were primarily the result of the lifting costs, including production taxes.  The R$2.04 billion provisioning of the Marlim special participation tax caused a substantial increase in operational expense and reduced operating income when compared with the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Next, please.  Operating income for our Brazilian Downstream segment was reduced as the Brazilian realization price have fallen to the international levels.  Higher volumes were offset by lower average prices and cost of goods sold was a reflection of the decreases in international price, partially offset by the increased benefit from cost averaging.</p>
          <p>The absence of programmed maintenance during the quarter reduced unit refining costs and contributed to a utilization rate of 94% during the period.  Our Gas &amp; Energy segment generated its second consecutive quarter of positive operating income despite limited thermoelectric generation.  The gain was largely a result of greater availability of natural gas and more developed gas infrastructure.</p>
          <p>As capacity to deliver gas increases the segment has more flexibility to capture incremental revenue and profits from power and natural gas sales.  The growing supply and the infrastructure has also eliminated the contractual penalties, which adversely impacted earnings in the past.</p>
          <p>The improvement in the International segment was due largely to growing production, particularly in Nigeria, offsetting declining production elsewhere.  Higher price and reduced operating costs also contribute to higher operating income.</p>
          <p>Our Distribution segment continued to demonstrate these steady results and margins, generating R$620 million in operating income with a retaining market share of 38%.  Capital spending increased to R$50.7 billion during the first nine months of 2009, a 49% increase from the same period a year earlier, 46% spending was for domestic E&amp;P and the remainder for our integrated operations.  Gas &amp; Energy spending nearly doubled as it works to complete the gas infrastructure in Brazil.</p>
          <p>During 2009 Petrobras has contracted $34.8 billion of additional debt to meet the financial needs as required by our business plan.  The bulk of this amount raised is long-term funding from the BNDES and the Chinese Development Bank.</p>
          <p>The average life of all this financing that has been contracted so far is 10.6 year, what gives the company a lot of comfort.  Additionally, we completed our repayment of a two-year $6.5 billion commercial bank bridge loan contracted at the beginning of 2009.  We had two years to do that, but we were happy to do it during the course of 2009.</p>
          <p>We continue to sell by tapping the bond market in October for $2.5 billion of 10-year note and 1.5 billion of 30 years note.  Total debt increased by R$22 billion during the quarter.  Virtually all of this increase in debt was held in cash with a cash balance of R$30 billion on September 30.</p>
          <p>The relatively small increase in the net debt to cap &#x2013; our net debt to capital ratio at 28%, well within our target of 25 to 35 with the contracting cost for additional long-term obligation.  Short-term debt as a percentage of total debt fell to 11%.</p>
          <p>Our accumulated operating cash flow during the first nine months of 2009 was R$4 billion more than the same period of 2008, despite substantially lower oil prices.  Higher capital spending and dividends have led to the expected funding gap for this year, which have been fully covered.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we have built up a substantial cash position.  These figures do not yet reflect the loan from the Chinese Development Bank.  We have also managed to extend the average life of the total debt from 4.2 to 6.4 years, which will extend further when the recent four billion bond issue is factored in.</p>
          <p>To conclude the discussion of our financial results, I think it is important to emphasize our commitment to a sound capital structure.  We still have much to do not only to achieve the targets in our existing business plan, but to take advantage of new opportunities that are sure to arise as Brazil's economy expands and as we continue to realize Brazil's hydrocarbon potential.</p>
          <p>To meet the needed capital requirement, the Executive has proposed a capitalization of Petrobras, as well as the acquisition of the rights to produce up to five billion barrels of oil.  The bill has passed the special commission within the lower house in the congress and it will now be debated before the general assembly of the lower house.  Afterwards it's going to be addressed to the upper house.</p>
          <p>So far the response to the proposed capitalization position has been very positive from the congress, from the Brazilian society and from our shareholders.  We remain optimistic about its passage and execution next year.</p>
          <p>Thank you.  With that, I will be happy to answer any questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Our first question will come from Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein.  Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question.  I've got two questions really, one is looking at the exploration and the appraisal program over the next few quarters, could you go into some detail on what are the large wells we should be looking out for in the next few quarters and any new drilling tests that are likely to come up beyond the early production scheme?  And I've got a follow-up question as well.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will have Molinari from E&amp;P to help me in this question.  Please, Molinari?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the exploration side we will continue to drill on BMS-9, 10 and 11.  We added this season four new drilling rigs in the first half of 2010 and two orders in the second half of 2010 to continue the program and our main target in the pre-salt of those areas I mentioned, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And in terms of well flow rates, from what you have seen so far, are you happy that you think that a sustained rate of around 20,000 barrels a day may be the production, initial production rate from the pre-salt, from what you've seen so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We are producing 20,000 barrels per day in the extended well test of Tupi and we are still limited to our forecast that we are allowed to share.  So we are ahead so far with this result.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us an estimate of what you think the potential would be if you were not constrained on gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This not restricted production.  We'll have a better idea when we install the pilot system in December 2010, because at that time we will have a gas pipeline to Michigan platform.  So we will not have this <mark type="audio gap" />.  So we have to wait a little bit until then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  It just would be useful for modeling purposes, given your capital raising coming up for purchasing some of the government's reserves if we could get a good idea of what the sustained initial flow rate would be in a net production, a full production setting, that's all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We cannot anticipate that, but all the information we have collected so far giving us a very positive indication that the tests we've run in Guar&#xE1;, for example, that was able to produce more than 50,000 barrels per day, and in Tupi, the extended well tests we were able to get the approval of E&amp;P to go to 20,000 barrels and it responded very well.  But how much we can go beyond that, we don't have this information handy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Our next question will come from Marcus Sequeira from Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, everyone.  Just two questions, one is on the capitalization.  I know this structure is going to be done in two parts, and actually capitalization is the second part, but I was just wondering if you have any conversations with the CVM with regards to this transaction?  And the second question is on natural gas, if you could talk a little bit about natural gas demand plans for the next couple of years, given the fact that today demand is pretty weak and you expect a large increase in gas production, so what are your plans for, let's say, five years from now in terms of commercialization of natural gas?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the capitalization, we have no contact so far.  We have all the regulation that CVM has issued and we are committed to follow, of course, all of them, but there is no need, no need we had so far to have the contact with CVM.  Regarding the natural gas production future demand value, I will ask my colleague from Gas &amp; Energy to help me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For us, five years is a quite long period because we don't know for sure, and the prospect of production of natural gas in the new field.  But what we expect is that, for example, the demand in this respect will come back from the previous period after the crisis, and we believe that it can go about like the GDP.  We also believe that the thermoelectrical generation, the power plants that are gas-fired, they are going to play a more much important role in the power generation in Brazil.  So we believe that in the next years, probably some of that generation could be a kind of base load.</p>
          <p>We also are looking for new ways to incur possible growth in supply of natural gas from E&amp;P, so we are looking in some kind of fertilizer plant optimizing, we have two fertilizer plants and we're looking to optimize these two plants so they can grow their consumptions in the short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, just one follow-up on electricity, what's your position in this spot market?  Because I remember the last quarter one of the reasons why your results were positive, it was because, if I remember correctly, that spot prices were very low, but in this quarter you guys say that spot prices being low is actually bad for Petrobras.  So I'd just like to understand if, with spot price being low, you could just buy from spot market and not dispatch from your plants?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is quite confusing, because in the same way that the low price in the spot markets do an improvement in our commercialization income, also is that they also are a reflection that the thermogeneration plants are not dispatching.  So what we tried to say in the comparison of second quarter and third quarter is that the low demand in thermogeneration plants is a reflection of the low price in the spot market.  The spot market in the last quarter is a kind of minimum price.  This is a reflection that there was practical moderation and this impacts our generation.</p>
          <p>But we compensate partly that loss in comparison with the second quarter with the improvement in our margins in the contractual business, because as you know, you have some power selling agreements that were linking this gas with the spot market.  So what we try to balance is our position day-by-day in with the objective to maximize our results, so depending the spot market, the price probably would hurt the generational side, but in the commercialization side, that's a good position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Hi, guys, wondering if we're looking at in your last year's offshore basin, the equatorial margin, can you tell us what sort of acreage position that you have there and any drilling plan for the next 12 to 18 months?</p>
          <p>The second question is that I want to see is there any update what is the 2010 CapEx program, are we still talking about 35, $36 billion, or that may have changed?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  In the equatorial margin, we are going to drill other well in Bahadinas, in the Bahadinas area.  It's deepwater; we have not found oil so far in that area.  We have drilled one well, but we are going back there to evaluate the potential of that area.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so far in the one well and also the seismic that you guys are looking at, have you seen the trend or the structure, and also then maybe the source of raw uptake fundamentally different than what we've seen in the offshore Ghana trend, or that they have a pretty close similarity?</p>

But we have an average of $35 billion, if you take our business plan as a base.  It may change a little bit up or down, depending on the level of activity, but what is expected is that range.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  I have also two questions, the first one on the topic of flow rates.  You mentioned in the case of Tupi and the extended well test that you were able to negotiate with E&amp;P so as to be able to increase the production there a little bit to 20 versus the 15,000 barrels from before.  Does that mean that between now and December 2010 when you have the pilots starting, that we could see maybe this is happening again and therefore see the flow rates that you're getting out of the extended well tests actually increase beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Molinari, you have some information on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The extended well test is limited to the amount of gas.  We reduce in other areas the gas barrier in order to be allowed to increase the production to 20,000 barrels per day in the extended route there.  But the pilot system will be irrelevant, because then we will have a gas pipeline to shore, to basically on-platform, and we will have no restriction on the gas barrier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And how much cushioning have you left between when the pipeline is expected to be finished next year and the actual beginning of production of the pilot program?  Because that's a key part of this, right, if you don't get the pipeline done in time, you may run into similar limitations in terms of how much you can produce at the pilot?  So how many months have you left between your expected conclusion of the pipeline and the actual beginning of the production of the pilot program at Tupi, more or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The pipeline, the gas pipeline will be led by technique in the first half of 2010, so we have some months to December.  We have some time before the pilot starts.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Okay.  And the second question was related to the rights offering, on the press release, on the CEO's statement, you mentioned that given the size of the capitalization and its magnitude and importance, that you have been fine-tuning your corporate governance procedures so as to allow for better transparency.  Can you, I was just curious, can you mention are there any specific things that you've done already, when you say fine-tuning your corporate governance, are there any examples or anything you can give us some color on that you've already adjusted to make this an even more transparent process?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you, good morning.  I have two questions about the pre-salt in the Tupi cluster area, first one on BM-S-11, it seems you have concluded a formation test in Tupi Northeast with a recent announcement, also there are works taking place in <mark type="inaudible" />.  I would like to understand whether this formation test would enable the Company to start work with a higher recoverable volume estimate for the Tupi discovery or if they only confirm what has been already said?  In other words, should we continue to look at five to eight billion barrels or maybe closer to eight billion barrels now or eventually more than eight billion barrels now and whether this different prospects, Tupi Northeast, Tupi, Tupi Sud, they are one single area or they are insulated prospects?  That's one question.</p>
          <p>The second question is about BM-S-9, we had statements from Repsol over the weekend that <mark type="inaudible" /> itself is probably over 700 million barrels peak and the whole area could be, could have somewhere between two and six billion barrels.  I know you had Guar&#xE1; at 1.1 to two billion barrels, but from Repsol's statement the rest of the block could still have another four billion barrels at least, so could you comment on these numbers and what's your take on that block as well?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The result that we have in the BM-S-11, that confirms the volume between five to eight billion barrels of oil equivalent as we mentioned in the release that we made after the test.  Regarding volumes in Carioca, BM-S-9, we have not evaluated yet and we have not bring numbers to this area so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  On BM-S-11, can you elaborate a bit more because the difference from five to eight million barrels, if I'm not mistaken, was attributed to different layers in the reservoir.  Now with the formation test you probably have more information about the different layers, so does that bring any higher confidence that we are in the upper part of the range or not yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.  I have two quick questions, the first one, just I was looking back at my notes, the second quarter you seemed to indicate that in 20 days we might have some kind of indication from Iara and about 45 days some kind of indication from Guar&#xE1; and the Guar&#xE1; press release has come out a long time ago, but we've heard really no update from you guys on Iara.  I was wondering if you could give us some kind of indication on that front?  And the second question just with regards to the mapping out of the five billion barrels and the wells that are yet to be drilled along with E&amp;P, I just wanted to understand from a step-to-step basis is this something that has to happen before you kick off your capital increase or is it not correlated?  Do you need to have the results from the wells before you do that or is it something that you guys don't see as linked to one another?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gattass, we are working with E&amp;P to find the spots where we are going to drill the two wells we are planning to drill for better evaluation of the light; transferring light to produce up to five billion barrels of pipe, transporting <mark type="inaudible" /> Brazil to Petrobras.  So we don't have yet the location and the timing we expect to finish in the course of the first half of next year when we expect to have the transaction done.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Barbassa, just so that I understand, is whatever the result you get at the well going to be something that needs to be taken into account before you do the transaction or not?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  The drilling is going to add new information that is going to be taken into consideration, but don't forget that we have the option to reevaluate the oil that is being transferred in the future, so these are not the only information that will be added.  These are important information, but not the ones that will complete this test.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, everybody.  I have a couple of questions, one is when I look at the ramp up for 2010 production and the three platforms that you still are ramping up it looks like P-53 and P-51 are on track when I look at the wells connected so far relative to the target.  But I'm curious to understand what is happening, if anything, in Cidade de Niter&#xF3;i you have not connected any new well since the first quarter and it looks like the second well you connected there has by far a much lower productivity than your first well?  And I'll leave it at that with the first question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Cidade de Niter&#xF3;i, we are going to reach the 100,000 barrels per day in the second half of 2010.  In the third quarter it produced about 38,000 barrels per day, but the peak production will be only second half 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I understand that.  Thanks for your answer.  But is there anything that, can you explain why you haven't connected any new well there, is the productivity of the second well being so dramatically different from the one of the first well, is that a cause of concern for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  It's a question of drilling.  We need to drill all the wells before we can increase the production in that system.  It has to go with the pressure of the reservoir, is a technical issue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Thank you.  And just as my second question, I wanted to clarify your area of comments about the number of rigs you have scheduled for 2010, you mentioned that you're expecting a total of six wells in the first half and two in the second, but was I understanding that for the &#x2013; that you had eight rigs scheduled for 2010 and so these new number of six rigs was a little bit of a surprise to me unless there has been any delays or reprogramming that I'm not aware of?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>We have four drilling rigs starting in the beginning of 2010 in the first half, which is one drill space there.  We have Cajun and SS Victoria and was this mid of 2010 or in the beginning of the second quarter.  We have two other drilling rigs may start in production, Lone Star and we have this West Orion from Seadrill and we have orders starting more in the end of 2010, but I don't have here the schedule when they are going to start drilling.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I have two questions on the diesel Santos Basin and firstly on FPSOs.  Your guidance today is for the third FPSO to go on Iara, however, some reports suggest that it may instead go to Iracema, could you comment on that?  And the second question I have is on Guar&#xE1; and Iara regarding gas commercialization, are you going to tie back the Intialio platform as well or how you going to commercialize the gas reserves?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  On the FPSOs question, the first pilot will be Guar&#xE1; in 2013 and the second pilot is not decided yet.  The Guar&#xE1; will be installed, then maybe Iara, maybe other area, maybe Iracema, we haven't decided yet and regarding the gas, we have the possibility to tie back to the Tupi Michigan gas pipeline that will be available in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up maybe on given you've talked about slower rates on Tupi potentially exceeding well above 20,000 barrels per day at the pilot stage once gas production comes on line as well.  Are you changing your guidance in terms of producer and injector wells that need to be drilled, given the higher flow rates expected?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly if you can realize higher flow rates per well then obviously you need fewer producer and injector wells and thereby reducing the CapEx per barrel quite a bit, so I was just wondering whether anything has changed on your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the number of wells that will be connected to each platform, we will prepare them in phases.  It will depend on the pilot for system test that we are going to do in the pilot system.  So we have to wait until we have this information to give us that guidance to the permanent system.  Today the pilot system will have five oil producers and three injectors, will have water injection, gas injection and we may use alternatively water and gas, in the case of gas, natural gas or fuel to improve the recovery of the platform of the two key areas.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  I just wanted a clarification to one of the answers you gave earlier about the rig schedule, did it change because I believe in New York at Barclays you were taking about nine for 2010 and I just was also trying to figure out if there's an additional rig being added if you're still on the same schedule?</p>

For diesel we have &#x2013; to give you an idea, so on the first quarter 158 barrels a day, on the second 714 barrels a day, on the third 752 barrels a day and we expect almost the same on the last quarter.  This shows that the diesel demand is growing as GDP, the new GDP going up.  In gasoline we sold 300 barrels a day on the first quarter, 288 on the second, 291 on the third and we expect to sell a little bit more, 303 barrels a day on the last quarter of this year.</p>

          <p>We don't see any imports in the first half of 2010, most because we see the reservoirs of water in the inter generation and they are full.  So we don't expect any imports from LNG in the first half, but we may contract some just in case.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question will come from Emerson Leite from Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead</p>

          <p>Okay, thank you.  Just a follow-up on the capitalization process, now assuming the project, the draft bill is approved in congress at some point in the second quarter, I guess you mentioned in other occasions that the idea would be to carry out the capital increase a couple months after it's approved in congress.  My question is given the fact that Petrobras is in no need of extra cash at the moment and probably in a year from now you would not be needing cash as well given your CapEx program is fully funded, you have R$30 billion in cash, $10 billion more coming from the Chinese.  So why not waiting or using the full 12 month period that the draft bill allows for the deal to be done and in the meantime get more information about the wells, more information about the barrels and therefore the economics so you can have a more clear cut transaction for the Company and for minorities, so why rushing up and doing it next year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Emerson, we have, as you well know, we have a very large CapEx program and the load has given us some concern in the last year.  So to be in the safe side in terms of liquidity it's very important.  We have very good projects, we have a good prospect of growth, why to put this challenge or why work in a situation where this can be damaged in some way by the international financial system.  So as we have this in hand, the better is to have all the conditions we need to implement it, this is the first point.</p>
          <p>The second point, why to do it as soon as we can is that acquiring up to five billion barrels of oil is not common, is it, in the world today?  This is a very unique opportunity and situation that presents to an oil company.  And the sooner the best in this case.  There are many variables that can have &#x2013; can change with time.  We can, of course, improve the evaluation, but there are other variables in the game also, so it's for that reason it's better to do it as soon as we can.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Barbassa, if that's the case why don't you then do a global offering together with the process instead of just making an offer that is restricted to existing shareholders, why don't you do an open transaction to other investors so you can raise cash with everyone that is really willing to participate in the story and strengthening even further your capital base?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, privilege the current share owners and second, we believe that doing, following this track, this way, we'll be able to raise all the money we need, so these are important issues for the Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And how much money do you think you need?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More the better, yeah, but of course there is some I cannot tell you, but there is the most probable figure that is expected and this is what we think is enough for the time being.</p>
