        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome. I've got the executive team with me here today. I've got David Thorburn on the phone from the U.K. and Andrew Thorburn on the phone from New Zealand. You may notice that Nehemiah is not here anymore, he has taken on another role within our business, which is great. <mark type="ph" /> Craig Hollen (0:21) will be coordinating with Dave. But you might have also noticed Ross Brown somewhere in the audience, who most of you all know, over in the back, and pleased to announce Ross is our new Head of Investor Relations. So you will probably see him at the quarterly update.</p>
          <p>Fairly typical agenda for the day. I'll go through the presentation. Mark will go through the detail and then will go into Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>This is a good result. Cash earnings are up 19.2% on the year to $5.5 billion, driven by strong revenue momentum from our banking businesses, disciplined management of costs with positive jaws and improving asset quality. And we have on a strong balance sheet position with a Tier 1 ratio of 9.7% and the strength of liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Our ROE has improved 200 basis points to 15.2%. We've increased our dividend, bringing the full year dividend to 172 cents. It demonstrates that we have set the right strategy for the Group. We continue to execute well against that strategy and we are in a far better position as an organization to face what is an increasingly uncertain macro environment. We continue to make decisions and invest in the future of our business and continue to deal with whatever external challenges we face. And this approach is reflected in this year's result and in what we've achieved since 2009.</p>
          <p>If you look at the economic outlook, clearly we think Australia remains very strong, and although there is short-term uncertainty. The United Kingdom obviously has played a more difficult part of our portfolio but we are pleased with the result in the U.K. this year and there is still obviously issues with the interest rates being at all time low.</p>
          <p>New Zealand recovery is underway. The housing market is soft, but it continues to improve. There is high commodity pricing there, which is helping exporters. And obviously the main risk, like Australia, in New Zealand remains in what will happen with the U.K. economy.</p>
          <p>The United States is continuing a slow recovery. The risk of recession, we believe, is receding but it's not absent. Whilst there is soft labor market data and the unemployment rate does remain high. And China, which is obviously such a critical driver of Australian economic activity, we do feel that there is robust domestic activity. There is easing inflation and the recent GDP numbers look relatively strong.</p>
          <p>We have strong progress against our strategic priorities. The balance sheet is significantly strengthened. Since March 2009 our Tier-I capital ratio has improved 130 basis points. The SFI ratio, the stable funding index ratio, is 7 percentage points higher with a majority of the growth coming from customer deposits. And the liquidity levels are well in excess of pre-crisis levels.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency agenda is progressing well. Our focus on driving efficiencies through sustainable cost management and process simplification continue to deliver. The transformation of the Group's mortgage process saw significant improvements with the conversion rates improving from 59% to 64% and loan documentation dramatically reduced 60 pages to four, as an example. And the re-platforming of the bank continues.</p>
          <p>Our People, Culture and Reputation agenda remains very important. Reputation as an organization has also improved. The innovative Breakup Campaign has highlighted the many ways we've changed the way we do business with our customers. Our Personal Bank customers' satisfaction is now ahead of the average of the peers and is the highest it's been for 15 years. And the reputation of the Business Bank has been further strengthened through its unwavering commitment to relationship banking and support of its customers during the crisis and beyond. MLC and NAB Wealth led the way in its efforts to improve trust and transparency in financial planning. And we have a higher staff engagement than before, driven by our continued investment in our people.</p>
          <p>With regard to the portfolio, the realignment of the portfolio has delivered substantial returns with Personal Banking now a credible competitor in retail banking, with 600,000 new customers and cash earnings 6.5% higher than it was at the end of 2009. The Australian business continues to gain market share in an increasingly difficult and competitive market.</p>
          <p>Wholesale Banking successfully refocused on supporting the core franchise and is demonstrating good momentum in its customer businesses. Internationally, New Zealand and Great Western Bank are both providing good returns in equity. Solid progress has been made on improving the returns in the U.K. and our commitment to run-off our SGA portfolio has now fallen 35% to $11 billion.</p>
          <p>Whilst we are very pleased with progress so far, we still have much to do. At a group level we remain focused on the transition to Basel III, looking at ways to optimize our balance sheet and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We will continue to invest in our infrastructure and IT to build a sustainable long-term business while staying vigilant on costs. And we'll look to maintain our market leadership positions or close the gap to our competitors, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, which continues to be our focus.</p>
          <p>We presented this slide at the half-year and it outlines the core areas of our multi-year, multi-layer transformation program currently underway. Infrastructure and Network Transformation, which is about getting infrastructure layer right and ensuring the plumbing and wiring are in place. You may recall that was 28% completed at the half year, it's now 100% complete.</p>
          <p>The Re-platforming Program, which is the core application layer that builds the functionality across Core Banking, such as products, enterprise systems and customer facing systems. This is what is referred to as NextGeneration. It includes the underlying database, analytic and delivery engines, product engines and end-user applications that are built and implemented over time. Progress is very good since we reported the half-year <mark type="ph" /> we reported the (6:22) general ledger, securitization engine and the customer relationship engine.</p>
          <p>And the customer process transformation, this represents the business processes and people capabilities required to effectively deliver the customer experience at the front end. So since the half-year, as I've mentioned, the current achievements have been completing the network modernization upgrade, the implementation of the new general ledger financial system and the deploying of additional functionality and the securitization engine, which will be very important to support our securitization &#x2013; sorry, our funding strategy.</p>
          <p>In 2012, the key priorities include progressing the payment system replacement, implementing a "single customer view" capability and continuing to extend UBank's capability, amongst other priorities.</p>
          <p>If I turn to the outlook, I'm trying to find an intelligent way of saying I have no idea what's going to happen, but I would say in closing that we are in a much stronger position. The things that we can control, we can control. Things that are outside of our control are obviously, are outside of our control. We are in a much stronger position and far better place to respond. We have a well-established executive team that's fully engaged in delivering a stable strategic agenda.</p>
          <p>We will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities. We'll remain discipline on costs with a bias to positive jaws, and while I'm optimistic about the future, the global economic environment remains volatile and the outlook is obviously uncertain.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll now hand over to Mark, who will take you through the result in detail.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Cameron. As you will quickly realize I've got a lazy facial nerve at the moment, so that's probably going to make me even less articulate than usual. So I'll try and do my best to make sure it doesn't affect your enjoyment of the occasion. So as Cameron indicated, a solid result for the year, very much in line with the quarterly trend that we've been reporting and delivered despite some fourth quarter volatility, which you are all aware of. For the year, there is a strong pickup at all lines including strong jaws and falling B&amp;DD.</p>
          <p>We have higher ROE despite continued and quite substantial capital gathering and a stable NIM. So that's all a good shape I think. You might say that the second half perhaps exhibits these things less clearly, but you do tend to get more volatility when you shorten the periods. So looking at the second half, I think the notable things are that the NII growth is still strong. In fact it's accelerating. You've got 7.7% NII growth in the second half, which is faster than the year as a whole, and this compares with balance sheet growth of about 5% in the half.</p>
          <p>The softness in the second half is in OOI and it's very much related to the market gyrations that we experienced particularly in August. So we've seen a swing in the <mark type="ph" /> CSOs (9:24) from a positive $58 million in the first half to a negative $84 million in the second. So that's $142 million swing or thereabouts. And also the sudden is a Six Sigma event in August with the market suddenly pricing in something like 150 basis points of rate cuts, and it's very hard to say exactly what would have been and what was, but we estimate that the &#x2013; given the momentum that the trading and treasury businesses had on the risk side in the first four months of the quarter, that probably took about $200 million of revenue out of the second half. So you can have &#x2013; so absent those factors you'd also have growth in ROI in the second half.</p>
          <p>Expenses fell 0.2% and we had continued downward trend in bad and doubtful debts. The only conscious adjustment we've made in B&amp;DD was to reverse the $75 million flood provision that we took in the first half, which wasn't taken in the businesses, it was taken at Group and was reversed at Group in the second half on the basis that the actual customer experience will by now have been showing through in the underlying experience of the business. And then in the ratios there below cash earnings, probably the most notable thing is that the core capital generation of 46 basis points in the second half is higher even than the 32 basis points that we recorded for the first half.</p>
          <p>Looking at the NIM, it's a fairly simple story on the NIM, no real surprises. We moved from 223 at the half to 228, and really two things are substantial and two are really noise I think. The lending margin has improved four basis points and you'll see particularly in the Business Bank and the Personal Bank that there was re-pricing activity. Our growth has come disproportionately in mortgages and mortgages, as you know, are a low-margin product, so we lose one basis point in the mix for that. And the treasury market three basis point up tick is really just noise between the NII and the OOI line, which tends to happen when you have a strong Aussie dollar. And as you will see we've been boosting our liquid holdings and we'll probably maintain them at higher levels, which increases the footings and actually spreads the margin across a bigger asset base, so that gives you a negative one there.</p>
          <p>For the individual businesses, Business Bank has had a good half on NIM, continuing the rise to 257 to 266 and that's a combination of pricing and some good strategies around the deposit mix. In the Personal Bank we've got some decay there, which is partly the growing in mortgages offset by getting a full six month affect of the re-pricing done last December, but also because the asset side is growing faster than the &#x2013; certainly the lower end of customer deposits. You get an averaging up in the cost of funds supporting that book.</p>
          <p>In the U.K. the NIM is flat, which is a good outcome because we did see a reemergence of basis risk in the U.K. given all the ructions going on in Europe, but we have effectively hedged that exposure so we were able to sustain our margins there. And New Zealand is doing very well on margins as that market is switching from fixed rate mortgage products to variable, in particular, a trend that will probably continue until at least it's clear the RBNZ is moving to increase rates.</p>
          <p>All that said, we would say that we would expect pressure on NIM going forward. Certainly wholesale funding costs are higher and only to some extent are senior debt markets open. We've seen the basis risk in the below IRS swaps and the like increase and these things tend to move out quite quickly and to come back much more slowly.</p>
          <p>We also have heightened competition for assets in Australia given our low credit growth, ongoing competition for deposits as we all position for Basel III. And the higher level and improving move to higher quality mix in the liquids is also going to create a headwind. So, there will be plenty of pressure on the NIMs going forward.</p>
          <p>As you know, we're trying as best we can to manage the business to jaws and I suppose we only achieve jaws technically in the second half with zero revenue growth and minus two in expenses. But in actual fact, we are quite pleased with the outcome and underlying it's quite strong. So, you see down in the bottom left hand corner there, if we just take the SCDO, the FX doesn't have much impact because it affects both lines of course, then the revenue growth is 2.3% in the half and 0.6% at the expense line, giving jaws 1.7%, which is quite healthy. And then if you chose to attribute anything to the decline in risk income you could convince yourself that the underlying was stronger than that still.</p>
          <p>So we do remain committed to positive jaws, but that also will have its challenges. As we all know credit growth is fairly muted at the moment. We do expect some up tick next year, but we've expected that for a while. And although most of the franchises are gaining share, so we're not necessarily tied to what's going on in aggregate credit demand. But I think more importantly, we got to recognize that we've got a pig in the python going through in terms of our technology investment. You can see in the bottom right there our investments spend, which is now running at levels quite well above the sort of 800 to 900 norms that we've talked about in the past. And the blue section of that, the 62%, really describes what's going on around infrastructure and re-platforming the banking systems. So, a lot of that's finding its way in to capitalized software. Our capitalized software is up $250 million versus September 10. That's still in the range of peers, but eventually that's going to find its way through to things like depreciation. So, as we go through this transition, there will be output pressure on cost and in a soft operating environment that means we have to be particularly vigilant in order to continue to deliver positive jaws, but that is our intent. I'm just highlighting some of the pressures.</p>
          <p>One final thing on this absent foreign exchange, the year-on-year cost growth was about 4%. So, it tends to get disguised in these presentations. Turning then to the business contributions and the drivers, the Business Bank had a strong half, 5% revenue growth, 0.7% cost growth, strong NIM that we've already touched on, and 7% cash earnings growth for the half. The only blot in the performance there was the B&amp;DDs, which rose 8%, and you'll remember at the quarter we said they had ticked up and that's coming mostly from the SME segment.</p>
          <p>The business achieved 2% growth in GLAs, about 0.8% growth in business lending itself, the rest coming really in mortgages, which allowed it to continue to gain market share, because while it grew 0.8%, it looks like sector contracted about 0.25%. So, steady share gains from that franchise continued despite of course very strong competition in that sector. And this business combined with the capabilities and contribution from the Wholesale Bank is now number one in loan syndication, which is for the first time since 2001. So it's really getting back into its stride.</p>
          <p>On the asset quality side, the 90 days past due fell marginally and certainly we felt inside the business that the arrival rate of new problem loans has certainly slowed. But the impaired assets are up, reflecting mainly commercial property, especially in Queensland, and the structural changes that are underway in the economy with the strong Aussie dollar and changing consumer spending patterns. So we would anticipate that bad debts coming out of the Business Bank would remain fairly sticky and high for now, but we certainly don't see them on an upwards trend at this stage.</p>
          <p>Similarly, the Personal Bank had a strong half, 5% revenue growth, 1% cost, giving 9% of the underlying profit. The NIM was down, as we touched on earlier. B&amp;DDs were also down 15%, really being the reversal effect that we highlighted at the half. If you remember we talked about interruptions to collections, holidays on credit cards and these sorts of things that gave rise to a bit of a bump in the B&amp;DDs for Personal Bank and that's really &#x2013; to the extent it's going to reverse it's reversed and normalized in the second half. So all of that combined to give the Personal Bank a 16% cash earnings growth over the half</p>
          <p>And then to these two exhibits, I think we were very pleased to see that the Personal Bank has now closed the customer satisfaction gap on the average of the peers. It's very slightly higher in the last results, 78.5%. These things are volatile and you never declare victory on it, but certainly that negative differentiate has been effectively dealt with. And also on the mortgage flows we don't necessarily expect the business to keep going at this multiple system, particularly given more competitor interest in the area, but nevertheless it has remained strong, growing at 3.2 times the system and bringing the market share to 14.4%.</p>
          <p>The two businesses that perhaps had a more difficult time were Wholesale Banking and the Wealth franchise. Wholesale had a strong half actually in every respect except one and that one was enough to bring about a 32% decline in cash earnings to $268 million. So on the positive side the customer income was up strongly and you'll see in the top left there, the dark blue portion. But the customer income, which is coming from specialty finance, debt capital markets, custody and the sales part of the markets business, that was up quite substantially, reflecting a more effective cross-selling to the Business Bank for risk products, some strong franchise win rates in specialist finance and debt capital markets and some share gains in asset servicing.</p>
          <p>But the risk income, at the top there, was substantially reduced in the half, and again if you look back through time, you can see that we typically get about 400 out of that and that also that outcome also points to about a $200 million gap in the second half. So hopefully the customer momentum will be sustained and the risk income will normalize in subsequent periods and we'll start to see some of that strength showing through.</p>
          <p>MLC and NAB Wealth, like its peers, has also had a difficult period with cash earnings down 13% pre-IROE to $234 million. You can see in the bottom left there that the equity market gains of the first half were very much given up or more than given up in the second half, which of course is major driver of revenues. And I would say that these market gyrations we've been through are likely to keep discretionary flows weak and put any recovery on that back maybe 12 or 18 months at least.</p>
          <p>Insurance claims remained above historic norms, and there has been an increase in the lapse rate of certain types of insurance for various reasons. And insurance sales slowed, pending new product releases, but pleasingly at the end of the period a new suite of insurance products was launched. And I think has been well received.</p>
          <p>So, as well as that on the positive side and you can see in the bottom right, advisor numbers have grown very strongly, probably stronger than at any other time in the company's history, up 300 over the last 12 months, with most of the exists being retirees of people leaving the industry, probably in response to the FoFA reforms. MLC also implemented the migration of MasterKey Custom to the more exciting MLC Wrap on the navigator technology, which again has been well received with all the customers and $9 billion of funds being successfully transferred across. That's the largest such transference ever attempted in Australia.</p>
          <p>In the main, the international businesses performed well in the half. New Zealand was up 16% in cash earnings with expanded NIM, positive jaws and falling B&amp;DD. There we still hold the earthquake provision overlay of NZD60 million, really because we haven't yet seen how Christchurch is going to recover and to play out. But otherwise all the lead indicators on asset quality in New Zealand was sharply improved. The U.K. also picked up, was up 38% in cash earnings, stable NIM, as I said before on positive jaws in that business, and despite only a small improvement in its bad debts. Now, we did take a GPB100 million PPI, provision in the second half, which we put outside of cash earnings. And so, part of the pick up between the first half and the second half is that the first half pre-tax expense of GPB14 million will not recur in the second half, instead it went against the provision. Both these businesses had negligible balance sheet growth, although the U.K. mortgage growth was strong by local standards and the business did pick up some share.</p>
          <p>GWB was slightly improved ex the Tier 1 acquisition accounting. There are some quite volatile factors in the way we have to account for the asset pools that we have acquired in that acquisition, but underlying half on half GWB was slightly up. The gross impaired assets were up quite a bit in GWB, but that's not driving bad debt expense, because it relates to a small number of accounts that were already appropriately provisioned.</p>
          <p>And then finally, SGA, lower cash earnings in the second half. That's okay, this is not a business we are trying to grow, we are trying to shrink it. And so, as we run off good accounts, the NII does fall, so that's down 11% in the second half. And it's also of course materially affected the SCDO marks swing from positive to negative, which is $142 million as I said pre-tax swing between the halves. The expenses in the B&amp;DDs were essentially flat. So as Cameron said, we're now about a bit over a third of the way through the runoff. It's slightly flattered on &#x2013; including FX it looks like we are more like 45% of the way through I think. But in substance, we are just over a third of the way through and the runoff will probably be slow from here. But at the same time we have been de-risking the portfolio. So it will become I think less of an earnings drag and perhaps continue as an ROE drag, but one that should get smaller over time.</p>
          <p>As all of you know, we exited the risk of four of the SCDOs that, of the six that we hold, during the period. We did write off the hedge premier associated with those as we indicated we would do in our last MD&amp;A. So that gave rise to $127 million charge in non-cash earnings. And we have got $140 million of hedge premium on a pre-tax basis still left in the balance sheet related to the remaining two instruments, which we would still like to exit at some stage, but we remain very comfortable with the underlying credit. There have been no credit events in the pools for very long time and we will wait for market conditions to be attractive to enable us to do that. The economic costs with existing these instruments doesn't affect the P&amp;L because it was basically already reflected in the mark to markets.</p>
          <p>On the Group asset quality, a very familiar picture actually. The bad and doubtful debts charged is falling down to $834 million. You can see that the specifics are up slightly and there are some releases on the collectives. That is not a conscious effort on our part to release collectives. It's simply model driven. It's some customers who driving high collectives switching over into impaired and so that swings across to the specific side. It's some improvement in the average credit quality in the portfolio and so on. But other than the $75 million reversal for the flood overlay we've done nothing to the discretionary areas of collective provisioning.</p>
          <p>You can see on the top right that the bad and doubtful debt expense at now 38 basis points is below the 1980 to 2010 average, the long-term average, but it's still well above what was a relatively benign period, '94 through 2007, but we are kind of getting back in the range. And so we might see some improvement from here, but given that a lot of it's now being driven out of the Business Bank in the U.K. I think it's likely to be quite sticky.</p>
          <p>The lead indicators smartly improved, the 90 day passed due and GIA is down 15 basis points to 1.77% and the categorized assets are still falling and the coverage has remained strong. We put a new exhibit in here on the bottom right, which shows the seasoning of the mortgage portfolios on a year of being written basis.</p>
          <p>So this shows cumulatively what percentage of the mortgages you wrote in a year missed at least one payment. And so the first three years, '06, '07, '08, show the typical experience, which normally peaks at about 36 months where you get somewhere between 4% and 5% that have had some kind of delinquency. And you can see in the '09s, '10s, and '11s the quality of the mortgages that we're writing today that are seasoning at least twice as well as the normal experience.</p>
          <p>On our capital position under the current calculation rules, the capital ratio has continued to strengthen. The Tier 1 is up now to 9.7%. It's up 79 basis points over the year, 51 in the half and importantly as the attention turns more to the core Tier 1 ratio is now up to 7.6%. And the main reason of this is the core capital generation in the business itself, where you can see the profits, less the dividend and we do assume about 40% participation in the DRP in this, and that we grew the balance sheet but actually managed to reduce the RWAs in the period. So, combination of that seized core capital generation about 72 basis points.</p>
          <p>We do &#x2013; we are under-issued on hybrids. So we do have the capacity to issue about another $1.5 billion of hybrids, which would add about 40 basis points to that pale blue on the right hand side, but we are waiting for further clarity on our first approach to the Basel III hybrids before we contemplate that issuance.</p>
          <p>There are also some sub-debt that will mature during FY '12 and again we will look at issuances for about $900 million. But ironically by pushing up the core capital the way we are, it's actually reducing the appetite for sub-debt because the total capital ratio is remaining strong for that reason.</p>
          <p>The regulatory reforms I think are well know to you. We really think about them in these two camps, the capital reforms and the funding and liquidity reforms. On the core Tier 1 you just saw we were at 7.58. APRA have come down with their draft pronouncements around the Australian calculation with the main differences being an increased deduction for the NTA of Wealth and removal of the need to accrue the dividend in the calculation, which are largely offsetting adjustments in our case. So we currently estimate that under the APRA calculation our core Tier 1 would be 7.13% and on the international calculation for international comparability about 8.71%. So a combination of this improved position and the strong capital generation in the business, we continue to feel that we're very well placed on the capital side to move into compliance.</p>
          <p>On the funding and liquidity, there are two things to be accomplished on that side. One is compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio by the beginning of 2015 and the other is the net stable funding ratio by beginning of '18. Again, APRA has consultation underway and we'll get more clarity around these things, but meanwhile our focus is on LCR compliance. So, you won't necessarily see it in our ratios, but we're improving the quality of deposits within the mix and we're changing the composition as well as the level of the liquid assets as we trend towards what we think is an attainable position. And then as you know APRA will allow access to a reserve bank facility to complete the compliance.</p>
          <p>So that's moving at pace. And the challenge on the NSFR remains, but working on LCR transition does help to deal with that because terming out is part of the LCR requirement in any case. And now of course, we're going to move to taking covered bonds to issuance, which should allow us to start to bite into the back book issues on that front as well.</p>
          <p>We had a well-executed funding plan during the year, so our Group stable funding index has continued to improve despite the balance sheet growth, now at 85%. We've come an enormous way on this. I think just when I joined the bank or just before the business that had been somewhere in the high 50s on this measure. So we've come further than we've got to go, but anyway despite the growth we're nudging in a positive direction.</p>
          <p>You can see on the top right that we're continuing to emphasize longer tenor where that's available. And despite some periods of market difficulty we still manage to execute above our plan actually and get $32 billion issued, and you can see the importance of secured funding starting to come back. We did get some RMBS done and we've uncovered bonds already out of New Zealand. So I expect secured to play a more significant role for a while. And then on the right hand side you can see the liquid asset holdings moving to a much higher level. Part of that is market conditions and part of that is a conscious effort on our part to build a transition portfolio that puts us on the right path.</p>
          <p>If we focus on  the return on equity, which is our most important measure internally, for the half we're up only 10 basis points, but you can see that generally the businesses have all contributed positively to the ROE outcome, so the Group effect to Business Bank, Personal Bank is basically a 1% uplift and the international business is contributing. And then what we hope is temporary weakness in Wealth Management and the Wholesale Bank, largely offsetting that. But I think there are positive signs underneath that there is good ROE momentum in the core businesses. And as a proxy for it at the divisional level down below, you can see the return on average RWAs and you can see a similar picture there, but it does give you a sense of the drag from the U.K., albeit a diminishing one, and some of the volatility and the drag in SGA, although as I said before the whole objective is to shrink that.</p>
          <p>So to echo some of Cameron's comments, we'd say there is solid momentum in the banking businesses economically and strategically. We're managing our expense growth to positive jaws, while continuing to invest quite deliberately in our capabilities and efficiency. But there are cost challenges that will remain in the business and we're very awake to those. The balance sheet settings continued to be strengthened, increasingly what we've been doing has now been taken over and is being regulatory driven. And there is a lot of regulation to be assimilated, so we got a long way to go on those things. And the strong focus on ROE at the Group and the business unit levels is being sustained.</p>
          <p>So with that we'd be happy to take some questions.</p>

          <p>Hi. Jon Mott from UBS. A question on commentary around positive jaws <mark type="ph" /> I know its target to have (37:36), but I think you summed it up with no one's got any idea what's going to happen going forward. Forecasting revenues is probably the biggest challenge and you can say in the second half how difficult that is. Do you need to start going to a much more definitive target on costs whether it's flat costs, 2%, what really should you be looking for that cost line given the difficult environment going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we're going to remain very vigilant on costs. One thing we're not going to do short term in the business. And it's quite clear we need to re-platform the businesses, arrange a number of things and we will continue to do that. Now, if revenue is softer then, yes, that's going to present some challenges and maybe we've got to be a bit more tactical on some short term stuff. But we are very committed as a management team to the longer-term re-platforming. It's got to be done.</p>
          <p>Now, if you think that the economic conditions will be very subdued for a decade then you maybe have a much different perspective on what you might do on a cost front, that's not our thesis. We think even in an environment of GDP growth of 3 to 4 plus inflation, 2 to 3 is still looking at credit growth perhaps coming back in the 6 to 7 range. Now when is the question, but we don't think it's going to take a decade. So we are comfortable at the moment that we've got a strong focus on costs. We are going to remain committed to the investment platform because we think anything else and start to take the easy short-term routes just puts us back, what we spent three years digging ourselves out of.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. But I want this to interpreted as a question of whether or not you will decrease rates if the RBA goes next week. But this is the first sort of potentially decreasing cash rate environment we've been in for the last couple of years. Previously when you look at the impact on margins for a decrease in cash rates, you look at it as there's some small pressure on deposits because of the low rate deposits. But in the last three years, the banks have changed their funding mix quite considerably. You've got less short-term funding, you've got more long-term funding, and you have increased your tenor of funding. So could I get you to make some comments on if we do go into a decreasing cash rate environment, the more or less impact on margins from the fact that your funding mix has changed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right that &#x2013; I can't say it, why did you have to say falling rates? So in a falling rate environment then the free floats and things like this become less valuable, but they are smaller in the mix because there has been a lot of, I don't know if it's customer education or what, but there is a lot more term deposit and <mark type="ph" /> I (40:42) saver type contributions in the mix.</p>
          <p>So there will be some, I guess, drag from that, but probably a higher proportion of the deposit base is going to be sensitive to the new rates and is going to get re-priced of those new rates. So there will be a slight detrimental effect, but probably not what it has been historically, I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Can I ask a question about the Business Bank margins? I would like some more detail on why they've been so strong, specifically what's been the impact of lending versus funding? What's been the impact of the housing loans that are in that division? What's been the impact of the mix? And also you flagged competition as an issue that will affect the outlook, but I can remember 12 months ago you were flagging competition as a headwind for the margin in the Business Bank and you had a very good year. So could you give us some commentary on the outlook for the margin within that division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll get Joseph to answer. But competition does remain. I think when we did flag, I think even going back two years ago, was that we did feel that one of the insulators that would help us through that would be that we were the most open Business Bank during the GFC. That's irrefutable. And that's when you need a Business Bank to support you and we felt there would be some benefit to apply for that. So I think that's part of it that helps us insulate some of the competition, the competition is pretty intense, but we do see that relationship platform we exhibited particularly in '09 that is coming back to help us.</p>
          <p>But Joseph, do you want to address the margin issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the relationship, the platform and the reputation that we have as a Business Bank and the way that we conducted ourselves through 2009 and 2010 has translated into economic value as we were expecting that it would. That commitment to our franchise has really reduced the price sensitivity of competition in terms of our existing book, in terms of protecting our franchise.</p>
          <p>The other thing the margin does reflect is the ongoing reassessment of risk in sector by sector, and of course the environment today does represent some risk in some sectors and we have had to re-price those sectors and clients to reflect the risk <mark type="ph" /> to focus to some (43:10) of those factors. So, it's really a combination of relationship strength, which we invested in over many years, consistent approach to the marketplace and a strong discipline on pricing for risk has resulted in the margin that we've got today. I am not going to forecast what that margin might look like next six months, or next year, but I can forecast, that our commitment to relationship banking and to our customers is unwavering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll just follow up on that. I mean, you answer basically talks about the strength in franchise, but I am wondering, can you provide some detail on the trend in your lending margins, the trend in your deposit margins? Have you had real funding benefit in that division? Has the cost of deposit funding come down? Could you also talk about the impact of the housing portfolio that's included in that division? And finally, may be a comment on whether you are getting better margins at the top end or the bottom end of the Business Banking, it's such a big division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm happy to do that. I mean, our portfolio of course is heavily weighted towards SME lending, assistant from institutional large corporate. And that pricing tends to be sticker and more relationship sensitive. So, more relationship strong, strong base is <mark type="ph" /> at the top end of time (44:37). On deposits, we have been very disciplined in our deposit focus. We will be obviously seeking to grow deposits but not at the trade off at the economics of deposit. So, we haven't been chasing as aggressively the hot deposit market and we will be careful in managing our margins in that respect.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's that those are the key combinations that will be the focus for us. But the strong bias towards SME is certainly a source of competitive advantage relative to other players in the marketplace. When you look at the information pack, you'll see that the mortgage book is approximately about 30% of the entire portfolio. So when you do the maths on that, then you work out the underlying business margin is significantly higher than the 266 that's our weighted average NIM. I'm very pleased with the way that we've been able to protect that and I'll look to the customer satisfaction stats and the fact that we're growing market share there's evidence of our emphasis on and making sure we're not seeking to maximize margin in the short term with longer term consequences in terms of reputation of market share, but it plays back to the strength of the relationship model.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (46:04) Sorry, question for you on the SCDOs. Towards back of the foray you typically put in a table, which you've done today, which shows the total asset value of the SCDOs against the fair value in total asset value of 1,290 against the fair value of 991 and that 1,290 comprises the 690 in relation to the full deals that now have protection and the other 600. Am I right in thinking that &#x2013; and also it shows there are no provisions with respect to those specific provisions. So am I right in thinking that there is a $300 million gap in value between the two remaining ones and the balance sheet carry value of them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure that whole gap relates to the remaining instruments, which are quite long lived. They got their seven year instruments and I think they're somewhere around $0.50 and $1 or something if you tried to sell them. They're $600 million, so that's about $300 million of mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the $600 million is what's on the balance sheet?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The $600 million is where we still have risk, they are all still on our balance sheet, because we have not actually gotten rid of the instruments, we just traded out of the risk in them. But there is only two that are not effectively worth par and they are the two that drive that difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thanks. Craig Williams from Citi here. Just focusing on NextGen, if I look at your disclosure today on pages 20 and 23, seems to suggests that your infrastructure investment spend over the last years probably totals around $1.4 billion, which being majority is NextGen related. Your capitalized expense balances are up 25% year-on-year, although the amortization levels are down year-on-year and rating the release one sort of gleans a little bit of slippage in the foundation release, whatever that might be, of the call banking platform being employed now from calendar year '11 to sort of FY '12 in the language. Can you talk please about when we can perhaps see customer loans and most particularly deposits migrated as perhaps the key to implementation risk on the system, but also customer benefits emerging? You seem to have spent about $1 billion so far, are we halfway through in terms of spend and time on the project and have some color on the implementation for these projects please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we &#x2013; in terms of customer benefit we actually had obviously UBank actually build us a customer platform and we're increasing the functionality on that platform, so at least that gives an insight to people as to sort of functionality that's going to exist in the market. We are very comfortable with progress on this. We've called out that it's a multi-year program. The other thing is here we've taken a quite deliberate approach of actually spending that money, or the initial components of the money, on the infrastructure layer. And I'll let Gavin talk a little bit about that. Yeah, we think you got to have a solid foundation, so we prioritize things like financial system, customer analytics, credit risk and securitization platforms, those sort of things that have a, I think &#x2013; we got to do them at some point, and will so that &#x2013; There is no suggestion that the money we spent in any way, I think we are very pleased with the progress. But, Gavin, you want to give an update?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Cameron, thanks, Craig. The way &#x2013; and Cameron mentioned that in the presentation, it is a multi-year with multi-level transformation. So there's a lot of below the ground transformation that we are undertaking that does have a very real customer benefit today, plus the above the ground, which is typically the functionality and the capability that customers see. So below the ground we've got a huge transformation program underway and we are currently executing around datacenters, so that's your mainframe, your servers and all of those. And as we are replacing those and reconfiguring those that provides better system availability and capability as well.</p>
          <p>So our system availability for our core channels like NAB Connect for Business Banking, ATMs, Internet banking is the highest it's ever been as a direct result of the infrastructure transformation we have underway.</p>
          <p>Cameron mentioned in his slide the network transformation that we've completed now across our entire network that has resulted in a reduction of technology related incidents in the retail network and the business banking centers of as much as 50%. So that brings again more system availability for our bankers and for our customers. So we are seeing customer benefits already. But in terms of undertaking this transformation, it's a little bit like building a house. You can't put the roof on before you've actually put the foundations in place and built the walls. And that's &#x2013; we were spending a lot of money, Craig. So there is embedded value in that, but in terms of what I'll say the visible value, that will come in later years.</p>

          <p>Hi, James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. Mark, I was just having a &#x2013; I apologize for focusing on such short timeframes. But just wanted to actually get an idea as to what's happened in the fourth quarter in terms of the margin, because by most of the accounts it looks like the margin has fallen 8 basis points in the fourth quarter, which is quite a big drop given what you disclosed in the third quarter. I am just wondering actually what was driving that to get a bit of an idea, it looks like the exit margin in the fourth quarter is substantially below the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look I haven't &#x2013; I have been focused on the year and a half, I haven't dug into quarter by quarter. So I'll look at that for you. I suspect that there is some change in the noise, some of the accounting noise, but also in the mortgages would continue to chip away so there will be some substantive effect as well as some cosmetic. And also the liquids only ran up in the last quarter, so you'll get that effect only and over a shorter period of time it will have a more dramatic effect. So why don't we just do a quick rec for you this afternoon?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And perhaps just following up on that, is the exit margin then &#x2013; is that right, the exit margin is substantially below the average in the second half? I mean it looks like it's 4 or 5 basis points below, is that the right?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My question related to your Tier 1 generation, in particular the information on slide <mark type="ph" /> one I see (53:29). I guess on this we can see that the average risk weighting on corporate lending has come down significantly and without that I guess you wouldn't have generated nearly as much Tier 1. So my question is about the reasons for the full year and where do you see that going forward continuing and if not, does this affect your willingness to keep up the current level of asset growth that continues to win you a lot of share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, this really goes &#x2013; this is sort of the unwinding of a legacy problem. When that got accredited for Basel II, it had really made a late run, if you remember it got accredited probably six months behind others. But really its capabilities were way behind and so we've been engaged, we've talked about it as RWA release, capital release for a number of years now and really just bringing our capabilities, our housekeeping, the way our models are configured and work and so forth into line with competitors, and we still have not reached the same level of efficiency in that as competitors. So each year, we identify a number of areas of difference and we go after them and that's probably over the last three or four years released $90 billion plus of RWAs or something, so it has been quite a significant contribution. But it's simply housekeeping. And each year we refresh the target. Now, we'll run out at some stage, but it hasn't yet and we'll be going after some more in future periods. So we don't count it as permanent and factored into our dividend payout policies or anything like that, but it is something that we do expect to contribute for a while yet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Victor German from Nomura. I'm just &#x2013; if we look at the funding environment, it has clearly deteriorated in the last six months, and as availability shows up in the market it's obviously at a much greater price. Can you just perhaps highlight how does that impact your strategy, particularly in the Personal Bank, given that margins in that business are relatively low? And if you have to raise funding at much higher rates what's your thought process in your ability in growing well ahead of system as you have done in the past year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is really two parts of that. The first part is what might be the short-term impact and whether we have the same appetite for asset growth. But much more important question to ask is we know what we are tracking to, we are tracking to 100% net stable funding by 2018. So you can't take a breather in the market, so, we will &#x2013; we got a &#x2013; had a well executed funding plan. We've got to get out there and execute that over the next seven years to get us towards that target, that to us is much more important. Now, that might change our view depending on funding and price about what we do with regard to the appetite we've got for mortgages. If business credit growth comes back more quickly, obviously that's something we want to &#x2013; there's moving parts as to what might happen in the market over the next year or two, but for us the much more important tag is that we've got have a committed program, which we've got to get us towards 2018.</p>

          <p>And product ROEs are still very attractive, so you wouldn't turn off product growth for that and there is still the question as to what the prices are going to do in the marketplace as well.</p>
          <p>But you're right and we do, given current market conditions, we would now predict that the average cost of funding would probably peak mid 2014, so we're going to be in rising average cost of funds for the next three years.</p>

          <p>It's Ben Koo from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on the business lending growth and just I'm looking at the half-on-half growth in business lending that the change, I'm looking on slide 22, the change over the half was that you saw the corporate institutional business plan, which shrunk in the first half but grew again in the second half, and net business also slowed down on the flip side in terms of half-on-half of volume growth in the segment. So trying to get a feel, perhaps a question for Joseph, first see which area, segment parts of the economy are actually taking on what is right now given concerns about a two-speed economy, and secondly just whether you're expecting the growth to come more so from the institutional rather than the small business limited market, which is historically where the growth has come from? And so I was just reconciling that as well with that big acceleration in your credit growth forecast at the back of the pack for the economic forecast is quite a big acceleration in terms of what you expect in the system growth to recover in 2012?</p>

          <p>On the question of system growth, we continue to hold a view there is a significant amount of pent up investment that has to take place in the economy. Businesses have to replace fixed assets in order to keep their business models operating. So I think that's a reality that will become evident when business confidence returns to the levels that we've been hoping will happen for some time now. But everyone knows what the business confidence environment is like and how it was impacted by the global environment, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>The positive factor in my mind is when you look at corporate balance sheets, I am talking here about the top 500 to 600 corporates, we're at 34 to 35 year low in balance sheet leverage. And so there is a significant amount of balance sheet capacity for companies to come back to the debt markets, and so quite apart from the CapEx, essential maintenance CapEx we still believe there is quite a lot of pent-up event-driven activity, M&amp;A type activity and which we're seeing some evidence of that now and we think that will be a driver. So I think the main driver of credit in the next 12 months besides things like infrastructure will largely be in the top 500 corporates with significant capacity to use balance sheet to drive investment and to drive events when confidence returns. We continue to see some growth in the SME space, again, essential maintenance and that will be across sectors reflecting, some sectors are doing it tougher than others, some sectors are well placed to grow when the conditions return, but largely, as a summary answer, will be much more in the top 500 segment than we see the lending activity really coming back.</p>

          <p>Mike Wiblin from Macquarie Can you just talk a little bit about the collective provision movement just sort of the $332 million. I know there was a release of sort of $75 mill flood overlay, but just by division what you're seeing there, what's really driving, I suppose, your confidence that things are getting better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they are not conscious &#x2013; I mean out in flood, which we called out would actually, that's was held a Group and actually reflects actuals. So that's why &#x2013; there has been no conscious decision. I mean the reality is it's either gone from collective to specific or the models, as we've have updated our customer financials in particular, have driven a lower credit rating score. And that drives the statistical provisioning lowering. So we're not making any conscious decisions, we are not making any economic overlay adjustments.</p>
          <p>I mean, Ben asked the question about two-speed economy. We think it's a 10-speed economy. The simplistic thing is to say mining good, retail bad. It is much more granular than that. And you've got obviously a whole range of companies there that actually are doing, they are not in at the booming end of the equation but they are actually quite solid. And if you get &#x2013; and that &#x2013; there is a credit &#x2013; as the economic conditions improved, well there is more stability, it's reflected in the credit scores in those models.</p>
          <p>If you go to Ben's question about the confidence and what might happen in business demand, what we do observe and we obviously spend an enormous amount of time talking to our customers is, the pent-up demand is not fictional. But every time it looks like it's going to emerge, you have an event which forces them to stop. And we did see, I think, Joseph. probably between the period of sort of March to June, actually quite a significant up tick in confidence. And this is confidence on the ground, we are talking to. And then you start at the U.S. debt ceiling and we went from there. When you get a sustained period of international calm, you do actually find that comes too, because in many cases they've been sitting on non-fixed asset replacement for sometimes three and four years. So we are not talking about expansion reinvestment, but just getting to the point of actually replacing costs up. If you get that you do it and so when you take that 10-speed view, and that's kind of what's reflected in the collective, there is certainly some stress points at the end particularly in the specifics. And then you have got just the general improving health from what was sort of quite poor credit scoring with a much more dire outlooks, say, in the '09 and early part of '10 scoring. But we are not making any &#x2013; we've made no conscious or any change to our economic overlays at all. They are not being released.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's T.S. from Bell Potter. You lost 175 advisors in the last six months. Do you have plans to replenish them maybe through M&amp;A? And what is the optimal number of advisers to run a business like this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean the ones we lost, I mean, by and large, they are people leaving the industry. There has been quite a high increase of exists from the industry over the past couple of years. But new advisor growth has actually been stronger than its ever been and to attract that level of advisors. We certainly don't have any M&amp;A in that space planned and we don't need to. That sort of level of advisors is enough to run happy in other places and you can see that by the 300 that are coming through the door. Steve, do you want to -</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's right, Cameron. I mean, there is a lot of regulatory uncertainty and some of the older advisors are taking a chance to move on. But the net advisor growth for us in the last 12 months has been unprecedented and very strong. And we think it should continue. We are well placed to help advisors to make the transition to the new environment, which is why they are joining us. In the next year or two that will continue. I think in terms of the optimal advisor numbers, as long as they are high quality and their productive and we will have as many as we can get. And it's a competitive market to do that. But our organic activities have been really successful, so that shows that you can build around the right offer and get growth, which is what we're after.</p>

          <p>Brian Johnson CLSA. My apologies for yet another question for Mark. Mark, if we have a look at slide 17, and we have a look at the liquid asset holdings can I just confirm that the $55 billion at the bottom is the level one liquidity for the LCR. Where would the LCR be right now? How much does that imply the RBA facility would be, and what's the expectation of the pricing on that, which your peers have been hinting is 25 basis points to 40 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll give <mark type="ph" /> Eric (1:05:46), a heads up to comment on this. We no way &#x2013; no way &#x2013; no decent way through our transition to LCR. I mean it takes time to try and accumulate Australian sovereign debt, get your bank pay for and corporate pay in proportion and so forth so that's going to be a multiyear journey. And so, I don't think we know and I have seen quite wide estimates amongst the peers as to the level and the cost ultimately of the RBA facility.</p>
          <p>So, I don't think anybody really knows. I think the way we regard it is that we want to show APRA that we are doing all the things we can reasonably do to get ourselves as close to compliance on our own account as we can, and I think if they think we've done a reasonable job then whatever the gap is, the gap will be plugged. But I don't know, <mark type="ph" /> Eric (1:06:43), do you want to add some specifics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess on the LCRs, a simple answer to the question is we haven't disclosed that yet and, as Mark said, we're in our transition phase. We will know more about the final roles in due course and then after release the draft of liquidity standards and we expect that sort of mid to late November. I would also say that this slide is in relation to the liquid assets for the whole Group. So it's not just NAB Limited so that $55 billion of liquids just isn't the level 1 Australian liquids will also got Clydesdale Bank liquidity in there as well, so that would be cash of the Bank of England <mark type="ph" /> Gales (1:07:17) etcetera as well.</p>
