          <p>Greetings and welcome to the third quarter 2009 Monsanto Company earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Scarlett Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations from Monsanto. Thank you, Ms. Foster; you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rob, and good morning to everybody on the line. I'd like to welcome you to Monsanto's third quarter earnings conference call. And I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, Carl Casale, and Terry Crews from our executive team.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we're webcasting this call. You can access it at Monsanto's website at Monsanto.com, and the replay is also available at that address. For those of you who would like to go to our website, the slides for this call are posted on the Investor Information page.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10-Q and today's press release.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're providing you with measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we've provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measures in the slides and in the earnings press release.</p>
          <p>As has been our practice, we also have published today the preliminary numbers for our biotech trade acreage penetration by crop and by country.</p>
          <p>Our conversation today is intended to do three things: highlight the growth potential in our Seeds and Traits business, bring clarity to the prospects for our Roundup herbicide franchise, and underscore our financial commitments both for this year and looking out to 2012. Hugh will start by discussing the strategic path forward with an emphasis on the Seeds and Traits business. Carl will take a deeper dive into the new paradigm for the Roundup business. And Terry will bring it all together with an update to our financial outlook as we finish fiscal year 2009 and prepare for 2010, all with an eye toward meeting our commitment to double gross profit in 2012.</p>
          <p>Before we start, I'd like to review the financial results for the quarter and year to date. As we shared with you in late May, ongoing EPS in the third quarter declined compared to the third quarter last year as the competitive dynamics for glyphosate dramatically shifted. Total company net sales and gross profit declined 11 and 7% respectively as seen on slide four, although margins rose over two points. These results reflect a 17% lift in Seeds and Traits gross profit with a three point margin lift, in contrast with a 54% decrease in gross profit from the Roundup business. Coupled with the benefit of SG&amp;A reductions, ongoing EPS for the quarter was $1.25.</p>
          <p>Based on our current outlook for completing the US season and starting sales in Latin America, we believe we remain on track toward meeting our full-year ongoing earnings guidance at the lower end of the $4.40 to $4.50 per share range.</p>
          <p>If you would refer to slide five, all of our major crops reported gross profit growth and margin expansion for the quarter. While corn and soybeans are typically winding down as we complete the US planting season, corn gross profit still increased 12% and soybeans rose 26%. Corn margins were up by nearly four percentage points and soybeans by approximately three. Vegetables recorded a 22% increase in gross profit and margin expansion of some five percentage points, predominantly from the addition of the protected-culture business.</p>
          <p>The third quarter is the heart of the earnings season for cotton, and gross profit increased 28% while margins expanded by five percentage points. The tried and true combination of new, higher performing seed with the best stack trait package is now playing out in our cotton franchise.</p>
          <p>The earnings power of the Seeds and Traits business, however, was overshadowed by the decline in the Roundup business. Gross profit was halved compared with that in the third quarter last year. Total volumes were down 28 million gallons as we held price for branded Roundup above the $20 per gallon level. As a result of the mix of branded and non-branded sales, Roundup margins contracted to 44%.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, SG&amp;A as a percent of net sales was just under 16% in the quarter and expenses were down by more than $100 million.</p>
          <p>Year to date, companywide gross profit increased 13% and margins rose four percentage points. Gross profit for all our major crops increased, led by corn and soybeans at 21% and 32% respectively. Margins for Seeds and Traits increased some two percentage points. Roundup gross profit declined 3% year over year, yet margins increased nearly six percentage points as we favor price over volume in optimizing the gross profit contribution of this business.</p>
          <p>The net result is that ongoing EPS for the first nine months of the year increased 19% to $4.38 per share. Free cash flow was $827 million less than this time last year, first because of the high level of prepays we experienced in August 2008 which normally would have been cash generated in the 2009 fiscal year. Additionally, we had a greater use of cash from working capital, primarily reflecting higher seed and Roundup inventories.</p>
          <p>In sum, we have optimized gross profit across the portfolio, leading to an expected 17% growth in the seeds and trait business and the flat gross profit from Roundup. With the benefit of some prudent cost reduction actions, we still believe we can deliver a more than 20% increase in ongoing earnings and free cash of approximately 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Hugh.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Scarlett, and good morning to everybody on the line. Because of our fiscal calendar, we are now nearly two months from the start of our next decade. It's been then just shy of 10 years since we have embarked in launching a unique play in the agricultural space built on the premise of a game changing technologies in an effort to simple seed interest, only as we enter the next decade, we're crossing a bridge similar to the one that we traversed in 2000.</p>
          <p>Slide six helps visualize that timeline. When we first began this journey, Roundup was a key driver of the business, fueling our investments in Seeds and Traits. By the end of fiscal year 2003, we saw the first tangible signs of success of our Seeds and Traits strategy when the gross profit of this segment went past the gross profit contribution of our Ag Productivity segment for the first time.</p>
          <p>Seeds and Traits gross profit continued to grow to almost double that of Ag Productivity by 2007. By 2008, however, the dynamic shifted again. This time, both segments were delivering phenomenal growth. Seeds and Traits gross profit increased by 28%, while Roundup gross profit more than doubled to just under a record $2 billion. This year, Roundup is expected to deliver gross profit of $2 billion again, albeit via a different path. The bridge that we're crossing as we enter 2010 has a familiar look, but the road diverges on the other side.</p>
          <p>Today, we need to provide you with three things: one, a greater clarity on Roundup; two, highlight the growth potential in Seeds and Traits; and three, a solid confirmation of our financial commitments to double gross profit in 2012. Carl will discuss the Roundup path in more detail, but let me give you my high level view. In 2009, Roundup should be flat at $2 billion in gross profit. But we now believe that we'll deliver something in the neighborhood of $1 billion longer term. We harvested a significant level of operating cash from Roundup in the last few years and we have reinvested that cash back into the growth side of the company or we have returned it directly to our shareowners. We will continue to do so.</p>
          <p>That said, the reality is that even our amazing Seeds and Traits business cannot in one year offset a $1 billion decline in Roundup gross profit. And yet by 2012, the Seeds and Traits segment is forecast to deliver 7.3 to $7.5 billion in gross profit. Not only do we have the potential to be approaching some 300 million acres with our traits as we cross into the next decade, but most of the world will be replacing old technology acres with new, revolutionizing farming once again and creating a value dynamic in farming that's unmatched in our industry.</p>
          <p>On the other side of the coin, Roundup by then will be less than 15% of the company's total gross profit generation. So even as we reset the financial bath for Roundup, we remain committed to doubling gross profit for the entire company from the 2007 base of $4.2 billion to roughly 8.6 to $8.8 billion in 2012 as shown on slide seven.</p>
          <p>To be fair, when we thought Roundup would level out at $1.9 billion in gross profit, we said then that we could more than double. But even with a lower benchmark for Roundup, the Seeds and Traits business is expected to grow at more than 2.5 times its 2007 base and allow us to cross this doubling milestone for the entire corporation. While it's sometimes easy to miss in the Roundup fray, 2009 will be the year that the Seeds and Traits business alone will deliver more gross profit than all of Monsanto did in 2007. That's a remarkable achievement in just two very short years.</p>
          <p>To generate more than $7 billion in gross profit from Seeds and Traits in 2012, the growth has to come from our domestic and our international markets, as you can see on slide eight. The foundation for our unique position in agriculture is in the consistent, aggressive investment made in R&amp;D coupled with an unparalleled capability to turn great research into really great products.</p>
          <p>If you isolate the Seeds and Traits segment as we do in slide nine, a 20% compound annual growth in R&amp;D investment has returned a 27% compound annual growth rate in gross profit. More importantly, given that it takes eight to ten years and roughly $100 million in investment to bring a trait to market, the investment that you see in 2004 through 2009 will be puddled into the products that will propel our growth in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p>As we look to the next decade of growth in Seeds and Traits, let's reground ourselves in the platform that is truly the springboard for our future. The fundamental principle is simple to see and much, much harder to do; find the sweet spot amongst market share, trait penetration, and value that optimizes gross profit. These three factors make up our golden triangle.</p>
          <p>So let's start with share. No matter where we are in the world, we are matching our presence in the market to the brand experience that the farmer really wants. We alone have the diversity of germplasm and the technology to serve the farmer who wants a retail experience or the farmer who wants a high touch experience or even the farmer who favors a value proposition. We're refocusing and we're retooling our commercial efforts around these concepts, allowing us to continue to target one to two point share gains per year in markets around the world through 2012, as shown in slide 10.</p>
          <p>As we enter the next decade, we'll stand alone in the technology arena that we alone have created. Our products will be fundamentally differentiated, and thus we'll compete against our own older technologies. Our job then will be to replace every old biotech acre with a new one and again lift the value proposition for growers.</p>
          <p>Trait penetration, the second leg of the golden triangle, boils down to our ability to execute. As we look across our high impact technologies on slides 11 and 12, the execution required for the growth that we see in the next decade through 2012 has already begun. If you could imagine being a player in the biotech pharmaceutical arena and been able to point to the potential to launch one new product nearly every year for the next seven years, even more each one of those products conservatively has the potential to deliver $300 million or higher in gross revenue just in the first country of launch. If you can imagine that for a drug company, you can only imagine what this type of technology explosion will mean to our customers, the grower.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we summarize for you the four big drivers of our successes in 2010. We began the transition with the trade up of the original Roundup Ready soybean trait this year to Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield. Right now, some 16,000-plus farmers are experiencing the Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait on an estimated 1.4 to 1.5 million acres. That penetration we expect accelerates to seven to 8 million acres in 2010, with a total market opportunity of 45 to 55 million acres. Supporting this expanded launch are some 1,500 trials of both 2009 and 2010 products.</p>
          <p>This week also marked our submission of the regulatory package in Brazil for our insect protected Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybean product. We're growing the base trait of Roundup Ready there nicely with 64% penetration this year and a goal to cross 75% next year. Ultimately, the goal will be to convert the Brazilian soybean market to the higher performing platform likely post 2012.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, the key milestone in corn is the launch of Genuity SmartStax in 2010 pending EPA approval. This will begin the next revolution in corn farming with a true all-in-one product for insect control above and below the ground along with more robust weed control. The macro opportunity is 50 to 65 million acres as we convert our foundation of some 32 million acres of triple-stack product this year in SmartStax and then grow beyond that base.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 helps you with the valuation for both of these new products, and I'm pleased that we alone have demonstrated the wherewithal to simultaneously launch two such remarkable new tools for growers.</p>
          <p>In Brazil and in Argentina, we finished 2009 with the launches of YieldGard Corn Borer on 2 million acres and a double stack on 2.4 million acres respectively. These are our largest corn seed footprints globally, both at 40% or greater market share, and we'll build on that seed base as those markets move up the technology ladder. Next year in Argentina, we expect 65% of our portfolio will be a double stack. In Brazil, we're working to penetrate some 5 million acres with YieldGard Corn Borer. Ultimately, our plans are to bring SmartStax in both countries in the 2013 &#x2013; 2014 timeframe pending regulatory approvals.</p>
          <p>If you refer back to slide 13 again, in cotton we had a major breakthrough this year with the launch of new varieties in the United States, dubbed the 'Class of 2009'. Approximately 35% of our portfolio will likely be from this new class and the class was nearly sold out. The performance reflects the added investment that we made in cotton that accelerated our breeding gains. Next year, we expect 65% of our projected sales will be either the Class of '09 or the Class of '10, and we'll complete the phase-out of Bollgard in the US in favor of the next generation Bollgard II with Roundup Ready Flex.</p>
          <p>In Veggies, our plan is to expand margins from this year's base in the mid-50s percent, and we're exceeding our goals for marker development. And the first big products from that investment are targeted to arrive in the marketplace in the 2012 timeframe. Margins are expected to continue to expand to our targeted 65% as we're investing more aggressively in the crops that are growing faster than the overall vegetable segment, and reflecting the power of our R&amp;D and the choices that we make as to which seeds are most valuable in key individual markets.</p>
          <p>This week we also announced a five-year collaboration agreement with Dole to develop new products that will enhance consumer vegetable choices.</p>
          <p>This entire base translates into value and for us thus value created and value shared with the grower as the third leg of our golden triangle. After a decade of being a startup seed and trait company, we've become the market leader globally because we offer the best genetic performance matched to the purchasing decision that the farmer prefers. The value gap next year will not be amongst products that are positioned as almost as good as ours. You should expect as we move into the next decade that we are the innovation leader with products that are unmatched for performance or for grower experience.</p>
          <p>Price in our existing portfolio matches value to experience. Globally, we're maximizing value with modest price increases where we're fully penetrated. And in areas that are early in the adoption curve, pricing tracks to encourage grower trial and drive penetration. Pricing in 2010 will not be above our existing portfolio where our regions will see a value lift from a greater mix of higher performing seeds or with high single digit increases. The true lift comes from new technologies whether it's the yield advantage of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in US soybeans or the conversion of the Brazilian corn market to biotech traits of the switch of the US cotton market to a double stack of second-generation traits. Only the potential pricing for SmartStax is still to come and it must wait on regulatory approval before we can discuss value or launch size.</p>
          <p>We've crossed a familiar bridge as we enter the new decade. We need to remove the volatility associated with the changes that we are experiencing in the Roundup business, while we unlock the new growth potential from our seeds and our traits globally. There will be a small group dedicated to the first and it will be the remainder of the organization that's singularly focused on the latter. The task is really straightforward. Optimize the golden triangle of share, penetration, and value. Deliver to the market the most robust pipeline ever to be witnessed by growers, and widen the differentiation between us and our competition. If we execute, we will deliver double the gross profit in 2012.</p>
          <p>So let me turn the call over to Carl and Terry to first add some more color for the Roundup discussions and then to consolidate all these thoughts financially. Carl?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning to everyone on the line. As Hugh noted, we believed for some time that Roundup would reach its peak contribution in fiscal year 2009. If you would refer to slide 15, although we knew the supply/demand imbalance for glyphosate would ultimately correct itself, the speed and depth of the transition was unprecedented. In the face of competitive response whose magnitude and pace far exceeded even our most conservative expectations, we've revised our outlook.</p>
          <p>Today, if we use the US market as a bellwether, we see a price gap between our leading brand of more than $2 per acre when compared with the competition. Just last fall, that gap was roughly $0.50 per acre, a gap easily overcome by the peace of mind our quality and our Roundup Rewards program convey. Not only is the rate of decline in the pricing from the competition more rapid than expected, but the sheer volume of competitive products hitting the distribution channel, particularly in the US, is unprecedented. Our competition has overestimated the size of the global market and employed what we would consider to be an aggressive approach to working capital.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget what Roundup is, a fabulous product valued for its ability to consistently perform for growers and deliver cash flows for reinvestment for Monsanto, but one that competes in a dynamic, highly volatile environment. I think of Roundup as the annuity that accompanies the greater growth stock of Seeds and Traits. Our goal now is to manage the volatility and to guarantee the annuity with a measure of performance that is predictable yet meaningful.</p>
          <p>To reassess our strategy and equally importantly to remove the distraction from the rest of the organization, we are creating a separate division for Roundup and all of our other herbicide chemistries. The significance of this move is its simplicity, one team, one focus.</p>
          <p>If you move to slide 16, you can see that there are many levers we can pull as we seek smoother waters. First and foremost, let me be clear that we believe the demand for glyphosate globally will continue to grow in the low single digits with additional Roundup Ready acres and continued conversion to conservation tillage practices.</p>
          <p>What we are facing is a changing supply environment and what we need to determine is the price/volume share dynamic that will deliver the optimal gross profit and ultimately the optimal level of operating cash. This may entail stretched premiums and lower volumes, or at the other end of the spectrum sub-historic premiums and a recapture of share and volume. Both are possible, but in this highly competitive environment, we'd like to wait to discuss our path forward until later in the calendar year.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we want to convey to you our confidence in our ability to deliver approximately $1 billion in gross profit in 2012 or roughly 15% of the estimated gross profit of the entire company at that time.</p>
          <p>I have mentioned many things that have changed in the Roundup environment in recent months; but one thing has not, our low cost manufacturing position. We remain confident in our ability to remain the low cost producer, and in fact have identified further areas of improvement. That said to be very conservative, our long-term gross profit projections of approximately $1 billion for Roundup assume that glyphosate acid prices remain in the $3 per kilo range for the foreseeable future. To provide some context for that number, the acid price was $10 per kilo in August of 2008, $6 per kilo in September, and $3 this June. Our working assumption we forecast around a gross profit at 1.9 billion was a competitive acid price of $6 per kilo.</p>
          <p>For us, converting gross profit into free cash is our key operational consideration. Historically if you turn to slide 17, the EBIT delivered by the Ag Productivity segment in total has ranged from $250 million to better than $1.5 billion since 2004, with operating spend in the range of 20 to 25% of net sales in the years prior to 2008.</p>
          <p>While we don't disclose spending on an individual product level, Roundup by itself would have a lower spend than the entire segment but still with opportunity for further refinement. Some of this cost will naturally erode as sales erode. Some will continue to be reevaluated under our new strategy, and some has already been cut as indicated by our announced restructuring. This one-time charge of 350 to $400 million is primarily designed to reset the spending level associated with the Roundup business either directly or in corporate support.</p>
          <p>All costs on the table are for consideration and nothing is being sacred. Our guidance for future gross profit for the Roundup business considered the benefit of the restructuring actions. All in considering some efficiencies and business support, continued tight working capital management, and ongoing depreciation and amortization of approximately 150 million, you could reasonably estimate operating cash flows less maintenance capital spending of approximately $400 million for a Roundup gross profit contribution of $1 billion.</p>
          <p>As Hugh mentioned before, there is no great Roundup Ready without great Roundup, and this is priority one in the assessment of the strategy for Roundup in our portfolio. Priority two is delivering results in a predictable, meaningful range that are in turn reinvested in the growth engine of Seeds and Traits. The future consistent baseline of free cash flows from Roundup coupled with Roundup Ready franchise considerations will ultimately determine how the die is cast for this business.</p>
          <p>Make no mistake, today marks a clear reset in the expected contribution from Roundup. We are grateful for the contribution from the business for the past few years where it has allowed us to secure assets like Agroeste and Cristiani in corn in Latin America and De Ruiter in protected-culture vegetables, while further bolstering in already solid balance sheet.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Terry, who can share with you the outlook from this rebalancing of our expectations for our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl, and good morning to everyone on the line. Carl and Hugh have laid out the keys today for how our growth prospects for the Seeds and Traits business while we reset the expectations for Roundup. As CFO, there are three things financially I want to add to that discussion. One, we need to confirm our ability to meet our ongoing EPS target for 2009. Two, we need to give you some early indicators for 2010. And three, we need to recommit to our goal of doubling our 2007 gross profit by 2012.</p>
          <p>As Carl described, Roundup's contribution to Monsanto's value is expected to peak in fiscal year 2009 at roughly $2 billion. We believe we can complete this year with sales volumes of approximately 200 million gallons, as we indicated in late May. Of those 200 million gallons, roughly 70% were sold by the close of the third quarter while holding branded net selling practices at an average of more than $20 per gallon globally. We still need to deliver another $500 million in gross profit in the fourth quarter, and it will be a function of our success in closing out the US season and the preseason sales in Latin America.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 18, we're comfortable that the Seeds and Traits business can deliver gross profit toward the upper end of our prior guidance of 4.4 to $4.5 billion. This 17% increase reflects a combination of value creation, market share growth, and expanded trait penetration across the segment.</p>
          <p>Corn gross profit is still in track to grow by 20% for the full year to approximately $2.6 billion with a 1 to 2% percentage point lift in the margins, landing on a 62 to 63% margin for the year. We anticipate soybeans gross profit will grow by more than 20% to approximately $900 million with margins of roughly 62%. We continue to believe that we will deliver share gains of up to one point in both DEKALB and American Seeds corn and one point in Asgrow for soybeans, all depending of course on the final planted acreage numbers.</p>
          <p>Cotton and vegetable seeds are on track also to meet their financial year goals of approximately $300 million and $450 million in gross profit respectively. Both of these crops anticipate margin growth of approximately two percentage points, reaching the 72% mark for cotton and a 55% mark for vegetables. In the case of vegetables, this margin expansion is being achieved even against an inventory step up associated with the De Ruiter acquisition that will reduce the gross profit contribution from vegetables by $36 million in 2009.</p>
          <p>So if you turn to slide 19, even with a flat gross profit from Roundup on a year-on-year basis, we can see a path to our fifth consecutive year of 20% or greater ongoing earnings growth in 2009 and a lift in gross margin this year of more than three percentage points.</p>
          <p>We would now expect SG&amp;A for the full year to trend toward 18% on an even lower net sales figure as compared with our prior guidance of approximately 19%. These cost savings will help offset the decline in Roundup versus our original expectations. We also expect R&amp;D as a percent of sales to be in the 10% range.</p>
          <p>We anticipated an additional upside in taxes as we expect that the effective tax rate for the full year will likely range between 28 and 29%. The majority of this benefit comes from discrete events that happened in the first half of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>We expect to end 2009 with a modest gain in the fourth quarter that will allow us to deliver the low end of our 4.40 to 4.50 in ongoing EPS guidance on a free cash flow of $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>While our spending reductions will allow us to deliver on our EPS commitment for the full year, some portion of the cash benefit will occurred in fiscal year 2010. Some significant fourth quarter expenses such as marketing programs are reflected as accruals now with the actual cash payments going out the door in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>As Carl referenced, we have announced a restructuring today of 350 to $400 million, with most of the actions being taken against the Roundup business along with some product rationalization primarily in the Vegetable business as we complete the integration of Seminis and De Ruiter. We expect the restructuring to reduce our annual future costs by 160 to $180 million, with half of it being realized in 2010, and the full savings will be realized in 2011.</p>
          <p>As we've readjusted our expectations for Roundup, we need to give you our view as to how our strategic decisions will play out financially in 2010. To that end, I would point you to the path to 2012. We anticipate Roundup will provide the annuity of $1 billion in gross profit with an estimated $400 million in operating cash less maintenance capital spending. We have the potential to be in that ballpark in 2010 depending on the decisions that we make competitively to find the sweet spot among share, volume, and price, coupled with the cost savings we're targeting from the announced restructuring.</p>
          <p>Partially offsetting the decline in Roundup in 2010 will be by almost any measure another year of stellar performance from our Seeds and Traits sector. Gross profit for this segment should cross the $5 billion mark in 2010, in line with our 20% compounded annual growth rate from 2007 to 2012. This growth will be driven by the value of new seed launches, trait expansion, and the conversion of the portfolio into the next generation of yield enhancing products. We will of course give you full 2010 earnings guidance, as we do every year, during our fourth quarter earnings call in October as we finalize our operational plans, make adjustments for spending, and determine our tax rate.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that fiscal 2010 will mark nearly a decade long transition to a pure play Seeds and Traits leader in the global agriculture industry. Our next fiscal year will mark the first time that Seeds and Genomics becomes a contributor of more than 80% of the total company's gross profit generation.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 20, by balancing value, share, and trait penetration, we believe the Seeds and Traits portfolio alone can generate 20%-plus ongoing earnings growth as we look from 2007 to 2012.</p>
          <p>As the Seeds and Traits grow even stronger, we're crossing into a different space with a different set of benchmarks and metrics. These are pegged much closer to the performance of our biotech pharmaceutical peers rather than a more traditional chemical comparison. As you think about the Seeds and Traits segment by itself, you should expect margins of 60% plus, which reflects the higher value of our traits, but somewhat offset by the fact that we do have to produce the physical seed itself, which has a higher cost of goods sold; so it is a blended margin.</p>
          <p>On its own, SG&amp;A as a percent of sales is in the mid-20s given the high-touch approach across all our channels. R&amp;D as a percent of Seeds and Traits sales is in the mid-teens, and this is an area where we have benefited greatly from the contribution of Roundup to the funding of our technology driven approach to farming.</p>
          <p>In 2004 through 2008, Seeds and Traits generate sufficient cash on its own to not only manage our recent capital investments but to also return cash directly to shareowners, as shown on slide 21. About 40% of EBITDA was derived from Roundup and was used predominately to fuel the investment in innovation and growth of Seeds and Traits.</p>
          <p>Based on the cash generating power of our Seeds and Traits business, we will continue to maintain our dividend and are continuing to repurchase shares under of existing authorization, with more than $300 million of shares repurchased in the first three quarters of this fiscal year.</p>
          <p>In summary, we expect 2009 to be another year with a 20% growth rate for ongoing EPS and of a path to reduce the volatility associated with Roundup, and still a clear line of sight on exceptional growth from an unparalleled Seed and Trait franchise as we enter our second decade as a technology leader in agriculture.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn the call back over to Scarlett.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will be from the line of Mark Connelly with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When I look at your corn &#x2013; sorry, your cotton and your soybean numbers, it looks like we're starting to see a little bit of a step change in the performance there. And I'm wondering if you could talk about whether there is a step change out there somewhere in the distance on Seminis as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. I think you're right in your observation. We are seeing a step change in cotton and in soybeans. We've been talking about it in beans for a while. We've got active more resources there. We've seen the uplift of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. And as I mentioned with the Class of 2009 and the Class of 2010, we're seeing some nice graduation results with improvements on our molecular marker technologies and improved breeding there. And Seminis is probably 2012, Terry, before we see the big leaps, but we're seeing smaller incremental improvements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What's driving that though, Hugh? What is going to be &#x2013; it's GM and the other businesses, but what is it for Seminis that's going to create that breakthrough level of performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the driver in Seminis is the same as we've seen in cotton in the last year. It's not just biotech markets or markers, so once you have those street signs identified that means navigating and identifying improved performance becomes easier. In the last two years, we have generated an enormous amount of markers in our Seminis and our veggie business. I don't know, Terry, if you can add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add to the fact that we're beginning to see marker capability, we're also beginning to progress toward working with other companies to collaborate and create opportunities for vegetables at the marketplace that show better nutritional value, better appearance such as the one we announced with Dole. As an example, we're now looking at the opportunities to improve lettuce so that you can get the nutritional value of a romaine lettuce with the taste value of an iceberg. So the combination of using marker capability to improve things on the farm for growers in combination with navigating to advance marker capability that gives us a better tasting, more stable, better looking vegetable at the fruit stand will enable us to grow this business. And I think Hugh is correct that you see some step up in 2011 and some in 2012 as well. But just to bring it back, 2010 we will also be through the inventory step up on De Ruiter, so we'll begin to see the benefits of the protected-culture market there also.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. My question would be you've raised the expectation for gross profit growth out of 2012 for Seeds and Traits from 2.25 to 2.5. What has changed in that mix that gets you that extra 0.25, if you will?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Vincent for the question. Most of that is seeing the benefit of the acquisitions that we've added to in the past couple of years that strengthen the performance of that business. So, we now &#x2013; when we laid out our initial numbers, we didn't include any acquisitions. And since that time, we've acquired De Ruiter, Cristiani, and Agroeste. So we expect those businesses to contribute to the success of Seeds and Traits, and that's what is giving us the belief that we can get to that Seeds and Trait number now.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I know we have to wait three months until we get official guidance for next year, but given Terry's comment that gross profit in Roundup could be $1 billion in fiscal '10, but given the lift in gross profit you just alluded to in Seeds and Traits, it would appear as if the potential is for earnings to be largely flat in 2010. Can you give us any color on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll begin. Your calculator and my calculator would work the same. I think the reality is if Roundup falls to that level, we could see results below flat. The situation is this; we've got &#x2013; and it's not that we're not &#x2013; we can go ahead and share as much as we can on 2010, but there is a lot of strategic decisions that we have to make in the next couple of weeks and the next month in where we're going to go with pricing in Seeds and Traits and where we're going to go with pricing in Roundup and what approach we're going to use in the Roundup market for next year, where our spending is going to be, and then there is some smaller items such as our tax rate, which we just haven't assessed yet for 2010.</p>
          <p>But the math don't lie. If you lose $1 billion of GP, if that were to occur in Roundup, it would be difficult to offset that even with the stellar performance in Seeds and Traits. And Seeds and Traits will be stellar; there is no question about that. And we're still talking about an 18% growth curve between here and 2012 to achieve our 2012 numbers. So by any stretch of the imagination, that's great news for the Seeds and Traits business, but we are dealing with a real downside in Roundup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I think just to add something, I think the reality is that Roundup is going to be smaller, probably smaller faster and more precipitously than we expected. The danger is that it fogs or obscures the extraordinary growth in Seeds and Traits. So 2009, we're going to have more gross profit in our Seeds and Traits than we generated across the board in 2007. And as Terry said in his remarks, despite the downturn in Roundup, Seeds and Traits gross profit equaling probably 80% of total business in that year.</p>
          <p>So I think getting lost in the Roundup drama, the danger in that is you don't see the extraordinary growth that we see in the market. We can see the extraordinary growth that we're anticipating between now and 2012 in our seed businesses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your corn seed revenues for the nine months are up about 17%. And I guess I thought that your average price realizations were probably above that. So is it the case that corn seeds volume has grown through the nine months or has it shrank? Where do things sit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right on your numbers. I think what we see is we've seen some share growth. We've also seen some mix dynamics as well between the actual seed we sell. Anytime we see share growth, we see that. So there's some mix and plus there is an increase in our business outside the US, so we're seeing the mix effect on the global side of business as well as we've grown share in both Brazil and Argentina, and those are different pricing points. So when you take the combination of all of that, that's what we're looking at is about 17% growth. And as we said for the full year, we would expect GP to still be up about 20%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, a question on seed pricing. I know last year you gave a hint to your plans in seeds pricing and I realize you doing some strategy now, but two subparts to this. One, in the past as Roundup pricing has come down, one of the levers that you have is to bump up the Roundup Ready tech fee by an equivalent amount. Of course, it's hard to separate that out now from the price of the seed. So I'm just wondering if that's a consideration on how you manage the Roundup decline.</p>
          <p>And secondly, is it your expectation that just on base seed that the market can support another price increase next year. And couple that with lower production costs; should that lead to margin improvement even before you get to trait expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, thanks for your two questions. I'll maybe do some headlines and ask Carl to comment on value transfer. On pricing, as we look out in the next year, and we're still working through this, I would anticipate on our existing hybrids and existing biotech traits, I would be thinking about price increases in the high single digits. And then as you think about our new technologies, Roundup Ready 2 Yield and ultimately SmartStax and our new technologies in Brazil, we will continue our philosophy of pricing to value and then splitting that value with the farmer. So that's independent of the vagaries of crude oil and commodity prices. That's how we would lay in our stall.</p>
          <p>On the shift between Roundup value and our seed value, I wouldn't hold your breath on that. That's not how we're thinking about this. We're fighting a significant onslaught of genetic material, and I don't think we're going to be looking at value transfers there. We're going to be recapturing share. Maybe, Carl, you have a few more words on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean as Hugh said, what we're very focused on is the Roundup franchise in and of itself and the dynamics of what's occurring in the marketplace, and then the other side of it is what we're doing about it.</p>
          <p>If you take a step back and reflect on what's occurred, the acid price has gone from $10 a kilo down to about three right now. That spurred a lot of purchasing in markets, particularly the United States, and we expect that ending inventories of generic material this year are going to probably be about 40% of next year's consumption, so inventories are quite high. And then that's leading to a third dynamic in the marketplace, which is people attempting to liquidate inventory to generate cash, which is further depressing selling prices.</p>
          <p>So against that environment, there are three things that we're doing. The first one is working to lower our manufacturing base, our cost base, and that work is underway right now. The second bucket, and we announced it today, is to restructure the business to size the support of the business with an expectation of reality that we're going to probably looking at $3 acid for the foreseeable future and a correlating $1 billion gross profit contribution from Roundup. The third bucket of work that's underway as well is what is the ultimate price/volume/share combination that's going to generate the results we want? And that last piece of work is the one that we're still working on. And we want to get through the over-the-top season this year because that will provide some more color to that decision set for us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Carl, maybe you could talk a little bit about the 2012 plan in Roundup. I guess the profit level there is maybe 50% higher than the prior trough. I know you've got a little more capacity and maybe a little bit more mix shift towards branded, but could you just characterize why the future trough looks so much healthier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yes; so the &#x2013; when we went through this cycle last time, the floor at that point was about $600 million of gross profit and we're talking about $1 billion now. So there is basically two things that drive that incremental $400 million of GP. One is we continue to lower our all-in manufacturing cost base, so gross margin per unit will be higher today than it was previously. And the other one is we have the option to sell more volume over this time period than we did last time. So it's the combination of those two that will yield the higher price. Again that's in an environment that anticipates $3 acid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And should we infer the isolation of Roundup as a prelude to something from a corporate action standpoint? It would seem like there is sufficient clarity as part of Ag Productivity, which is the biggest piece. So is this something to look forward to down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean everything is possible, Bob. I think what we've done in the divisionalization and streamlining this is much more focused on getting a future state where we optimize profit and increase the dependability on this. And to Terry point, if it's throwing off $400 million of cash and when it reaches that position, it's a decent product. But we've always been open to that conversation. We just we need to reclaim a lot of lost volume this year and lay out our stall and get ready for 2010. Comments, I'd never say never but the real focus in the first round of this is getting it back to its fighting weight.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up on Bob's question, do you see any reasons that you would want to add to your crop protection chemicals business? Obviously there is a lot of speculation in the market right now about what Dow is going to do with its business, which is obviously predominately more crop protection. Does that add anything to that part of the Monsanto portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frank, thanks for the question. As we've looked at it, the piece that we've been focusing on is seed treatments. And as we continue to increase the value that we deliver to the grower and as we continue to drive yields, and that's what he's really looking at, then the application of chemicals or seed treatments is an area that we're really interested in. We're a big customer worldwide, and we've been looking at that in our corn and our new soybean products; they will be treated. So as we're delivering 7 &#x2013; 11% more yield, we're protecting that with chemicals so that our new Roundup Ready 2 Yield products would be treated.</p>
          <p>And we're also looking at that in the veggie areas where also as you improve the performance of these vegetables seeds how do you protect them from funguses and disease at the start. But to venture in a whole bunch of generic chemistry and the same conversation where we're saying next year 80% of our profit will be in the sale of Seeds and Traits growth I think is a better strategic detour. So I think we'll get this Roundup business cleaned up. We always said it would eventually get back to more reasonable levels, but I don't see us having a broad chemical portfolio. That isn't who we are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, terrific. And looking more broadly then, given that you have so much free cash flow that you're generating, what are the areas that you would be focused more on in terms of M&amp;A today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's more of the same, Frank. So the three that I have always talked about and I think we've delivered on is repatriating cash to shareowners, either in dividends or buybacks. And the other one is I continue to look for expansions in our seed platform and expansions in our technology. And the seed platform I'm guessing as we look forward, that's going to be more international than it is domestic. And we still think there is opportunities in the vegetable framework as well.</p>
          <p>But it's interesting; if you look agriculture compared to a lot of the space right now, we don't see evidence of distressed sales. We don't see things coming in the market that are fire sales, but we continue to kick the bushes and knock on doors. And my experience in this segment is nothing is ever for sale until it's for sale. So we will continue to use that cash to try and transfer from a lower margin chemical business to a higher margin future performance Seeds and Traits business. That's how we're looking at it.</p>

          <p>Thank you, and our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question for Terry, cash conversion has been slow this year. I know you had prepaid last year, which is distorting comparisons. But you also mentioned that you have higher Roundup and seed inventories than last year. So can you tie all that together and tell us how you get to your $1.4 billion free cash flow target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question, P.J. And you're right, it has been a bit slower. And the two major things that have got to occur is that the Roundup collections which are going to occur in fourth quarter from the sales in the third quarter. So what happened is the entire Roundup season in the US moved later, which moved all of those collections to later in the year. And so a lot of that comes in the fourth quarter now when last year it came in the third quarter, so we have that factor. And then also a lot of the inventory that we &#x2013; reductions that we're going to be making consistent with the plans that we've laid out that we'll see the cash benefit of that also in the fourth quarter as well.</p>
          <p>So just a reminder, on the Roundup season last year was really a lot different than any normal season. Because of the shortage of the product, there was a lot of product that was procured earlier in the season pretty much globally, and we saw a lot of that cash come in, in the first and second quarters last year &#x2013; predominantly in the second and third quarters &#x2013; I'm sorry, second and third quarters of last year. A lot of that is going to come in, in the fourth quarter of this year. So I still feel comfortable with our ability to get to the 1.4 billion. But we're just going to have a lot more collections in the fourth quarter than what we've had in 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just quickly on SmartStax, do you need a decision by the EPA by August to make your goals for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't. We still feel confident that we'll make our planting goals in 2010, P.J, so we don't.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes it would. That's absolutely correct. I'm hesitant because our policy for 10 years has been we've never speculated on regulatory events or when those approvals come. And that's a good philosophy. There are others that don't follow it but it has served as well, but we're still feeling pretty good on our SmartStax position.</p>

          <p>Rob, we're running just a few minutes over, if we could take just two more questions please and then Hugh will wrap up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, our next question is from the line of Steve Byrne with Banc of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, Scarlett; just another one on Roundup. Terry, your unit COGS on the Roundup business have been in the seven to $8 a gallon range. Can you split that out for me, how much is fixed versus variable? And if you were able to push volumes from say 200 million gallons to maybe even getting closer to 300 million or at least high 200s, how much of a unit COGS benefit would you receive from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've always been a bit shy on splitting this out, Steve, as you can attest to, but I'll let Terry take a swing at it. We're bringing more capacity on at the back end of this year. As you know, it's a germane question as we cut the tape on our expansion and ruling. But maybe, Terry, you could make a broad comment; and then Carl, maybe say a few words in what we're seeing with generic material more or less and our cost positions there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I just I want to reiterate that I didn't give out the seven to $8 cost for the glyphosate that you quoted. I think the reality is yes there is definitely a push from plant occupancy; it's the way to think about operating the glyphosate business. And part of the value of the last expansion we put in was in fact to lower that cost position. So just by definition that means we're better off or we're wise to utilize the plant. So we haven't shared a fixed/variable breakdown of that, but when you think about the overall and the $1 billion, that's certainly incorporating a decision, a possible decision to more fully utilize the plant. Carl, I don't know if you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other piece on the COGS, so Terry addressed the fixed cost piece of it. And on the variable piece, we see some opportunities, and again it's in the $1 billion GP number, but consolidation of SKUs, formulations, and the associated leverage that goes along with that from raw materials purchasing we think is a significant opportunity. And again that number as well as utilization numbers are factored into the $1 billion GP number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl, can you clarify for me the price spread that you have on chart 15, whether not that $10 again on price spread is based on the way you account for price or whether that is more of a retail price spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be our assumption of farm gate, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What the farmer is actually experiencing.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it seems a little light but thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have time for one last question please, Rob, and Hugh will conclude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>That last question will be coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last brief question on glyphosate, as you look at the inventory levels downstream and the distributors holding what will now be relatively high cost inventory versus whatever price point you arrive at for next year, do you need to compensate the distributors? And if so, would that be a cash impact this year or it would be an impact next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we still have to make our decisions about how we approach the market, so it would be premature to talk about whether there would be some involvement in compensating distributors. But I think that when we think about the cash effect for next year, I mean we're still going to be driving forward to keep the cash within the year when we make the sale.</p>
          <p>Just by definition, if you go to a model that says you're going to run a $1 billion GP company with 400 million or so of cash flow, it says you have to run a tight working capital model. And I'm really pleased with what the team has done in running a tight working capital model through the past several years and that's paid great dividends and enabled us to make great acquisitions. So one of the things that has to be inherent with this change is that we'll continue to run a tight working capital, so I would expect to still see the cash benefit to occur in the year in which the sales occur. How will we go about handling that with distribution is still decision to be made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I would point out is we &#x2013; the series that we run with pretty tight inventories, and the inventory bubble in the marketplace isn't ours. It's the competitive generics that are sitting with all the inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the only sure thing that has ever happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're comfortable with the 20% inventory level that you've highlighted on the slides?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean that's well within historic norms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the change this time. We've seen much more generic material in the channel and it has been oversupplied and overbought, but we'll slug our way through that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just wrap up. Thanks very much for the questions this morning. I think you can take from this call that we didn't supply every answer today, but I hope that we left you with three things. And the three things that we've tried to really focus on this call were: number one, much greater clarity on Roundup as the story evolves; number two, continued confidence in our leadership in Seeds and Traits; and three, a view to 2012 that confirms our commitment to double the gross profit of this business over the life of our five-year plan.</p>
          <p>I think it's one thing to say that we have a rich pipeline that's unequaled on farm. It's another thing to see it. So I would encourage all of you to join us for our fourth annual Whistle Stop Tour for Investors on August 13 and 14. As many of you know as devotees, we're in remote locations and the hotel space is always limited. So I'd encourage you to sign up early as we've already reached the quota or sellout on our capacity. And I think the early sign-up indicates that there is absolutely no substitute in the middle of the summer for pulling on your boots, walking the fields, and talking to our customers, the growers. Ultimately, we are only successful for you if we are successful for them. So I hope you take the time and spend a bit of time with our customers this summer.</p>
          <p>So many thanks for your questions and your support this morning, and we look forward to seeing many of you in Iowa. Thanks very much.</p>
