          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Nordea International Telephone Conference. My name is Dave and I'll be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of the call, you'll be on listen-only. However, at the end of the call, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I'm now handing you over to Johan Ekwall to begin today's conference. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon. And welcome to Nordea's international telephone conference, following our Q3 numbers disclosed this morning. With me here in the room, I have the CEO of Nordea, Christian Clausen; Fredrik Rystedt, our Chief Financial Officer; and Carl-Johan Granvik, our Chief Risk Officer. We will have three short presentations by each of the three members of executive management team and then we will follow-up on a Q&amp;A session. Christian, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Johan, and welcome to this meeting. It's a pleasure for me to report a very strong performance in the third quarter. I will give you a few comments in the beginning of this meeting and then Fredrik Rystedt and Carl-Johan Granvik will take over.</p>
          <p>I will start with the slide three in the slide show you have received. And the summary is very clear, net interest income is up on the quarter, commission is up, expenses are down and loan losses are more or less flat on the same level as we expected. Operating profit is up 2% and risk-adjusted profit is down 6% on the quarter, but is up 30% on the year. And this is the reason, the main reason for this is that we have this constant delivery on our gross strategy.</p>
          <p>It proves that we have successfully executed the growth initiatives, which we launched in 2006, the interim 2006. It also shows that we have quite a strong resilience in our business franchise.</p>
          <p>On the cost management issues, we have had cost management in focus, we have right sized and done a number of things during the year as part of our middle-of-the-road approach. And we have actually decreased the number of employees by 3%, which is slightly higher than our target. And cost growth is up 3% on the year and if we take local currencies, adjust for the currency movement, then it's up 7%, exactly as planned.</p>
          <p>Net loan losses, in line with our outlook statement. Larger part of the loan losses are now collective, 17 basis points, 37 are individual and a few basis points are to the Danish guarantee scheme. It's interesting to see that we, once again, delivered very much in line with our risk models and risk profile and this is confirming that the long-term risk profile we have will be met. We have no indications that we will not stay within the average expected loss over the cycle of 25 basis points.</p>
          <p>The next slide is, of course, is very important. It is very satisfying to see that we can actually deliver operating profit, which is more or less unchanged throughout the crisis. And the loan losses have been there, and we have more or less compensated by increased revenues and as you can see we have the same level as a year ago and even if we go back further, I think we can say that it's quite amazing and it's, of course, unique on a European context to see result development like this.</p>
          <p>This means, we will continue on the journey towards Great Nordea and we have an outlook, which is more or less unchanged. Risk adjusted profit is expected to be higher this year. Cost growth is expected to be the same level as in the first nine months. And loan losses, which were 55 basis points, we expect to be broadly in line with this level for the full year as we have seen in the first nine months.</p>
          <p>We still highlight that the risk from somewhat higher loan losses remains as we did in last quarter to give the full picture. With these words, I will hand over to Fredrik Rystedt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. As you can see from slide 10 in the presentation, we had a good result development in Q3 with net interest income up with one and the net fees and commissions up by six.</p>
          <p>Total expenses down by 3% and, of course, operating profit up by two. On a year-to-date basis, income is up by 16 and the expenses by three and risk-adjusted profit up by 36% so far this year.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide, the currency impact for the quarter is relatively marginal whereas, of course, the change for the year is still significant, and especially on the income line, 0.1 versus 16%.</p>
          <p>If I turn to the different components and start with net interest income on slide 12, we've had a situation where the margins have continued to increase and, of course, particularly so for the corporate lending margins, reflecting the repricing due to the credit risk and, of course, also maintained or still liquidity premiums in the market.</p>
          <p>The strongest development as we also anticipated and discussed in Q2; strongest development was in Finland, we've also had margin improvements in the rest of the Nordic countries and particularly in Denmark and Sweden and throughout the NEM countries.</p>
          <p>Total lending to public increased by 2% and that's mainly driven by household lending, which is up by 5%. There is still a little lower demand for corporate lending being down by 1%. The corporate demand is still fairly subdued due to a relatively low investment rate among the corporates and, of course, maintain low working capital level. Net interest income is also this quarter negatively impacted by weaker deposit margins. In this particular quarter, we've had an impact or negative impact of 50 million in comparison; that impact or negative change is slightly lower than what it was in Q2 and, of course, more so in Q1, but it's still a significant one.</p>
          <p>The underlying volume trends as you can see on slide 13, the overall lending is actually down by 1% in the quarter in comparison and deposit is down by 4%, very clear from that slide is that the Nordic corporates is down by 3% and this is all in local currency, so not impacted by currency fluctuations.</p>
          <p>Change in the net interest income, if we look at those, it's clear from the slide 14 that the margin impact is relatively minor, we continued to improve, as I mentioned, on the corporate lending margins, but not quite enough to compensate with the corporate deposit margins and even more so in the household deposit margins, so that negative impact is bigger.</p>
          <p>We turn to the next slide looking at net fees and commissions, slide 15. We had a good quarter of income up by 6% and &#x2013; actually for all categories of net fees and commissions. The saving commissions continued on that positive trend that we've seen in the previous quarter, up by 7%. Payments and cards, up by 2% and lending commissions by 20%. We had a relatively weak Q2 for lending commissions, but we clearly had a good quarter and Nordea lead managed a number of transactions, including bonds, benchmark bond issues, so it was a very good quarter.</p>
          <p>It's interesting to note that if one compares with Q3 2008 and Q3 2009, the difference there is to a large extent explained by the commission expenses for the state schemes, which amounted to 52 million in the quarter. Those were not there in Q3, so we are now as a level equal to that before the crisis started in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Net gains and losses remained at a good level. We continue to see very strong demand and high activity from our customers and as a consequence, we continue to perform strongly.</p>
          <p>The volumes are slightly lower and, of course, margins to some extent normalizing, but is still a high activity within the market business. Life &amp; Pension, we had good result in the process, the product process, investment process, the product results as a consequence, that continued to improve and as a consequence the financial buffers have reached a level where we now can recognize shareholder fees and that has impacted, had a very positive impact in Q3 with 46 million. Contribution from Group Treasury in net gains is lower in Q3 than it was in Q2, more reflecting the strength in Q2 than anything else.</p>
          <p>So in summary, if we look at slide 17, you can see that the income growth in comparison to last year in the business, the customer area is up by 4.5%, strong in markets and Group Treasury and we have significant negative FX effects generating a total income improvement of 16.2%.</p>
          <p>Looking at cost, we can see that the total expenses were down 3% compared to previous quarters, which is a reflection of, of course, lower variable salaries but also the seasonal, expected seasonal impact. On a year-to-date basis, the cost growth is 3% in comparison to last year and 7% in local currencies. The cost income ratio is 48% in comparison to 53% one year ago.</p>
          <p>As you are aware of, we set a target for this year to reduce the number of employees by 2%, we have reached that target and more so and we are now just short of 1,000, fewer employees than we were at the end of the year, as you also can see on the next slide and the total reduction is 3%.</p>
          <p>So on slide 20, we can summaries the expense growth on a year-to-date basis. And clearly wage increase are relatively high on the back of high variable salaries and, of course, you can also note the significant FX effects that are within our numbers, bringing the total increase of expenses to 3.3%.</p>
          <p>If I shift a little bit to the balance sheet and the capital position initially, we can conclude that we have maintained our strong balance sheet and strengthened it even further. And our core capital position is one of the strongest in Europe. We have a significantly increased ratios actually on all levels of both core Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratio based on, of course, strong net earnings. And for the Tier 1 ratio, that has been improved further by the issue of an hybrid instrument, $1 billion jump down during the quarter. We have also, as I will come back to, lowered the risk-rated assets.</p>
          <p>So in comparison to our capital policy of having a Tier 1 ratio of 9% over the cycle, we clearly have a very strong balance sheet. Looking at risk-weighted assets, we have actively managed that down throughout this quarter and we are one billion lower than what we were at the end of Q2. The reason for the decline is partly due to, of course, lower corporate exposures and we also have a relatively limited impact from rating migration of course change in credit quality.</p>
          <p>The risk rates are stable in comparison to Q2. Worth noting is, of course, that the FX impact is fairly significant than risk-weighted assets, actually increasing our risk-weighted assets. So we are stable or slightly down despite those impacts.</p>
          <p>It has been, of course, a active quarter in terms of regulation and we've had lots of discussions relating to liquidity risk and we can conclude that Nordea's risk management framework is very well in line and sometimes stronger than the framework currently discussed on the European level. There are three measures that are currently being discussed to be implemented. As you can see on slide 23, there is the core funding ratio, has a survival period in the net stable funding. The core funding ratio is targeted &#x2013; the ratio between retail deposits and long-term wholesale funding as a ratio of total funding. It's our belief, we are convinced that our ratio is well in line with the levels that are discussed, the threshold, this is regardless of whichever definition is used and, of course, those definitions are yet to be determined.</p>
          <p>As regarding survival period, calculated in a conservative way, our size of the liquidity buffer enables us to has a survival period of approximately two years and of course the level discussed by such for the time being is roughly one month. So, of course, in that aspect we're very conservative. And net stable funding finally, it's fair to say, we have been using a similar measure or Net Balance of Stable Funding for many years. And also in this area, we are convinced that the current status is we will be able to comply with our problems also for this ratio.</p>
          <p>So finally a few words on the funding, we have continued to &#x2013; and we've been able to fund ourselves on attractive levels throughout the quarter. And I think it's also fair to say that the funding markets have gradually improved with lower credit spreads and good access to liquidity. We have issued 12 billion in long-term funding, so we are at this stage &#x2013; we have issued more long-term funding than we did through for the entire year last year and in total we can also conclude that we now have a portion of our wholesale funding, which is 70%, up from roughly 66 in Q2. So we have continued that path and with those words I will leave over to Carl-Johan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fredrik. I think stable and diversified are two words very well describing our lending portfolio. However, we are trying to simplify that on the picture 26 here, where we point out that half of the portfolio we classify as low risk including mortgage lending, residential real estate and certain sector from the corporate side, where we have not seen any tangible effect from the downturn in the economy.</p>
          <p>Then we have one third, which we classified as the normal risk area, most of the other corporate included in that area and that leaves us with 17%, which we classified as special attention area, is higher risk including commercial real estate, construction, container ships, tankers, private equity sponsored funds and Baltic countries and Russia. The change to the previous picture of one quarter ago was that we have included tankers in this segment now because that market has now deteriorated, while we have moved the bulk ships into the normal medium risk area reflecting the fact that they have seen slight recovery and also that our particular exposure in that segment has been dealt with in terms of problems occurred.</p>
          <p>Net loan losses are down slightly as you saw, 358 million, it's something 54 basis points and excluding the Danish guarantee scheme, we are down to 50 and a big part of those provisions that we do are related to collective impairments and collective provisions. Also the geographical distribution has been slightly evened out, Denmark is still the one country with the highest participation, 40%, while the other Nordic countries are very much lower and then in Europe the market tends basically to pull on this is slightly higher.</p>
          <p>All the impaired loans which increased this quarter by 9%, which is significantly lower pace of increase than in the last few quarters. And out of them, 57% are still performing even if we have classified them as impaired and are early provisioning on those. And out of the total allowances, we had a big part, 742 million out of the 1.9, being collective provisions and the coverage ratio has slightly improved from 49 to 51%.</p>
          <p>One of the areas under scrutiny is shipping, shipping is reflecting the world trade and the activity in the global economy, which has been down. We have a well-diversified portfolio, very, very small, and the mostly hit sector being the container ship sector, but &#x2013; and also have a fairly high exposure in the offshore and oil service sector, which is still doing fine. While as I said before, certain other areas like tankers, have now, let's say, some problems in the spot market, but we should also remember that is typical for operators; it's not totally in the spot market but also for</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> in and out different crops in the market rates.</p>
          <p>Impaired loans are more or less unchanged and also good to know that out of the provisions that we did for the shipping portfolio,  27 million, only two were actual specific provisions while 25 million were added to the collective provisions reflecting possible future needs for provisions and a conservative approach.</p>
          <p>The private equity fund owned companies there is no rate change, they had same exposure, same comment, 99% senior debt, which is in most of the &#x2013; for the restructures that have been going on has been kept undamaged; in others there has been a small hiccup, but all the work of necessity have been dealt with and the outcome has been on average, I would say, even slightly better than the we feared at one stage.</p>
          <p>The Baltic portfolio is, of course, still of concern, in that respect I think it is a small part, but out of the losses, they are at different provision levels, 322 basis points in this quarter. The reason for our lower provisions compared to some of our competitors are many, and here I try to highlight one is that I think we have a more stable portfolio into some more Nordic business states <mark type="inaudible" /> business, and large corporate businesses. While we have more non-existing exposure to the small local corporates, but the big-sized local corporate is one of the areas and that includes quite a lot of companies active in the commercial real-estate area where the problems still continue.</p>
          <p>We have a coverage ratio on this portfolio sell of 50%, which is also slightly up from Q2.</p>
          <p>Finally, the rating migration that Fredrik already alluded to, we still see more down rated customers than up rated, but the pace has slowed down and the effect on the risk-rated assets from the migration year-to-date is 4.3% and I think we, at the beginning of the year, talked about the possibility of a much higher migration effect. So in that respect, we had a positive development in this development as well. With those words, I leave the final summary to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and it's quickly done. We have three main messages, results remained at high levels all through the crisis; operating profit was up and we over-deliver on our long-term targets. We continue to have a very strong business development, we increased the number of customers and our market shares are going up and the continued execution of our efficiency programs in line with our plans. And this means we have a consistent delivery on the growth strategy and the journey towards Great Nordea continues and as we express it we will take a careful balance between risk and opportunities going forward.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question, Chintan Joshi from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Chintan Joshi from Nomura. I have a couple of questions. Firstly, on your trading income. I mean, if I look at the 2006, 2008 average then your quarterly average is about 275 million and it's been closer to about 500 million for the last three, four quarters. I know you are saying that you are following the strategy, increasing customer activity along with the increased margins is leading to this higher trading income.</p>
          <p>But if you could tell us given the higher customer activity &#x2013; but if we use the normalized margins that used to exist in 2007, where would trading income be at during the current level of activity. Just to kind of get an idea, how much is due to the conditions of the market and how much is due to customer activity that would be useful? The second question was on dividends, if you could guide us what the dividend policy for 2010 is shaping out to be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on the markets, net gains/losses, I cannot give you the figure you are asking for because we've not calculated in that way. But I can say something, which I also said at the press meeting today and that is that we see a much higher level of activity within this business area we call risk management products for corporate customers, where we help the corporates to manage their balance sheet and the risks. This is a growing business and we expect the number of transactions to continue high and the volumes to be high in this area as those small corporates are having this service and, of course, there are more corporates need the service; that's clear from the crisis.</p>
          <p>So I think it's fair to say we expect volumes and transactions to be higher, we had had a period with a very favorable margin from that area too and that is there's somewhat pressure now. And the question is what will happen going forward and there are here too two opposite directions. One is that we are seeing more international competitors coming back after their problems competing on this, but also we are, of course, seeing that regulators are planning that the capital consumption in this area took a whop, quite a lot, and I'm not sure everyone has factored that into their operations yet or at least they will have to do it. So &#x2013; and that should actually not lead to lower margins as the capital equation goes up. The other thing is that part of this income is our very strong activity on the debt capital markets and the equity capital markets, and both are very strong positions we have gained in the last few years. And I think we will actually keep those positions at least on target.</p>
          <p>So you can say that we have probably shifted our position in this area. Not least equity market where we, one and a half year ago, was small if not present, where we now have a very significant presence. We're building it gradually and we are not at all there yet where we want to be, but we have at least reached a very good position and we're targeting to lead right now.</p>
          <p>So there are several areas pointing to the ration that this is going to be a very healthy business line going forward. And what the margins then will do, I think, is up for everyone to try to figure out, because it's not that easy to guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get the dividend there, our dividend policy is to distribute 40% of net income, which has been there for several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how is it shaping up for 2010? Can we expect like last year or is 40% going to be the payout ratio that you're targeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course this is a decision for the Annual General Meeting and for the owners, so it's not possible for us to comment on. Of course, we lowered it as you rightly said in 2008 as a measure to strengthen the balance sheet together with the rights issue. But our policy is 40% and, of course, is the decision for the AGM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, may I follow-up on the first question? I mean, consensus currently has trading income at about 350 million a quarter, whereas you have been delivering just out of 500 million. Are we way off in our numbers when we are looking at trading income, we are actually 50 a quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not given any outlook on this particular issue. I think I have commented fairly well on our expectations from the business volumes and our strategy going forward. Since it's a margin issue, it's very difficult to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Geoff Dawes from Fox-Pitt, Kelton, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. It's Geoff Dawes here from Fox-Pitt, Kelton. I have got two questions, one's quite narrow, one's quite broad, quite conveniently. But first for the narrow one; if I look at your Swedish operations, your household lending volumes have increased by about 9% quarter-on-quarter. I know, you've given us a little bit of color on that already, but could you just outline basically a little bit more detail. So is this new sales, is it refinancing kind of LTVs, mortgage consumer split, just any color you can give us on that 9% quarter-on-quarter increase?</p>
          <p>On the second question, on page seven you outlined the trends in pre-provision profitability, as page seven of the presentation. Could you just give us a bit of guidance on not just how you expect that to go to develop going forward, but more specifically between different operations where you expect pre-provision profitability to increase and where you expect it to decrease, so essentially between the different banking markets? Those are the two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe I can start with the first one, the Swedish household, it is generally a strong market and actually has been for this entire year. And the growth is, of course, largely, the underlying growth is largely a consequence of the lower interest rate environment and continued strong housing markets. However, the absolute growth of 9% is very largely due to &#x2013; in a substantial part due to the currency strengthening on the Swedish crown. So the reported number overstates in that sense the growth in Sweden, that's the main reason.</p>
          <p>And your first question, that is related to where we see the biggest potential going forward, when it comes to the profit, was that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pre-provisions or before provisions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But I can &#x2013; that's a very broad question, I would say. What we have been saying is that we believe that as the economy gradually stabilizes and maybe we will also see some growth next year and that volumes will start to pick up again. And so the question about our potential is very much in terms of various &#x2013; different directions and margins. The deposit margins are very low right now because of low interest rates and some <mark type="inaudible" /> we move up again. And that's a fairly significant amount of income, which is a potential there. And then again corporate lending margins might stabilize, which is another direction, provisions and fee and commissions seems to be going up as savings increases, we expect that continue and also in other areas. And net gains/losses is, as we earlier discussed, somewhat uncertain.</p>
          <p>But the general underlying business growth, as we like to call it, is the underlying growth of customers and business. And there we see an inflow of new customers, which of course generates more business, especially as they come in, in fees and so on, but also net interest income. And we are still penetrating our customer base with more business.</p>
          <p>So we think we have an underlying growth rate by penetrating our cost base and attracting new customers who live in our area. So that's the reason why we are repeating again, our long-term target, we still believe there is an underlying potential out there of 10%. But next year it's difficult to forecast quarter-by-quarter because these margins are moving in different directions and which effect will come first is very difficult to forecast.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was great. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up, if you could give us just a bit of regional color on it as well. As an example Finland, you've seen a very extensive contraction in pre-provision profitability. Do you expect that to continue or do you expect the markets where pre-provisions have contracted to be the markets, which drive the growth in '010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the last part of your statement is probably the right one. Finland is particularly hurt because we have a significant deposit base, specifically high base of transaction accounts, where the money is just standing there and, of course, here the interest rate level is extremely important. The other thing is that we are pushing Finland a bit more right now because we want to strengthen the number of areas and we think that we have a good potential in Finland.</p>
          <p>Sweden is on a good steady growth rate underlying the new customers in business, so we feel comfortable about that. Norway has grown fast; that is probably likely to continue, we are also coming from a lower market share there. And Denmark is a very solid position. And I would say that the acquisitions we have done and the new customers coming on there also seems to be a good position. So I would say, we see actually a quite good potential in all the Nordic countries for slightly different reasons.</p>
          <p>The Baltics will come back on stage again one day, maybe towards the end of next year. We have a very strong bank and I think we're gaining reputation in the Baltics by having stayed rock solid through the crisis in the Baltics. And then Poland, as you probably heard me say before, is the wonder of all wonders. We are building a fantastic bank in Poland with new branches, good growth, low risk, low loan losses, strong profitability, so resuming the growth of branches, the grow rate we had last year is something, which we'll be looking at when we go further with the plans for next year.</p>

          <p>And I think the next question is from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Bank of America, just two questions. Maybe if you could &#x2013; you're just touching on sort of the growth opportunities. And you've highlighted sort of what the organic opportunity &#x2013; I saw some comments from the press conference this morning that you are also open to look at acquisition opportunities at least within your current footprint.</p>
          <p>Could you talk a little bit of where that is, are we talking similar things to what you've done in Denmark, maybe larger in terms of size and what do you think your scope is to make acquisition in terms of total investments?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just following up on your comments on liquidity earlier. You said that you had liquidity to withstand without access to wholesale funding markets for two years. When you talk about that, can you just give us your underlying assumptions, what are you assuming in terms of deposit volumes, so I would presume and expect that you would assume a significant portion of the deposits to leave the bank, just if you can elaborate a bit on how you arrive at those two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start with the acquisition part, no new messages in acquisitions, we have said all the time that our prime road forward is organic growth existing customers and new customers. But then we also said that we will be looking at all possible acquisition, possibly is coming in our area and within our footprint and that happened this year in Denmark and it can certainly not be ruled out, it will happen in other areas, not necessarily only banks that are distressed but also banks that may think that this new burden of capital regulation and liquidity and all sort of things, which is going to complicate life for a lot of smaller entities to &#x2013; I would say to an extreme extent actually will make some much smaller banks want to take another decision.</p>
          <p>And we are &#x2013; in all our <mark type="inaudible" />  to look at this, we have only one hurdle rate &#x2013; not only one but we had at least one important hurdle rate, which we also have been stated all the time that we will not take on risks we do not feel comfortable about. So we have to understand the balance sheet and the risk very carefully as we did in Denmark on the two acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Whether they are larger or smaller is, maybe, not an issue, of course, it's always nice if they are larger. And I think we have some scope to do things here, I think we have a track record of acquiring and merging. And I think we have a successful track record. We have proven that we know how to do it and I think we know that still, actually we a cookbook on how to do it, so we know how to cook if off. And we actually have executed very well the first acquisition in Denmark also, which is small; it's done already.</p>
          <p>So I would say, we are ready to move and I think we have the scope to move also on things, which could be somewhat bigger than those in Denmark. But they have to present themselves and they have to be within our risk appetite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yah, to the second question regarding the long-term funding of the survival period. First of all, the defined definition of this measure is actually not done yet and I think there is going to be some more discussions before it is done. We have approached this from an angle of conservatism, and the measure set up is basically that the baseline is the maturing wholesale items that we have. So retail loans and deposits are not assumed to mature during the time horizon, so basically being constant.</p>
          <p>And on top of that baseline, the <mark type="inaudible" /> liquidity buffer is added, and of course only the items that has not, for instance, been pledged for Central Bank payment traffic or other kind of purposes. So that's the measure set up and the assumptions behind this measure is that it describes how long do you have positive cash flows provided that liquid assets can be utilized to generate liquidity.</p>
          <p>And basically what this actually describes, this measure actually describes, is it describes a scenario when wholesale funding is basically not available. It does not cover scenarios when other sources of funding are leaking out, for instance, retail deposits. So this is the definition done. And of course one can apply couple of different calculations methods. We have conservatively assumed that the liquidity buffer is only that of the whole held in treasury, and we are not using, for instance, room in the cover pools whilst other banks are actually doing this.</p>
          <p>So these are the assumptions and this is how the measure in more explicit terms are set up. But it may be eventually more loose than what I just said, so again this is how we define it.</p>

          <p>And the next question is from Matti Ahokas from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken Capital Market. Question on the deposit margins, do you believe that the deposit margins actually have crossed here in Q2 or sorry Q3 or do you kind of still expect them to go down from these levels assuming that interest rates are where they are at the moment? And also a question on the Finnish deposit margin, it was actually negative. Was that a question of the reference rate and how is that calculated?</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding, you've increased the share of collective provisions, which is quite unlike what some of your competitors are doing. You previously said that you've used the collective provisions when you've been less certain about the grip on the credit quality. Why increase it now, because it seems at least the individual provisions are developing quite favorably.</p>
          <p>And then last, if I may, just on the long-term funding, you have increased the share of long-term funding, will this mean that the net interest margin in Q4 will go down or is it visible already in the Q3 net interest income? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I can start answering the first question with deposit margins. The &#x2013; of course the absolute dominating reason why the profit margin is down is of course related to the interest rate movement decline and of course that largely happened before Q3. So just by judging  from the interest rate level, of course it's unlikely that we will see further declines in the deposit margin, simply because of the fact that no material changes in the interest rate environment is actually taking place during Q3. So it's been a fairly stable level throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>I think the other reason for the deposit margin decline is, of course, the fierce competition for deposits, which basically is due to the fact that many banks are using deposits as a funding and those banks being less able to fund attractively on the market than Nordea is. So of course that pushes up prices for deposits and eventually, of course, also takes down margin.</p>
          <p>Just by adjusting for the first factor, it's not very reasonable to believe that interest rates will actually fall it seems more that the term perhaps is more on the upside. As regards the competition, we believe it's still going to be fierce throughout quarter but not necessarily much worse than it is now. It's, of course, always very difficult to anticipate there going forward, but it's likely to be, as you have seen the trend, falling in Q2 and now falling again in Q3 in terms of deterioration that could also be a likely scenario for Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the collective provisions, the simple answer is that, it very much reflects our conservative approach to provisioning. It's true, and it  <mark type="inaudible" /> for the fact that specific provisions are down but the uncertain economy is still there and we still see slightly higher downgradings in our overall portfolio than upgradings is why I have chosen to still increase these collective provisions. Hopefully, one day we will be able to take most of them back but that's going to be the day when we wait to see clear skies ahead of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards to long-term funding and the increase of ratio in terms of wholesale funding, of course wholesale funding long-term is more expensive than the short-term, so there is a marginal impact. Having said that, the liquidity on the short-term market is continuously very, very strong, and that also means that the ability for us to fund on extremely attractive terms, both &#x2013; particularly in the short-term but also on the long-term, actually gives relatively small impact in our increasing that ratio. So I wouldn't expect major impact on the net interest income from that movement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In relation to these answers, we could say that collective provisions are mainly up in the Baltic countries as well as in shipping. It's not related to the Nordic region.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Andreas H&#xE5;kansson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Two questions, first one is back to the Swedish NII or the Swedish loan growth. It seems like you are the only Swedish bank that's growing volumes at the moment in this quarter, and it sounds like FX explained most of it. Could you tell us the same impact, these FX movements had on the NII that was quite strong in the quarter, which is a sharp contrast to some of your peers in Sweden?</p>
          <p>Then if you looked at Russia and Baltics, I just still want to understand a little bit better what's going on with the MTS and the provisions. I mean, in Russia you have very, very low provisions and when I compared it to some of your local peers, there is a very big difference, could you tell us a little bit about the differences there?</p>
          <p>Then in the Baltics you grew very quickly in 2007, 2008, I think faster than even the market leaders. Still you have a much lower coverage ratio and a much lower NPL ratio than your peers, could you guys explain why that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question was the FX effect on net interest income in Sweden, whether that is positive or negative this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It has a major impact on the net income growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Not major, but it had a significant impact. And if you look at the actual lending on the household side, it is more than half related to FX impact for the household side as we elaborated on before but it is a strong impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding Russia to start with, I think we should remember that our portfolio is totally different from that of local banks, not to talk about them but also most of the foreign banks that have been for a long time. Our portfolio is almost entirely made up of big corporate, well known corporate customers in the energy and in the metallurgic sector, which enjoy still &#x2013; particularly the energy sector, with markets that make good profit. And they are also among those customers that have been singled out by the government to get support if needed.</p>
          <p>So the absence of mid-markets, I will not to talk about this, at least in the portfolio is the main reason that it cannot be compared to the overall market. Regarding Baltics, again I think we have said it before, the main reason is that we have always applied a very prudent and constant and the reason constant is, there in order to supply we have never been closed for business, we have always been open for good business, are still today. But we have always avoided the pitfalls that represent in &#x2013; some years ago when the markets started to heat up. And also the structure of the portfolio, as I said before, a bit more Nordic, international big large companies and municipalities and so on, makes it &#x2013; our portfolio is simply a stronger portfolio, which has of course been seen by the, say, neutral comparison when you look at our rate 47:15) non-performing loans to the market's non-performing loans.</p>
          <p>So we feel that the &#x2013; we have a prudent approach and the provisions that we have made, most of which are in the collective provisions, also show that number of single individual losses is still on a very manageable level. But we are taking height for the risk of increasing and continuing problems also going forward. So that would be my short answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can add in one thing, because there is a misconception, the thing about that, we have particular a fast growth in seven or eight, we actually have a complete linear growth over many years, maybe eight to 10 years. Because the way we have grown in the Baltics has been to establish a new branch, start it and get good customers and high quality customers in. And that we can only do at the pace we can open branches. So that has been a complete linear relationship.</p>
          <p>Now others took down our growth in seven and eight, that made our relative shares look somewhat bigger. But if you look at the absolute growth in euros, then we have had a completely linear growth and that is the main explanation for what Johan said that our credit quality is good is that we have not grown by buying portfolios or buying business by price competition, we have simply taken in, customer by customer, credit rated and taking them in &#x2013; within our segment strategies. So we have simply targeted some spread, some segments with a better credit quality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. Just last question on that topic, if I may. And so your mortgage book is, what is it, 2.5 billion. Could you tell us the average loan to value &#x2013; Swedbank gives us a number, which is quite helpful. Could you do the same please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sitting here, no, I cannot do that. Of course, there has been a deterioration in the value of those mortgage collaterals that we have there. And that is one of the reasons for the provisions that we have been doing, i.e. covering by provisions those gaps that are coming forward, but I don't have the loan to value figure.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had a couple of questions. First, I would like to look at the number of the risk your books, the private equity book, the shipping book and the construction book. Could you give a sense of the NPLs and the coverage ratios you have on those books if possible? And then second question was just on your Swedish operations, what would have been the corporate lending growth in the quarter, ex the FX effect? And then lastly, just on the margins that you have in the different regions in the Nordics. How much of the corporate books have been repriced at this point, how much further repricing do you think we can see over the coming quarters in those four countries? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start with the leading three segments, shipping, we already commented on that. And so we have impaired loan level of 190 basis points in the shipping portfolio, basically related to a very huge number of customers which &#x2013; where we have restructurings ongoing and therefore they are being classified as non-performing. We have taken the provisions, which we feel are necessarily based on the collateral value gaps or the gaps in future cash flow. And I think this has to be seen very much as individual cases where the majority of the company still have to refine their strong listed companies with access to capital market to fill gaps rather than having just to rely on bank credit for that purpose. So that means that we see this as a high-risk area as we said, but still the level of absolute losses we don't see that to be a problem of size in relation to Nordea.</p>
          <p>Private equity, I will say that it has been fairly calm autumn, the early on &#x2013; let's say, one year ago we identified the cases where we might have the problems going forward based on high leverage and sensitivity in terms of sector exposure through its very cyclical industries. Most of them have been re-scheduled with very satisfactory outcome with new <mark type="inaudible" /> has been wiped out and is more haircut for the banks in some of the cases but in most of the cases the senior loans being kept intact. So obviously, so far so good in that respect, and new cases have certainly slowed down because most of the high leverage ones have been refinanced and thereby put on the right key again.</p>
          <p>And regarding construction industry, to say that is an industry, which, I would say, two other countries that is Finland and Sweden, we have roughly seen any problems whatsoever, the reason being that they are totally dominated by the big four or five actors, which are strong companies and are able withheld or withstand the downturn of the market. Where we have seen some problems and that is reflected in the higher figures in Denmark is that, because of the bubble that was created in Denmark, some of the construction industry. We have also taken some hints there, but to much lesser extent as we have been dealing with the office segment of investors and operators.</p>
          <p>And the same, we can say regarding Norway, we have had some smaller construction companies where we have the need for provisioning and reschedule of debt. But also as there we have avoided the risky areas, which in &#x2013; say both countries have been basically banked by the small banks and the big banks, I think Nordea has been able to stay out of all those questions. So they are not therefore in the Nordea level too overextended in the nonperforming loan sector, even by definition a typical industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. I think the first question was relating to the loan growth, the reported loan growth in Sweden was plus two and adjusting for currencies approximately minus 3%. If we look at the repricing as we talked about in, also in Q2 the corporate lending is significantly more easy to reprice in particularly Denmark and Norway. And that has largely been done there, whilst we saw, in particular, future possibilities in Finland and to some extent, in Sweden. I think the Q3 result we can clearly see that the margins have increased in all countries still and particularly for Finland.</p>
          <p>In more general terms, of course new lending margins are not increasing in more general terms we are talking more about repricing of the stock. There is still lending outstanding which carries low margins and it's primarily the repricing of the lending book is primarily coming from that repricing &#x2013; reprising of the stock.</p>
          <p>So I think in summary of course, we have increased margins significantly and the environment is clearly being more &#x2013; is a more difficult task to do that in the future, but we have managed to do that in Q4 and in Q3 as you have seen from the numbers and there maybe some upside also going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Can I just ask you what percentage of the book have yet to get repriced?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think it's difficult to actually say. It follows the line of logic that a large portion of that book is actually repriced of course in Denmark and also in Norway and the proportion is less, particularly in Finland, but exactly how big that portion is difficult to say.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon Jan Wolter here, Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions, if I may. First, if you can give some more color on our loan loss indication for 2010. For example, if you assume there that we will see lot less loan losses in the Baltics, more in shipping what are the assumptions there? The second question is if you could give an update on the current NII sensitivity for 100 bps WIPA hike in Europe Nordic area. And if you would be comfortable in increasing this sensitivity, i.e. increase the interest rate risk in the bank. And the third question is on the trading line coming back to that, we can see in the report on page 20 there that all the increase in the trading line this year has been in an area called markets other, could you just give some color on this again there. Is this primarily effect of new mandates or what other factors could drive this development because it's booked here outside the custom, the normal custom operations rather in this market other? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Loan loss assumptions for 2010, we do not do that, I think Carl-Johan, will you give a few more senses of that one?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't have a figure, but I would say on the &#x2013; as you mentioned, obviously we see that this extra set up today in problem will not just come out of there overnight, meaning that in the Baltics we see continuing higher provisioning level than in the Nordic markets. Also that the shipping portfolio will take some time to work itself through, but I think they have demonstrated here in this year which just has passed that they have been able to handle those problems with very limited losses at the end of day and at the same time we can clearly see that we have started on the recovery journey in the Nordic economy. So those would give some sort of let's say, that is for yourself to make your own estimate, but say nobody really knows and we are still overlooking for the confirmation of the strength of the recovery before we really dare to say anything more about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As it relates to the sensitivity of the net interest income we &#x2013; I think you can see in the fact book, the SIIR is approximately 140 million for increasing market rates, of course, positive and decreasing market rates, roughly 240 or just below that. So that gives you a sensitivity for net interest income. And the third question I actually did not catch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that follow-up question is about NII sensitivity, if you would be comfortable in increasing this sensitivity, which would mean that you increase the interest rate risk in the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This largely of course is a result of the possessions we have in the bank relating to our normal operational activity and to some extent the trading we have within the VaR risk mandates that we have in the group. So, of course we are &#x2013; we have a possibility to change these numbers using the existing VaR mandates that you know of, so yes of course we can change these figures. But these are the numbers that are in the sensitivity at the end of Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question was related to the net gains, losses, increase in net gain losses being reported under markets other. And that is basically, since we have the split between the revenue from risk management products in markets between the business areas and markets. And generally speaking, these are of course very closely related to when we are increasing our business with our core customers, and we have done that, we have taken a larger share of volatility during the last nine months when competition has been less intense and not many players have actually been quoting prices to weigh prices during these difficult times.</p>
          <p>Then we have improved our position with these customers, margins have also been very &#x2013; been higher than normal and to a large extent that the margin expansion is played in this markets other. It's not related to the increase with mandates &#x2013; that you can see from our risk measures in the reports. So it's more to increase share of wallet and somewhat higher margins that is the basis for it.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Could you come back to slide 45 and the gearing to raising rates. I still don't really understand why &#x2013; if you haven't hedged more would it have increased because you've raised your equity efforts to understand that. And then when do think rates will rise, what's Nordea's internal view on rates are rising? And then the secondary is loan growth, obviously, corporate lending volumes are going down, when do you think that will stop, do you think it'll go down further, more deleveraging to come?</p>

          <p>Facts and figures. Yes, ma'am.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel the number is very low relative to the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's, it has been actually similar, so if you take Q2, it was 150 and the increase their form Q1 was 150, up from 87. So in fact it's &#x2013; and Q4 was 55. So in alternative, it has actually been low for now almost a year. And the difference there between Q1 and Q2 was actually triggered by the rights issue. So you say we have maintained roughly the same level throughout this year. So basically it positions to some extent for low interest rates in more general terms and of course that over time will increase back again. The lower number, decreasing market rates partly has to do with the fact that interest rates actually cannot decline more than 1%. But that's the underlying trend. It has been fairly stable as you can see from slide 44, 45.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there was a question on the lending, on the lending growth, was that you announced?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Whether the corporate volumes could go down further, I mean, what you think corporates intend to do?</p>

          <p>Answer for corporate lending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is a demand driven thing, we all know that the corporates have taken down working capital and not an issue that new investments are working to that, capital is most likely coming up right now, because new orders are starting to build again that's indeed our expectation and probably also some investments will come online. So I don't think we expect any more deleveraging. The main question is how much of this funding will be done on our balance sheet and how much will be done on the debt capital markets? And that remains to be seen, we are very active in both areas, so it's not that big a difference for us. But the actual strong growth in the corporate sector again will require a clear recovery, a clearer recovery picture than is looking into right now in my opinion. So I cannot get any further into this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just come back to the &#x2013; to your interest rates and when Nordea's half year rates in, say, Sweden and Finland and Denmark start to rise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that of course &#x2013; first of all, of course, the Swedish rates of 0.25 is clearly not a recession interest, it's a crisis interest that we would expect of course that to rise during next year, at least at the latest during Q3. For the Norway, that is expected to be happening earlier than that, but it's during the course of next year, the likely estimate, but of course it's a difficult guess.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay. In which case, I'll take the next question, which is from Fridtjof Berents from Arctic Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got questions related to capital adequacy and funding. And first, you show the average risk rates of the corporate portfolio to be 60%. And I wonder if you just could indicate the split between Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland? And regarding market risk, as understood the CEO and discussions in Brussels committee and so on, you would expect the risk, the capital requirements for the trading book to increase. But over the two or three last quarters, you have seen a decrease in the capital requirements for Nordea. And I just wonder if could you elaborate slightly on that? And the last question is related to page 24 in the conference materials. And you show there is 70% long-term funding in Q3, is that portion you think is correct going forward and what is the average duration on the long-term funding and whether is that likely to increase or not down the road?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Maybe I can start, I'm not sure who answers what here. But let's start with the first question. The capital adequacy, the split is not something we are in fact providing in terms of the risk rate. So I cannot give you an answer on that. Relating to the capital requirement, of course, you're will aware of the new components of how to measure the capital consumption or the risk here, or the capital consumption from market risk. And of course they are expected to be implemented most likely 1st of January, 2011, so it's still a year to go, so to speak. In fact the general trend, the general expectation from those new rules and here you should direct me, Carl-Johan, but this is expected to increase capital consumptions from this kind of activity would roughly between 2 and 300%. So again this is not something that is actually, you cannot track this from the last months or even in the next few months and you will see that going forward.</p>
          <p>The final question relating to the founding whether it's 70% or not. We have maintained a level of more than 60% for the last several years. And we have taken the liberty or taken the opportunity to actually increase that slightly to 70%, we've been in over 60% for several years. And we've been over 63% in the last year, we have now increased that. The duration is less than a issue because that is more of a interest rate issue, it's much more the maturity profile and we have maintained that maturity profile over the last several years.</p>
          <p>So if you're asking about the tendency going forward, I think the general trend and partly because of the risk measures I elaborated on before, the liquidity risk measure. I think for the banking industry, as a whole, it's likely that maturity profiles will extend and the portion of long-term funding will also extend or increase. For Nordea as such, we believe we already have a very long maturity profile and of course also a very high portion of long-term funding. So we don't expect of any measure changes in that aspect for Nordea.</p>
