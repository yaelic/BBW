          <p>Thank you for standing by. Good day everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com First Quarter 2009 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I would now be turning the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Rob Eldridge. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, and welcome to our Q1 '09 financial results conference call. Joining us today is Tom Szkutak our CFO. Jeff Bezos, our founder and CEO, and Tom will both be available for Q&amp;A. The following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today April 23, 2009 only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.</p>
          <p>If you listen to today's call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures and our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. I'll begin with comments on our financial results. Trailing 12 month free cash flow grew 82% to $1.43 billion. Return on invested capital was 41%, up from 32%. ROIC is trailing 12 month free cash flow divided by average total assets minus current liabilities excluding the current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.</p>
          <p>The combination of common stock and stock based awards outstanding was 447 million shares compared with 435 million. Worldwide revenue grew 18% to $4.89 billion or 25% excluding the $268 million unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Media revenue increased to $2.72 billion, up 7% or 13% excluding foreign exchange. EGM revenue increased to $2.05 billion, up 38% or 46% excluding FX. Worldwide EGM increased to 42% of worldwide sales, up from 36%. Worldwide unit growth was 30%.</p>
          <p>Active customer accounts exceeded 91 million, up 16%. Worldwide active seller accounts were more than 1.6 million, up 19%. Seller units were 32% of total units versus 30%. Worldwide gross profit was 1.15 billion dollars, up 20%.</p>
          <p>Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock based compensation. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content, and G&amp;A combined was $826 million or 16.9% of sales, unchanged year-over-year. Fulfillment was $407 million or 8.3% of revenue while tech and content was $239 million or 4.9% of revenue; both were unchanged from the prior year. Marketing was $124 million or 2.5% of revenue, up 11 basis points from the prior year.</p>
          <p>Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods we do not allocate to segments, our stock based compensation or the other operating expense income net line item.</p>
          <p>In the North America segment, revenue grew 21% to $2.58 billion. Media revenue grew 8% to 1.31 billion dollars. EGM grew 42% to $1.17 billion representing 45% of North America revenues, up from 39%. North America gross profit grew 22% to $694 million and gross margin increased 18 basis points to 26.9% driven by improvements in inventory management including vendor pricing and the increase in the 3P product sales partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.</p>
          <p>North America segment operating income increased 15% to $150 million, a 5.8% operating margin. In the International segment, revenue grew 15% to $2.31 billion. Revenue growth was 28% adjusting for the $258 million year-over-year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates during the quarter. Media revenue grew 6% to $1.42 billion or 17% excluding FX, and EGM revenue grew 34% to $874 million or 50% excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. EGM now represents 38% of International revenues, up from 33%.</p>
          <p>International gross profit grew 17% to $454 million or grew 33% excluding foreign exchange rates. While gross margin increased 36 basis points to 19.6%, driven by improvements in inventory management, including vendor pricing and increases in 3P product sales, partially offset by lower prices for our customers and changes in product mix.</p>
          <p>International segment operating income increased 34% to $172 million, a 7.4% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from FX, International segment operating income increased 63%. CSOI grew 25% to $322 million or 6.6% of revenue, up 33 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the $32 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates, CSOI grew 37%.</p>
          <p>Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense slash income. GAAP operating income grew 23% to $244 million or 5% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Our income tax expense was $69 million in Q1 or a 28% rate for the quarter. GAAP net income was $177 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared with $143 million and $0.34 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, cash and marketable securities increased $579 million year-over-year to $2.73 billion. Our cash and marketable securities primarily consist of cash, government and government agency securities, AAA-rated money market funds, and other investment grade securities. Such amounts are recorded at fair value. During the quarter, we redeemed the remaining 240 million euros, $319 million based on the euro to US dollar exchange rate at the date of redemption and principal of our 6.875% peaks.</p>
          <p>Inventory increased 18% to $1.27 billion and inventory turns were 12.5, down half a turn from the prior year as we expanded selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 28% to $2.38 billion and accounts payable days increased to 57 from 53 in the prior year. Our investment in net fixed assets increased $295 million from a year ago to $889 million. Our Q1 2009 capital expenditures were $55 million.</p>
          <p>I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.</p>
          <p>As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can all have material effect on guidance. Our guidance assumes that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or investments, record any further revisions to stock based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently.</p>
          <p>For Q2, we expect net sales to be between 4.3 and $4.75 billion or growth between 6 and 17%. This guidance anticipates approximately 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. GAAP operating income to be between 110 and $190 million or a decline between 49 and 12%. The second quarter 2008 results include the $53 million noncash gain recognized on the sale of the company's European DVD rental assets. This includes approximately $90 million for stock based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock based compensation and other operating expense to be between 200 and $280 million or between 18% decline and 14% growth.</p>
          <p>We anticipate our free cash flow growth rate to trend similar to our operating profit growth rate over time with some variability including from changes in working capital and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. We remain heads down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection, and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks, and with that, Rob, let's move to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&amp;A portion of the call with Jeff and Tom. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how to initiate a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll have our first question from Doug Anmuth with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Great quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about the 2Q guidance and in particular is there something that you're seeing early in the quarter that is making the outlook look a little bit lower than we would have expected versus the 1Q numbers, particularly on the margin side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Our guidance from a revenue standpoint is growth of 6 to 17%. That's on a dollar basis, on a local currency basis that works out to be 13 to 24%. A few things to keep in mind, one, last year Q2 was our strongest growth quarter, so if you take a look at the splits by quarter last year, we had 41% growth rate in Q2 or 35% growth rate on a local currency basis. So we're overlapping that growth rate, again the strongest quarter.</p>
          <p>A couple other things to keep in mind on the top line as well, smaller impacts but certainly Easter was in Q1 last year, it's in Q2 this year. So we had that benefit in Q1, and we will be overlapping that in Q2. Also as I mentioned from an exchange standpoint, the 700 basis points is more than you saw in Q1, so again those are the impacts on the top line. So that's why the high end of the range, if you will, works out to be 24% which is a little bit below what we came in for Q1. So that translates down into obviously a lower operating income.</p>
          <p>The other thing to keep in mind too is as you look at our Q2 seasonally, Q2 is our lowest quarter from a revenue perspective. And which means with that top line, you get a little bit less leverage in particularly the fixed operating costs. So that's reflected in the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have our next question from James Mitchell with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you for taking the question which is about the improvements in gross margins year on year in the first quarter. Were there any unusual gross margin influences other than our old friends inventory management, third party mix, EGM mix and lower prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are the &#x2013; you know, those are the big pieces from the inventory management. You know, we worked well with vendors in terms of getting vendor savings. An example would be something we have been working on for a number of quarters, but certainly working with them to ship when they have shipments, to ship in bulk to the nearest fulfillment center. The benefit of that is they get, is a way to share some of those savings, shipping to the closest facility, and then we get to optimize taking that larger bulk shipment and optimizing that in our network. So things like that. But certainly inventory management, vendor savings and also third party growth were certainly key factors, and those were partially offset by lower prices to customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Digital sales an impact or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, digital sales as you can, you're referring to Kindle sales or all digital or? Digital is certainly part of the numbers. One thing to keep in mind as you think about Kindle specifically from a device standpoint, we recognize that in the month following shipment over a two-year period. We amortize that over a two-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have our next question from Jeetil Patel with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys, two questions. First of all, It's probably hard to break out, but I guess maybe a qualitative view. But I'm just curious, how much of your core infrastructure that you've been building over the last couple of years is being redeployed in other business initiatives such as FBA and AWS that are maybe contributing to the operating profit line? I guess is there any way to quantify that of what the contribution looks like to CSOI at the end of the day. Some of your newer initiatives in terms of kind of leveraging the fixed assets and costs that you built out over the years?</p>
          <p>Second question is I guess can you characterize how much downsizing and retrenching that online and offline retailers are doing out there in the landscape is you know kind of impacting your business positively? Or in general as it relates to as you go, kind of go after customers or consumers as well as just talking to your suppliers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first part of your question, just you know maybe talk to how we think about the overall infrastructure both from a operations as well as infrastructure capacity standpoint. The retail part of our business, we plan for peak, and so when you think about say fulfillment capacity, we're certainly planning for peak, which again is in December. Our infrastructure capacity that supports our retail business, we also plan for peak as well. And so some of the things that you're seeing with FBA as well as web services, we're not looking at it as a way to use our existing infrastructure. We're looking at them as separately standing businesses, if you will, and we look at the economics that way as well. So I don't know if that's helpful, so it's hard to tease apart, to answer your question. And then the second part, could you repeat the second part of the question, Jeetil, sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>One moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it having for you guys in terms of talking to consumers and talking to your suppliers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you, you were cutting out. I apologize. I couldn't hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just trying to understand whether online and offline retailers as they shrink their business kind of growth spending out there, how much of an impact is that having or opportunity is that as you go kind of go after customers as well as go after better supplier terms out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I apologize. I don't think I can help you much with that one. I would just add to the first one that we use the same &#x2013; so for example the Fulfillment by Amazon inventory is commingled with our Amazon owned inventory in the same fulfillment center. So in that respect we're leveraging those fixed investments, but we're not &#x2013; there's not excess capacity that we can -- we're building new capacity both for Amazon owned inventory and new capacity for FBA. But it is -- but it is commingled inventory. Same thing for web services, when you look at our data centers. The Amazon retail services and the web services that we offer through infrastructure and computing like EC2 and S3, those are commingled in the same data centers as well, so there you go.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll have our next question from Mark Mahaney with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Jeff, in your shareholder letter you refer to muda or waste, a Japanese word for waste and you talk about being able to, seeing it in a lot of different places and a lot of potential. Could you maybe bring it down to financial terms for us and where do you think you have your best opportunity to get at that waste and where we would see it maybe show up? Or are we already seeing it in terms of some of those CapEx efficiencies? CapEx spending seems to be nicely contained.</p>
          <p>And then secondly just on marketing spend, is there any particular reason why you're not seeing a little bit more efficiency in marketing spend given what seems to be pretty clear deflationary trends in online display or search advertising? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the muda point, this is very encouraging for me and very energizing for me that everywhere we look, and every team here looks. When we look, we find that we are doing every operation that we do in suboptimal ways. We've gotten better every year, but we still have a lot of progress that we can make. And that's encouraging because it means we can get variable &#x2013; we believe we can get variable and fixed productivity for a long time to come. So that's the opportunity. I don't know how to quantify that for you. I mean, we do have every time we go through our planning process, we do set top down targets for variable and fixed productivity, and we try to work towards those and make sure that we're being frugal and efficient so that we can have a cost structure that supports the customer experience we want to have. Which is to have the lowest prices, so that's something we take very seriously. And as I said, very, very energizing for me to see how much opportunity there is there.</p>

          <p>We'll have our next question from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple. Some people measure Google's paid clicks versus revenues as a measure of the recession impact. If I look at your revenues versus your units, 30% units, 25% revenues. Is that 5% related to maybe ASPs, or is there a mix issue or shift going on?</p>
          <p>And then two quick ones. Your shipping revenue was down 1% year-over-year. Does that have any indication on Prime adoption? And then the Other revenue in the US, the growth slowed there. Were there some interesting things going on last year that maybe have stopped and can we read anything into your Web Services adoption based on that number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a mix standpoint, the one thing that we are seeing certainly is higher priced items are still growing, but certainly not growing as much as they were a few quarters ago. So that's certainly one of the impacts that you're seeing. Keep in mind when you look at our business, given the selection that we have in the categories that we're in, you do see certainly some variation by quarter in terms of mix just because of the sheer amount of the ES selection that we have.</p>
          <p>In terms of the shipping, the shipping revenue, there's no question that we're seeing a good adoption in Prime. And certainly in free shipping, and that's certainly impacting that revenue line item. And that's a trend that you've been seeing, if you look back to prior quarters, that's something that you've been seeing for a while.</p>
          <p>In terms of your last portion of the revenues, there's a number of things that go in that line item. And as we have talked about in previous calls, that can tend to be a little lumpy from quarter to quarter. But again there's a large number of things that go in there. And so as we have described in other quarters.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I just wanted to touch on vendor pricing again if I could, and ask it a different way. I was wondering if you were seeing any significant differences by category, possibly in areas where there is more significant retail disruption? And then also if you could just comment on the sustainability of these vendor pricing approvements in all economic environments. I think Tom you mentioned getting product to different fulfillment centers. Does that seem sustainable, and I'm interested if as well if there is vendor pricing that is just driven by the general disruption in the channel and whether the relevance of the business model can sustain that as the economy improves. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize, there's not a lot of help I can give on the vendor pricing side. We continue to work with our partners in all of the categories that we're in, you know, geographically, certainly the way you should think about it is we think that there's room over time to get &#x2013; work with our partners to get better prices over the long term. Certainly the categories that we have been in the longest, there's still opportunities. But I would &#x2013; when you think about magnitude in terms of basis points, I would think that there would be more opportunity in the categories that we have been in the shortest amount of time. That's the way I would think about it.</p>
          <p>In terms of what it could look like going forward, we certainly had healthy amount of savings in Q1 as reflected in the gross margins that you see, and what we believe is certainly reflected in our Q2 guidance. But we'll continue to work over certainly a long period of time to continue to try to get better, work better with suppliers to get better savings.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Could I ask two questions? First, did you have a specific push on Fulfillment by Amazon or was that demand driven? And then can you give us just an indication about margins on that business and where you're booking it exactly? Is it all going into other or is it spread across the product categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, in terms of FBA, this is something that we have been doing for not long, but it's again over the last several quarters. And it's continuing to build. I wouldn't call it any specific push. It's certainly something that we're offering to sellers. We think it's a very good experience for sellers so that they can take advantage of our multi-nook fulfillment network in the US and our fulfillment networks outside of the US. So we think that that's a great opportunity.</p>
          <p>It comes in a number of different forms in terms of the revenue. Certainly the third party revenue that you're seeing would come in the individual categories, which is certainly the largest piece. And obviously we're recording the operating expense associated with those fulfillment services in our fulfillment line item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'll add to that just to say that one of the things that is driving the uptake of Fulfillment by Amazon is that sellers have the opportunity to drive up their sells &#x2013; drive up their sales when they switch to Fulfillment by Amazon in large part because of the interaction between Fulfillment by Amazon and Amazon Prime. So as soon as a seller switches to using Fulfillment by Amazon, all of their products become eligible for Amazon Prime just as if they were Amazon owned items. So that is &#x2013; the interaction between those two programs is driving sales for sellers, and that is something of course that sellers want. And I think that's in large part what is driving the uptake of Fulfillment by Amazon.</p>

          <p>Wondering about the media line that has been decelerating. Is there anything &#x2013; I know FX was the impact to your international part. Is there anything going on there beyond just kind of the maturation of the category? Then on a related matter, as media as a category transitions to digital, could you just, Jeff, maybe talk a little bit about Amazon VOD and how that's &#x2013; how you plan over differentiating that going forward? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take a look at our &#x2013; you mentioned international media, I think was the first part. You know, <mark type="inaudible" /> media growth in general, we saw North America we saw an 8% growth which is consistent with what we saw in Q4. Q4 was just slightly less than that, plus 7. And then in international on a local currency basis, it was up 17% which was down a little bit from Q3. It was 22%. And again you saw our total revenue, if you go back to Q4 for international, it was 31% on a local currency basis. And so it was really consistent with what we saw in the first &#x2013; really the first three quarters of the year. We saw that dip a little bit, and we believe that's economic related in Q1 to 28%, but still very solid growth, 28% in total for our international businesses on a local currency basis. So we did see a little bit of a decline in international media but we saw a corresponding increase in EGM, also growing 50% on a local currency basis.</p>

          <p>The Amazon Video on Demand team is doing a terrific job. The strategy is very simple, which is to keep improving the customer experience of Video on Demand relentlessly as we go forward. And at the same time, to make it very, very easy for partners to integrate the Video on Demand service into their set top box or video display device. So today you can use Video on Demand, Amazon Video on Demand very seamlessly on TiVo and also on the Roku box. So continuing to do those kinds of integrations is an important part of the strategy of making those integrations easy for our partners.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Jeff, one question on obviously, Kindle both generation one, generation two of Kindle did very well. Any plan to unleash the computing power of Kindle and let it compete with form factors like netbook which are obviously getting better traction now?</p>

But I can tell you that we're really focused on devices with electronic ink displays that are purpose-built for reading. Kindle 2 has, really is a terrific long form reading device, and we think reading is an important enough activity that it deserves a purpose-built device, and that's really a sweet spot for us.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I had a couple of quick questions. First, can you update us on your Cloud Computing business and any initiatives with larger corporate accounts you have been successful with? Also in the past, you have disclosed the number of web developers in your solution as nearly 400,000. Can you provide any update to that figure?</p>
          <p>And then finally, you reduced capacity earlier this quarter which appeared minor and head count fell by about a hundred sequentially. Can you comment whether these are cost control efforts and describe any other specific cost reduction initiatives in place that are helping margins? Thanks a lot.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first one. Examples of enterprise customers using our infrastructure web services today, there are many, but I'll name a few. Eli Lilly, doing basic research, clinical trial analysis using EC2. ESPN is another user of EC2. Autodesk is a user of EC2. There are many more. Some of them prefer not to be identified for competitive reasons. There are a number of hedge funds using EC2 for compute. So I'll just leave it at that, but there is good traction in the enterprise customer set as well of course there is with startups, small business and medium business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your other question related to head count, pretty flat. Q1 head count was pretty flat with year-end. We did do, continue to hire, but we also had attrition as well so it just remained pretty flat. In terms of other productivity, we have a large number of things that we're working on from a productivity standpoint. I talked about some of them earlier. We continue to work with suppliers to find ways where we can make them more successful as well as us more successful. One of the ways that we like, Jeff talked about some of the efforts we have, earlier in Mark's question. And one of the ways that we spend a lot of time on is, to get productivity is by becoming more efficient for customers. And we find that the many, many programs that we have that become more efficient for customers translates into a better experience for customers, but it also results in productivity. So we have many, many different programs across the company. This is not something new. This is something that we have been working on for quite a few years and as Jeff described earlier, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to work on those going forward as well.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two quick ones. First starting with Tom, if I look at the segment breakouts and I look at your Electronics and Other, in the US, there was a noticeable reacceleration in that business. Growth was 42%. Can you just help us understand why your acceleration, were there any sub categories that performed exceptionally well or better than your expectations?</p>
          <p>And then, Jeff, back to the Amazon VOD, question, what would be the hurdles to maybe allow an Amazon to move into a subscription model in addition to the &#xE0; la carte offering that you already have? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, in terms of Electronics and Other general merchandise, we did see strong growth in North America. We also saw strong growth in international. And it was, we continue to add selection in those categories, we continue to improve our in-stock levels so that when customers came to our detail pages to order, it was available right away for shipment. So a lot of &#x2013; and pricing was very, very competitive. So we think the combination of certainly prices, adding additional selection, in-stocks, and certainly fast delivery with Prime helping those numbers as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In answer to the Video on Demand subscription model, there is nothing structural that would prohibit that. The amount of selection that you have available in a subscription model today is much less than the, what you can get with the &#xE0; la carte model. So that's the beginnings of an answer to your question, I think.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to get your perspective on some of the regional and national initiatives to impose sales taxation on the Internet.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions. First, you know, I think some of the retail companies and some of online retailers also talked about business conditions stabilization or improving. Now, your business was not impacted that much by the economy, but can you give us some sense, have you seen some sign of improvement or growth rate acceleration as we progress towards the end of the quarter?</p>
          <p>And second question is for Jeff. You know, Jeff, third party business is growing at a faster pace and becoming a bigger part of the business. The challenge is, I think you are very extremely focused on improving user experience. As third party becomes bigger part of the business, how close are you monitoring the user, consumer satisfaction, and how do you guarantee that the consumer gets the same satisfaction when they buy from Amazon when Amazon is the principal? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of growth rate, you know it's obviously difficult to say what the economic impact is. But we certainly, starting in Q4 by looking at our overall growth rates, we saw solid growth rates but certainly not as strong as we saw for the several quarters previous to that. And you saw the same thing again in Q1, so our Q1 revenue growth was 25% on a local currency basis, but last year in the first three quarters it was well into the 30s, and so we did see some slowdown both in Q4 and Q1. But we continue &#x2013; we're not doing anything different than we have done in the past. We're continuing to focus on what we think the right thing is for customers, and that's what we're doing. So it's hard to say what the economic impact is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the third party sales business question, how do we guarantee the customer experience in that third party model, there are a couple of ways. One, we maintain scorecards on the sellers, and the sellers are very interested in self-improvement. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of sellers do a very good job fulfilling for customers, and the small fraction that do not, we can provide them feedback and we can ultimately ask them not to sell on Amazon. Second thing we do is we have the A to Z guarantee, so ultimately we can take care of customers if the seller cannot. And then third, we have Fulfillment by Amazon, so Fulfillment by Amazon really levels the experience and makes it so that those third party sold items have exactly the same fulfillment and customer service experience as Amazon owned inventory.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. You mentioned that third party this quarter was 32%. That's a number that has been surprisingly stable for a while, and particularly surprisingly given the growth that you're obviously seeing to some degree in third party in Europe. Can you give us a sense of where you feel like the right balance for that is? And I guess to the extent that you're willing to talk about the difference in where you are with third party as a percentage of units in the US or as a percentage of orders in the US versus Europe and at what level you see that balancing out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, ultimately the customer is going to decide what that mix ends up being. And what we're trying to do is try and make sure that we have a great customer experience. You know, certainly for our consumers, we continue to work as well on our sellers, which is another customer set that we have. And so the way you should think about it is we are trying to make those two experiences as well as our third customer set which is developers. But in terms of mix, the customer is going to ultimately decide and what we're trying to do is just make that experience as good as we can make it. And so that the customers will ultimately decide who they buy from.</p>
          <p>In terms of the &#x2013; we haven't disclosed what the numbers are for each of the two segments, but looking at Q1, both segments are growing nicely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. If you could talk a little bit about Prime and just the overall percentage of products on Prime right now. I know you talked about Fulfillment by Amazon and how do you basically fulfill and promote more products being offered by Prime? And second is can you talk a little bit about just about behavior, when people actually do sign up for Prime, just general differences in how peoples' buying behavior changes once they become Prime?</p>
          <p>In terms of selection, we have very vast selection in Prime. And so it's just a very good experience for customers. And we continue to add to that selection. We continued to add selections back in Q1. We'll continue to add selection in the coming quarters for our Prime customers. In terms of the experience, what we're seeing, we're seeing customers are doing a lot more cross shopping than they had previously. And so it's a very good experience for customers that's certainly impacting the growth rates that you're seeing not only this quarter but the last several quarters. So it's a very good experience for customers.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>I'll just add when Tom talks about Prime selection growing, it is millions of different items, and it is across all categories. So you can use your Prime membership to buy shoes, to buy food, to buy diapers, to buy obviously media products and electronics and so on, but it's across a wide array of categories and growing every day.</p>
