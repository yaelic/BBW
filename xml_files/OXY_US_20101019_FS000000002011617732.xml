          <p>Good morning. My name is Christy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Occidental Petroleum Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Mr. Stavros, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Occidental Petroleum's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Chazen, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Albrecht, President of Oxy's U.S. Oil and Gas Operations; and Sandy Lowe, President of our International Oil and Gas business.</p>
          <p>In a moment I'll turn the call over to Dr. Irani for some opening remarks and comments regarding the new management structure we've announced released recently. Steve Chazen will then review our third quarter and year-to-date 2010 financial and operating results.</p>
          <p>Our third quarter earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules and the conference call presentation slides, which refer to Steve's remarks, can be downloaded off of our Web site at www.oxy.com.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Dr. Irani. Dr. Irani, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very enthusiastic about the new management structure we announced last week, both for myself and for Oxy. The new structure will assure Oxy of continuity of a winning team, both in terms of our experience and effective management and in terms of our emphasis on a highly successful business strategy.</p>
          <p>To recap the new structure, I informed our Board of Directors of my desire to relinquish the position of Chief Executive Officer effective at the May 2011 annual meeting of stockholders, and to continue as full time Executive Chairman. I recommended to the board that Steve Chazen replace me as CEO. The Board agreed with this new structure.</p>
          <p>Steve is a proven leader, he has been an integral member of our senior management team for many years. Steve joined Oxy in 1994 as Executive VP Corporate Development, became Chief Financial Officer in 1999, President in 2007 and Chief Operating Officer earlier this year. He was also elected to the Board of Directors in 2010. He has made and will continue to make significant contributions to Occidental's ongoing success and development. This is a carefully developed and long anticipated senior management transition.</p>
          <p>Steve and I have had an extraordinarily productive partnership for many years. Clearly maintaining this partnership is in the best interest of Oxy and its stockholders and I look forward to continuing this partnership in future years.</p>
          <p>During the 20 years that I have been CEO, our management team has transformed Oxy from a conglomerate of unrelated business entities with a market capitalization of $5 billion into the fourth largest oil and gas company in the United States with a market capitalization today of $67 billion. Oxy has led its proxy peer group in total stockholder return with cumulative returns of 76% over the past three years, 204% over the past five years, and 870% over the past ten years. I'm very proud of these accomplishments. Our management team is strong and cohesive and will be ready, willing and able under this new structure to take Oxy to new heights in performance and excellence.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Steve Chazen for the details on our third quarter performance.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ray. Net income was $1.2 billion or $1.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to 927 million or $1.14 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009. Income from continuing operations, $1.47 per diluted share in the third quarter of this year, compared to $1.14 per diluted share in third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Here is a segment breakdown for the third quarter. Oil and gas third quarter 2010 segment earnings were 1.7 billion compared to $1.5 billion the third quarter of last year. The improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices with additional contributions from higher volumes. Realized crude oil prices increased 13% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 38% from the third quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&amp;A rates and higher operating expenses, partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010.</p>
          <p>Production for the third quarter of 2010 were 751,000 BOE a day, a 6.5% increase compared to 705 BOE a day the third quarter of 2009. Most of the year-over-year production increases came from the Middle East, North Africa with smaller increases in Argentina and the United States. The worldwide oil and gas sales volume for third quarter of 2010 were 749,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of over 6.5% compared with 702,000 BOE a day in the third quarter of last year. Sales volume differs from the production volumes due mainly to timing of the lifting in Argentina.</p>
          <p>Exploration expense was $83 million in the quarter. Oil and gas cash production costs, excluding production and property taxes, were $10.25 a barrel for the first nine months of 2010. Last year's 12-months costs were $9.37 a barrel. The nine-month increase reflects a $0.35 a barrel higher CO2 cost due to our decision to expense 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and higher field support operations, workovers and maintenance costs. The higher domestic workover activity is mostly in the Permian.</p>
          <p>Taxes other than on income were $1.76 per barrel for the nine months of 2010 compared to $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs, which are sensitive to product prices, reflect the effect of higher crude oil and natural gas prices in 2010.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for third quarter of 2010 were $189 million compared with $108 million in the second quarter of 2010. Third quarter results reflect improvement from the second quarter in 2010 in both volumes and margins across most product lines. Export markets have improved more rapidly than domestic markets due in part to favorable feed stock costs in North America versus Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>Midstream segment earnings for the third quarter of 2010 were $163 million compared to 77 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increase in earnings was mainly due to trading and marketing income and higher margins in the pipeline business.</p>
          <p>The worldwide effective tax rate was 41% for the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to our performance for the first nine months of this year. The net income was $3.3 billion or $4.07 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2010, compared with $2 billion or $2.43 per diluted share, the first nine months of 2009. Core income was $3.3 billion or $4.09 per diluted share for the first nine months of this year compared with $2 billion or $2.48 per diluted share for the year-to-date 2009 period. The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the nine months of 2009 (sic) [2010] were 812.4 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 813.8 million. Our debt-to-cap ratio was 7% at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Capital spending for the third quarter of 2010 was about $1.1 billion and $2.8 billion for the first nine months. Year-to-date capital expenditures by segment were 82% in oil and gas, 13% in midstream with the remainder in chemicals. Cash flow from operations first nine months of 2010 was $6.6 billion. We used 2.8 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, 1.6 billion on acquisitions and $340 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to 4.7 billion. We also used $850 million to pay dividends and $310 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by $900 million, to $2.1 billion at September 30. The first nine months free cash flow after capital spending and dividends and before acquisition activity and debt retirements was about $3.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our acquisition costs in the third quarter were 1.1 billion and we expect to spend about $300 million the first part of the fourth quarter. Through these acquisitions we expect to add about 10,000 BOE a day in average production in the fourth quarter. These acquisitions have a run rate of about 12,000 BOE a day. Of this production, about a third will be liquids and the balance will be natural gas. Over the medium term we expect these acquisitions to add at least 25,000 BOE a day of production. This increase will come largely from oil production.</p>
          <p>In addition to these acquisitions, we expect to add an additional 380,000 acres to our California acreage position and interest in 100,000 acres in other producing areas. Our California acreage will now reach 1.6 million acres, an overwhelming portion of which consists of mineral interests. We currently don't contemplate any more sizeable acquisitions of acreage in California.</p>
          <p>Our total year capital spending is expected to be about 4.4 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the fourth quarter of the year largely in our domestic operations and in Iraq. The beginning of the year we were running 11 development rigs in California and 5 rigs in the Permian. We're currently running 16 rigs in California and 9 in the Permian and expect our year-end exit rate rig count to reach 19 rigs in California and 14 in the Permian. Next year we anticipate working 21 rigs in California and 15 rigs in the Permian. In the current environment we are cautious about natural gas drilling and may reevaluate our 2011 U.S. natural gas drilling program.</p>
          <p>In the Permian we are currently running 94 workover rigs compared with the 57 rigs we had at the beginning of the year. We currently expect to be operating 110 rigs by the end of this year. A portion of the workover expenditures are expense, as opposed to being capitalized depending on their nature. Our operating costs have recently increased due to higher workover activity to $10.94 per barrel in the third quarter of 2010 and further increases are expected in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead in the current quarter, we expect oil and gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 760,000 to 770,000 BOE a day at third quarter average oil prices. Volume increases in the fourth quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field and the acquisitions. Increase in oil prices of $5.00 a barrel from the third quarter 2010 levels would result in about 4,000 BOE a day of lower production due to the impact of higher prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts.</p>
          <p>Based on the development plan at the Zubair field in Iraq, we believe that we should have a small amount of production in the fourth quarter. We do not expect to report any sales from Iraq until the first quarter of 2011. Field development plan is on target for us to meet next year's production targets.</p>
          <p>With regard to prices, at current market prices, $1 per barrel change in oil prices impacts quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $39 million. Average third quarter WTI oil price was $76.20 per barrel. For gas, a swing of $0.50 per million Btus in domestic gas prices has a $27 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. Approximately the current NYMEX gas prices is under $3.90 per Mcf.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $110 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.</p>
          <p>The chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the quarter of about $100 to $120 million. The fourth quarter is usually the weakest for the business. We expect that continued margin improvement will be offset by the typical seasonal slowdown in housing, construction, bleach and fertilizer markets.</p>
          <p>We expected our combined worldwide tax rate in the fourth quarter to be about 41%. Our third quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our supplemental schedules.</p>
          <p>The Century plant in the Permian has just started operations and will be providing additional CO2 to support growth in our Permian operations. We expect that the plant will yield 180 million cubic feet a day of CO2 a day next year to support our Permian EOR operations. We are in the process of contracting additional CO2 from other sources and we'll use penalty payments due from the operator for underproduction to support these activities. We expect to have sufficient CO2 to meet the needs of our previously disclosed expansion of flooding activities.</p>
          <p>Turning now to California. During the first nine months of the year we drilled 7 conventional exploration extension wells in California. Of these, 5 were outside the Kern County Discovery Area. 2 of these wells are currently being tested. We also drilled 12 unconventional exploration wells in the first nine months of this year, of which 3 are successful and 5 are being tested.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we expect to drill 10 exploration wells of which 2 will be conventional and the remaining 8 wells non-conventional. In the fourth quarter our exploration program will target smaller prospects until permits are obtained for the larger ones.</p>
          <p>We've also drilled 13 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County Discovery Area and 15 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first nine months. Due to delays in permitting, we've reduced our exploitation plan for the second half of the year by about 10 wells.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to have problems with our gas processing and gathering infrastructure at Elk Hills. As a result we expect our gas and related NGL production to be about flat in the fourth quarter. We have ordered and commenced construction of the first new processing plant and we'll order the second plant shortly. Once complete, the new processing plants will increase productive capacity, improve yields, enhance net backs and lower operating costs.</p>
          <p>We are also working actively to optimize and de-bottleneck our existing facility to improve performance. Additionally, we are shifting our drilling to oil wells, which we expect will result in higher oil production in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Copies of the press release announcing our third quarter earnings and Investor Relations supplemental schedules are available at our Web site or through the SEC's EDGAR system.</p>
          <p>We're now ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question. As you think about the acquisitions in the quarter and then the medium term run rate of adding 25,000 barrels of oil a day, can you talk about what the medium term is and how that incorporates into your multi-year production targets that you detailed at your Analyst Day?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Medium term is three years or less so it'll fall clearly within the plan. As we look at where we are right this minute, it's likely we'll slow up our gas drilling in the Rockies next year and so we view this as sort of an offset for that, if that's what turns out. If gas prices are higher, we'll spend more money, but I think that's the way I think about it is that we were shifting to an oilier base on the intermediate term as long as we have these not very attractive natural gas prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as you think about, you mentioned that you'll be buying CO2 and using, I guess, the penalty payments for that. Could you give us an idea of what the purchase price of CO2 is on a per MCF basis today just so I can start thinking about how you fulfill those volumes and what that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill could answer that better than I can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, normally we're contracting for CO2 at anywhere between $1.00 and $1.15 per MCF. And of course we also have the option to throttle up our drilling in the Oxy owned Bravo Dome field, which is up in Northeast New Mexico.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as I think about that, CO2 volume is still on track, so the acceleration in rig activity is more primary production in the Permian. Any particular regions that your increasing rig count would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, one of the regions is in the Wolfberry trend where we currently have a couple of rigs working and you can probably see some throttle up there in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any horizontal drilling there yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not drilling horizontal wells there yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Robert Kessler of Simmons &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask you to put a range around your 2011 CapEx at this point? It seems like you've got a number of offsetting factors. You mentioned your prudent caution with respect to natural gas prices, the ramp up in activity in California and the Permian, and that kind of offsetting the conservativism on gas. Your pie charts from the Analyst Meeting would seemingly imply a pretty good uptake next year, somewhere in the order of 5.5 to 6 billion in CapEx versus this year's 4.5 billion, but qualitatively it seems you might be on the lower end of that range. Is that the right way to think about it? Or can you put something around next year's capital program at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still developing it, to be fair, but the estimate we made in May wasn't that long ago. So if you subtract the 4.4 from the five-year total and divide by four, it would give you at least a feel for it. We don't have any way to microanalyze whether it's going to be 200 million less or 200 million more. We're obviously not all that accurate anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you think about your exploitation CapEx for 2011 in California as you continue to have problems with the gas processing plant? What's the risk that you have incrementally more CapEx that sits sort of stranded temporarily while you wait on the additional processing capacity? And why not taper back a bit since you're not really at risk of losing this acreage next year if you don't drill it up more aggressively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're shifting to more oil production and so we think we'll be okay. But we're certainly not going to drill wells to shut them in. So we'll just see where we are as the year progresses. But we are being cautious about not just the capacity but the not very exciting natural gas prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then a quick point of clarification for me. I think Bill responded to David's question about CO2 incremental acquisition costs of $1, $1.15 per M. I'm assuming that's a gross cost. And can you remind us what the net would be after subtracting the fee for non-delivery of gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on how much they non-deliver. But to the extent it's making up for shortfalls, it's $0.25.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Steve. Hi Ray.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning or afternoon or whatever it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could have a specific one on acquisitions and then a more general one. Could you talk a little bit more about the location of the acquisitions you made in the quarter because I guess the gas/oil split would indicate that they're slightly off your usual beaten track?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The bulk of the acquisitions are in the Permian. And they may show up partially in the mid-continent gas unit because they're in the New Mexico type part of the Permian, which is gassier. So when we actually break them out, since a part of the Permian is carried in the mid-continent gas unit, so when we actually show the numbers, you'll see Permian may be a little oilier than natural gas and mid-continent gas up a little bit. So the split may be off, but the overwhelming majority is in the Permian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got you. And by extension, there's no step-out acquisitions that you might be doing, I don't know, in the Marcellus or wherever?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we did a small acquisition in, I think I've told the story about we had a small interest in Bakken, 25% interest. The sellers wanted to monetize it so we looked at the numbers and bought them out. And that'll show up also in the mid-continent unit. But that's pretty small in the total.</p>

          <p>Great. And then if I could extend that into the wider question. If I'm not wrong the volume targets that you set at the Analyst Meeting were ex-disposals, ex-acquisitions. I know there's been a lot of moving parts here obviously with California and other stuff, but do we need to reset the target outlook allowing for the fact I guess we didn't meet the full year target here without acquisitions? Or can you reiterate the numbers that we had at the Analyst Meeting for future growth ex-acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the big change is that the gas price hasn't met, so far, in what we would hope for where we'd be at this point. So I would view the acquisitions as a replacement for the gas production that we're probably not going to get next year from the Rockies. So I think we'll &#x2013; I think next year's guidance is probably pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So without acquisitions, we can still assume that you'll meet that 6.2% base that you talked about within the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we're looking for, and right now we don't have a reason to change that. But I'd caution you about the gas. The gas in the Rockies is the only place where I'm feeling a little seasick right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. How much of a step down could we, could you envision seeing there? How much is at risk, if you like?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. But we have two rigs running currently. And we had planned to go to double that next year and I don't think we'll do that. So it's whatever growth we've shown there I think is probably at least some risk, and so I think from my perspective, acquisitions are just like drilling money. You move the money around. And I think the acquisitions will cover that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, also I would extend my congratulations to Dr. Irani and to Steve. I had a couple of questions on California. First of all, the acreage that's being added, a pretty big swath of acreage. I was wondering if you could comment on how such a large amount of acreage is still being pulled together? Is this private companies, public companies that are selling? Or is it actually organic leasing with land holders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not leasing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then also, just on some of the comments you made about volumes. Increase in overall California volumes but flat natural gas and NGL volumes. I was trying to reconcile how you could be increasing the oil volumes without associated gas. Does this mean you're able to actually re-inject at Elk Hills or something along those lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean, some of the wells are oil wells, legitimate oil wells, and so the amount of gas that's produced is relatively small in the total. So I said flat-ish, so that's what I would look forgiven the outlook right now is that we actually are drilling real oil wells, not condensate wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. I was probably trying to read too much into the semantics there.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm rarely accused of being too clever. And final question, if it I could. You've mentioned the seven conventional exploration wells that you drilled in California. Would you be &#x2013; and two obviously testing, would you be able to comment on how many of the wells that you've drilled so far would be &#x2013; you would be able to classify as either successful or unsuccessful?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, fellows. Good morning, I think, and congratulations to both of you guys. I look forward to working more with you in the future. A couple of questions, Steve, please. On the increase in the rigs, can you help us understand a little bit, what exactly are you going after here on these incremental rigs, particularly in California? Is this the shale play getting some attention now? And if so, can you give us a little bit more color, please, on reverting back to what you said in your conference about what the IP rates were indicatively? What the down spacing was, all that good stuff? Basically what are we looking at in terms of shale drilling activity as we look forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is clearly a step up in shale drilling activities in the numbers, a fairly sizeable increase. The rest of it is sort of stuff we had planned, but shale drilling has picked up, and the wells are still running 300, 400 a day on average, some a lot higher. So I would go 300 to 400 barrels a day sort of per well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's looking 30-day IP type of indicator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's our 30-day or maybe a little bit longer. It's not an IP number. IP number is a little misleading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, forgive me for probing a little bit on this, because clearly if you're drilling these things, I'm guessing 20, 25 days, because they're verticals, if I'm not mistaken. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, about a month. Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So basically your drilling campaign on this, should I assume maybe 10 of these rigs are drilling on the shales, looking at the step-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little less than that probably.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So net, net, we're looking at a fairly substantial acceleration in that program. So basically, what did you have baked into your guidance when you gave your strategy presentation in May by way of rig programs compared to what you're now telling us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It may be a little more in what we're now telling you than what we told you in May. Maybe a couple more rigs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the shift is over to oil rather than gas as you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess the final thing would be, just as it relates to the Elk Hills gas plant, can you be a little more specific on, the new plants are a 2012 start-up, but as I understand it, the gas gathering system has been the problem. Can you be a little more specific as to what the issues have been, what you're doing about it and what the current status is in the early part of Q4? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't really &#x2013; our ability to predict this has not been all that exciting. So our goal is to get everything working. As we try to run the plant, there's some problems on the gathering system at the traditional Elk Hills, and we're working on seeing if we can make that better. So I'm taking a cautious view right now to improvements.</p>

And on this point, Steve, I wanted to see if you could provide a little clarity on what the new total shareholder return incentives are, which I think you guys call TSRIs, and whether they're different from the previous plan?

          <p>Okay. Great. And then just in terms of your CapEx for the fourth quarter, it looks like you'll be spending about 1.6 billion. How much of that is related to activity in your newly acquired acreage? Or your newly acquired &#x2013; your asset acquisitions?</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Phillip Dodge of Tuohy Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. If I've done the arithmetic correctly, you're recent acquisitions, it sounds like about 50 million feet a day is natural gas. And my question is, were you intentionally buying natural gas? Or did you have to accept some natural gas to get the oil that you wanted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We view all these thing as sort of money, not whether it's natural gas or oil. And if you could buy natural &#x2013; in our view, if you could buy natural gas at essentially a discount, the present worth based on the current prices, we wouldn't view that as an unattractive thing to do. If you got to pay $6 an M baked into it, we'd view that as sort of unattractive. So buying gas at the current market discounted, where it's basically $4 discounted for present worth, we don't view as an unattractive thing to do. We produce a fair amount of gas. While we're oily, and not a pure oil company, and especially in the Permian, and a lot of opportunities we think in the Permian for gas. We're a big processor of gas in the basin. So, we'd prefer to buy oil real cheap, but if we can buy gas cheap we'll do that too, in our operating areas.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Understood. Other question unrelated. I want to understand the permitting in California. I believe you said that there's more of a delay in permitting on the large prospects than on the small prospect. Is that just chance? Or is there?</p>

        <plist>

          <p>Last one for me. You're carrying about 50% to 100% less PUDs than your peers. Do you think you get penalized perhaps for being too conservative with regards to reserve booking?</p>

          <p>Your next question is from David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow up on your unconventional drilling in some of the Monterey Shale in California. I've heard comments and understanding that there's a decent amount of water production. How do you handle water disposal and the permitting process for that, as you think about ramping activity? And are there any bottlenecks in that system that we ought to think about heading into next year and the year after?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, you're right, we dispose of our water from this production via disposal wells, and we have a good many of those on the books to be drilled here in 2011. Traditionally, permitting has not been a problem, although I think it is fair to say that it has slowed down some.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as you think about a 300 or 400 barrel a day well, what type of water rates are you actually seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Generally 1,000 to 1,500 barrels a day once the load is recovered and production has stabilized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's in line. Thanks. That's what I needed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on the new management structuring. Just had a quick question, can you give us a sense for how the cost of the barrels in the acreage you acquired relates to what your traditional finding costs would be in those similar areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the future finding costs can be a lot less than our historic numbers, because we sort of paid for the production upfront. So I think it will be very comparable when we're done, maybe a little less than what we've been doing.</p>
