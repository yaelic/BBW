          <p>Thank you, Frank. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2010 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and web cast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our web site at www.travelers.com under the Investor sessions. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>Other members of senior management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the web cast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions.</p>
          <p>Before I turn it over to Jay I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note on page one of the web cast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risk and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our web site, travelers.com.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gabby.  Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Given the very substantial second quarter weather losses for the entire property casualty industry and of course for us, we were pleased with our performance this quarter reporting net income of $1.35 per diluted share, an increase of 6% from last year's quarter and a return on equity of 10.1%. Recognizing that our operating income of $1.39 per diluted share is about $0.11 below consensus estimates I would like to make the following observations. First the $0.11 differential equates to approximately $50 million after tax. I point out that for the first six months of the year, we have earned in excess of $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the shortfall was attributable to second quarter weather losses which aggregated $285 million after tax or $0.58 per diluted share. To put that cost in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the second quarter included in our previously provided guidance was $92 million after tax, or $0.19 per diluted share. As best as we can tell, consensus estimates included $0.22 per diluted share for second quarter catastrophe losses.</p>
          <p>To put the first half weather losses in context we have already recorded $597 million of after-tax catastrophe losses, or $1.19 per diluted share. The methods used to estimate our expected annual catastrophe losses indicate an expected annual loss of $390 million after tax or $0.80 per diluted share for the entire 2010 year.</p>
          <p>So even after just six months we're now well in excess of our expected annual loss estimate for the full year. Recognizing that we don't control the timing of weather, we just take these events in stride. There have been periods where catastrophe losses have been exceptionally low, such as in 2006 and '07 and there were times where they run abnormally high. We price our product for the long-term and weather will occur when it does.</p>
          <p>We don't believe this high level of catastrophe loss is in any way a result of changed underwriting standards or reinsurance practices and Brian's going to have more to say about our cat losses later.</p>
          <p>Third, the quarter also benefited from $251 million or $0.51 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. Again as best as we can tell, consensus estimates for the quarter included $0.23 per diluted share of favorable reserve development and just a reminder, because development is so unpredictable, we don't include it in any of our guidance.</p>
          <p>In terms of the operating environment for the second quarter, we remain quite pleased with our performance in our personal insurance segment both auto and homeowners. Given the amount of discussion this time last year on our AGC auto business we're particularly pleased with the improving rate of change of policies in force in personal insurance. Profitability in the first half improved versus last year and we're pleased that the actions taken to improve profitability, which we spoke to you about this time last year, are coming through in the results. In our commercial businesses the operating environment really remained very similar to last quarter. Retention rates remained quite strong and rate on renewal business remained positive but it was at a lower level than in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The negative impact of the economy on net written premiums has moderated somewhat from recent quarters, and we're hopeful that this bodes well for future economic growth.</p>
          <p>We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter, and since the second quarter of 2006 we have now repurchased over $12 billion of our common stock. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully if the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Given that municipal bonds have been receiving a lot of attention lately, we thought we would take a few minutes this morning to have Bill Heyman take you through the strategy and the tactical positioning behind our muni portfolio and demonstrate why we're comfortable with what we own. Our investment team has applied to our municipal portfolio the same very thoughtful approach to risk and reward that served us exceptionally well during the capital market crises over the last several years. I'm sure you will find it helpful. And with that let me turn it over to Jay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jay. There are a few points based on the data contained on pages four through seven of the web cast that I would like to highlight this  quarter. First is our strong balance sheet. All capital leverage and liquidity measures remain at or better than target levels. Second is the repurchase of 1.4 billion of our common shares this quarter and the payment of $173 million in common stock dividends. This brings the total cash we returned to our shareholders to over $3.1 billion in the first half of this year. Holding company liquidity of 2.4 billion at the end of the quarter, down as planned from the 3 billion we held at the beginning of the quarter, due to our share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our holding company.</p>
          <p>Another quarter in which we increased book value per share, operating performance, ex-cats and favorable prior year reserve development but including net investment income that was in line with our expectations. Another quarter of net favorable reserve development in each of our segments, mostly driven by Business Insurance where we are now seeing better than expected loss results for property, workers' comp and commercial auto product lines in recent accident years and where we have re-estimated unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves given recent loss results.</p>
          <p>And finally, a double-digit ROE and operating ROE despite the record second quarter cat losses. I would also like to point out we successfully renewed our cat treaties this quarter, keeping essentially the same structure but at a modestly lower cost. The new treaties are outlined on several pages in the web cast and are described more fully in our second quarter 10-Q which has been filed earlier today. So let's have Brian now discuss our operating performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jay.</p>
          <p>Before I go into the business specific results a few comments on this quarter's catastrophe losses. As Jay mentioned, this was the highest level of second quarter catastrophe losses in our history. So obviously a difficult weather quarter and it's on the heels of high first quarter catastrophe losses.</p>
          <p>In this quarter the activity was not of the national headline variety, but it was a very active quarter with numerous significant events. Page 8 lists out the 14 industry designated cats for the second quarter of 2010, with initial property claim services or PCS estimates.</p>
          <p>Although 14 second quarter events is not unusually high for the industry, the severity of a number of these events is clearly out of pattern. The initial industry estimates of 3.6 billion is very preliminary and based on reported activity to date.</p>
          <p>This will obviously develop up and we are confident that once fully developed this will be one of the largest industry catastrophe second quarters.</p>
          <p>As we look at our level of losses, we're confident that they are not a result of changes in our mix of business, selection process, geographic footprint or coverage grant. And we don't see anything that would indicate a fundamental change in weather patterns. Slide 9 displays our first and second quarter catastrophe loss ratios for the last six years or since our first full year post merger.</p>
          <p>It shows that for 2010, both quarters were significantly above average level; but in the previous five years, with the exception of the second quarter of 2008, catastrophe weather losses were relatively mild. Accordingly, we don't see 2010 as a trend but just another data point which we will factor into our assessment of risk and reward. So we're going to stay in the weather business and we'll continue to actively manage our exposure.</p>
          <p>Now let me shift to discussing the segment results and I'll start with Business Insurance. When excluding catastrophe unpredictability, underwriting income was very strong driven by continued favorable prior year reserve developments. In the current year, loss trend continued to be fairly benign and consistent with our expectations. The renewal rate change on premium for the first half of the year has been slightly positive, but is below loss trends and less than expected. So the impact on margins is slightly more than we anticipated. Overall, net written premiums were down slightly in the quarter, but not down as much as earlier in the year. The negative impacts of the economy on our insureds, which we see in lower exposures and reduced audit premiums, continued but have moderated from earlier levels. So now I'll turn to pricing and if unpredictability has been the message with the weather, stability is the message in our aggregate domestic commercial insurance pricing.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 graphs our renewal premium change and splits out the pure rate and exposure change components. The short story here is that nothing is really changing. Overall renewal premium change on guaranteed cost business was essentially flat, with a modest improvement in exposure change offsetting the modest decline in rate change.</p>
          <p>These overall trends are fairly consistent on an individual business basis, but as always there are differences and I would like to highlight a few things.</p>
          <p>Starting with slide 12 and select accounts, we've been getting some good premium increases and retentions have been consistent, but a few points below where we historically have been. New business has been mixed, with strong results in smaller accounts but in the fourth quarter 2009, and the first quarter 2010, lower new business levels in Express Plus.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we moderated our pricing strategy, and believe this helped boost our Express Plus new business in the quarter. On the renewal book we typically work 90 days in advance, so any impact on retention will start in the third quarter. Overall, we continue to feel very good about our select Express platform and how we are positioned in this market.</p>
          <p>In commercial accounts, retentions have remained very strong and the renewal premium change has improved modestly, going from a slight negative to a slight positive. If you look at the commercial accounts chart at the bottom of page 13, you can see that this essentially flat premium change is the result of improving exposure changes and slightly lower rate changes.</p>
          <p>When negotiating a renewal, we are negotiating both the pure rate and total premium with the account. As the impact of the economy on our customers' exposures has become less negative, it has become increasingly more difficult to negotiate a rate increase, especially when it would result in an overall premium increase.</p>
          <p>New business results for commercial accounts were down compared to the prior year quarter; in the second quarter of last year, our new business writings benefited from the marketplace disruption caused by the financial distress of several of our competitors.</p>
          <p>Absent this impact, the results reflect the normal seasonality of our business. Our new business flow has stabilized at record levels with quote rates up slightly and close rates down slightly. Given these dynamics we continue to be very pleased with our new business performance.</p>
          <p>In other Business Insurance, retentions have remained very strong while the price change for both the rate and exposure have moved more significantly than the overall commercial business. These pricing impacts are primarily driven by our large property business with some significant softening in rates but improvement in exposure. As competitive pressures in this class of business increased in the current quarter, driven by ample reinsurance capacity and a benign 2009 hurricane season, we made a conscious decision to maximize our retention on this business and not push rate on large property accounts.</p>
          <p>Similarly, large property new business became increasingly more competitive with aggressive concessions to expiring terms and conditions frequently required to motivate accounts to leave their current carrier and we are not willing to make these concessions.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continue to prudently manage each of our businesses and adjust our actions to the unique needs.</p>
          <p>But in the aggregate the results are not different than our recent experience, that is, solid retention, relatively stable pricing and a strong flow of new business opportunities.</p>
          <p>In the Financial, Professional and International Insurance segment, core underwriting margins were generally stable in the quarter as the marginal rate gains essentially offset slightly increasing loss trends. Additionally the underwriting margins benefited from a reduction in surety reinsurance costs associated with prior year reinsurance treaties. Net written premiums after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates were down for the quarter. In some of our management liability lines of business and in some of our international lines, we believe pricing is not consistent with our profitability targets so our writings in those lines are down.</p>
          <p>Turning to the production statistics on page 16, although renewal premium change is slightly negative, in both management liability and international, for most of the businesses contained here we've achieved positive rate gains.</p>
          <p>Turning to personal insurance, in agency auto our underwriting margins, after adjusting for the impact of cats and prior year development, improved quarter over quarter as rate gains once again outpaced lost cost trends. Within agency property we have been speaking to you for some time regarding the slight margin compression driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. As the rate gains we achieved in recent quarters continue to earn through our property business we have crossed an inflection point where, in the second quarter, our rate improvement outpaced loss cost trends. Agency auto new business improved in the second quarter as we reintroduced our 12 month policy. As we have become more confident in our new business products and are consistently within target returns we felt it was appropriate to reintroduce a longer-term policy. The aggregate timing impact of this additional six months of written premium was about $30 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As the roll-out of this product is completed, the impact on our new business written premiums will increase throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>More significantly, we are pleased with the improving rate of change in policies in force. We believe the PIF change is a result of our improved competitive position compared to third and fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Agency property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. Quarter over quarter PIF growth was at the highest level since third quarter 2007, retention improved two points and new business is up 15% compared to the same quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Given the expansion in core underwriting margins and the strong top line trends in these products we are very pleased with both our current and going forward marketplace position in personal insurance.</p>
          <p>So let me sum it up. Weather's been bad but it is a big part of our business and the one thing we know for sure is that it will change. The commercial marketplace, both domestic and international, is fairly stable. We obviously wish it was improving but we feel great about our position and are confident we will maximize the opportunity. And in personal insurance we are encouraged by the trends, both for us and the industry.</p>
          <p>With that, let me now turn it over to Bill Heyman to discuss our tax-exempt portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brian.  Since municipal securities have received considerable attention in the press I thought I would spend a few minutes discussing this sector in general and our portfolio in particular.</p>
          <p>As you know, we have a tax exempt portfolio of about $41 billion. You may not know that of that, about 7 billion consists of bonds which have been pre-refunded, which means they have been defeased to maturity, or their first call date, usually with U.S. Treasury securities. Still the 34 billion remaining constitutes about half of our fixed income portfolio.</p>
          <p>The first observation I would make is that we have fortunately always starting long before credit quality became an issue new tax exempt credits as credits first without regard to any advantages or tax exempt status confers. While optimization of the alternative minimum tax provides a target allocation, it is not a bucket we feel we must fill regardless of quality, and a general obligation of a school district competes with a corporate bond or a mortgage-backed security for our investment dollars.</p>
          <p>We scrutinize closely not only the credit-worthiness of the issuer but the nature of the obligation. For example in some cases revenue bonds could be stronger than GOs and vice versa. Furthermore, where issuers have enhances their creditworthiness with bond insurance, we have always ignored it. The result was that several years ago, when the bond insurers more or less simultaneously lost their triple-A ratings, we did not make portfolio changes.</p>
          <p>The result of high credit underwriting standards means that our portfolio does not closely resemble the broad market. For example, we own about 23 million of municipal health care revenue bonds or about 1/10 of 1% of our portfolio. Such bonds represent roughly 7% of the broad market and since 1970, 39% of all municipal defaults have been in the healthcare sector.</p>
          <p>Conversely we're overweighted in pre-refunded bonds, state and local general obligation bonds and water and sewer bonds.</p>
          <p>Recent focus on general obligation bonds relates to potential for these bonds to be treated like senior unsecured debt with bondholders becoming general creditors alongside employees, retirees and vendors. The general creditor construct is most descriptive of general obligation bonds issued by states as their general funds act like pools collecting revenues from a wide range of taxes, fees, and paying salaries making pension contributions, paying vendors as well as servicing their general obligation debt.</p>
          <p>In contrast, this construct is probably not descriptive of many local general obligation bonds. We expect that in extremis, holders of many local GOs would be treated as secured creditors based upon legal precedence and the provisions of chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code, which provides that the security interest in special revenues remains valid and enforceable in bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>As you know, most school district general obligation bonds are specifically authorized by voters in a ballot initiative. This authorization allows the pledge of ad valorem taxes to be levied on all taxable property within the school district without limitation as to rate or amount. The collection of these taxes is generally segregated in the debt service fund outside of the general fund and these funds can only be used to service the authorized debt and are not available to finance the general purposes of the school.</p>
          <p>The unlimited nature and segregation of this debt service tax revenue contrasts sharply with the school district's other property tax revenues which are statutorily limited and commingled with its state per pupil funding and used for operations.</p>
          <p>In addition to assembling the portfolio selectively we manage it actively. The portfolio contains approximately 8,000 discrete securities but of only 925 issuers. There are over 50,000 issuers in the municipal market. We have general obligation bonds of a mere 75 cities -- there are 5300 in the Bloomberg database. So we feel that we know our cities well. We monitor closely financial condition an operations of our credits. While it is true that we are basically buy and hold investors we have in the past year reduced, often substantially, positions in issuers whose credit worthiness has in our view deteriorated. So I would add we believe that even those issues we sold are overwhelmingly likely to pay every dollar on time.</p>
          <p>As we demonstrated two years ago with our mortgage portfolio we do not blindly rely on ratings but it is nonetheless worth noting that roughly 50% of our municipal portfolio holdings, which are not pre-refunded, carry an average triple-A rating from Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch compared to only 17% of the broad market. Almost 96% are rated Aa3 or higher. Only 4%, 4.3% are rated A or lower, compared to 33% in the index. Rating agencies are looking at the same challenging economic budget and spending dynamics affecting state and local governments that all of us are yet the ratings of our holdings remain very strong. A recent publication by Moody's points out that over the entire period 1970 to 2009 the riskiest 20% of municipal issuers as measured by ratings, accounted for 86% of all defaulters.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio contains approximately 7.2 billion in state general obligations with only about 330 million in the headline states of California, Illinois and New York. The table in the web cast contains the aggregate holdings and the average ratings of our top 16 states.</p>
          <p>With the exception of our holdings from California, which average Aa2, the average rating for each state is Aa1 or higher. The generally obligation bonds at the top five states total 1.4 billion. All that said we have purchased very few big state GOs in recent years and have sold a few recently.</p>
          <p>The other slide of the web cast presents the run-off of our state GOs. Based on current market yields for those borrowers and the coupon structure of our holdings, nearly 70% of our state GOs will mature or be called by 2015. The local general obligation bonds from the stop five states total 6.4 billion and the revenue bonds from these states total 3.6 billion. Our general obligation bonds issuers other than states consist largely of school district exposures with a moderate number of counties, cities, community college districts and other special districts.</p>
          <p>As we just discussed the nature of these obligations is such that most could be considered as obligations secured by a pledge of revenues from ad valorem property taxes levied without limitation as to rate or amount. As we have discussed previously our fixed income portfolio exists first and foremost to ensure our commitment to our policy holders. We underwrite the investment risks assumed in our portfolios with careful consideration of the trade-off between risk and return.</p>
          <p>Just as in the other fixed income assets we do not reach for yield in our municipal portfolio and attempt to outperform a benchmark, boost investment managers' compensation, or for any other reasons. We expect our fixed income assets, including our municipal portfolio, to provide adequate risk adjusted returns and support our insurance operations in pursuit of maximizing wealth for shareholders over the long-term.</p>
          <p>Obviously history may not be indicative of the future. And ratings cannot be relied upon with certainty. But we believe our portfolio is strong, and we wouldn't trade it for anyone else's. We could certainly have losses in our municipality portfolio, maybe even material losses, but even viewed through the prism of recent events we feel very comfortable with what we own. Let me turn it over now to Jay Benet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill. Let's discuss updated guidance for the full year. We have got information on page 22. Four full year 2010 fully diluted operating income per share, which has now been refined from the previous range of $5.20 $5.55, to a new range of 5.20 to 5.45 which is a $0.10 reduction of the upper end of the range that primarily resulted from commercial renewal premium increases in 2010 not meeting our original expectations, which we believe is attributable to the impact of the continuing difficult economic environment.</p>
          <p>In round numbers this range for operating income should still translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11% as we have said before.</p>
          <p>We continue to anticipate some accident year loss ratio deterioration on a consolidated basis to full year 2010 ex-cats as we expect loss cost increases to modestly outpace projected earned rate increases in our commercial businesses for the full year. So in your modeling please remember that the second half of last year included favorable re-estimations of current year loss ratios for first half 2009 losses, so quarterly loss ratio comparisons for 2010 versus 2009 must take this into consideration.</p>
          <p>We're now assuming cat losses of $835 million after tax or $1.71 per diluted share which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first half and our original estimates for the second half of the year; no further estimates of prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable; a low single digit decrease in average invested assets ex unrealized gains and losses resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to the share repurchases; full year share repurchases of $4 billion; and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards of approximately 487 million shares.</p>
          <p>So with that, why don't we open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. My first question is on the pace of the share buybacks. Travelers repurchased $3 billion of stock in the first half of this year. I believe the guidance is for 4 billion for the first year yet there's still almost $4 billion left in the existing authorization. I'm just trying to get a sense of why the pace may slow or, you know, might that just be a conservative outlook?</p>
          <p>And my second question has to do with the economy. It appears that we're lapping some of the more challenging comparisons. So I'm trying to get a sense of how much of a benefit the stabilizing economy could be and whether Travelers feels it can still raise prices as exposures increase? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay, thank you.  First on the share buyback.  We have historically scaled back in the third quarter pending obviously cat season. Of course it seems to us like we've already endured two quarters of cat season already.</p>
          <p>My recollection was that the original estimates of share buyback included in the guidance was 3 to $4 billion. And -- 3.5 to 4? -- 3.5 to 4 and essentially we are still largely on that target for the moment. We may alter that as we go into the quarter depending upon second half of the year. That is, depending upon earnings, depending upon weather, reserve development to the extent it occurs and all that. But nonetheless it's a plan that we embraced at the beginning of the year and for the moment we're sticking to it.</p>
          <p>Your second question and maybe Brian and I will ham and egg this a little bit. We certainly can't prove this to you. It's largely anecdotal. It's been sitting in &#x2013; with conversations with our field folks and I'm speaking now about your question regarding the commercial insurance environment. Our sense is that there isn't anything that has particularly changed competitively. You all seem to be fixated all the time, have some company or companies changed their pricing strategy or tactics? We certainly don't see that and have no evidence of it.</p>
          <p>What we are hearing from our field folks is that as exposure is leveling out and it was -- you know, a comment I made earlier is that it looks as though exposure is trying to get back to zero, broadly speaking in the commercial lines businesses, is that it's getting more challenging to get rate increases. If you're a customer, you really don't focus on the granular dynamics that make up your price, your premium. You're really not all that worried about how much is exposure and how much is rate change and all that nonsense. What you as a customer tend to look at is, is my premium going up or down in its simplest form.</p>
          <p>And as exposure flattens out, to the extent that you try and get rate gains, you're asking for a premium increase. In this economic environment, our sense is is that it's getting just more challenging to pass that rate increase on. There's more, a little more resistance both from the intermediaries, the agency brokers, as well as the customers to accepting meaningful rate increases.</p>
          <p>Now it's interesting, we didn't present the data but we certainly do look at the distribution of rate gains in our middle market business each and every quarter. We've shared that with you previously. And to the extent there are loss dynamics at work, to the extent that an account has loss experience that's different, more problematic than what it had originally been expected, we do get rate gains. There are still significant accounts where you'll see a plus five, or even a plus 10 rate gain. But it largely is loss driven. It's not in effect margin or profitability driven.</p>
          <p>So -- and I would love to -- if Brian has any comment -- but our sense is that the margin picture broadly in our commercial businesses is modestly deteriorating. That it's -- and that is, that our ability to get rate in the aggregate is a little bit less than what you're experiencing broadly speaking in loss trends. So that's the way that we would, I think I'd answer. And I don't know if <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, one of the phrases that I would emphasize that Jay just used is this economic environment.  So we certainly wouldn't want to make the statement that as long as exposures are coming up you can never get rate changes.  If you think of where the psyche of our typical commercial customer is today, they saw the economy take a big dip.  They saw their business by and large take a big dip.  The good news is, if we look at our total portfolio, they're kind of back to not dipping anymore.  They're not yet back to growing or anything close to robustly growing.  And in that mind-set, you know they're sitting there going, you know, again, loss experience being neutral, you know we're going to struggle with premium increases.  So that's the dynamic we're seeing today and --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the context of returns in our business you always got to go back to, where are we from a profit margin perspective? If we went back &#x2013; if you go back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, which obviously contemplated normal tax and no reserve development, the return on equity that we were projecting for the year was about 11%.  And in the context of the environment we're in, both the investment environment, important to remember, the investment environment combined with the economic environment, it's -- you know, that's a pretty good return.  We -- it's difficult for us to plead that profitability measures in our business are inadequate and as a consequence we need to improve margins.</p>
          <p>In this investment and economic environment to the extent that we're capable of producing an 11% return on equity, we feel pretty good.  So we continue to try and seek rate where, and most importantly, where the loss experience demonstrates that we should and to the extent that we can improve our profitability dynamic as we move forward, we'll continue to do that.  But it's not as if we're starting from a point of impaired profitability in any way.  It is a pretty strong franchise and a pretty strong profit picture in the context of that environment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everybody.  Couple questions for Bill.  One, I was just curious if you could comment on the performance of the other investment income line this quarter, and what drove that? Just a little surprising given what macro is happening in the investment environment.  And then second, just with respect to the municipal portfolio I guess if someone wanted to play devil's advocate, a lot of the defenses of the municipal, the securities market around rating, average credit quality, things like that were things that were made for the mortgage market.  So I guess, if you had to be realistically bearish on your portfolio or the market broadly, what would you point to as kind of the bigger risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's take them in order.  In terms of the other assets, the results of the quarter were attributable to strong distributions in private equity, cash flow from the portfolio for the first six months was about even.  That means distribution equaled capital contributions which is better than we would have expected and there was a lot of net investment income gain in the results that we saw.</p>
          <p>Hedge funds made money but not very much, maybe a couple points better than the broad index.  Our hedge fund portfolio was only about 470 million, 1.6 billion at the time of our merger. And frankly we find it difficult to predict ex-ante facto which managers will do well and which won't.  So we have a handful of relationships of long standing.  In real estate, a lot of our funds had marked down properties, probably excessively and the first half of the year reflected a bounce in valuations.</p>
          <p>Let's go to municipals.  I agree with you, one can argue both sides of the equation forcefully.  We think about this issue every day.  But I would add we're not talking our book because we can't get out of where we are.  If we decided that instead of 34 billion -- forget the pre-refundeds for a moment -- instead of 34 billion it ought to be 20 billion or 25 billion, the quality of our holdings would permit us to make that adjustment and the market is very firm.  Frankly it is very firm -- it is very firm even in credits we wouldn't buy.</p>
          <p>In terms of the risks in the sector, and I think I alluded to this at Investor Day in May, I think the risks are less of economic defaults.  Because even with states with big budget problems are when you analyze them, not very heavily taxed, the risks are that some jurisdictions will seek, if a court allows them -- it may not -- to repudiate their debts simply because they choose not to increase taxes or cut budgets.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to larger jurisdictions, the possibility of this is pretty remote.  It is one thing to only have access to the capital markets at a high price and frankly most jurisdictions haven't even faced that penalty yet.  It is another to lose access to the capital markets altogether,  which is what would happen in a political repudiation.  So I agree the issue is not free from doubt.  And our take on it can be disputed.  But it's not arrived at lightly.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody.  Couple of questions here, just to follow up on the exposures.  You know, trend looks better.  How do we reconcile that with sort of the negative data that we have been seeing coming out of small businesses whether it is lending, business optimism, new business startups? And then if you could also touch on the trends you are seeing within audit premiums and then I've got a follow-up for Bill.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take on the first and I'll ask Greg to take on the second.  First I think our exposure data is actually largely in sync with what we see as to GDP changes broadly. We're not seeing growth, what we're actually seeing is a leveling out. And I think that there are some measures that would suggest that the economy is expanding modestly.  There are some that would suggest that -- there are some that would suggest that it has flattened. And that's largely at this point what our aggregate data says.  There will be some pluses and some minus in various businesses.  But the exposure change that we saw in the second quarter across all of our commercial businesses in the aggregate you know is getting close to zero.  And I think if you asked anyone from an economic perspective what do they see, they would largely say that at the very least we flattened out.  So we don't see it as inconsistent.  Maybe there's something else that you see but that's kind of our take on it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Audit. Okay, so -- this is Brian.  On the audit premium side we have talked about the numbers before.  At the depth of -- you know in the normal environment we're going to see something like 3 to 5 points of positive on the audit premium side.</p>
          <p>You know, around the end of last year, very beginning of this year we were running about a point negative and we're close to back to zero.  So we're at a really modest negative number.  So pretty consistent with that, that same view on the exposure change number.</p>
          <p>So still negative, but close to back to a plus number.  Now, you know, again, in normal world we would look for a plus 3 to 5 so --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's less about &#x2013; do you want to speak to that point about it being less about the economy than the way our policies work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yeah, there's obviously the -- audit premium has a lot to do with the psychology of the buyer and how the product is even sold.  And the natural course is that the buyer is going to understate exposure slightly.  And we pick it up on the back end on the exposure.  So we're always playing that game.  So that leads to the normal 3 to 5.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somewhat unpredictable because we're dealing with the psychology of our buyers and their willingness in effect to have us carry for period of time premium relative to exposure change.  We of course factor that into our pricing.  It is not a surprise to us.  But that one may snap back faster because it is predominantly psychologically driven more than the overall genuine exposure which really is an economic dynamic.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful.  And then, Bill you started to touch on this on the munis.  But, what I really want to know is who holds the senior position here? Is it the bond holders or is it muni workers, pension payments and healthcare benefits? Where is that dollar going to go to if we come down to that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  And I guess I would direct you back to the conversations we've had previously about the credit crunch analysis. And I would say that broadly that the way we're looking at it is stable.  So, hasn't been a lot of change but the release broadly comes from six or eight years from '01 to '08 and the actuaries go through the data every quarter and they are making lots of estimates and judgments based on a lot of cases that are still really at a state of infancy.  So I would say broadly speaking no change.</p>

          <p>Great.  Thank you, and then just if I could one follow-up on Personal Lines.  Brian you'd mentioned or that slide had 3.6 billion I think in cat expectations for the second quarter.  And Travelers' number in the second quarter is about 440 million.</p>
          <p>Am I looking at that right? I mean, that's about 10%.  I just want to understand, is it just different estimate base or how should we think about that thanks?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 3.6 billion on the industry slide is -- you know, comes out of PCS, property claims services.  And that is purely the kind of initial data that they have gotten from carriers and in some cases, for some events that happen literally three or four weeks ago.  So very, very immature data.  That will develop up fairly dramatically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>History would suggest.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>History would suggest, yes.  And just the way the claim process works.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I'd make a very important point.  We don't utilize PCS estimates to make our estimates of losses from those events.  Our losses are based upon what we are accruing, are based upon claim notices, claims files and our people on the ground.  So the important point here is that while we believe that history again suggests the PCS data will develop negatively, historically our estimates have actually been pretty good relative to catastrophe claims.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because obviously what we're trying to do is as quickly as possible take our claim data and make an actuarial estimate of what the ultimate will be and PCS does that over time but it takes them longer.  So it is really tough to do any kind of industry relativity right now. And then obviously you've got geographic distribution underneath that that you have got to look at.  But -- so we will scrutinize that as the data becomes available.  But, all we know is it's a big industry event and it was a big quarter for us, too.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  A couple of questions.  First maybe big picture on the reserve development.  I guess if you looked at your accuracy you would almost think you guys aren't that good at setting reserves given how redundant things have been.  If you can talk more specifically what's happening. I know it is going to vary by line and by segment but is it more of a frequency issue or a severity issue. So that's the first question.  And then secondly, maybe for Bill on the other investments it looks like the return this quarter annualized was around 12%.  And I probably asked this before but what would you consider the normalized return on those investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay.  Brian's going to answer your question on the reserve development.  But I'd just make an observation, that we really try hard to get it right because the issue is actually how we price our product.  To the extent that we end up overstating our loss costs going into a product offering, then we're pricing it higher than we otherwise would have to and we become less competitive relative to someone who takes a different view.  So it always feels good when it happens, of course it feels terrific when your results are impacted this way and certainly it is a whole lot better than under-estimating your loss costs which means you are underpricing your product and that's really a disaster.</p>
          <p>But we really try hard to get it right but because in the end what we're about is trying to grow our business and getting it right is what's going to help us do that the best.  Now your point's relevant.  We've had a long stretch here, significant development, and Brian or Jay or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I can start.  I think when you look at the components that make up the reserve development, frequency continues to be behaving in a way that when you go through the reserve setting process, you come up with estimates of what frequency's going to be, and it is behaving better than that.  And you know, that's been a trend that's been going on for a while.  When actuaries and finance people are looking at what the reserve process should be as it relates to favorable frequency and work with their business partners in terms of pricing and everything, you know, if you look at what, the current trends are, you wonder are things going to get better than they are when you are in a favorable position.  And you know, sometimes you just look at it and say well they are pretty good and I can't imagine them getting better and sometimes they do.</p>
          <p>So that's been a part of it. We're in a very low inflationary environment today.  And looking out several years as to what severity is going to be, just a little bit of a change in the inflationary outlook is going to have an impact as well.  So you know, you have to go back to what's the base upon which all of this is being done and on a gross basis our reserves are in excess of $50 billion. So the absolute level of these changes in terms of percentage points are very, very low.  But, given the nature of that reserve base they impact the income statement as you have seen.  But as Jay said each one of it these quarters, you know we're doing best estimates of what we see out there using all the information. And as it changes we just update the reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jay this is Brian. So two other points, because if you look at where the development has come from, not just in this quarter but over a good period of it time I would say it two things.  First on the liability side where we have had a lot of favorable reserve development, one of the toughest things to guesstimate at over time is where the tort environment is going and what the sustainable impact of that is.  And so that's been a big variable driving our improvement.  And at the same time, over -- and again this is a five to six-year kind of statement -- we have done a lot in our liability claim process that we think has helped the way we do business and service our customers and we think that's had a pretty strong impact there.</p>
          <p>But it takes time to see the impact of those things come in through the loss data so that's been driving.  And the other area is workers' comp which has continued, you know, again -- I always say this with comp: very much a state by state gain but in the aggregate where we play, we have continued to see some favorable news there and frequency dynamics that Jay Benet talked about.  But comp would be an area where that's really been true is trying to look at those frequency trends and project forward what do we think they are going to be in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great.  And then the other investment return?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I think that one has to speak to various sectors rather than generalize for other investments.  I think from owned real estate, unleveraged one ought to hope to make mid to high single digits; leverage real estate, leverage real estate that is funds, low double digits; hedge funds, low double digits; private equity maybe a little more.  And therefore our blended return depends on our allocation of those asset classes.</p>
          <p>Obviously one has to rethink all those returns if we're in a protracted period of very low interest rates.  You know we may all, all of us still be stuck in the mind-set of what these asset classes ought to make in the world before 2008.  But those are horseback numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Building actually off on Jay's question a little bit in terms of loss cost trends.  I'm just wondering about to what degree are you seeing favorable loss cost trends, whether it be from deflation or even falling frequency? And to the extent that you are, how confident would you be to really act upon that in terms of your forward pricing?  You know, I think of the personal auto industry and, 10 years ago where in other words you were about to experience several years of rapidly falling frequency.  And I think some of the more aggressive companies like Progressive had wished that they had been able to fully anticipate that to really grow their book. I'm curious how you would take that in terms of going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's -- first I would observe that this is very much line by line specific.  There are long tail lines where you take a deep breath obviously before you embrace an emerging trend.  And I mean I would make an example in workers' comp.  We are still contemplating meaningful medical inflation.  We're not pricing our product -- we talk all the time about denying loss cost and no inflation. We should always be excluding medical portion of workers' comp where we assume a robust inflation rate and we'll obviously see how that works out.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking with I think a couple of individual exceptions, Brian talked about asphalt shingles which a number of carriers have highlighted because it is a by-product of the price of oil, that loss cost trends' severity have broadly speaking been awfully benign.  That doesn't mean zero.  It doesn't mean that we don't see some embedded inflation in lines of business.  The shorter the tail of that business is, the more we're willing to embrace it and incorporate it into our pricing because if we're wrong it doesn't take long before we can reprice the product.  The same thing holds true for frequency.  In many lines of business there has been a long-term systemic decline in frequency. And I would actually say that it's gotten -- well we have been chasing it.</p>
          <p>You ask the question all the time, as frequency comes down, is it making a new level.  Is it going to return back to previous levels not only from a pricing perspective but also from a reserving perspective as well.  And I think the same thing holds true to the extent that these are shorter-tail lines of business, we're aggressive in embracing it.  And to the extent that they are longer tail we're a little more reluctant to move in that direction.  I think one of the things that affected workers' compensation -- I can't prove this, it is just from data that we look at -- is that as our economy has moved increasingly to a service based environment, frequency in workers' comp has come down.  That's not a great surprise to people.  And so that's sort of the dynamic, that element that you feel more comfortable embracing.  So it is very line specific and I think it's difficult to generalize. If there's a line that you're particularly interested in, we can attempt to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cliff you are really getting to the core of the puzzle we're trying to solve each and every day in the marketplace: do we understand why loss trends are changing.  First of all can we see as granular as possible where they are changing and break them out.  And then the real trick is understanding why.  The generality would be the better we feel about our ability to understand why something's changing, the more confident we're going to be factoring it into our pricing.  Where you get in trouble is you see a pattern and you don't understand why.  And you just start extending the pattern.  But we can talk -- it is as Jay said it is very much a line by line --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I do think though, culturally, as a matter of the institution and the way actuaries think and in this organization, you would characterize us as not pushing the edge.  It's, there's -- and again, particularly in longer tail lines you take a great risk when you make an assumption as to changing trends, embrace it, price your product, reserve for it and find, lo and behold, that you have not only underpriced but underreserved both.  So I just think culturally here we're not an organization that instinctively pushes the edge.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody, a couple quick questions here.  First, I'm looking at the Business Insurance <mark type="inaudible" /> your combined ratios, ex-cats the underlying, particularly on the loss ratio side, it looks like when you adjust for the current period development last year it took about 200 basis points year-over-year.  Is that pretty consistent with what we should expect here going forward given your comments about continued action here to  procuration year over year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I'm trying to do the math in my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you said it was about a 62 last year in the second quarter, ex the current period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I would say pretty close to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jay Benet.  The thing that we would urge you to do, urge everyone to do, is look at last year's combined ratio, look at last year's loss ratio component of that in its totality for the year, because of the re-estimation that took place in the third and fourth quarter.  So the best proxy for what the loss ratio was for coming into 2010 would be the full year 2009 loss ratio and then we said we would expect some margin compression from that.</p>
          <p>And so far what you've seen is the first six months. That would be the mechanical comparison that you would want to do, recognizing that in any period the non-cat related weather is also going to bounce around and there's going to be some noise from other larger loss activity or whatever.  But that would be the base information to be taking a look at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And then also in the Business Insurance your G&amp;A expenses, even if you add back the benefit you have in the second quarter last year, down fairly substantially year-over-year, anything unusual going on there or is there some expense initiatives going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're always closely managing expenses. And there is the timing of some expenses that'll take place at various quarters, one year versus the next.  I wouldn't say there's anything in particular going on there other than we're always watchful of our expenses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And then the last question, you talked about pricing and how you want to adjust it for obviously what's going on with loss costs et cetera but what about interest rates right now? I mean, it seems like interest rates are going to be low for a while longer.  How can you adjust pricing for interest rates or can you in the current marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you had gone back a year ago, our view was is that the investment environment that we were in was shorter rather than longer and that it was likely that combination of stimulus dollars and whatever else, and the Fed ultimately backing away from the support of the financial institutions that rates would rise to more normal historical levels.  Bill and I spend a lot of time talking about the environment and it's very possible now that what we're in is an extended period of time at where we are.</p>
          <p>And as a consequence we are beginning to think meaningfully about what the implication of that is for our business.  And that not only gets to pricing of our product, but return, expectations, capital embedded in our business, ways in which the capital is used.  It's a broad question that gets well beyond are you pricing adequately.  Again, in this environment, with these interest rates we're able to generate round numbers an 11% return on equity.  Now you begin to ask yourself the question, if riskless rates are where they are and spreads are where they are then what are reasonable returns and what can be expected and how do we deploy our capital going forward appropriately in that very different environment. We're at the -- I would say the early stages of those discussions but they are serious discussion that we're taking place here regularly.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  And thank you for the call. First question, did I -- I think I accurately heard that you are issuing annual policies for your personal lines.  And if that's the case, I'm a little bit curious as to the strategy.  Historically I think of that as sort of a top of the market kind of strategy to hold on to your business as opposed to a bottom of the market strategy given that on the upside you would typically want to be able to reprice your product as fast as you can. Am I just wrong on that or is there a different subtlety here to that strategy that I'm missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, this is Greg Toczydlowski. I guess to answer that question you got to kind of start off where we began.  We started driving a sophisticated product out in the marketplace about five years ago.  And underneath that was our first foray into predictive modeling.  So as we needed to stay nimble and adjust that product we kept the shorter term contract.  As we move forward and become very confident in that new business pricing and that in combination with the demand base from our agents and customers, based on the profile that we're trying to attract, we think it prudent to issue the annual policy at this point in time.  And again as Jay talked about some of the underlying dynamics of the personal insurance business, we feel terrific about that position right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is back to the current returns.  And I agree that 11% ROE especially relative to your peers is a good result.  The question I have is, is that does this in your mind suggest that essentially the market, meaning the property casualty market, largely ignores the interest rates where they are today in their profitability? Or is this in your view a view that essentially the hurdle rate has fallen for the industry?  Because I would imagine that the hurdle rate if anything has gone up given volatility, uncertainty, the cat losses and the stock market seems to be behaving that way.  The stock market looks like it's behaving as if the hurdle rate for the industry has risen over the cycle. Any thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand the question, I think, anyway.  First, I certainly don't think that the insurance industry ignores investment returns.  As we price our product we are driven by available investment returns in the marketplace. When -- shortly after the crisis when the world sort of settled back down and we were confronted with a different kind of fixed income environment than had existed previously, the real question was, were you going to knee-jerk react to a changing interest rate environment, causing disruption to agents, brokers, customers and all of your distribution?  Or were you going to take a deep breath and see what would happen to investment returns over time?  I've spoken about this earlier.  It was our decision to take this in the longer view and not to knee-jerk now 18 months ago and attempt to drive pricing up in some very dramatic fashion.  I think that would have been not only highly disruptive but candidly not very successful.  That would have been a strategy that I think would have failed.</p>
          <p>Now I think -- and again this is how we perceived it, you can certainly ask other companies what their view is -- it may very well be that this economic malaise, such as it is, is longer rather than shorter and it may very well be that this investment environment is as a consequence longer rather than shorter and we are, as I said, in the early stages of really thinking through the implications of that.  It's a long view.  We speak about returns over time.  We try hard not to get tangled up in, candidly, this quarter, next quarter, that we manage this business to generate returns over time.</p>
          <p>And one of the questions that we're going to ask ourselves is in the investment environment that's available and given other investments -- we recognize that we compete against other investments, including investments that are fixed income.  We have round numbers of 3% yield at the moment.  What are the implications of that? How do we think about our company and what are we, what do we strive to produce for investors in a very different investment environment than existed even a couple years ago.</p>
          <p>And it's a very legitimate question, and we're ankle-deep in it at the moment as we try and wade our way through it.  It's complex.  Obviously no one company can adopt a strategy that's disruptive in the marketplace and think somehow that it will be successful.  We operate in a very competitive environment.  So you have to balance all of those factors.  More to follow.  Just no immediate clear answers about that issue, but a very relevant question.</p>
