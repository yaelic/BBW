        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And good afternoon and welcome to our conference call on results for the third quarter of the year. With me here today are Rafael Matute, CFO of Walmart de M&#xE9;xico y Centroam&#xE9;rica, and Alberto Ebrard, Executive Vice President and Managing Director of Walmart Central America.</p>
          <p>We are satisfied with our third quarter results. EBITDA grew 12%, and net income grew 15%, both above the rate of growth in sales. I am particularly satisfied with the performance of our retail business in Mexico. In the case of Central America, the third quarter reflected another quarter of investment and transformation.</p>
          <p>We'll begin by analyzing the results for Mexico, first for retail, followed by those figures pertaining to the bank. The retail operation in Mexico had solid performance. Total income increased 12.1%. Gross margin grew 12.4%, slightly above sales, despite the reinvestment we made in pricing. Expenses grew 11.1%, 10.3% if you take out depreciation. That is 100 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively, below the increase in income. EBITDA for the quarter increased a solid 15.0%.</p>
          <p>Regarding sales performance in Mexico, as I commented on our second quarter '11 webcast that we were not satisfied with comp sales performance, and on the other hand, that we had improved the distribution of openings throughout the year, which would benefit total sales for the third and fourth quarters. Comp unit sales show an upward trend vis-&#xE0;-vis the first and second quarters. Comp sales grew from 1.7% during the first quarter, 2.4% growth in the second, and 3.0% growth in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding total sales, we note the same trend. Growth in the third quarter was 12.0%, compared with 8% and 9.8% for the first and second quarters respectively.</p>
          <p>I wish to highlight the improvement in the growth trend for comp stores during the quarter. If we take a close look at growth month after month using the 4-5-4 retail calendar so as to eliminate the calendar effects, a marked improvement is noted: 2.2% growth in July, 2.8% in August and 3.3% in September.</p>
          <p>One of our primary concerns was the reduction in customer traffic at comp units. This trend reverted in September, and transactions increased 1.0%.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we are focused on three strategies to grow comparable store sales. One, strengthening our fundamental strategy of Everyday Low Prices. This process was completed in July, lowering prices consistently in different categories, in all of our formats, nationwide. Two, reinforcing categories that drive traffic to our stores: lowering prices, improving assortment and increasing communication to our customers. And lastly, we are growing categories that are underdeveloped for both general merchandise and apparel.</p>
          <p>The results for Mexico, integrating the retail operations and the bank are as follows: income increased 12.2%; gross margin remained stable and represented 21.7% of income; expenses grew 11.6%, below the increase in sales; and EBITDA grew 14.4%.</p>
          <p>Banco Walmart continues growing in all line items. Comparing third quarter 2011 results against the same period last year, we see that income has increased 3.1 times, deposits have grown 2.2 times, and the deposit balance is now more than Mex$2.86 billion.</p>
          <p>Loans have practically quadrupled, reaching a balance of Mex$2.99 billion. We now have more than 250,000 credit cardholders. This implies eight times the number that we had one year ago. As a result of this increase in credit activity, there is an impact on results, because pursuant to Mexican banking regulations, reserves equaling three times our past due portfolio have been created.</p>
          <p>Now Alberto Ebrard will discuss the integration process and results for Central America.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Scot, and good afternoon to everyone. In Central America, we are conducting many changes and investing strongly so the region may run like a true Walmart operation that will allow us to take advantage of the substantial opportunities that exist for profitable growth.</p>
          <p>The first strategic change to prepare the region for accelerated growth was the redefining of our multiformat strategy. Central America already had a multiformat strategy, however, the differentiation and positioning of the different formats was not as clear as in Mexico.</p>
          <p>First, we had to redefine the target customer for each format and redirect business strategies to meet the needs of each customer type. The Maxi Bodega format, for example, despite being a Bodega format, have higher prices than those found in discount formats. We are relaunching the Bodega format, lowering prices, improving assortment, and changing the name to Maxi Pali or Maxi</p>
          <p>Despensa, placing it under the umbrella of the discount formats which have the greatest brand recognition in the market and are price leaders throughout the region. By the same token, we are aligning the visual image of the logo for Bodegas as well as discount formats, employing the logo used by former Bodega Aurrer&#xE1; in M&#xE9;xico.</p>
          <p>The second strategic change so that operations in Central America can be more Walmart, was to introduce the brand itself calling ourselves Walmart. During the second quarter of the year, we converted all our hypermarkets to Walmart Supercenters. This change allow us to leverage the recognition of the Walmart brand, and implied a considerable improvement to the value proposition and the shopping experience for our customers, particularly in assortment and differentiation in seasonal items.</p>
          <p>The third strategic step is to differentiate our value proposition through the introduction of Everyday Low Prices. Everyday Low Prices is our fundamental strategy and one of our main competitive advantages. It is an essential part of who we are and the way in which we build trust, credibility and loyalty with our customers. It is also a way of working, planning and achieving efficiency with our suppliers.</p>
          <p>In Central America, we decided to introduce Everyday Low Prices in all our formats simultaneously during the second quarter of this year, in parallel with the launching of Walmart Supercenter.</p>
          <p>Another key change required to align the business for the three previous strategies I mentioned was to establish a regional structure aligned by business format, unlike the previous structure, which was aligned by country. Having a format-aligned regional structure enables each buyer to focus on the specific needs of the customer for every format.</p>
          <p>Through this structure, we can achieve operating efficiencies and reduce expenses, thus operate with Everyday Low Costs, which is the basis for our Everyday Low Prices strategy. In the past, we had one buyer per country. Now we have a regional buyer with the focus on the specific needs of the customer and with the negotiation capacity based on volume and visibility in the five countries.</p>
          <p>One of Central America's most appealing factors is its potential for growth, and one of our main priorities is to increase our rate of expansion. In order to achieve accelerated growth efficiently and profitably, we need the appropriate definition of formats and the differentiated commercial business strategies I mentioned before, and in addition to strengthening the selection, approval and construction processes for new stores that we have been conducting. This year we will make significant progress on the rate of expansion, increasing installed capacity by 10% versus 3.7% growth last year. Sales floor footage increased 5.9% in the last twelve months to September. With the year before, the increase was 1.4%.</p>
          <p>All these changes need to be within a systems framework. We are still in the process of changing the systems to those of Walmart. So far, systems have been converted in all our stores in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and we will finish by year end in Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
          <p>Having made all these changes at the same time implies a period of adjustment that impacted both customers and suppliers. In addition, we had some system-related mistakes during the EDLP implementation process, specifically in the price model of the non-Walmart systems. Put simply, the buyers in Costa Rica sent the prices of the different products, which arrived distorted to the stores, sometimes higher, creating a negative impact on sales, and sometimes lower, even lower than cost, causing the products to fly off the shelves, impacting gross margin.</p>
          <p>This situation impacted results for the second and third quarters, and had to be corrected store by store and product by product. The corrections have already been made, and we currently have our products priced as we want in all the countries. But the main damage we're suffering is the loss of credibility by our customers. We are investing to win back our customers through very aggressive campaigns. It will take us longer, but I am convinced we are headed in the right direction towards building customers' trust, credibility and loyalty.</p>
          <p>Third quarter results for Central America were as follows. Total income increased 1% in peso terms and 4% on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned earlier, the systems-related mistakes during the EDLP implementation impacted both sales and gross margin.</p>
          <p>Expenses reflect our investments in new units. The main increases were on pre-opening, maintenance and remodeling expenses, and depreciation. The rest of the expenses decreased by 2% in peso terms versus last year. Without a doubt, operating under Everyday Low Costs and sharing the same Walmart DNA are some of the focus points in the region and some of the greatest opportunities for improvement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alberto. Now, Rafael, why don't we go over the consolidated results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Total income increased 11%. Gross margin went from 21.8% to 21.7% as a result of the decrease in Central America. General expenses increased 10%, below the increase in total income. EBITDA increased 12%, and net income 15%, both at a higher rate than sales.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. At the end of the third quarter, our cash position amounted to Mex$15.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Inventories increased 21% as we have opened 410 new units more in the last 12 months, while accounts payable to suppliers increased 24%.</p>
          <p>I would like to highlight that despite the foreign exchange volatility observed during the quarter in which the Mexican peso devaluated 18.7% against the dollar from Mex$11.7 to Mex$13.90 per dollar, we did not have an exchange variance. This is a result of our conservative policy that we follow to cover our commitments in the foreign currency.</p>
          <p>Over the last 12 months up to September, we generated Mex$37.1 billion from our operations, plus Mex$190 million from the negative working capital. We invested Mex$16.4 billion in fixed assets, we paid dividends in cash for Mex$9.7 billion, repurchased shares for Mex$4.1 billion, and paid taxes for Mex$7.3 billion.</p>
          <p>This year we will exceed our expansion program disclosed at the beginning of the year. We will increase our installed capacity in Mexico by 13%, versus the 12.2% previously announced, and by 10% in Central America, versus 8.8% announced at the beginning of the year. With this, total sales floor growth will be 12.7%.</p>
          <p>And finally, some recognitions were received during the quarter. Honduras is recognized for fourth consecutive year as a Socially Responsible Company, for developing practices and projects that support the communities where it operates, its customers, suppliers, associates and the environment.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we received recognition for contributing towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, from the Clean Transportation program of SEMARNAT, for developing technologies and practices, together with our suppliers, that reduced emissions of GHG by 7,000 tons in a single year.</p>
          <p>Sam's Club is considered the company with the best reputation in Mexico, by the Reputation Institute, according to seven criterias, which are product/services, innovation, work atmosphere, integrity, corporate citizenship, leadership and finance.</p>
          <p>Vips was recognized with the International Quality Crown Award by Business Initiative Directions for excellence in leadership, customer satisfaction, commercial direction and brand prestige. We were the only Mexican company and restaurant chain to obtain this award in the year 2010.</p>
          <p>With this, we conclude our conference call. Thank you again and I wish to remind that we will be available to receive any phone calls to address any questions that you may have. Thank you.</p>
