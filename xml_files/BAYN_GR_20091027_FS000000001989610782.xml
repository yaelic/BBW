          <p>Due to technical reasons, the beginning of this conference call was not recorded properly and will be re-read.</p>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our call. During this call, we will review our Q3 2009 financial results that were released earlier today. With us on the call are our CEO, Werner Wenning; our CFO, Klaus K&#xFC;hn; and the CEOs from our sub-groups, Arthur Higgens from HealthCare, Friedrich Berschauer from CropScience, and Patrick Thomas from MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Before the presentation starts, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statement wording.</p>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We achieved a turnaround in the third quarter. For the first time this year, the Bayer Group reported EBITDA before special items that was at least slightly ahead of the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>HealthCare had a strong quarter, with higher sales and double-digit growth in earnings. MaterialScience showed a tangible recovery. Here we nearly doubled our earnings compared with the preceding quarter, and thus almost matched the third quarter of 2008. CropScience, in a weaker market, saw sales and earnings drop significantly from the relatively strong level of the prior-year period. We believe that the positive year-on-year earnings trend for the Group as a whole will continue over the next few months.</p>
          <p>We can therefore confirm our ambitious forecast that we will limit the decline in underlying EBITDA to approximately 5% for the full year 2009. This also shows, however, that we reacted quickly, comprehensively, and systematically to the economic crisis. We made further progress with our working capital management, maintaining spending discipline during the quarter. There was a clear improvement in free operating cash flow, which allowed us to lower net debt by &#x20AC;1 billion compared with the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a brief look at the numbers for the third quarter. As always, I will concentrate on the currency and portfolio adjusted changes. I now hand over to Mr. Wenning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>The group sales of about &#x20AC;2.4 billion were 7% below the same period last year. Lower volumes diminished sales by 3%, and lower selling prices by 4%. Underlying EBITDA for the Group at &#x20AC;1.5 billion was up 0.4% because of the double-digit earnings growth at HealthCare and the ongoing recovery in earnings at MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Group underlying EBITDA includes a 50 million negative impact from currencies. So at constant exchange rates, our achievements in cost improvements and efficiency would have become more visible. Core earnings per share were &#x20AC;0.78, down 8% from the prior-year figure.</p>
          <p>Sales of the HealthCare sub-group rose by 4% in the third quarter, driven by the positive performance in all divisions. And growth in underlying EBITDA was into double digits at 12%. We increased Pharmaceuticals sales by 4%. Growth here was driven by the continuing strong momentum in Asia and Latin America. In China, sales rose by an even more substantial 22%. We achieved double-digit growth rates on the quarter for Nexavar, Levitra, Aspirin Cardio, and Kinzal. Sales of Nexavar rose by nearly 30%, bolstered by its approval in Japan in May of this year for the treatment of liver cancer. Sales of Aspirin Cardio grew by 15%, Levitra by 12%, and Kinzal by 16%.</p>
          <p>The Yaz product family registered continued growth of nearly 5%. Mirena held steady at the high level of the prior-year period. Sales of Kogenate rose by 3%. However, sales at Betaferon declined by 4%. This was due to lower sales in Europe, which were only partially offset by an increase in the United States. Business with Avelox shrank by 8.5%, mainly because of lower sales in the United States.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA of the Pharmaceuticals segments improved by 9% to &#x20AC;765 million. This earnings growth was driven by the upward business trends, a drop in selling expenses, and by synergies from the Schering integration. Higher manufacturing and R&amp;D costs prevented an even bigger improvement.</p>
          <p>Important progress was achieved with some of our pipeline projects. Regarding Xarelto, we and our partner J&amp;J are now aiming to submit a complete response to the FDA during the fourth quarter of this year. We're also happy to announce that enrollment of the EINSTEIN-DVT trial, in which we are studying Xarelto for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis, has been completed. In View 1 and 2 studies in VEGF Trap-Eye in wet AMD has been fully recruited. Based on positive data, Clara was submitted for regulatory approval in the United States.</p>
          <p>We continue to build our cancer pipeline. In September, we entered into a global agreement with Algeta for the development and commercialization of Alpharadin. Alpharadin is currently being evaluated in Phase III for the treatment of bone metastases. On Friday last week, we announced that we have started a Phase III trial with Nexavar in thyroid cancer.</p>
          <p>Sales in our Consumer Health segment advance by nearly 5% in the third quarter to just under &#x20AC;1.4 billion. Here, business expanded by around 5% in all three divisions. Our OTC business performed especially well in the emerging markets and North America. Sales of blood glucose monitoring systems advanced in all regions.</p>
          <p>The expansion of Animal Health came mainly from an increase in sales of our Drontal product line. Sales of the Advantage product line grew by 2%.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health posted underlying EBITDA of &#x20AC;376 million, which was 18% above the third quarter of last year. This very good performance was due to the growth in business and to lower selling expenses.</p>
          <p>The increase in sales and underlying EBITDA so far this year shows that our HealthCare business remains on track. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate slight but continued growth, compared with the very strong prior-year quarter. We expect to improve the underlying EBITDA margin for the full year towards 28%.</p>
          <p>First nine months sales at CropScience improved by 2% on higher prices. Underlying EBITDA was 1.342 billion and includes a negative currency impact of 36 million. Adjusted for negative currencies, underlying EBITDA thus was only about 40 million or 3% short of last year's record level. A more than solid performance also vis-&#xE0;-vis the competition considering the deteriorating market environment.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of this year, with commodity prices still at a high level, farmers and wholesalers placed their orders early, expecting Crop Protection products to remain in short supply. These trends gave us a very successful start to the 2009 planting season. After that, however, declining commodity prices and adverse weather conditions caused the market environment to deteriorate. This held back business momentum in Q2 and led to a drop in sales and earnings in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Q3 sales fell by 8%, with a 7% decrease in volumes and a 1% decline in prices. Crop Protection and Environmental Science were the most affected. Our Bio Science business, on the other hand, continued to perform positively, with sales expanding by 3%.</p>
          <p>Q3 underlying EBITDA of CropScience came in at 108 million. This represents a 48% decline or in absolute numbers roughly 100 million lower EBITDA compared to the same period of 2008. About half of the decline is attributable to lower volumes, and a third to negative currency effects.</p>
          <p>Although we are obviously disappointed with the Q3 results at CropScience, we don't believe in reading too much into quarterly performance in this business. In Latin America, the season got off to a successful start, and we expect to regain business momentum in the fourth quarter. Q4 sales should be above last year, and we also expect to report an increase in full-year sales. Due to the big third quarter, we anticipate that EBITDA before special items for the full year will come in below the high level of 2008. Accordingly, we now expect to achieve an EBITDA margin before special items of between 23 and 24% for 2009.</p>
          <p>The MaterialScience business continued to recover in the third quarter. Although sales were still down 22% on the prior-year period, business expanded by 14% compared with the second quarter of this year. The sequential recovery in underlying EBITDA was even more significant. Compared with the second quarter, underlying EBITDA nearly doubled from &#x20AC;121 million to &#x20AC;238 million and thus reached approximately the level of the prior-year period. The sequential recovery in sales and earnings was predominantly driven by higher volumes. Selling prices improved slightly, and also our savings initiatives contributed to the increase. However, raw materials costs went up quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>We are currently experiencing the strongest recovery of volumes in Asia, where Q3 volumes were again above last year's levels. Europe and North America are still significantly behind in their recovery. We anticipate that the economic environment will continue to stabilize in the fourth quarter. Due to the usual seasonal weakening of business activity toward the end of the year, we expect underlying EBITDA in the fourth quarter to be below the third quarter but well ahead of the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>Also, gross cash flow in the third quarter was for the first time in this year level with the same period of 2008. Net cash flow rose by nearly 23%, and free operating cash flow by 48%, due to the improvements in working capital at HealthCare and CropScience. Net financial debt at the end of the quarter was down by 1.05 billion compared with the end of Q2 at &#x20AC;10.7 billion. We expect to further reduce our financial debt towards &#x20AC;10 billion in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, ladies and gentlemen, let me just briefly summarize again. In the third quarter, we saw year-on-year underlying EBITDA growth for the first time in 2009. HealthCare had a strong third quarter, and we can confirm the full-year guidance. Sales and earnings of CropScience dramatically lower than in the strong prior-year period. Here we have adjusted our guidance for the full year.</p>
          <p>MaterialScience continues to post a significant recovery. This sub-group doubled its earnings compared with the preceding quarter. We expect the up trend to continue in the fourth quarter, apart from the normal seasonal weakening. Against this background, we expect to post full-year Group sales of between 31 and &#x20AC;32 billion and are adhering to our ambitious target of limiting the decline in Group EBITDA before special items to about 5%.</p>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. My colleagues and I will now be pleased to answer your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. At this time, we will begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Fabian Wenner. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Fabian Wenner from UBS. Quickly, can you quantify how relevant the decline in selling expenses was in HealthCare? Secondly, any update on the RECOTHROM and the discussions with the agency in Europe? And thirdly, just &#x2013; can you disclose the easing of the raw materials and energy costs in MaterialScience in the third quarter, and what your best guess is for input cost inflation for the next two quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Arthur Higgins will start with the HealthCare-relating question, and then Patrick Thomas on your raw material questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me, first of all discuss with you that our overall expense management in the third quarter in both Pharma and Consumer reflected our concern about how quickly the markets were recovering. And that's important, because we have clearly seen a very good recovery in Q3 in our Consumer businesses and also a recovery in the U.S. markets.</p>
          <p>However, we kept very strict expense control in the third quarter. We will obviously start to see expenses now come back in line in the fourth quarter. But to give you a perspective, if you look at marketing and sales in our Pharma business in the third quarter, that was about 33% of sales compared to 37% in the prior year. And if you look at our Consumer business in the third quarter, again the number happens to be the same, 33% of sales. And that would have compared with 37% in the prior quarter. So roughly in both businesses a 4 percentage point improvement in costs of sales in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Regarding RECOTHROM, we continue to have discussions with the EMEA and are hopeful we will -- to resolve those in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Fabian, thanks for your question on energy and feedstock. If we look sequentially quarter-on-quarter from quarter two to quarter three, the raw material and energy prices in total had a negative impact around about 40 million on the EBITDA. Year-on-year of sequential quarters &#x2013; or year-on-year quarters, '08, '09 &#x2013; there was a positive effect of about 350 million on the EBITDA, so that's the sort of macro picture.</p>
          <p>If we turn to what the sort of outlook looks like, it's rather difficult because, as you've seen, the rather volatile oil price movement and oil derivatives have been all over the place. We expect quarter four raw materials and energy to be slightly higher than quarter three. And currently for full year, the total raw materials and energy price effect would be something like 800 million below last year. So hopefully that's helpful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Neil Tyler. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I'm Neil Tyler, JP Morgan in London. Sticking with MaterialScience for a second, Patrick, could you give us a quick update on polycarbonate capacity additions that you have seen or that you have seen canceled in the last two or three months. And also on the success or otherwise of the recent price announcements that you've made, how those negotiations are going?</p>
          <p>And then on the CropScience business, I wonder if you would mind adding a bit of detail in terms of the pricing trends, both on a product and/or on a regional basis &#x2013; where the greatest pressure point is, particularly on pricing, please. And also, still sticking with CropScience, the comment that you made in terms of the impact of the new credit control environment in Europe, is that something that's really commenced this quarter, or is that something that's been ongoing for the previous season? I suppose what I'm trying to get to the bottom of is whether we should expect an ongoing impact from that into the first half of the 2010 financial year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with BMS and polycarbonate, Patrick, and then Mr. Berschauer on the CropScience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Neil. On polycarbonate capacity additions, I guess the last major addition of substance was our own doubling up in Caojing in China, which was 100,000 tons. That was the second line that we put onstream, beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>If you look at some of the other projects which were slated, there were three or four small plants, one in Brazil, one in China, one in Japan, all of which I believe are now suspended or postponed, from every public source that I can see. The next slated major capacity to come onstream will be the Sabic facility in Al Jubail in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Thereafter, there may be another pant in China, a small unit, but that's by no means certain, although there is somebody in the queue for a license there in China. But that's more like 2012, I believe.</p>
          <p>In terms of price movements, we've seen steadily positive demand. And if you allow for the multiplying that's been going on, there's about 300,000 tons of material that we've taken out and multipled at the moment. From the beginning of the year, we've actually had to bring back on about 90,000 tons of that capacity to meet the product demand and the product mix. The demand is still pretty positive. We're seeing some new demand coming out of the furniture industry.</p>
          <p>For example, IKEA are now producing plastic chairs made out of polycarbonate, which are very fashionable at the moment. The IT industry, netbooks and TVs are still pretty strong. So we've been pretty pleased with the positive trend. And there is some restocking going on, which is helping to push price. So generally price is moving in a positive direction. It's not dramatic, but the movement is at least positive during Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and CropScience pricing trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing trends, first of all, as you probably know, the whole industry was able to implement really nice, good pricing trends, beginning of this year. Then as Mr. Wenning pointed out, the overall situation really changed. So overall, we have seen a significant pressure on prices, specifically in the third quarter. There are clearly regional trends, so we have implemented good price increases in Europe, which is the key part of our business. We also have been able to implement price increases in Asia Pacific, as well as in North America. And the pressure clearly is on Latin America. So there are significant differences region by region.</p>
          <p>Then you asked the question in terms of the business performance in France and what's going on in Europe, what's going on here, and what we are expecting. First of all, in Europe we had an impact on commodity prices, as Mr. Wenning pointed out, specifically cereals, which are very, very &#x2013; which is a very, very important crop in Europe. Secondly, we need to keep in mind that we had some negative business intakes based on the financial crisis in countries like Ukraine, where we reduced our business significantly to be on the safe side. And most importantly, in my opinion, in Europe overall, the whole industry, we faced adverse weather conditions compared to other years. So the weather situation in Europe for our businesses was clearly below average.</p>
          <p>And finally, we need to keep in mind France, which is very &#x2013; in our business not clearly number one in Europe. Probably you know there is a different &#x2013; a new law implemented in France. This law says that you only can accept credit terms of 45 days. We have the famous also in the past is famous multi-sows, which means we are filling the channel in this &#x2013; mainly in the fourth quarter, and now with this new law, we still not able to implement this kind of multi-sow in France, but we are pushing our sales logically into December. But overall, basically we are expecting due to this new law in France not a significant impact on this year as well as next year.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean, sorry to interrupt, but we probably missed the first part of your question here. Would you mind repeating it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem. Can you hear me now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, so Jean De Watteville from Nomura. Question is can you please quantify the impact of that 45 days credit terms law in France in your third quarter, please?</p>
          <p>Second question, on CropScience still, you made announcement in September about quite ambitious R&amp;D projects in Bio Science, and I just wanted to have an understanding of how we should read that. Is it a switch from R&amp;D from Crop Protection to Seed and therefore there will not be a step-up of R&amp;D spending overall for CropScience, or should we expect a step-up of R&amp;D? And if that is the case, can you just explain to us what's the impact on profitability mid-term for the CropScience? Should we expect the EBITDA profitability to be slightly impacted by that effort in R&amp;D spendings?</p>
          <p>The third question I would have, obviously MaterialScience results have been significantly above the guidance you gave in the second quarter conference call, and I was just curious if you could rank for us what were the areas of surprise to you? Was that mainly because of better volumes? Was that because of the price increases that have been implemented in Polyurethanes or Polycarbonates, or there was something else?</p>
          <p>And the very last question I have is on the working capital. You obviously had a strong working capital generation in the first nine months. Usually Q4 is a good quarter in terms of seasonality for working capital generation. I'm just wondering if we should continue to expect further working capital reduction in Q4, or there will be some reversal that we should be aware of? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's start with CropScience, and -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, CropScience, there have been two questions. First of all, the impact of France on Q3 and Q4. There is some impact on Q3, but limited impact, as discussed, on Q4. So overall it's rather difficult to differentiate now between Q3 and Q4. But overall, as explained before, we do not expect a significant impact due to this new law in France on our top line as well as profitability in Europe.</p>
          <p>Coming back to your question in terms of research and development, our spending, to share with you the numbers, our R&amp;D spending this year in CropScience &#x2013; which means Crop Protection, Environmental Science, and Bio Science &#x2013; will be in the range of &#x20AC;690 million. Presently, we are spending 78% for Crop Protection and Environmental Science, which means around about 540 million. The big metric is Crop Protection, with 500 million or a little bit above. Environmental Science is in the range of 30 million. And we are expecting to spend in Bio Science this year around about 150 million.</p>
          <p>Our strategy is very clear. We are going to keep our R&amp;D spending in Crop Protection flat. No increases, there is no need, because we have anyway the highest R&amp;D spending in the whole industry and also based on trades, very strong commitment. We are convinced that we need to keep this spending to continue to be innovative in the years to come. So the message is keeping Crop Protection and Environmental Science R&amp;D spending flat in the years to come and expanding our Bio Science R&amp;D activities year-by-year. But you can expect maybe a yearly increase of 20, 30 million and not in a &#x2013; but a different dimension.</p>

          <p>So Bayer MaterialScience, what has really happened compared to the guidance of the second quarter and the third quarter. Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jean. Yeah, I think we said we'd bottomed out, and it would be positive in the third quarter. So I think we kind of confirmed and met our guidance, although I agree with you that the scale was slightly different than perhaps what had been imagined.</p>
          <p>If I just look sequentially quarter-on-quarter, around about 100 million of the increased EBITDA came through volume and around about 20 on price. And this is actually the first quarter in the last five quarters where we've seen price and volume move both in a positive direction. So that's obviously significant and very gratifying.</p>
          <p>And if I look at the price fixes that are in for October 1, that would explain why some of the volume was there in September, but also we would expect more price movement as we move into October. That was offset then by around about 40 million on raw materials, as I mentioned earlier. And then the rest of the gap is made up of savings programs and contingency plans, which resulted in another improvement of around about 40 million sequentially, quarter-on-quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jean. We expect for the fourth quarter also a further improvement of overall working capital performance, so a positive contribution. We expect somewhat stronger in the trade working capital, and maybe a slight, let's say, decrease from the other working capital. But net, we should see a further improvement there in fourth quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, limited, because, again, we are pushing sales in France into December. And so it's maybe a shift from October-November into December.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Andreas Heine. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Andreas Heine, UniCredit in Munich. The first question, again on Crop Protection. Mr. Berschauer, you mentioned that the environment has changed, but all the issues you mentioned, like weather or pre-buying in the first half and not using so much in the second half or the France effect seem to be timing issues. So looking forward in 2010, what do you think on a full-year base has changed in the environment in the Crop Protection business?</p>
          <p>And then a question on these pension assurance association payments Bayer has to do, as other German companies as well. These were 36 million in the third quarter; maybe more bankruptcies will come. So have you any clue how much it will be on a full-year base, and how you see this looking forward?</p>
          <p>On the financial side, the U.S. dollar usually has also a positive impact on net debt. Could you elaborate how much this is if the U.S. dollar stands at year-end where we are right now at 150? And could you elaborate a little bit more on the litigations? You have booked up to 200 million during this year on the litigation. Is it additional provisions, or is that also at this stage already cash out? And is there anything what you can give us an idea how this is going forward? Do we have to assume that the risk in especially HealthCare are rising and that these 200 million are what it will be at the end and is something we have to have in mind also for the coming years? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, let's start with CropScience and the environment in CropScience of the coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Heine, you know the CropScience business very well, and I think you can appreciate that since Q3 clearly is not, let's say, a trend. I think we explained the situation what happens this year good enough.</p>
          <p>So you asked the question what are we expecting for 2010? First of all, there is no logical reason to believe that the medium- and long-term fundamentals to our business have changed. So still we have increasing world population. We have this fluctuation. We have this climate change impacting negatively the production in agriculture. Then we have the renewables, which also is a further demand, and commodities stockpiled in '011. So the fundamentals are still positive, and the arable land is limited, as you know. So there is no reason to &#x2013; I see absolutely no change in terms of mid- and long-term fundamentals for our business. So I'm still absolutely positive.</p>
          <p>So talking about 2010, what are we expecting? Always under the assumption of normal average weather conditions, we are expecting that the Crop Protection market next year should grow in the range of 2 to 3%, seeds and traits more than 2 to 3%, maybe in the range of 5 to 6, but the majority of our business is Crop Protection and Environmental Science. So we are expecting that the market should grow in this dimension, and our ambition is &#x2013; and this is our target &#x2013; to outgrow this market and to outperform the Boston market. So that's our present assumption to the best of our knowledge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then about pension, the U.S. dollar impact on net debt, and litigation cash out, Klaus K&#xFC;hn will answer your question on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mr. Heine. We have reserved so far roughly &#x20AC;35 million per quarter for the German pension assurance association, and this assumption was based &#x2013; or this was based on the assumption that the rate of insolvencies in the second half would continue at the rate of insolvencies for the first half of the year, which we do not know yet. So either we have an underaccrual or an overaccrual, depending on the insolvencies in the second half in Germany. So we will learn that only by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>With regard to sensitivity to currency fluctuations on our debt, roughly a 1% change in the &#x2013; we have roughly, let's say, 25% of our net debt in dollars and 10% roughly in yen and renminbi, so you could say that roughly a 1% change in the U.S. dollar would mean a 25 million change in the debt in euros. And with regard to renminbi and yen, that would mean roughly 10 to 12 million euros in change of the value, 1% change.</p>
          <p>With regard to the litigations, these were on one hand new provisions, but on the other hand we also have current payments ongoing, and all these accruals so far all the payments have been solely related to defense costs. So it does not include or it does not relate to any penalties or things like that. And if we accrue, we accrue according to the best knowledge for the foreseeable defense costs in the future, which last for, let's say, currently probably at best mainly due to the LLRICE situation, for probably a horizon of what we expect that could last, maybe 25 &#x2013; or 24 to even 30 months. That's currently probably roughly the horizon.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Craig Maxwell. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Craig Maxwell at ICAP Securities. Three questions, first one on the EINSTEIN extension study, can you give us some indication of when you're going to find out from ASH whether or not you'd been accepted as one of the six late-breakers. Novartis are very, very confident they're going to get Gleevec in there. And then just also on EINSTEIN extension, can you confirm that some of that data has been included in the complete response file?</p>
          <p>And then second question, just on the Animal Health, some of your competitors &#x2013; your major competitors, basically &#x2013; there's been some merger activity there. And they're now with &#x2013; got quite substantial market shares, particularly obviously if Sanofi and Merck go ahead. Is that a concern to you? I mean, how would you combat having such big competitors suddenly come into that market in that way?</p>
          <p>And then lastly just &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; one more question on CropScience. I know we've talked a lot about it, but just a simple question, I guess. Could you give us a bit of color as to why even at constant exchange rates the hit to earnings is so, so much harder than the hit to sales? I mean, I know it's going to be harder, but it just seems a bit excessive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig, sorry. We missed a significant part of your last question on CropScience. Would you mind repeating it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. It's on basically just a bit of color on why even at constant exchange rates, the hit on earnings is so much harder than the hit on the sales. It's bound to be harder, but it just seems excessively harder.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with HealthCare and our other EINSTEIN extensions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me just begin by reminding everybody what this is. The EINSTEIN extension data is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial that evaluates Xarelto 20 milligrams compared to placebo in the long-term secondary prevention of recurrent VTE. The study includes over 1,000 patients who have completed either six or 12 months treatment with either Xarelto or a Vitamin K antagonist. It is our plan to submit that data to ASH. I will tell you we're very hopeful that it will be accepted as a late-breaker, but there's no guarantees. But we are also hopeful the data will give all of you further confidence in respect to the long-term safety of Xarelto and provide further evidence for the medical need of secondary prevention to treat recurrent VTEs.</p>
          <p>As to our complete response, let me make it clear that &#x2013; firstly that J&amp;J is very confident, as you heard from Mr. Wenning that they will meet the end-of-year date to respond to the agency, and of course at that time the agency may well request other data that we have available to us, including the EINSTEIN extension data.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Animal Health, sorry. Craig, this is a situation we will monitor. It's too early to say what the impact is, but suffice to say this is a significant change in the market, and we have to watch that very carefully. Of course we will probably see a phase to begin with where there's quite a bit of disruption. That may actually represent an opportunity for us, but we obviously have to also understand what the long-term implications are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as we mentioned, the explanation is a rather simple one. We have the majority of our costs in euros. For example production, we have a lot of production activities in Europe. Fortunately we have some activities in India and China and also in U.S. And secondly, in terms of R&amp;D costs, again, we have the major &#x2013; the big part of our R&amp;D cost in euros.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Florent Cespedes. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Florent Cespedes, Exane BNP Paribas. Thank you for taking my questions. First, some unrelated questions. First one on Betaferon. Can you give us your view on the U.S. market trends for any Extavia launch? Is the uten performance right now the good benchmark for next year for Betaferon in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Xarelto, could you remind us your expectations for the sales for 2009?</p>
          <p>And two quick financial questions. Could you remind us your dividend policy? Are you committed to at least flat dividends? And the last one, the tax rate for 2009 following the high Q3, could you give us an update on the full-year guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then, let's start with Betaferon and Xarelto, Arthur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Florent, it's far too early to predict the impact of Extavia in the U.S. We've really not seen any real activity from Novartis in the U.S. But perhaps it's worth reminding people that if we look at the impact that it's had in Europe, with the exception of Germany, it's been rather modest. And I also want to make it clear that if you're looking at the performance in the third quarter in Europe, that's primarily impacted by timing of our tender business in Russia and not the impact of Extavia.</p>
          <p>So I would summarize that to date, the impact of Extavia has been modest, with the exception of Germany. And we remain fully committed to our guidance for 2009, which is that we will come in at 3 to 5% growth. And as far as next year is concerned, let's wait and see. But certainly if I was to summarize 2009, we feel we've contained the impact of Extavia, perhaps better than we had originally expected.</p>
          <p>Coming now to Xarelto, again with Xarelto we remain very pleased with the progress and are reconfirming our guidance, which is full-year sales in 2009 of between 20 and &#x20AC;30 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, before Klaus K&#xFC;hn starts to take your question about taxes, on dividends you know that our guidance is to pay out 30 to 40% of our core EPS. The range gives us of course a certain flexibility. Last year, we paid &#x2013; or let's say this year for last year we paid &#x2013; our payout was 35% of core EPS. Of course it's, as always in autumn, it's a little bit too premature to talk about our dividend today. And our policy and let's say our final dividend for 2009 depends on the full-year results and also our forecast for 2010. Our dividend proposal will be announced on February next year, during our conference call in February. So taxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our tax expense rate in the third quarter was roughly 35%; year to date it was something like 31%, so it has always reverted to the base effect for more days in Q3. We maintained our guidance of a full-year tax expense ratio of roughly 30%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Rim Bennani from Exane BNP Paribas. Actually just a few follow-up questions on Crop Protection, I hope you don't mind. First you point still at higher Q4 sales. Can you maybe highlight for us the grounds for that and what you expect in term of fulfillments for Brazil, as I guess it also contributes for a higher share in Q4 versus Q3 as per the rest of the industry?</p>
          <p>Also, can you highlight as well where you still see high inventory levels post-Q3 by region for the Crop Protection business?</p>
          <p>And finally, I think you've been quoted on Bloomberg talking about 2 to 3% higher prices next year for Crop Protection. Can you maybe shed some light on the grounds for higher prices next year versus this year? Is this a mix issue for you, or is it broad price rises for the industry? And as well, can you maybe remind us if your 2 to 3% growth for Crop Protection next year for the industry is based on pricing only? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So all your questions are related to CropScience. Mr. Berschauer -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First question was Q4 sales, so as Mr. Wenning pointed out, we are expecting for Q4 higher sales compared to Q4 last year. This should mean that our plan should be driven mainly by Latin America, and here specifically by Brazil. And secondly, our Q4 performance last year, and in Asia Pacific we are expecting a solid performance. So that's the explanation why we believe Q4 should be higher than Q4 last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you expect Brazil to grow in Q4 basically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not only Brazil, but Brazil is the key driver.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Secondly, inventory level last year, and again that was the main reason for the excellent start into 2009, channel inventories almost were zero. It was at least very low. This year there are clearly inventories I would say overall more or less on average, so on average compared to years before.</p>
          <p>To make one thing clear, I was not saying that we are expecting price increases of 2 to 3% next year. I was saying that we are &#x2013; we believe that the Crop Protection market would grow by 2 to 3%, market growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Martin Flueckiger. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen, Martin Flueckiger from Helvea in Zurich. Just two small questions, remaining questions from the extensive discussion we've had so far on the chemicals side your business. Firstly, if I understood you correctly, the currency impact on group EBITDA was around 50 million. Can you confirm this, and could you also give some guidance on what the split was between the various businesses, particularly for the chemicals side? Then secondly, special items, according to your press release, restructuring items will fade out at the end of this year. I was just wondering what the outlook was for restructuring measures and particularly costs for BMS in 2010? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, your question related to currency, the currency impact and the impact, Klaus K&#xFC;hn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall, we had for the Group in the third quarter a positive sales impact of 50 million, but a negative EBITDA impact of also 50 million, so plus 50 on sales, minus 50 on EBITDA. And it was &#x2013; if you have the split &#x2013; the HealthCare and CropScience label suffered with regard to EBITDA, around 30 million in HealthCare and even 35 million in Crops, and BMS had a slight positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps in regard to special items, our guidance for the running restructuring program was 250 million at the beginning of the year. Now we added in our guidance &#x2013; in our recent guidance &#x2013; additional 100 million. So our best estimation for the time being is 350 million on restructuring projects, and the major impact of the additional 100 million comes from CropScience. We are going to restructure substantially our production side and institute. So this is the major impact which we expect to happen the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And on the other side, we also announced today that we will finish our running restructuring programs by the end of this year. So we do not expect &#x2013; well, we do not have in mind &#x2013; additional new restructuring programs for 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Luisa Hector from Credit Suisse. I've just got a follow-up question on Betaseron and the ex U.S. So you've explained about the Russian tenders, but I just wonder if you can give us any more color on the sales or market share in Germany and whether that has stabilized or you're still continuing to lose share there, and whether there are any other significant tenders in the ex-U.S. markets to be aware of?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is on the Pharma costs, coming back to the earlier comments you made on SG&amp;A. So you pointed out this significant improvement in the SG&amp;A. Just wondered how you'd managed to achieve that and why it isn't sustainable? Because I think you're saying that the costs will come back in line &#x2013; or the SG&amp;A costs will come back in line. And given that you've had the improvement in SG&amp;A and I think in the press release, it ties in, you're talking about the higher cost of goods and R&amp;D, so any color on that and the ongoing trends there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. All related to HealthCare. Arthur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Luisa, first of all, coming back to the European situation, as I mentioned, it was &#x2013; essentially the biggest impact in the quarter was the Russian tender. To put that in perspective, we sold 20 million in Q2 in Russia and only 1 million in quarter three. So I think that accounts for a lot of the weakness you're seeing in Europe.</p>
          <p>If we look at Germany specifically, we believe that the penetration of Extavia has stabilized at about 15% of total Betaseron. Let's see how that continues as we move into next year. But the German situation is also complicated by parallel trade, Luisa, which makes it a little difficult to really understand what's happening. With the weakened pound versus the euro, we're seeing a significant level of parallel trade, which again somewhat distorts even the performance in Germany.</p>
          <p>To respect to Pharma costs, I think I made it very clear that we made a commitment in the second quarter call that we would have a very tight control over all discretionary expense, particularly promotion and information expense, until we were comfortable that our markets were recovering. Those markets, both in Pharma and Consumer, clearly showed signs of recovery in the third quarter. So it's really more a return to normal than anything else that you can expect in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But maybe to just again help put this in total perspective, we are reaffirming our commitment to towards 28%, and if you look at that and try to model from third to fourth quarter you can expect margins in Bayer Schering Pharma to be broadly in line, but the dilution comes in our Consumer businesses, where we traditionally see higher seasonal expenses reflecting the flu season. But also, as I've again reiterated, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of the strengthening consumption we're seeing, particularly in the U.S., so that we have good momentum as we exit the year and start 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Christian Faitz. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Christian Faitz from Oppenheim. Couple of questions on CropScience and then one on MaterialScience. In CropScience, you mentioned in your release that both insecticides and herbicides were affected by lower product prices. Do the glyphosate issue, at the glyphosate producers &#x2013; or have they had any impact on pricing of the non-glyphosate products in any way. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that?</p>
          <p>Second in CropScience, you mentioned cotton, that you also saw some pressure in cotton products. Have cotton markets shifted somewhat in terms of geography, or have end markets faltered? What is the problem in cotton, and is that also affecting your seeds business on top of I guess the pesticide business?</p>
          <p>And then in MaterialScience, inferring from today's strongest conference call, you are quite confident that the positive momentum in MaterialScience will carry well into 2010, i.e., you clearly don't see the second dip of the double dip scenario materializing. What makes you so confident considering that the car industry benefited so nicely from scrapping incentives this year, which might not repeated next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. CropScience again, Fried.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with nonselective herbicide, glyphosate was in no way a significant or dramatic deterioration of the market price. So in terms of our portfolio, one could assume that our glufosinate, which is in the same segment, would have been impacted, but fortunately glufosinate is used to &#x2013; if you have really significant resistant problems with glyphosate. So fortunately we are in a different situation. And the impact of this &#x2013; deteriorated reduced glyphosate plays on the other herbicides is really limited.</p>
          <p>Second question, cotton. The cotton acreage in the United States decreased over the past year significantly, from 13, 14 million acres to around about 10. So we have a significant reduction in the United States. This was also driven by reduced commodity prices. If you watched the commodity prices this year, we have seen a significant decrease. Fortunately in the last weeks, we have some recovery. In terms of our business, our cotton business in the United States, acreage is reduced, that's correct, but fortunately we improved market share. So our business performed very well this year in the United States because we were able to grow the market share in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And MaterialScience, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Christian, I guess nobody knows what's going to happen next year. And we tend to limit our guidance one quarter at a time in MaterialScience, as you know.</p>
          <p>I'll just say a couple of things. One of the strong areas that we're seeing which is now more than a quarter of our business is the strength of the Asian markets, which are not so dependent upon automotive specifically. I think it's quite difficult to forecast, but if you look across all the industry segments we're facing at the moment, most of them have been making reasonably good progressive recovery. And next year we will see whether that continues, but the sort of Cash for Clunkers type subsidy program really only affects about 18% of our sales. So it's not a take-it-or-leave-it part of our portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just if I might come back on the glyphosate issue, I fully understand that you're not affected by the glyphosate pricing discussion in itself as a non-glyphosate producer. But I mean, does this affect discussions with your partners in terms of, I can get glyphosate much cheaper, and if I apply it twice, I might even save the glufosinate application, or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very good question, but so far we are not facing the situation. And again, the big issue, or the big advantage of glufosinate is that this compound is able to overcome the resistance. So even though glyphosate is extremely cheap now, and even if you would increase the application, right, by 30 or 50%, honestly who cares? So but if you really have a resistance problem, then you need a different chemistry.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, fully understood.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Andrew Benson. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrew Benson from Citi. Most of my questions have been answered. Just &#x2013; and I don't want to harp on too much about CropScience, but another question. You talked about price weakness in Brazil. And I wondered what it was that you believed has provoked that price weakness and if it's got much further to go and whether that will have an impact &#x2013; whether it could spill out into other regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the only question. So, okay, the situation in Brazil is as following. First of all, it's a very strong competition because the whole industry has had a very good first and second quarter, and now each company is basically concentrating on Brazil. But the main driver here clearly is currency. So as you know, the Brazilian real is very strong. The costs are &#x2013; the majority of the costs are in local currencies. So the big question for the pharmas is now really based on this currency ratio, whether they are really able to make money. And so that's basically the main driver presently; it's really currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mr. Chris Raymond. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Yeah, Chris Raymond with Robert Baird. Question regarding Nexavar. Last quarter, you guys broke down in pretty good detail some of the other geographies, and I wonder if you could delineate maybe in more detail China and Japan specifically? That'd be great. And also if you have an update or any indication from the Chinese government on the National Drug Reimbursement List (sic] [National Reimbursement Drug List], that'd be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Chris. I guess no good deed goes unpunished. Because we gave you the data last quarter, I guess we better give you the data again for this quarter. And if you start with total revenues in the quarter of 161 million, 40 million of that was in the U.S., 77 million of that was in Europe, Asia Pacific was 36 million, of which Japan was 21 million and China 10 million.</p>
          <p>As to reimbursement, I can't really say anything more than we continue to work with the Chinese government. What I would say, as one of the leading, if not the leading pharmaceutical company in China, we have a very good relationship with the Chinese government, and I'm reasonably hopeful that ultimately in the not-too-distant future we will see some progress in the reimbursement fund with Nexavar. But again, no guarantees.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Jessica Li from Goldman Sachs. I have another question with regard to Nexavar. Could you please comment on the price increases versus volume growth for Nexavar in the quarter in various regions? If there is any price increase, could you please comment on when it was taken and by how much and what is the effective price increase? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jessica, in the sentiment of previous comments that no good deed goes unpunished, we are not going to give you that specific detail in terms of the price volume. But I will comment on the U.S., because we've done that historically. We took an additional price increase in July for Nexavar in the U.S. of 10%, but that's all we're going to comment on our &#x2013; Jessica, as you can appreciate, we end up getting into a lot more detail than necessarily is helpful. Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Ronald K&#xF6;hler. Please state your name, company name, followed by your question. Go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. My first question is on restructuring. Mr. Wenning, you stated that all the, let's say, normal restructuring programs are running out end of 2009, if I'm correctly understood. Does that mean actually &#x2013; in bio MaterialScience obviously there is still significant overcapacities. Is there not any need to do something, or how should we understand that? Should we understand that you're just business as usual restructuring, meaning small amounts and not being bigger, and how is your policy of going along with this restructuring?</p>
          <p>Second question is on the emerging market development in Pharma. Obviously we see a very, very nice phased growth in Pharma and Consumer Health. I'd like to a little bit understand &#x2013; I believe today obviously emerging markets have a lower profitability but you're building up economics of scale, and so I guess you get an over-proportion of let's say earnings swing in the emerging market. Is that my right understanding, or it's still, let's say, the build-up process is actually phased that these sales expansion is going with unchanged lower margin, or how is your outlook to get profitability up in emerging markets?</p>
          <p>And last question also to Pharmaceuticals. In 2010 &#x2013; and I'm potentially a little bit early to ask &#x2013; but should we take care of, let's say, significant higher R&amp;D expenses for the big Phase III trials or launch costs or whatever, or let's say, take it a little bit different, should we be aware of any, let's say, significant lower cost than historically due to these front up investments, or what is your kind of view on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would like to state just that, Mr. K&#xF6;hler, you understood me very well. I can repeat what you summarized. At the end of this year, we certainly accelerated due to the market situation. We accelerated certain initiatives in our restructuring programs, and the programs called rebar new and the integration of the Schering acquisition. We will come to an end at the end of this year. And you are also right, what we are going to see in the future, our usual restructuring, which will always happen, but we don't have in mind for the time being an completely new restructuring program in one of our sub-groups.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That means also no major closures to be expected in MaterialScience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No major closure impacting &#x2013; yes, you are absolutely right. No major closures impacting MaterialScience. You know that we have mothballed certain capacity. When do we restart this capacity is &#x2013; depends on the market development over the last couple of months, but no major closure, you are absolutely right. Then you talked about HealthCare. Arthur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ronald, as you know we're very proud of the fact that we have one of the higher percentages of HealthCare companies in what we call the Emerging Seven, which is Russia, Mexico, Brazil, China, Korea, India, Turkey. We have approximately 14% of our sales from these regions. They are showing very strong growth, and I'm pleased to report all these business are profitable, and whilst they are dilutive in terms of our overall profile, with the increase in scale we are seeing not only good progress in the top line, but we're also improving our margins as well. So I think over time these businesses are not only going to be a significant driver to top-line growth, but will actually be even less dilutive to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>And as far as your question on R&amp;D expenses, rest assured you don't have to worry about that. We are targeting R&amp;D at approximately 15% in 2010, very much in line with 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that be the same &#x2013; the launch costs are similar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry? Launch costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, launch costs. Should we expect any kind of significant launch cost in 2010 or any SG&amp;A expenses going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I missed that part of your question. No, I guess you're talking about the prospects regarding Xarelto, but that will not have a material impact in 2010. And regardless, it's our intention to reallocate resources from some of our mature products into our launch products. So net-net, you should see no significant shift in either selling and general admin expenses on R&amp;D on a going-forward basis.</p>
