          <p>I'd like to welcome the media who are listening in and remind people that we are live on our website. I would also like to remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements are given as of the date of the call and involve risks and uncertainties. A number of factors and assumptions were applied in the formulation of such statements, and actual results could differ.</p>
          <p>For additional information with respect to forward-looking statements, factors and assumptions, we direct you to our news release and our most recent Form 10-K. Also, today's news release, which is posted on our website, includes a reconciliation of certain non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS measures.</p>
          <p>So, I'll now turn the call over to Bill Doyle for some comments, and then we'll go to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, Denita, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we discuss PotashCorp's third quarter performance and our outlook for the period ahead.</p>
          <p>The current market reflects a certain dichotomy in the global potash business. Our sales volumes in North American buyers set a third quarter record as fertilizer distributors increased purchases and farmers focused on the fertility of their soils to capitalize on favorable crop economics.</p>
          <p>Strong Brazilian demand also was evident in our results, with shipments reflecting the expectation of record soybean and corn acres in that country.</p>
          <p>This strength was offset by delays in the settlement of new contracts with China and India, where decline in volumes had an impact on our potash gross margin for the quarter. Our other nutrients also experienced a decline in gross margin compared to last year's third quarter, although our diversified product offering in phosphate and our ammonia business proved to be areas of strength for the company.</p>
          <p>As a result, we delivered third quarter earnings of $0.74 per share, which trailed the $0.94 per share in the same period of last year. In a view of current conditions, we recently revised our full year earnings guidance, primarily reflecting lower volume expectations for the potash market in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>While the mounting pressure on global grain supplies and the strength of crop economics are driving strong demand in market-oriented regions, they have not translated into full engagement from China and India as quickly as we previously estimated.</p>
          <p>In North America, demand remains robust, with corn and soybean harvests advancing at a near-record pace and farmers moving to take advantage of the extended fall application window. As we speak with our customers, especially those in areas removed from severe drought conditions of this summer, we hear reports of some farmers cranking up the dial to ensure their soils contain the necessary nutrients before the upcoming planting season.</p>
          <p>Dealers are placing new orders to ensure they have the potash they need, although we continue to see a desire to build only enough inventory to meet near-term requirements. Still we anticipate another strong quarter ahead and believe second half domestic deliveries are likely to establish a new record.</p>
          <p>We are seeing a similar situation in Brazil where corn and soybean planting is in full swing and farmers are drawing down fertilizer supplies which have been delivered at a record pace over the past number of months.</p>
          <p>While competitive pressure has resulted in lower prices in this market, demand is expected to remain strong through the balance of this year. Farmers in Brazil are preparing for a big safrinha corn planting in early 2013, and distributors are trying to spread shipments over periods that historically have been less active in an effort to reduce port congestion.</p>
          <p>The question in the potash market and in our outlook for the balance of the year continues to be the timing of new supply contracts with China and India. China's potash consumption has been strong, but it has been meeting its recent needs through domestic production, inventory withdrawals, and rail deliveries. It's reliance on these sources is expected to reduce China's seaborne requirements in the second half of 2012. But it cannot solely rely on these sources on an ongoing basis, especially as it works to keep pace with its agronomic and food production needs.</p>
          <p>New contract negotiations have been constructive and ongoing, and we anticipate shipments will resume prior to the end of this calendar year. Importantly, we believe that draw on China's inventories should lead to increased sales volumes to this market in 2013.</p>
          <p>The situation in India is different as there are number of near-term challenges that make it difficult to determine how the balance of the year will play out. It is commonly accepted that food inflation remains a real issue in that country; and that India's current fertility practices, if maintained hold significant implications for lower long-term crop yields. We know that proper soil fertility can improve agricultural production. What we cannot predict is how or when India will address this issue.</p>
          <p>India has a system of subsidies that distorts its domestic fertilizer market, putting a higher priority on nitrogen over the scientifically proven need for balanced crop nutrition. Some have suggested that the current contract impasse is due to high global prices for potash, which have caused demand destruction, but the numbers simply don't bear that out.</p>
          <p>Since 2008, the price India pays for potash has declined 22%, while the average price it pays for urea is down 16%. If given the India's misguided subsidy policies its farmers have seen potash prices climb by more than 200% while urea prices have remained flat.</p>
          <p>For a farmer trying to put food on the table, making a short-term financial decision even one that has negative long-term agronomic consequences becomes easy. This has slowed the potash market in that country, but we knew that nutrient deficient soils put yields at risk; poor fertility practices and contract delays cannot go on indefinitely.</p>
          <p>We are encouraged that the call for change in India is growing louder. India's private sector fertilizer industry is drawing more attention to the importance of taking steps to improve nutrient balances, because they know the nutritional requirements of over 200 million Indians are simply not being met. We believe this mounting pressure coupled with the engagement of other key markets, including China, will provide an incentive for the Indian government to address its fertilizer policy and stimulate farmer engagement in 2013.</p>
          <p>Other Asian countries continued to demonstrate strong demand and represented the largest percentage of sales volumes for Canpotex in the third quarter, although competitive pressures have led to lower prices. Strong economics for crops grown in this region are expected to support healthy demand for potash.</p>
          <p>Total volumes to this market will fall short of the record levels in 2011, but we anticipate year-end inventories for 2012 will be well below levels at the close of last year. Based on these conditions, we have lowered our forecast for 2012 global potash shipments to approximately 50 million tonnes to 52 million tonnes and have reduced our own sales volume guidance for the full year to 7.6 million tonnes to 8.3 million tonnes.</p>
          <p>Given these expectations, we now forecast full year earnings of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, an estimate which includes $0.39 per share impact of our second quarter Sinofert impairment charge.</p>
          <p>We are well aware of the realities that are having an impact on our industry today. But we believe that our business operates on a long-term continuum and we know that capturing the greatest value for our assets requires thinking beyond this quarter or this year. That means sometimes accepting greater short-term variability. This can be frustrating to investors and we understand that. We are shareholders too. But as many of our long-term investors know, building a potash business can't be timed to swings in demand. This fact has been proven over many decades.</p>
          <p>It will take a little time before we can fully turn loose our horses and demonstrate the full capabilities and value of our potash expansion program. That is the reality of our business when you consider the capital and the time commitments required to construct new capacity.</p>
          <p>While we expect demand to rebound significantly in 2013 and our sales volumes to rise; we will face a temporary decline in our Canpotex allocation as the tonnes we received from Esterhazy revert to Mosaic.</p>
          <p>We anticipate this will impact first half offshore sales, but expect our allocation will increase as we prove out our new capacity, starting with Cory, which we are positioning ourselves to complete during the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>Our potash system has needed and strategically intended surge capacity, which represents tremendous opportunity as demand grows. The flipside of that is that it requires us to shutdown capacity when the market slows so as not to destroy value.</p>
          <p>Like we did in the first quarter of 2012, we recently took steps to address the near-term supply imbalance by notifying our employees of inventory-related downtime at our Lanigan and Rocanville facilities during the fourth quarter and early first quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>As we refine our estimates for next year, we anticipate our operational capability will be approximately 12.5 million tonnes. Given our strategy of matching supply to demand that will likely require us to make additional curtailment decisions even in a robust marketplace.</p>
          <p>While we remain committed to a patient approach in growing our sales volumes in a responsible manner, that doesn't mean the opportunity for shareholders is like some carrot on a stick that is just out of reach.</p>
          <p>We believe we are in an enviable position today and for years to come. As other companies evaluate or begin to plan for new capacity, our growth story is nearly paid in full. We are almost 80% complete on our potash capital commitments. With our annual capital expenditures forecast to decline in 2013, we expect to have a greater ability to generate free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Beyond the potential we see in potash, we will also have more nitrogen capacity which should be evident in our nitrogen gross margin in the first quarter of 2013. We are taking steps to reward our long-term shareholders including the most recent increase in our dividend announced in September. That was our third adjustment since the beginning of 2011, bringing the cumulative dividend increase to more than 500%.</p>
          <p>We continue to explore ways to maximize and return value to our shareholders through dividends, opportunities in our potash business and share repurchases. We will do this as we have in the past with a focus on the long-term and understanding of the needs of all of our stakeholders. By building a company that serves our investors, customers, communities and employees, we can increase our value to all of the people we serve.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today by our management team and we would be happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today comes from Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Bill, many investors are concerned that several potash producers are becoming less disciplined. I was wondering what your thoughts of this are right now? And what is the risk of this in your mind going forward as we see the industry significantly increase brownfield capacity over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Joel, what I'd say to you is that, in softer markets when volumes are down, you will get people that get a little bit nervous and it's just a function of people scrambling for business and as the business gets more robust and volumes return they seem to calm down. So, we've been doing this for a little while and I can tell you that it inevitably occurs during these times, I just think it's a function of the marketplace with the overall pressure on volumes in 2012.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez of Lazard Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Bill, quick question, I mean, one of your fellow Canpotex member recently intimated that prices might have to go down in China in order for a contract to get done. Where do you stand on that? And what &#x2013; what's your view on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have actually negotiations going on right this week with the Chinese and Canpotex folks too. And we just don't comment on prices &#x2013; what prices might do during negotiations. We just don't think that's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mark Connelly of CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill. As we think about your larger system and the downtime you're going to take, should we expect you to take downtime differently in a way that's going to affect the variability of your cost to a greater or lesser extent? Obviously, you take Lanigan down a lot, and that has a big effect because it's a low-cost facility. But as your system gets bigger, is your approach to downtime going to change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, what I'd say is the downtime now takes into consideration the expansions and then a need to prove out some of the expansions. So, you have some short-term variability.</p>
          <p>Over the long term, obviously, I'd say that it would behoove us to operate our lowest-cost facilities. And you're right with Lanigan is one of our lowest-cost facilities. So, there's a short-term anomaly here as we bring on these expansions and prove out the expansions under the Canpotex formula. But over the long term, I think we'll do what obviously is in the best interest of our cost profile.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I'd say, Mark, is that we are reverting the Esterhazy tonnes to Mosaic at the end of this year. Those tonnes have proved especially this year, to be expensive tonnes for us, so our cost profile should improve as we eliminate those high-cost tonnes from our mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Prospect Global announced a deal sweep with the Chinese. Is there a growing ability by these smaller players to create mines quicker and get &#x2013; gain share from larger players? Is there a concern in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I saw that, David, and it's just another promoter. No. The answer to your question is no. They can't do it any quicker than anybody else. They can talk about it faster than other people, but we know that deposit and it's very low ore grade. It has a lot of challenges, it's going to be expensive to build out. And the comment that they had signed this 0.5 million tonne contract with the Chinese, believe me, there are all sorts of outs for the Chinese in that contract. I understand, if they don't produce significant quantities by 2015, that the Chinese can get out of the contract altogether. So, this is just another promoter. And if you look at the economics of the business today, there's no return on that investment. So, we don't pay much attention to it.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon, Bill. You talked about the summer refill programs and dealers getting ready for the fall, but what we've been hearing was that dealer inventories are still quite low. So, can you shed some light on this refill program and talk about each nutrient like NPK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, P.J., I'll have Stephen Dowdle comment. He'll talk about potash first and then talk a little bit about nitrogen and phosphate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. P.J., in the third quarter, we saw quite robust demand for &#x2013; on our dealer system, and basically this was the result of a couple of things. One, when we ended the previous fertilizer year on June 30, inventories were very, very depleted and as we began the new fertilizer year, very positive crop &#x2013; the prospects for a positive crop economics. And we saw from &#x2013; during the quarter, very strong desire to position tonnes for fall application and to start rebuilding the supply pipeline.</p>
          <p>And in our results, we sold 950,000 tonnes in the third quarter, which was an all-time record for us. And the mood in the market right now and particularly since we've had some timely rains here over the past four weeks, the mood is quite positive with this moisture and the prospects with an early harvest, that we will have an open and extended fall application period is for very good fall application; the demand is certainly there.</p>
          <p>And as we end the year, the demand here in the fourth quarter will depend, in part, upon the weather and how open the season is when snowfall comes. But all indications that we're hearing is very positive demand. This is translating as well into the phosphate and nitrogen markets. With the early harvest, there's been an early &#x2013; an earlier-than-usual demand for the phosphates. There's logistical challenges on the river with low water levels, which has people concerned, but the demand is there and producers are struggling to keep up with the demand right now.</p>
          <p>The nitrogen markets have been unusually stable, trading in a relatively narrow range and this is again a reflection on good demand in the Midwest for nitrogen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, P.J., I might just add, there was a lot of talk and some things written about P&amp;K applications being severely down because of the drought this year and that just hasn't been true. And if you look at the biology of crops and when they have uptake of P&amp;K, if you have &#x2013; any type of agronomic background here, we knew that, that just wasn't factual. So, we're seeing that proved out here with the current demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, this is Ted Drangula sitting in for Vincent. I guess, one question on your global shipment outlook for 2012 and 2013. Obviously, you took down the range for this year, in the 50 million tonnes to 52 million tonnes. And then I guess, previously, you had said 56 million tonnes to 60 million tonnes for next year.</p>
          <p>Does the &#x2013; do you guys still think that the total demand for 2012 and 2013 combined is the same or is some of this a demand destruction or longer-term deferral issue, meaning what we're losing here in 2012 doesn't go into 2013, because those will be some pretty significant numbers for 2013 demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I &#x2013; I think, Ted, that &#x2013; first of all, I think I addressed the demand destruction comments. That's just not true. The prices are more affordable for potash today for people growing crops around the world than they've been in a very long time, so it isn't a question of demand destruction.</p>
          <p>We have had deferrals and we have had, obviously, the impact of some of the macro issues that are out there. I think the China and India delays are just going to put more pressure into the first quarter &#x2013; first half of 2013. We think it's going to be a robust recovery year. We have said 56 million tonnes to 60 million tonnes, we don't really come up with a final number here until early in the new year, but it's going to be a significant recovery year and that's just to be able to respond to these fundamentals of agriculture.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Historically, Canpotex and PotashCorp has restrained production in the interest of global potash pricing. As you build up toward 17 million tonnes, if it turns out that your tonnage because of slow growth of the market remains, I don't know, below 10 million tonnes, do you have to depreciate all of that additional capacity whether you use it or not, and is Potash comfortable having such a large amount of unused capacity relative to what it used to have in the old days when yours have soft demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, I'm going to tag-team you with that answer. I'll answer the first part and then get...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>... Wayne involved in the depreciation. But, first of all, I should just say to you that Canpotex has nothing to do with production decisions whatsoever. So to say Canpotex participates in restrained production, that's just crazy because we each make our decisions on our own at Canpotex as member companies. There's a debate as to how much capacity &#x2013; overhang of capacity that we'll have. And what I would say to you is that, I think, in the medium term, that we're going to be using much more of our capacity than a lot of people think. And if we get any type of recovery in the global economy, you're going to see the potash market really be very, very robust. So I don't think that we're going to have all this tremendous overcapacity that some are reporting in their particular write-ups. Wayne, you want to comment on depreciation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's very simple. We depreciate our potash capital on a unit of production basis, so it will basically be attached to the production levels that we have in a particular year. So we won't have to be eating that, Jeff, if we ever got to that unlikely scenario.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Bill just maybe a quick question on your previous response, you talked about a global recovery in emerging markets. I'm just going to trying to figure out what that means when we are already in an environment of record or close to record grain prices. And what we would we have to see with respect of farmer economics for demand to really come back next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Ben. It's really &#x2013; we talked about India and China markets that have a lot of government involvement in them. There are some &#x2013; when you have a lot of government involvement, you can do things that don't reflect the market and you can make decisions that, okay, we're going to delay potash importations even though we know it's ergonomically shortsighted.</p>
          <p>Anyways, policy &#x2013; maybe they're certainly pound foolish, especially when you have the number of undernourished people that exist and by the way India has the largest number of undernourished people in the world. So you're seeing a lot of pressure from the private sector, our customers, they're very concerned about this and rightly so, and so you will see a rebound in these government &#x2013; where you have government involvement in these &#x2013; in some of these large markets that are going to respond.</p>
          <p>And so when we look at return of India for example for next year, we have India, in our 2013 profile, at 5 million tonnes. Well, India was &#x2013; in 2010 was over 6 million tonnes. In 2009 they were over 6 million tonnes. The last two years, they have been down &#x2013; 2011 they were 4.2 million and 2012, our forecast, they are going to be about 3 million tonnes this year. So, significantly down and they were already behind the eight ball in terms of their nitrogen to potash ratio, tremendous imbalance in fertilizer.</p>
          <p>It affects grain production, it affects food production, and when you have a really difficult situation, a crying need, certainly in the case of India for better food production to address these nutritional challenges that they have, you just can't go on and keep pursuing that penny wise, pound foolish policy. So it's going to rebound and we think that it's just a matter of time.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, I wanted to go back to the Esterhazy reversion, and two questions there; one, on your Canpotex allocation, do you get the full benefit of proving out your expansions, because it's my understanding that some of your Canpotex ratings are above your effective capacity? And two, what's the trade-off between the lower cost you'll have next year by not having Esterhazy and the higher depreciation charge from your expansions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to tag-team you again with that answer. First of all, if you take Cory as an example, which will be the first mine that we will prove out, we're going to get the full benefit of the Cory expansion. So everything over and above what we had in our original entitlement we will get that full benefit. Same thing is true of Allan, same thing is true of Rocanville. So that's just the way the system works, Don, and as you know, the Canpotex process, if you prove out your capacity before midyear, before June 30, you get the benefit of that capacity in the second half of the year. So, if you can't get it done until the second half of the year, it doesn't effect until January 1 of the following year, but basically it's a six-month process that you benefit from if you are able to prove out your capacity during the first half of the year. Wayne, you want to comment on the second part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, we will give you better information in January when we put our guidance for 2013, but right now I would expect our cost per tonne in potash would come down with &#x2013; we're probably going to have a bias towards running Allan and Cory at a higher rate and not having the Esterhazy tonnes and the drop in the Esterhazy tonnes is going to more than offset any weighted average change across our mines and right now I would expect our cost per tonne to come down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Excuse me, just a little bit more on the cost side and managing the cost associated with that excess capacity, so if you are still in the position of 4 million to 5 million tonnes of excess capacity, should we be thinking about the kind of $150 to $160 per tonne, and does it make sense instead of doing a rotating shutdown in periods of lower demand to shutdown say just one mine instead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's operational issues, Jacob. First of all, to say we are going to have 4 million to 5 million tonnes of overhang, overcapacity is &#x2013; those are your words, not mine. I don't believe that, so &#x2013; and as this market recovers, we won't see anything like that. There are operational issues.</p>
          <p>When you close a mine at the depths that we operate, you have some issues keeping your operating panels open, your entry ways open, there is things that you have to take into consideration. There is a lot of pressure at 1,000 meters deep, and so you have to watch that.</p>
          <p>I think, as I said earlier, that you will see us &#x2013; and Wayne just commented &#x2013; have a bias towards Cory and Allan production in the short-term as we prove out these expansions, but over the long-term I think you will see us take a more historical approach to shutdowns where we would tend to operate our lowest cost mines in periods where we have shutdowns.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Bill, with regard to China, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks three issues that appear to be influencing demand there, namely rising domestic production, inventory de-stocking, and higher rail deliveries. I appreciate you are in negotiations right now, but to the extent you can I was wondering if you might be able to amplify a bit on each of those three to help us better understand maybe the relative importance of the three issues and how much they might have varied versus your prior expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is in terms of the domestic production, of course, Qinghai Salt Lake is the biggest producer in China and they are shutting down now for the winter season, they don't produce because their brine like freezes up and their equipment is very hard to operate during the winter months. So they will have some inventory there. I might have Stephen just comment, he follows these inventory positions fairly closely, but we know that they have been using that domestic production, they have been de-stocking. He can comment on overall inventory, as I said, and we know that the Russians have been railing potash into China. That works during periods where you don't have really robust demand. For spring season, it doesn't work. They definitely need seaborne imports and certainly as they grow and the market takes off again, they will need much more reliance on seaborne. Stephen, you want to comment on stocks, inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Kevin, in China right now &#x2013; and this is &#x2013; China is not really much different than what we're seeing in every large market around the world. What we're seeing here as we come to the close of 2012, we've seen lower inventories in all these major markets compared to where they were at the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>In China right now our estimate of inventories is approximately 2.8 million tonnes, but they're being about 1.3 million tonnes at the seaports. Qinghai Salt Lake have been about 1 million tonnes and then about 500,000 tonnes at inland warehouse <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:15) distribution. We expect there during the fourth quarter to be some draw down on these inventories, and we expect that as we enter January 1, 2013 that the situation will be pretty normal in terms of inventory levels in China.</p>
          <p>We also see right now in 2012, January to September, the imports are up about 17% and we've seen a trend here in the last couple of years of consumption in China to continue to grow and our view of that as we look back on 2012 that we are going to see that that consumption grew in 2012, and I think we are on a positive trend line and we expect to see that positive growth trend to continue in 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, Michael. The third quarter costs were up primarily. We were still feeling the effect of Tropical Storm Debby in White Springs. We were down about two extra weeks there and had some associated cost with that downtime. We had a 35-day turnaround in Geismar, and then, in the third quarter, we entered some difficult mining conditions in a new area, primarily with the some water issues and the depth of the ore. And we feel like we are working through those issues and hope to improve here later in the fourth quarter and into the new year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just want to get back to China for a brief second here. Bill, in the opening remarks, you were mentioning that you expect China &#x2013; there is a lot of confidence with respect to China contract relative to India especially and you expected volume to be better next year. I just wanted to know the reference point, I mean we only have 700,000 tonnes for the first half of this year. Typical Canpotex is about 1.1 million to 1.5 million tonnes. So when you are making that the context is relative to a typical year, like you're analyzing the 700,000 million to 1.4 million tonnes, that kind of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be some growth also, Paul. We expect China to be a little bit stronger next year overall, but yes, I would say you return to more normal. If you look at Canpotex in general, about 30% of the marketplace is Canpotex, and we see returning to that more normal trend line next year. So, if you add a little growth to that, it could be even a little bit better, but we'll see.</p>
          <p>We do feel more confident about the Chinese. Our conversations with the Chinese are very business oriented. They know they need the material and I think we're having very constructive discussions from the reports that I am getting this week and they are continuing. So we'll see where that ends up, but we're expecting something before the end of the year in China.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. In your press release, you highlight that you have roughly $10 per share in equity investments. I am not implying that the worst case scenario might happen again next year, but just theoretically speaking, if we run into an issue with India again and it doesn't seem like some of these equity investments are actually giving you a lot of control over the overall supply/demand environment, would you consider divesting some of these equity investments and doing a special dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you say we don't have much control over the equity investments, it depends on which one you're talking about. When you're a shareholder at the table, say, of SQM, you own almost a third of the company, does that give you some say of the equity investment? I think so. Should we get Board of Directors and having a seat at the table? So, I think there's some there.</p>
          <p>In terms of Jordan, we have operating and marketing control of Jordan with 28% of capacity. So I believe that gives us some degree of say in how APC operates. I think that, as I've said many times, that those investments are the second best potash assets in the world after our own. We don't own them to be investors. We own them with a long-term goal of having a majority position in each one. I've said many times, this doesn't happen overnight, but we think that they're very, very valuable part of our company, and it's more than just the monetary value.</p>

          <p>Hello, everyone. Just a question on Trinidad, just wanted to know were the interruptions over this past quarter anything different than kind of normal curtailments that we've seen kind of ongoing for the last couple of years? And with that perspective, are those curtailments something that we should consider to be like a permanent situation, is it lagging infrastructure or is there less available gas and what's marketed, what's happening there?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, Matthew. In Q3, we were impacted by about 40,000 tonnes of ammonia in Trinidad and 100,00 tonnes year-to-date, and I feel that for the full year we could approach 150,000 tonnes which is a bit more than we had in 2011. I expect a similar number for next year. What's happening is there's a lot of offshore maintenance on all the platforms and infrastructure. A real heavy reliability program by the gas producers and we expect that to tail-off at the end of next year, and then return to normal levels in 2014.</p>
