        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Debbie and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter and year-to-date operating results for fiscal year 2011 and February Sales Results call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Debbie. Good morning to everybody. This morning's press release reviews our second quarter of fiscal 2011 operating results for the twelve weeks ended February 13th and, of course, our February sales which ended Sunday, February 27th.</p>
          <p>As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 12-week second quarter of fiscal '011, for the quarter, earnings per share came in at $0.79, up 18% from last year's second quarter earnings per share of $0.67. As was noted in the press release, in last year's second quarter we had a $22 million or $0.03 cents a share charge that was recorded related to a change in the company's employee benefits. Excluding this charge, Q2 EPS last year would have been $0.70 and the 18% EPS increase would have been 13% on a more normalized basis.</p>
          <p>In looking at the year-over-year Q2 earnings comparison, there are just a few other items I'll quickly note here. As was in the case of Q1 year over year, with rising gas prices or gasoline operations were still profitable in Q2 this year but less so than in Q2 last year to the tune of about $0.02 a share, so that hurt us a little bit year over year. As was previously disclosed, we're taking a 4.9% pre-tax accrual in the second quarter to pay, pending court approval, some attorney's fees in the derivative suit.</p>
          <p>LIFO, it's back, after nine &#x2013; at least nine fiscal quarters with no LIFO charges and in fact, back in '09 all four quarters had LIFO credits. We recorded in Q2 here a $6 million pre-tax LIFO charge and based on the way things are looking, we'd expect more in the coming fiscal quarters.</p>
          <p>And lastly, currencies, foreign effects, many of the foreign currencies in the countries we operate have strengthened relative to the dollar year over year; and as compared to the U.S. dollar such that when we consolidate the profits by these foreign operations by converting such profits into U.S. dollars, this helped Q2 by approximately $0.02 a share. If you take those four items that I just mentioned, gasoline profitability, the $4.9 million accrual for legal fees, LIFO of $6 million and the FX benefit, added together, these four items collectively hit this year's Q2 EPS by approximately $0.02 a share.</p>
          <p>One other item of quick note, as I had mentioned in last quarter's conference call, effective the start of this fiscal year back in September, we began consolidating the results of our Mexico operations, our Mexico joint venture. Historically before this fiscal year, these operations were treated on the equity method investment method. Thus, we only reported 50% &#x2013; our 50% share of the joint venture's net income within the non-operating interest income and other line item on our income statement. Since the beginning of this fiscal year, we now fully consolidate the Mexico venture. In effect, it adds 2% to 3% to top line sales, assets and liabilities. 100% of the venture's financial statements are included in our P&amp;L and balance sheet and cash flow. And then the 50% portion held by our joint venture partner is then backed out at the bottom of our income statement to offset it, such that there's no effect to our bottom line or our earnings per share. It does, however, impact the discussion of the percentages of gross margin and SG&amp;A and the like, and earnings basis points and I'll point that out as I discuss our results in the next few minutes.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the second quarter, I reported total sales were up 11.4% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure was up 7%. For the quarter, as has been the case for several quarters now, both total sales and comp sales were impacted by gasoline price inflation and by the strengthening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year over year.</p>
          <p>On a comp basis, the reported 5% U.S. sales increase, if you exclude gas inflation, would have been 3%. The reported 12% international comp figure, assuming flat year over year FX rates, would have been plus 8% resulting in the total company comps which, again, we reported as plus 7%; excluding gas inflation and excluding FX would have been plus 4% for the company.</p>
          <p>In terms of the February &#x2013; the four-week month of February, which we're also reporting this morning, it's directionally similar to the quarter. Again, excluding gas inflation, the 6% reported U.S. comp would be plus 4% and the 14% reported international comp would be plus 7% in local currency. Such that excluding both gas inflation and FX, February's four-week reported comp number of 8% would be plus 5%. And again, for the month of February, this is what I will call the normalized plus 5% compares to a normalized plus 4% for the entire second quarter.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest that I will review this morning, our open activities and plans: after opening 8 new locations in Q1, we opened two new locations in Q2, one net. One is a new location in a suburb of Minneapolis, in Burnsville, Minnesota; and our second location in Vancouver, Washington, which is just north of the Oregon-Washington border, north of Portland. We also closed a unit in the quarter in San Marcos, California. This unit is being torn down and rebuilt on the same site. It will open again later this summer before the fiscal year end.</p>
          <p>Since Q2 end on February 13th, we have not opened any new locations but we'll open a third unit in Tucson, Arizona in mid-April, and our plans are for 14 buildings to open by fiscal &#x2013; an additional 14 buildings to open by fiscal year end, including the relocation of that San Marcos &#x2013; the reopening of the San Marcos site. All told, that would put our fiscal year 2011 opening schedule at 24 net new units. That would include 14 in the U.S., 3 in Canada, 5 in Asia, all of which are planned for our fourth quarter which starts in early May; and 2 in Australia, which would be our second and third units in Australia.</p>
          <p>Also this morning, I will briefly review our .com results, our membership trends and, again, talk about margins and SG&amp;A in the quarter; mention what we bought in terms of stock repurchase and a couple of other miscellaneous items.</p>
          <p>Okay, so on to a discussion of our quarterly results, sales for the quarter, as I mentioned, were $20.4 billion, up 11.4% from $18.4 billion a year earlier. And, again, our reported comp was 7%, which, of course, was benefited by the inflation and the FX. For the quarter, the 7% reported comp included &#x2013; resulted from a combination of an average transaction increase of plus 3% and an average frequency increase of about 3.5%.</p>
          <p>The frequency trend, by the way, during the past three calendar reporting months for December, January and February was basically 3.5%, 4.5% and 4% -- a little under 4%. And for the &#x2013; we're now going on to two plus years where the year over year frequency increases in 3% to 5% range on a year-over-year monthly basis, and that's after, as many of you know, after years of frequency figures in the, really, 0% to 2% range.</p>
          <p>For the February reporting month, much like the quarterly comps, our 8% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction increase of 4.2%. And again, that includes the FX benefit and the gas benefit. It would have been somewhere between 0.5% and 1% net of those two, and an average frequency increase of 4%.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, for the quarter, the Midwest, the LA and the San Diego regions were the strongest, followed by good showings in the Bay Area and the Southeast. The weakest U.S. region was Northeast. Of course, that was impacted by the ongoing inclement weather.</p>
          <p>Internationally, in local currencies, U.K. has been the weakest, as it has continued to be, about flat; with Canada and Taiwan in the mid singles and everywhere else &#x2013; all the other countries in the double-digit comp range, in local currency.</p>
          <p>For February, we've continued, again, to experience weather in different parts of the country. During February, there were impacts in Midwest, Texas, Northwest and Canada. We estimate that detriment to what we would have &#x2013; in terms of lost sales somewhere in the 0.5% to 1% range.</p>
          <p>On a regional and country basis for the month of February, U.S. regions with the strong results were the Midwest and all three California regions: Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego. I remind &#x2013; recall that San Diego region also includes not just the San Diego market but Colorado and Arizona. The weakest U.S. regions were the Northeast and the Northwest; again, both impacted by strange weather. Internationally in local countries, in local currencies, we're doing fine; Canada up high single digits and Korea and Japan in the teens.</p>
          <p>One quick comment on weather and its impact on our sales. I recently read an internet article about our comments on weather. While negative impact to our year-over-year sales increases, it's not really an issue because we had similar reasons a year earlier in discussing sales. We understand that. We were just trying to share with you what our operators look at in terms of what we felt we lost. Whenever you have the kind of weather we've had, some of those sales are not recoverable and we give our best guess &#x2013; our operators give us their best guess of what they lost which then Jim discounts a little bit and that's what we give you.</p>
          <p>Inflation in fresh foods continues in the low to mid single digits range and in food and sundries in the low single-digit range in the month of January. Looking ahead to March, March is a five-week sales reporting month. We'll have a full 35 selling days this year compared to 34 days last year. That's due to the timing of Easter, which is three weeks later on the calendar this year versus last year. Last year, Easter fell on April 4th, which this year it falls on the 24th. The March reporting period will end Sunday, April 3rd and we'll report on the 7th of April.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories by quarter, in terms of sales &#x2013; I'm sorry, for February. Within food and sundries, all subcategories were positive, ranging from plus 3% to plus 12% for the month with essentially a flat hard lines comp sales increase. The strongest subcategories within hard lines for the month of February were automotive, sporting goods and office.</p>
          <p>Majors, which is electronics overall, were negative. That's the offset to the other areas. The big dollar negatives were in computers and other miscellaneous electronics like audio and what have you, which were overall weaker, both in terms of average selling price and units.</p>
          <p>The one positive note within that negative majors is TVs. While the average sales price per television is down, the TV unit sales in February were up 9%, which resulted in about flat dollar sales in TVs, so you can figure out what the average sales price decline was. But nonetheless, good unit sales increase in TVs.</p>
          <p>Within the high single digit comps of soft lines, housewares, home furnishings, small appliances and jewelry showed the strongest results. And within fresh foods, all right around 10% plus or minus a couple of percentage points in all four sub fresh food categories: meat, bakery, deli, and produce, in the high single to low double digit range in each of those subcategories.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the line items in the income statement, we'll start with membership fees. We reported $426 million, or 2.08% in Q2 of '11. That's up 10 percentage points in dollars, or up about $40 million from last year, but two basis points less. Again, you can go through all the explanations of gas inflation that impacts it, but nonetheless in dollars it was up 10%, $40 million. If you take FX out, it was up 9%. That's still a good showing.</p>
          <p>In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates and continued increasing penetration of the executive member. We had one &#x2013; as I mentioned, we had two opening in Q2 but actually, one closing with that San Marcos. With two openings, our new membership signups in the quarter were still up slightly year over year in the fiscal quarter, net new signups overall.</p>
          <p>In terms of number of members at Q2 end, at the end of the first quarter we had 23.5 million gold star members. It's now 23.9 million. Primary business, 6.2 at the end of the first quarter, 6.3 at the end of the second quarter. Business add-on, 3.6 and 3.9. And total households would be 33.3 million and 34.1 million. And if you include all cardholders, some households, of course, have two cards, 61.2 million at Q1 end and 62.0 at Q2 end. These figures, of course, include Mexico now that we consolidate. But both Q1 end and Q2 end have apples-to-apples comparison there.</p>
          <p>At Q2 end on February 13th, our paid executive members were just shy of 11 million, 10,974,000. That's an increase of 210,000, or about 17,000 a week, 17,500 a week during the last twelve-week quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewal rates, they've actually continued pretty strong. At the end of the year, our U.S. and Canada renewal rate was 87.7% which is the number we've always reported. At Q1 end, it was 88.2% and at Q2 end, it was 88.8%. Certainly part of that, I believe, is the continuing increasing sales penetra &#x2013; membership penetration of the higher renewal rates that we engender from the executive membership base.</p>
          <p>We see the same trends on a worldwide basis and many of the new markets where you have units that are a lot younger, you start off typically in the 70 range and trend up towards our company average. Overall worldwide, we're around 86%.</p>
          <p>Going down the gross margin line, gross margins in quarter was higher year over year by 15 basis points. This is where you get out your pen and we'll jot down a few numbers. We have three columns, fiscal '10, Q1 '11 and Q2 '11. We have several line items core merchandising is line one; ancillary businesses line two; 2% reward, line three; LIFO, line four. Other, well actually there is no other these quarters. Total; and then I've added two lines, Mexico impact and then the last line below Mexico impact would be without Mexico. Again, because we are consolidating Mexico starting this fiscal year to give you the true reflection of the basis point changes we show you with and without that.</p>
          <p>So going across these line items, core merchandise for all of '10, it was up 6 basis points, so plus 6 basis points; in Q1 '11, up 19 basis points and Q2 '11 up 24 basis points. That's again, on a year-over-year basis of how the margin improved. Within ancillary businesses, it's contribution to the total change, plus 3 in fiscal &#x2013; all of fiscal '10, minus 9 in Q1 '11 and minus 5 in Q2 '11.</p>
          <p>2% reward, which simply reflects the increasing sales penetration so higher reward being paid back to members, minus 2 basis points in '10 and then minus one in each of Q1 and Q2 '11. LIFO was a charge of 5 basis &#x2013; minus 5 &#x2013; not a charge but rather a year over year comparison of minus 5, note, in fiscal '10, zero in Q1 '11, and minus 3 basis points in Q2 '11 for a total reported year-over-year change in margins of plus two basis points for all of fiscal '10, plus 9 for Q1 '11 and plus 15 for Q2 '11.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, the consolidation of Mexico benefited these &#x2013; both of these numbers in Q1 and Q2 so in terms of Mexico impact, no number in the first column; Q1, plus 3; basis points in Q2, plus six. So without Mexico, it would be plus six for Q1 overall and plus 9 basis points in Q2.</p>
          <p>So with that chart in front of you, as you can see our overall reported gross margin was higher by 15 and that's what we reported. Within this plus 15, our core merchandise contributed 24 and ancillary business gross margins, principally gas, hit or reduced our gross margin by 5. In fact, the gas gross margin component was minus 6 or more than all of that minus 5 with the other ancillary businesses then net &#x2013; on a net basis contributing one basis point.</p>
          <p>In Q2, the gas sales penetration was higher year-over-year by just under 1.5 percentage points. As you know, it's a much lower gross margin business to start with and, in fact, within the gas business the margin was reduced year over year with the rising gas prices. That's what we see. Our lower margin gas business represented 7.2% of last year's second quarter sales compared to 8.5% of this year's second quarter sales. So again, as the sales penetration of our core merchandise was lower year over year, that tend to temper &#x2013; that 24, actually, is tempered in the fact that on a like basis if you look at the four core merchandising areas, which is a little &#x2013; about 80% of our business, which is food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines and fresh foods, just those component &#x2013; those sales divided &#x2013; those &#x2013; that &#x2013; those gross margin dollars for those four main departments divided by the sales for those four main departments were higher year over year in Q2 by actually by 36 basis points. But with the lower sales penetration, the net impact on the chart there is plus 24.</p>
          <p>Basically, within the &#x2013; those four categories, food and sundries, hard lines and soft lines, were all up nicely. Fresh foods was down ever so slightly, less than 10 basis points down year over year; primarily down due to the commodities price inflation and the fact that we tend to hold pricing as long as we can, particularly on key small business items like 15-packs of muffins and some of the items at the food court as well and the bakery and the deli.</p>
          <p>Overall, Q2 margins were just fine. The impact, as I mentioned, from executive membership was 1 basis point which, back of the envelope basis, implies about a 2% increase in the sales penetration of those rewardable sales dollars. And LIFO, as I mentioned, is back and we took a charge of $6 million or 3 basis points in Q2. And again, there's no way to predict what will happen other than my crystal ball tells me that it certainly will be a LIFO charge in Q3 and most likely Q4 at this point. Mexico, again, had the positive impact that we just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Moving to reported SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentages, Q2 over Q2 were lower or better by 24 basis points coming in at 9.96 as a percent of sales this year compared to 10.20 last year. And last year's Q2, as we mentioned in the press release, we have the $22 million charge related to the change in employee benefits. That was a detriment last year in Q2 on a year-over-year basis by 12 basis points so really when we reported 24 basis point increase, it's really an improvement of 12 basis points net of that.</p>
          <p>Again, like margin, we'll jot down a few numbers. Same three columns: all of fiscal '10, Q1 '11 and Q2 '11. And the line items will be core operations, central, stock or equity, quarterly adjustment, total and then again two new line items, Mexico impact and then total without Mexico.</p>
          <p>Going across &#x2013; and plus numbers here means lower SG&amp;A, plus is positive. Operations in fiscal '10 was plus 2 basis points year over year and Q1 '11 plus 17 basis points and Q2 '11 plus 13 basis points, so better by 13. Central: plus 1, plus 1, and minus 2. Equity: 0, plus 1, and plus 1. Quarterly adjustments: plus 7, 0, and plus 12. That plus 12, by the way, is that employee benefit comment, the $22 million run out. Total would be: plus 10, plus 19, and plus 24. Now, Mexico in Q1 '11, there's no numbers in the fiscal &#x2013; all of fiscal '10 column; in Q1 '11 it was plus 7 and Q2 11, plus '11. So excluding Mexico, it would be plus 12 and plus 13.</p>
          <p>In terms of a little editorial on SG&amp;A, we did have the negative impact of the $4.9 million legal fee related to the derivatives settlement. That's a couple basis points. There's about a 5 basis point negative impact from benefits costs including healthcare and workers comp.</p>
          <p>On a positive note, our payroll percentages year-over-year benefited SG&amp;A by 14 basis points. Total payroll dollars for the whole company increased 7.3% in Q2 compared to an 11.4% total increase. Both of those numbers include higher increases because of FX, but again, it's an apple &#x2013; both numbers do so. It's a like comparison. Again, small changes in central and equity; nothing big to talk about there. Overall, we feel pretty performance in SG&amp;A given the continued escalating costs in healthcare and that additional small legal expense.</p>
          <p>In terms of pre-opening expense, a little over 3 million in Q2 and a little over 4 million in Q2 this year versus a little over 3 million last year. Both numbers were calculated out to 2 basis points. No big issue in both quarters and 2 openings.</p>
          <p>In terms of provision for repaired assets and closing costs, last year we had a very minimal charge of just under $200,000 for the quarter. This year, just under $2 million. So all told, operating income in Q2 is up 27% from $470 million last year to $597 million this year. Again, if you exclude that $22 million charge that hurt last year's number, the $127 million increase in this line item would be $105 million.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was slightly higher year over year with Q2 coming in at $27 million versus $26 million a year earlier. These amounts almost entirely reflect the interest expense on the $2 billion debt offering in February of '07. If you recall, in February of '07, $900 million was 5-year money which will become due and payable in March of 2012. That will be a nice change given that we're earning a lot less in our excess cash right now and we'll be paying that off by, essentially, writing a check; $900 million of that $2 billion in March of 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of interest income and other which, again, like Q1 was much lower year over year, it was lower by $26 million, $3. &#x2013; just under $4 million versus a little under $30 million last year in the quarter. The big change there, of course, is again Mexico. Actual interest income was higher year over year by about 4 million. That's a reflection of higher cash balances; certainly because interest rates have hurt us a lot but also consolidation of Mexico's investment and coming into our financial statements. However, the biggest component of this $26 plus million year over year change was the earnings from Mexico, which are now consolidated, and to a lesser extent profit on FX contracts used in our business.</p>
          <p>Overall, pre-tax income was up 21% from $474 million last year to $573 this year and again excluding the $22 million charge pre-tax earnings were up 16%. Our company tax rate is pretty similar year over year in the second quarter. It was &#x2013; came in at 35.5% this year versus 35.6% last year in the quarter. We generally have seen that trend down a little bit. The effective rate in the U.S., which includes federal and state, is higher than that. In some of the foreign countries, which have lower federal income tax rates, given the increasing profitability overseas we've seen that number trend down a little bit. No big changes or issues on the tax rate.</p>
          <p>A quick run down on other things; we'll include in the &#x2013; what's &#x2013; you'll have on-line the, what we call the Q&amp;A which talks about quarterly LIFO charges, summaries of openings, calculations of earnings per share and also the full balance sheet so we won't go over the balance sheet here. What's not on there is when some of you ask for is depreciation and amortization. For Q2, depreciation and amortization was $195 million and year-to-date, 386 million. We have a strong balance sheet, as many of you know; lots of cash. Net cash even &#x2013; none of the 2 billion of debt, strong debt to capital ratios.</p>
          <p>Accounts payable, if you look at on a reported basis a year ago, accounts payable as a percent of inventories was 104% at the end of the second quarter. End of this year's second quarter was 97%. If you take out all the non-merchandise payables, notably and most importantly, construction payables, it was flat year over year at 87%.</p>
          <p>Inventory per warehouse, $10 million, right at $10 million last year at Q2 end and about $10.5 million at Q end this year so up $500,000 or 5% per warehouse. FX is $170,000 of that $500,000 so it's really on a flat currency basis, $330,000. And of that $330,000 about a little over a third of it, about $130,000 is electronics.</p>
          <p>No inventory concerns to speak of. We feel we did a good job of taking markdowns through the holidays and our inventory's in good shape and in fact our physical inventory level &#x2013; physical inventories, which we take at mid-year and year-end, our mid-year numbers continue the trend of improving ever so slightly the basis points of inventory shrink.</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, in Q2 we spent $234 million so year to date 540. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of openings planned for the last four months of the fiscal year starting in mid-May. And for all of '11, we expect CapEx to still be in the $1.5 billion range.</p>
          <p>In terms of Costco.com both here and in Canada, sales are up a little over 10%. That continues to be a profitable business. Our average ticket has come down a little but the site traffic continues to grow and was up a little more than this total sales increase.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion, as you know, in fiscal &#x2013; each of fiscal '09 and '10 we opened about 15 units; I think it was 13 in '09, net, and 16 in fiscal '10. This year, as I mentioned, we plan to do 24, which includes 8 in Q1, a net of one in Q2, that's 2 less the relo &#x2013; or the closing in San Marcos; in Q3, one, with no relos, Q4, 14. So all told, we'd have 24 net new increases on our starting base of 572, so about 4% unit growth which would translate to about 4.5% square footage growth given some expansion of existing locations, adding some square feet here and there as well as opening on average units that are on average a little higher than the company &#x2013; than the existing company average. As of Q2 end, square footage stood at 84 million and 84,000 square feet.</p>
          <p>In terms of stock repurchases, since the beginning of our program back in the summer of '05 through the end of fiscal '10 back in August, we've repurchased just under 100 billion shares at an average price &#x2013; for about $5.37 billion so an average price of about $54.37 a share. In Q1, we purchased &#x2013; those 12 weeks we purchased $150 million worth at an average price of a little under $62; and in Q2, $94 million worth of stock at $71.73 per share. We're generally buyers every day, including each of the past 11 or so business trading days since Q2 end and, you know, no change in those expectations going forward in terms of being out there.</p>
          <p>That's about it. As I mentioned, supplemental information will be posted on the Investor Relations site later this morning. Lastly, our Q3 scheduled earnings release date will be on Wednesday, May 25th. That's a little bit out there.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn over &#x2013; turn it back over to Debbie for Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Can you just dig in a little bit just the fresh foods margins being down? Is that because you guys haven't been willing to pass on the price increases? And then I guess looking ahead, do you expect to see similar pressure over the next couple of quarters because, obviously, those costs aren't going &#x2013; are going to continue to rise here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, it's us more than anything. You know, when you look at &#x2013; I'm making these exact numbers up, but if you look at our 15-pack of muffins or something that we sell a heck of a lot of those to restaurants and businesses and convenient stores that then sell them in eaches. And if &#x2013; and I don't know the prices off the top of my head right now but if it was $5.49 or $4.99 or whatever X was, you know, you tend to hold off and see &#x2013; realize a lower margin for several weeks or a few months and then finally bring it up to that next level of $0.30 or $0.50 extra and you get back to your regular margin in that stuff. That's not a competitive issue other than we want to protect the prices to the members that are buying these items and we feel that overall our margins have been quite good and we continue to do that kind of stuff. We really don't see any major competitive issues in our fresh foods.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And then you said gas pricing hurt by, I think you said, $0.02 in the second quarter. Can you give us a little bit of sense given how quickly gas prices have been moving up here in the past three weeks since your quarter end, how the profitability has looked for you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it impacts it. I mean, it's not as extreme as it used to be. Years ago, you lost a bunch in those weeks and you made some amount in most of the other weeks. You tend to make a little more in those other weeks and you lose less or make a little in those weeks. I mean, it's tempered relative to where it used to be.</p>
          <p>The big issue here was the comparison year over year. We had huge profit gains in Qs &#x2013; profits in Qs 1 and 2 last year, and I think like this $0.02 delta we talked about here in Q2, I think it was a little over $0.03 in Q1 on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Again, it's going to move around. Gas is still a profitable business, a very low margin business; a business that, I've mentioned before, requires some stomach lining occasionally. But nonetheless, we're getting good frequency. I think that's part of the frequency issue as well, and but certainly, when prices spike for a week or two here, you see some relatively flat numbers whether it's plus a little bit of profit or minus a little bit of loss. It's not a real big issue. And looking last year, Q3 was not as impactful and was not as profitable as Qs 1 and 2 in gas.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in line? Okay. And then, last, it looks like you bought back about $100 million worth of stock here in the quarter. What do you &#x2013; is there any change in the company's cash priority?  You're really starting to build a pretty big balance, I think like close to $12 per share. I'm just wondering at some point do you accelerate that or do you step up the dividend or what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, every spring, historically over the last six years we have. I can't tell you what we will do this time, but we generally haven't done anything giant special; we just increase it methodically, historically, and we'll look what we do come the spring. CapEx certainly has been ramped up and will continue, although so is cash flow. So it's a high quality problem.</p>
          <p>One of the issues, and I think in a round-about way what you're asking is you bought less in Q2 than you bought in Q1 while your cash is going further north. Part of that has to do that we tend to historically have bought through blackout periods with 75 ones. You have to put those in place before you know anything material about what you are going to report, whether it's monthly sales, which is a week and a half before, let's say, week and a half or so before; or in the case of a quarterly earnings number, four or five weeks before.</p>
          <p>Again, I think the high quality problem has been we put a matrix in place, if you will with how much we're going to buy at different stock prices out there and put some reasonable numbers above what the existing stock price is. During those four weeks, the stock price then climbs quite a bit and so a part of it is simply a fact that you locked in a matrix four, five weeks ago based on where the stock price was then. You know, again, I think it will ebb and flow, and I think the message here and the message that I have gotten in talking with the Board and Jim and Jeff, of course, is that we are certainly continuing to be comfortable buying stock back and you're not going to find us one to make some big announcement that because it went down three bucks we bought a lot extra today. We're going to buy more each day when it goes down a little and buy &#x2013; still buy when it goes up a little and then we get caught in these four or five week 75 ones when the stock jumps a lot and so that mitigates the amount that we've bought as well. But overall, we're still a buyer out there and we'll see where it goes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to follow up a little bit on that California question. If California is in line with the company average, how much more room of recovery does it have? Or another way to ask that is how much stronger was California versus the average back before the downturn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, California was always a little weaker and I'm pulling these numbers from the air here, but if you looked at what was &#x2013; if the total U.S. comp in good times a few years ago was, I'm making it up, but a 6, California was a 4. Part of that was we had more cannibalization in California relative to the rest of the U.S. at that time as well. That was a little bit of it.</p>
          <p>And then when the economy got hammered, California went down further. So if again, using my nomenclature if the spread of California comp were versus the rest of the U.S. comp a few years ago was at 200 basis point delta, there were times at the trough of the economy a couple years ago where that gap was 4, 4.5 percentage points so California got hurt harder. It's now back, in terms of actual comp dollars, so part of the, you might say, the gap is closer to zero now than even 2%. A part of that is because it was weaker a year and two years ago. And so again, trend-wise, it's encouraging. We hope it's got some more room. We'll see.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that in front of me. My guess if you take out gas, it's probably still a little lower; gas is an unfair benefit here. But keep in mind, you had a couple of &#x2013; I would bet it's closer, on its way there. But given where we've seen comps the last few months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on inflation for food, have you seen manufacturers providing some promotional support as the increases have been rolling in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I mean, some of them, the biggest promotional support that you see is typically they announce an increase and then they allow you buy in at the old price, two weeks, four weeks, six weeks at the old price. And of course, we take advantage of every one of those; I would assume many retailers do. We probably then hold the price longer than anybody else as well because of that and so that's the kind of thing you're seeing.</p>
          <p>I think there has been some push back by the retailers, not just us as I would imagine; but at the same token, some of it is coming through. I mean, you can't &#x2013; when you see underlying commodity costs go up and you see the improved penetration, a little bit extra penetration in private label and, you know, it's funny. When you look at the &#x2013; when our merchants show us in the monthly budget meetings that this commodity went up 28% and this one went up 42% and then the average price point went up 2% to 6% on an item, partly it's the raw materials, partly it's the pressure we can put and come to bear on manufacturers, part of it's the pressure and competitiveness of private label but ultimately, some of it has come through. And again, I would expect to see more not less in the last &#x2013; in the next couple of quarters, at least based on what the buyers tell us.</p>

          <p>Well <mark type="inaudible" /> get to gas on your transportation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. In terms of transportation, I'm speaking from a couple of years ago so add 15% in terms of how &#x2013; we're bigger 15% or so in total. What we call &#x2013; what I'll call the freight surcharge that runs through our depot operations and we've estimated that a couple years ago that every percentage point in that was $18 million of freight costs in the system, both inbound freight to us from vendors as well as outbound freight from depots to warehouses.</p>
          <p>My guess, just rounding to $20 million, most of that is passed on. You know, it's passed on when the buyers are buying, it increases their costs on which they marked up. I would think that the freight is less of a lagging issue than when a manufacturer raises the price of the item we try to hold it a little longer.</p>
          <p>So it's an impact, but it's a modest trend impact. I don't think that's a big issue here. If anything, we've shown our &#x2013; those numbers, by the way, are in our margin numbers. It's part of the cost of goods and we've shown that our margins have been pretty good this last year, this last quarter  year over year when, I can guarantee you, the freight costs within those merchandise sales have gone up the last 12 weeks, year over year</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Richard. I've got a couple questions on the average ticket. Can you first of all give us the comp sales leverage point for expenses we might see in the back half of the year? And then how much might that leverage point come down if we see further strengthening in the average ticket as a proportion of the total comp increase so that versus the first quarter improved for you, we didn't see that much of an improvement in the G&amp;A trend, though I guess there was noise there. Outside of that, payroll did improve a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it's hard to guesstimate what the actual point of leverage is. I can tell you that we &#x2013; the operators feel confident in the last couple years that we, like everybody out there, got a little better so whatever that threshold was, it's a lower number and I think that's why we've seen things like the payroll percentage improve like they have.</p>
          <p>You know, with healthcare it's always something. You know, some of these increases don't even relate to some of the new changes that are coming over the next couple of years. And so that's a challenge. I think &#x2013; now, the fact to the extent that sales increase includes, you know, inflation on like items, clearly, that's the good stuff in terms of leveraging SG&amp;A. Again, it will help. I'm sorry I can't quantify it any more but I think that it's going at least in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My other question on average ticket, while it's going up in the stores, you said down a little bit in e-commerce, why do you think that might be different? Is that a function of members not buying as many of the higher price point items on the website or it is due to changes your merchants are making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest &#x2013; the single biggest reason is the average price point of an item going through the front end checkout is, what 10 or 12 bucks? The average item on-line is just under &#x2013; somewhere in the 375 to 400 range, I'm guessing. And so part of it, I think, is as the economy got worse &#x2013; we know what &#x2013; I remember it falling in '09 versus '08 from like 425 down to 390 or 380. Couple that with deflation in like, take electronics items, I think that's more than anything, the economy and deflationary type items that permeate that site.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Richard, just to follow &#x2013; keep on the inflation topic, as you're holding prices flat on food as in the face of rising commodity costs, any sense of what competitors are doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, this is from what I hear at the budget meetings from Tim Rose and others, we tend to be the strictest. Not to imply that everybody else is not, that you know, our sense is is that some retailers try to get margin where they can. We try to hold it a little bit when we can and given that we had some relatively strong margin improvements in other areas, which includes every component. As we changed our electronics return policy two years ago, we're seeing modest increase and improvement in what we call D&amp;D, damaged and destroyed, which is a cost of sales to total gross margin. Our shrink numbers got a little better, just under a basis point better. Well, a basis point is 8 million bucks of &#x2013; $5 or $6 million this year implied by that, so all those little things help, too.</p>
          <p>It has more to do &#x2013; it has less to do with the traditional supermarket items like tin foil and paper goods and you know, cereals; those things we tend to move along. I'm talking more about items within the bakery where, you know, you don't want to change prices every week and so historically what we've always done is is you pick an item that forever it seemed it was at 5.99; ultimately, you're going to take it to 6.49. You know, you're not going to take it from 5.99 to 6.09 to 6.19 sequentially. Once you get there, you're fine. If it takes five weeks or 12 weeks or whatever, that's fine.</p>
          <p>Same thing in the food court, which is not part of fresh foods but with rising prices of cheese and things like that that, that's impacting the profitability of pizza. Not a big deal to the company overall, but all those things impact margins a little bit.</p>
          <p>We certainly have had strength in our overall margin and feel very comfortable doing that and feel very comfortable that all the metrics are going in the right direction in terms of frequency and a little improvement in G&amp;A and the like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm interested, and in these budget meetings when you are hearing from the buyers, any sense of how they see the direction of inflationary pressures?  Following on that, given that you've had success on controlling what you can on shrink and payroll, is there a tipping point? Is there a point at which the in the face of these inflationary pressures it is hard to hold prices? At what point does it get a little bit tougher to kind of hold off the price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mind you, we're not holding prices on every item and location. You know, and that's where &#x2013; it's kind of like in a budget meeting when a buyer gets up and talks about sales of this small soft category or this item was up 30%. Well, your department was up 4% so what was down? So we hear about that, you know, cotton has doubled in price and, you know, the tin has gone up so tin foil is up and there are items like tin foil, I believe, and I don't know if it has happened yet, but there are price increases coming from all the manufacturers in the high single digits.</p>
          <p>Well, we're not going to sustain that. I mean, you've got to pass a good chunk of that on. So when I highlight something like bakery and front end, we're not going to change the cost of a slice of pizza until we really have to and we can well afford in that small sub-department to do so. So it's like when you hear that the average price increase out there in the consumer price index was 1.5% or 2% and you're thinking wait a minute, gas went up 28% and my healthcare costs have gone up, whatever, high teens and all these other things. So overall, ultimately you've got to pass on price increases but we want to hold it longer and particularly on those business items like the 15 packs of muffins</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I'll just ask the membership fee hike increase. We understand you're doing well with controlling what you can and maybe you don't need the fee hike, but perhaps give us an update in light of the fact that frequency is strong and ticket is improving and all the metrics are heading in the right direction; that would seem to suggest that perhaps the backdrop is ripe for a fee hike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All the reasons that you would list on a page on why we should or shouldn't do it, you get comfort by the fact, as you said, renewal rates and frequency and all that stuff and the customer loyalty and all that stuff is fine. We haven't made any decision yet. We will at some point discuss it and you all will be the next to know.</p>
          <p>We did it &#x2013; the last time we did it was, I think, May or June of '06 so five years hence would be May or June of this year. I think I shared with someone and you guys on the last call or maybe the previous call that back in the middle of '09 at the height of the terrible economy or the trough of the economy, where everybody was still feeling very poor from their 401(K) plans and their house values and their job layoffs, all things being equal &#x2013; and we had very good frequency and loyalty everything then. And if that was a time to think about doing it, would we? And the view was generally, no. There's no rush to it. We'll do it when we want to do it and I think I added to that if you're looking in the next three or four year model, is it likely at some point? Yes. But I can't tell you when. And we really don't have any indication of that at this time.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question that I have &#x2013; just a couple of things. Could you just give us a feel for where you think your consumer is and your ability to pass through some of the inflation?  And I guess, more on any general economic thoughts in terms of where we are right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've been asked about like the 2% payroll tax benefit that everybody gets. It's kind of like when there was the $300 tax gift from a few years ago, several years ago to the $600 one, generally upscale retailers and Costco tended not to feel the benefit of that as much as the lower, medium-end discounters and the dollar-type stores. The same thing here; we don't really see that as a big impetus for us.</p>
          <p>Again, as it relates to our abilities, I think we have the &#x2013; the good news is we're our most competitive &#x2013; we're our own toughest competitor and we recognize you've got to pass on increases, but we're in a pretty good position to be able to delay that for short periods in some instances. This is, by no means, the example of late '08 when we took an extra 30 or so million dollars of markdowns on half a dozen or dozen key items to try to drive business a little. Business is fine. Some these increases are being passed thank you and, ultimately, you've got to pass them through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And could ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the economy, again, I guess I'll say the same thing that &#x2013; and again, none of us here are economists and we read and listen to the same news that you guys listen to. It doesn't seem like anything is causing it to get better fast. It doesn't feel like there's another big shoe that's going to drop other than the current thorn is oil prices and what does that do and how does it impact it?</p>
          <p>But again, we're adding jobs as we open units. I think I read recently that Target is adding a bunch of jobs and so I mean there's lots &#x2013; there's some jobs coming but nothing huge and this housing concern is still an issue. So we feel that our number &#x2013; we feel confident in our numbers and our frequency and in our comps and unit comps and everything else in the face of not terribly exciting expectations about the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Speaking of Target entering Canada, can you maybe just talk about the environment in Canada and how your clubs are doing up there with the 80 that you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's been great. In local currency, for a couple years now, we've been running comps in the mid to high single digits so compounded for the two years. Their economy is strong. It's &#x2013; a big chunk of their economy, I believe, is natural resources which have run up. They did not have any or very nearly any fallout from what happened in the finance and banking and the subprime issue. Funny thing, they didn't allow that kind of stuff. So it's a pretty good economy up there.</p>
          <p>Our numbers up there have been quite good. It's very competitive up there. I mean, Wal-Mart is huge up there over the last seven or eight years. There's some strong retail competitors like LOBLOS and others up there. And so Target, I would think, will do well up there and you know, we'd like them all to close and just be us, but that's not going to happen. But we're doing fine up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then my last question, Richard; are there any new items that you're really excited about as you look to this calendar year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gosh. You caught me off guard on that one; I'm just trying to think off the top of my head. It's more of the same. If I think in a category specific, apparel has been pretty exciting in terms of vendors that are not necessarily new people selling us, but really major increases in &#x2013; nice increases in everything from outerwear to, you know, shorts and pants to shirts and to bathing suits as we start entering that category, so &#x2013; and to kids' clothes and baby clothes. I'm trying to think what else.</p>
          <p>You know, there's the &#x2013; you know, there's a lot of electronic stuff coming out to compete with some of the products that are already out there like the iPad and there's &#x2013; 3D is not the most exciting thing but I'm not telling you anything you don't know. But TVs are &#x2013; again, unit sales of TVs are pretty good. PCs, there's been a little tick up I think in the last several weeks with this new chip coming out that delayed some of the new laptops and PCs that people were waiting for. Not big to our company, but a little thing there.</p>
          <p>I can't think of anything specific other than to say more of the same. Fresh foods, it never ceases to amaze me when the buyers get up in the budget meetings, whether it's new bakery items to drive what was a sluggish sale and then it's a good sale &#x2013; good sales. And we're very strong in the meat and protein department. So overall, I think we're doing well and that's some &#x2013; I can't tell you this one late great item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Richard, very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. To continue on with the international comments, can you provide additional color on your performance outside of the U.S., especially as it's representing a greater percentage of your square footage growth going forward? And also in light of that, how should we think about the margin contribution of those clubs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, first of all, you get &#x2013; every quarter, you get to see in the Q the segment reporting analysis. We kind of implied that probably outside of &#x2013; we show U.S. as a separate column and Canada as a separate column and then other international. Within other international, Mexico was &#x2013; actually has done well despite their &#x2013; the economy down there. U.K. has been the toughest one in terms of their economy and our sales &#x2013; our comp sales over there. Asia &#x2013; the three countries in which we're in in Asia continue to do quite well.</p>
          <p>Australia is great, but it's all of one unit. We'll have two more this calendar year this summer, hopefully, and maybe one will fall into early fall but I think this summer. And so overall, I would say margins reflect the strength or the weakness, so we're going to drive sales in the U.K. and work on, you know, a little tougher margins; in Asia, they're a little stronger.</p>
          <p>But there's other metrics that impact the profitability of the countries. On average, benefits, expenses, percent of sales is lower everywhere other than the U.S. Labor costs, while relative to local labor costs in those countries, we still pay the best wages for hourly out there. It's a much lower percentage in certain of those countries and a somewhat lower percentage in other countries than the U.S. In some cases, there's a little more occupancy, like in Asia. But we're driving big sales dollars in Asia, too, so that helps.</p>
          <p>So there's a lot of little things. Overall, I think the margins outside of the U.S. and the pre-tax return on sales, you'll see in those columns is higher than the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then, it's really been now two really impressive quarters in the core merchandise margins. Should we think of this as an inflection point of impressive performance against tough comparisons and can you provide additional details?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope it's in an inflection point. We'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean an inflection point in the positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel very confident that we are still &#x2013; that most competitive pricing out there and we've still have been able to show some margin improvement. But it's a tough business. And as we get a little too strong, we're reminded by the powers that be here that we've got to make sure that we are fiercely competitive. But we've done that over time. I've seen that in departments; I've seen that in countries where things were really strong and we bring it back a little bit and continue to drive sales and ultimately long-term profitability. I think we are &#x2013; I think Jim summed it up recently at a budget meeting says, you know, we don't have a lot of issues with margin right now, and we don't see that being an issue in the future; the near future. Beyond that, we'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one last question, you can just comment on what you're seeing out of your small business customer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it's &#x2013; I don't have the exact date in front of me. When we look at the small business sales penetration, and you've got to take gasoline out there because gasoline is generally a consumer item even if it's for the small business, it got hit a little bit in '09. It came back not all the way in '10 and my guess is it's continuing to come back a little bit; maybe not be where it was before late '08. When you look at things like restaurant business, you know, the restaurants got hit the hardest; the business restaurants, the high end steakhouses, not the neighborhood &#x2013; not as much in the neighborhood ethnic restaurant or the diner. And those that did get hit a little bit have come back a little. That's a very vague answer because I don't have the exact statistics at the tip of my tongue here. But generally speaking, that's the trend we've seen I know over the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. I was wondering if you &#x2013; we could go back to the promotions question again from the packaged goods companies. How are they looking at contributing to your coupon mailers as prices begin to go up faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really a separate issue. I mean, I can tell you that we've got more demand to be in those than we have spaces and it works well. They like it and we like it. So, again, that's another way for them to give us some competitive moneys, you know, it's a vehicle for them to invite some discounts. But again, we're full, pretty full, in that stuff already in terms of the vendors liking it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would it be &#x2013; you talk about space. Is it something you could expand as part of the marketing approach to the members as inflation picks up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I assume so. But again, I'm shooting from the hip here. As you know, we've expanded it in terms of number of days or weeks there are various coupons out there. We've expanded the offerings a little bit over time as well. Clearly, as prices go up, there's an opportunity to drive more business on a given item. So again, conceptually, yes. I'm just not &#x2013; I guess I'm not &#x2013; I don't have the numbers and specifics of that to tell you what different suppliers are doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. Good morning to you. I just wanted to go through the gross margin table again that you gave us because just allied to what Deb was asking, it looks to me like if you take out Mexico in the first quarter, there was still quite a nice increase in core operating gross margin. In the second quarter, once you take out the quarterly adjustment to Mexico, the core merchandise margin was pretty flat. Is that the right way to look at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry; say that again. I was turning to that page.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the Q1, total gross margin was up 19 bips and if you exclude Mexico, it was up 12 bips. And so the core margins have still nice, useful at least 10 bips growth there. If you look at Q2, if you exclude Mexico, it was up 13 bips but the quarterly adjustment was 12 bips of that so it would indicate that the core merchandise margin was pretty flat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The quarterly adjustment's an SG&amp;A item, not a margin item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'm looking at the wrong page, okay. So if I was to look at the first and second quarter then and look at the strength in the core merchandise margin, what's going on there?  Because obviously, it seemed a difficult environment in which to raise margins given the fact that costs are going up. Is there a mix shift going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There may be a little bit of that. Frankly, I stand by my comment earlier that we're our own toughest competitor historically and, you know, part of it is the comments which I actually didn't talk about today is the whole area of sustainability. As we take packaging and freight costs out of items, sometimes they're a small enough amount that you're not lowering a price point on something but you're &#x2013; the example I gave a couple of years ago, I remember, was just on the plastic container that we sell the four pounds of grapes in. We reduced the height of that container by 3 or 4 centimeters; it allowed to you get an entire additional line, if you will, a slip sheet of layer of those sell units on a pallet. Just the actual cost of the like number of plastic containers was like $300,000 of savings.</p>
          <p>Every budget meeting, the buyers, whether it's the &#x2013; going from a round to a square container for peanuts, you know; just on our cashews, there's another example I remember from last year I shared, just on the one item of cashews, that three or four pound container of the famous cashews. By going from a round to a square container, we reduced the &#x2013; on like unit volume to through-put of pallets in our U.S. system by 32,000 pallets and however many couple of thousand truck loads.</p>
          <p>A lot of those freight costs don't necessarily lower the price by $0.08 a unit or something. We don't lower the price on something like that, necessarily. So I think, the fact that we improved each year even in the last five years probably on average, a half to a basis point of shrink; the fact that we've had a little bit as a percent of sales slightly lower returns in part because of the change in the electronics policy a few years ago. All those things help as well. Not just pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's basically &#x2013; it's not that you're raising prices and that's what's improving your margin. It's more that your cost of goods sold are seeing benefits here, there and everywhere and that's reflecting in your &#x2013; in a slightly improved cost of goods sold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Sales penetration of private label; I'm not going to sit here and say that it hasn't happened, but I got to tell you, that's the last thing that a buyer looks at because they know they're going to be looked at</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the past, though, you've generally tended to pass through a lot of the savings through to shoppers and it seems like you're getting some savings building up and building up here. Could we expect you to maybe, perhaps, reinvest in the future or are you, as Jim's saying, you know, margins are looking good here, you just &#x2013; you're happy just to take the margin as we see it now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't tell you whether that's going to happen next week much less next quarter other than we feel pretty comfortable about how we're doing right now. We certainly have a confidence level in our renewal rates and our frequency that until it changes we'll feel comfortable about it. We feel very comfortable that competitively there's some tough competitors out there but we're the toughest. And I say that feeling very honest about that from what I hear.</p>
          <p>You know, the buyers know that they can't get too aggressive on things and again, we still take key items down, and, I used to &#x2013; we used to talk about the hot dog and soda for $1.50 and then we added the rotisserie chicken to that cadre of items. And then we added the 35 count, I think, of the half-liter water, the PS has gone from $4.39 to $3.55, I think, now. Maybe it's a little higher now with freight. That was a couple months ago.</p>
          <p>We're &#x2013; I kind of look at us as having our cake and eating it too. We're able to have some decent margins and still feel very comfortable. The priority is still going to be being the toughest competitor. Keep in mind, again, when you look at the fall of '08 when everything hit, and we specifically talked &#x2013; I specifically talked about the $30 million or so of extra markdowns. That's because comps for the first time in close to ever were approaching zero and we wanted to reverse that trend. That's not the case right now and, again, overall we feel that things are going in the right direction. So, again, I can't sit here and tell you it will continue in how it's been, but I can tell you that we currently feel pretty good about how things are going.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may ask a second question. Clearly, you've been very successful for a number of decades, particularly with the shopper that started off with you as family shoppers and they've grown with you and you still have a lot of appeal among the boomer generation. How do you feel that your appeal is going with some of the younger shoppers now who are starting to form families who are perhaps thinking about where they should buy some of their consumables in bulk with more options like the internet?  How do you think your appeal is to these sort of younger shoppers and the Generation Y shoppers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we want each of them to have three children. No, look, at the end of the day, we ask ourselves those questions, too. We're not going to be everything to everybody. To the extent that trend has occurred in the last three or four years, it's occurred &#x2013; in spite of that, our frequency is up and our comps are a little better than others in general for such a big retailer as ourselves.</p>
          <p>We're cognizant of that, but we don't &#x2013; we keep trying to come out with the right merchandise at the right price and we change it, there's no item that has a lock on its space and we're constantly bringing things out. Organic would be an example of areas which are growing nicely. Some things work, by the way, in that area and some things don't. And some things we're just waiting for more supply because we could exceed the entire U.S. production of certain given organic items.</p>
          <p>Now, as it relates to internet, are we always a little behind everybody else? Yes. I think we've saved ourselves from stubbing our toes occasionally and some would argue that the opposite, that we're not looking as hard and fast. I can assure you we're looking, but we want to stay true to the things that we do. We think that frankly, there's abilities to drive more traffic into the warehouse by using some of those same tools.</p>
          <p>We recognize we've got one of the largest manual social networks. You say the word Costco and people around you start talking about it. So we're looking at some things but I don't want to suggest that there's a lot of things coming tomorrow afternoon. You know, I guess it's a question that will be better addressed if and when we see some reduction in some of the things I just mentioned. Like, we have some people looking at that all the time but we also don't want to veer from what we've seen be successful.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks, Richard. I have two questions. One, hopefully a bigger picture on inflation and then on inventory. On the inflation side, I think you mentioned that food was up mid single digits and sundries up low single digits. If you just think about the mix of your sales, would you say that probably impacted comps for the company about 150 bips in the quarter if you were to compare it to the U.S. comp of 3%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. First of all, I think the food number was the fresh foods number not the food and sundries.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>So if you look at it that way, was there inflation in that 3% number overall, at least a little bit? Or do you think that some the pressure...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. My guess is there's some inflation. Now the other thing &#x2013; and again, I'm just shooting from the hip here. Any increase &#x2013; we might have inflation on a KS item, but we also have increased unit sales penetration on KS items which typically are 20% plus lower price points. So if I just took every physical item that went through the front end, my guess is it has a plus sign in front of it but it's closer to zero than one; and that's a guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then on the inventory side, I think you mentioned that it was 330,000 on a true like-for-like basis, up per club and most of it was electronics. Is that &#x2013; could you fill us in on what actual products that was, which parts of electronics or &#x2013; and did that sell-through in February or is that sort of a historic number?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little bit has to do with a year ago there were some shortages in some of the flat panels. We've got more SKU selection in TVs than we had a year ago. That probably helped the unit sales on TVs, by the way. And a little of it is if you talk about the pendulum swinging in terms of goal of SKU selection, I remember three or four years ago, in the U.S. example of the SKU selection, the SKU goals on average warehouse was probably somewhere around 4,000, 4,050; and you turn around and you've got to 4,200 and we brought it down to 4,000 again.</p>
          <p>And actually, before the economy got hammered a couple years ago, on a conscious way we said let's bring it down to 3850, 3,900. There's got to be &#x2013; if the top 200 items, or top roughly 5% of the items are in the mid to high 30% of sales, that tells you what the bottom 200 items are. And so it's a little bit of an art form, but I think that we probably have moved it &#x2013; again, as it got a little too high, toward 4,200, it probably got a little too low towards 38, 3850. It's come back a little and if I look at it, again, I think I mentioned about 130 of that 330 was electronics. The rest of it, if you look down about 7 or 8 sub-departments, it was 20 to 40 each.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And that would be indicative of the SKUs and maybe adding back 50 to 100 of those SKUs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, there has been no indication even on seasonal stuff that we've got any big problems out there. And in fact, there's been confidence the last two budget meetings about whether it was patio furniture or getting through outerwear last fall or getting into some of the spring and summer apparel items now.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's really not a whole lot to say. Basically, the two of us couldn't figure out how to make both of us happy and we're both out there still selling merchandise, but just different merchandise.</p>

          <p>One last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your last question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Hey, Richard, a quick one; just can you just remind us on the international outlook and sort of thinking the next three years plus, where are you most excited and where are your people most aggressively trying to get real estate sites and you know, weave into that, I think you added one more store in Australia than we were expecting today and just an update would be terrific on that outlook?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, as I've said in the last couple quarters, the three existing countries in Asia where we are, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, between those three, probably over a five-year period, we're adding on average 1 or 2 to the total of three countries a year. We're going to open 5 in the fourth quarter, which is also, I think, six for the year in total; and so we've stepped it up there.</p>
          <p>Australia, again, so far so good, but it's one unit. I'm pretty confident that a year from now we'll say so far so good but it's only three units but we'll continue to look there. The only other areas that &#x2013; the fact that I think we're opening three units in Canada this year implies that we're still think that we're not saturated in a country that has 80 plus units. It wasn't that long ago that we felt that as we had 50 going to 60 we said at some point that we're going to fill the country and we're happily finding that's not the case.</p>
          <p>And Mike Sinegal who, don't hold it against him, but his dad's Jim. But Mike's been here for 24, 25 years, 25 years since college, and he opened and ran Japan for us. And he did spend a couple of early years with Carefor when Carefor owned 10% or 20% of Costco years earlier and he speaks, in addition to English and fluent Japanese, he speaks fluent Spanish and French. And so he's over there in Europe, and there's no promises, but my guess in the next two or three years you'll see us announce, if not open, a unit or two in a couple countries over there.</p>
          <p>But our MO, I think, will continue there as well. It takes us a while to open a few units and make sure we like what we see and we understand all the issues with distribution and labor hiring and everything else and so, again, it will be additive; increasing penetration, if you will. But even this year with 24 net new units, I think I mentioned 17 of them, 14 in the U.S. and three in Canada, are in very predictable, very comparable countries.</p>
