          <p>Good day and welcome to the Rio Tinto, 2011 Interim Results North American Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Albanese. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, operator and good morning and good day to all of you. We've got a series of slides. These slides are basically a cut down version of what we did this morning and I'll try to go through pretty quickly those slides which cover the pertinent items. During the course, as usual open up for Q&amp;A. And I do appreciate the fact that many of you should be sitting on the Jersey Shore enjoying the weather and not sitting in an office place enjoying results.</p>
          <p>So, let me start off with safety. Once again, we have recorded improvement in our overall safety numbers LTIs [lost time injury], our all &#x2013; injury frequency rates were all down and continue to go down in the first half of the year. But unfortunately that was overshadowed by four fatalities, mostly at construction projects with contractors and clearly we have been very, very focused on that. I have been focused on that, this is unacceptable and we are taking actions. We recognize that as we ramp up projects particularly in a hot market that we have to make sure that all of our construction activities, all of our contractor activities are running at the same level of safety performance as our employees in our operations.</p>
          <p>Flipping onto slide number four, we produced a great result today, another record breaking set of numbers. These were record earnings, record EBITDA, and we built more than $2 billion of cash flow amongst record cash flows. Strong prices, of course, were the main driver, but our operations also performed well particularly in the face of exceptional weather conditions that we saw all around the world, but particularly in Queensland and WA. We did &#x2013; we've continued to buy back shares over &#x2013; since out original amounts in February that we would put that in place by this week. We've had a total share buyback program included of about $3 billion and given our strong cash flows, our strong balance sheet, the continuation of growth program, it's allowed us to maintain the pace, increase the program of the overall buyback program from $5 billion to $7 billion, an increase of $2 billion and we expect to complete this by the end of the first quarter 2012. Of course, with the usual caveats of market conditions.</p>
          <p>Now, if I can view &#x2013; I'll step through the product groups. First of all on slide five, iron ore benefited from relatively stable prices through the first half, driven by robust demand from China. This more than offset weak demand from Japan after its devastating earthquake and tsunami.</p>
          <p>Our Pilbara operations were affected &#x2013; heavily impacted particularly in the first quarter by significant rains. While production did recover strongly in the second quarter and in fact was the second highest quarter on record. I think this was a great result considering those adverse weather conditions. We did successfully expand our production in Pilbara capacity to 225 million tons per year by March &#x2013; end of March 2011, which is exactly when we said we would have that done and we accelerated the planned expansion, the 332 million tons a year by six months in the first half of 2015.</p>
          <p>We have been operating our construction projects in Australia to Australian control budgets and given the fact that we are now projecting an increase in what we would see the future Australian dollar, we've also approved a further $2 billion U.S. dollar capital expenditure as a result of that stronger forecast in the Australian dollar. I do want to emphasis again that our expansion plans remain on time on budget in Australian dollar terms, I've spent some time out at Pilbara with our project managers just last month and they did commit to me that they were working on that basis and all of their efforts. A lot of it had been making pre-commitments so they locked in a lot of those costs and they continue to be on budget in Australian dollar terms.</p>
          <p>Moving to Canada, at IOC we are expecting capacity to be lifted by 4 million tons early next year to 23 million tons and we have a clear pathway to 26 million tons and potentially almost double this to 50 million tons. Those of you in Canada know that we had some challenging weather conditions particularly in the first part of the year and that did impact production of IOC in the first quarter and again we saw that picking up by the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And then finally for iron ore in Simandou activities on the ground continue to gear up following the signing of a settlement agreement with government of Guinea earlier this year. We are now spending about $20 million a month on the ground and this is going to be increasing nearly fivefold in the coming months. We are currently in the process of ramping up quite a bit of activities on the ground.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide six and aluminum with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (5:00). weak adjusting results was driven by the higher pricing resulted tight income markets and continued strengthened demand in China. That said RTA was negatively affected by cost pressures, returning to the industry and those particularly not only energy but also particularly of coke, caustic and pitch. We also saw adverse foreign exchange movement particularly with the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar and lower volume from Queensland operation affected by severe weather.</p>
          <p>We are continuing with the transformation of the aluminum group with a plan firmly in place to achieve an EBITDA margin of 40% by 2014. And this we achieved by focusing on key &#x2013; three key priorities. First incremental EBITDA of $1 billion per cost efficiencies and capital improvement. Second a sub change improvement through capital investment in major projects such as Yarwun 2, such as AP60, such as the modernization at Kitimat. And finally disciplined portfolio management of all the assets in RTA.</p>
          <p>Moving on to copper on slide number seven, underlying earnings increased and that reflects the higher price driven by a steady increase in copper demand and that's all you know continued tightness in the supply side of copper. We did see a dip in grade at KUC, Escondida, and Grasberg, and those of you know, we both flagged that last year and those in particular the mature pits in <mark type="ph" /> mostly (0:06:27) coppers, these are pretty predictable in cycle, up and downs, this was a cycle down for 2011 and we do expect a recovery in 2012 as those grades do pick up again.</p>
          <p>And looking further ahead, we'll deliver new production, which will be timely into the tight markets from Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia from about 2013. Construction is going well at OT with nearly a third complete as of the June 30, 2011. And while development in OT continues to be on schedule, OT will require an agreed power solution sale schedule to deliver first commercial production in 2013. We've approved further funds at resolution United States. We completed the 50% of the 30 kilometer drilling program at La Granja in Peru. We are also progressing brownfield options at KUC and Northparkes.</p>
          <p>Turning to the energy group on slide eight, earnings were impacted by severe bad weather particularly at our Queensland coal mines during the first quarter. Operations are recovering well although we are not yet at full production rates. Hunter Valley mines were affected to a lesser extent although we did see some additional rain in the second quarter particularly in June. Expansions are progressing with additional port capacity now secured for the 8.5 million ton per year proposed Mount Pleasant thermal coal project.</p>
          <p>Moving onto slide number nine, I would like to say a few things about Riversdale. An important highlight of this half, was the transformation of our energy group growth portfolio through the acquisition of Riversdale given the fact that the number of Tier I company coal development projects in Mozambique. On Monday we completed the compulsory acquisition process and we now own 100% of Riversdale.</p>
          <p>The near term focus is we get the first phase in the Benga project up and running. There is a number of further exciting growth options ahead including further expansion to Benga and then later after that the development of substantial Zambeze resource and the Tete East projects, both of these, of course are 100% owned by Rio Tinto.</p>
          <p>As we move to the slide number 10, demand for borates and titanium dioxide feedstock continued to strengthen in the line with improved global market conditions. Market conditions for rough diamonds also strengthened in the first half of 2011, as demand from India and China continued to grow with a moderate recovery from the U.S.</p>
          <p>There's been quite a bit of focus on TiO2 prices over the course of this year, and of course you have seen quite a bit of strength and I think recognition that there are some structural issues with TiO2 supply which will benefit the producer. For the time being though our exposure to swap prices is really relatively limited as our multi-year contracts mature over the course of the next couple of years, they are being replaced by contracts with alternative pricing mechanism, which will provide increased exposure to current market pricing.</p>
          <p>I would like to now talk about prices and cost structures and move to slide number 11. It should come as no surprise the primary driver of our performance has been price, partially offset by the impact of the currency movements, notably the stronger Australian dollar. As previously highlighted, volumes were impacted by extraordinary weather disruptions in the first half and lower copper and gold grades in the first half. The effect of higher exploration and evaluation costs reflect the greater levels of investment in the forward look of the business and what we would consider to be a good cost. The increase in cost was significantly influenced by uncontrollable factors in the first half 2011 including adverse weather and lower grades, higher input prices and also the raw materials and general inflation.</p>
          <p>And let's talk a little bit more about the higher input prices but there are further details that can be found in the appendix for these slides. We are seeing quite high levels of inflation, particularly localized in hot markets for mining and looking forward we should expect to see continued inflation of production costs and input prices. In particular, labor costs in locations such as Australia, especially West Australia and especially Queensland and certain parts of Canada particularly far Eastern parts of Canada and Western Canada and, of course, certain critical raw materials.</p>
          <p>We do have a leadership position in operational excellence and that leadership position in operational excellence will help us to identify further opportunities for improvement through focus on cost management and productivity gains and ensures that our cost base continues to be well controlled.</p>
          <p>Flipping onto slide number 12 and the longer-term outlook. Demand from China continues to be strong. We saw a number of supply constraints across the industries over the first half. Of course on the supply-side, the industry continues to struggle to bring new production on stream. Key input costs for the labor, capital equipments and consumables continue to rise and tighter supplies affecting particularly the smaller producers. These macro conditions suggest higher average prices for the remainder of this year and into 2012.</p>
          <p>However, as you know, particularly from a U.S. perspective there are key macro risks for this outlook, certainly the pace of credit tightening in developing countries and the risk of sovereign debt crisis, particularly in Europe, but also again as magnified over recent developments over the past few weeks in Washington DC. In the longer term our view remains absolutely intact and as I've said before we expect that over the next 15 to 20 years consumption trends will lead to a doubling in demand for iron ore, for copper, for aluminum and certainly for other commodities.</p>
          <p>And this is well demonstrated by the fact that China's Central and Western provinces continue to experience far lower GDP per capita and metals intensity rates than their Eastern neighbors. I was in Central China just last month and judging by the construction crane count, we were talking with mayors and senior &#x2013; senior leaders, certainly the expectation will be that, that cities like Chengdu and provinces like Sichuan will be growing at even the higher levels of rate than you'd see overall within China and this will certainly have a positive effect on the overall demand for our products.</p>
          <p>I think the combination of strong demand growth and industry supply challenges does give us confidence that real long-term prices and margins from amongst everything we produce will continue at elevated levels, albeit recognizing the elevated price volatility driven around things such as debt uncertainty.</p>
          <p>So our intention is to continue to ramp up our capital and we are growing into a strong demand outlook. The fact we have been ramping up our capital investments more than 5 billion spent on high-quality organic growth. At the end of June we've already had 6 billion of capital expenditure commitment, scheduled for payment during the second half. We do expect to continue ramping up our rate of spend in our portfolio of high quality organic growth projects through the second half of 2011 and into 2012.</p>
          <p>On slides 14 and 16, we've outlined projects we have currently underway, projects in advanced levels of study and projects in early stages of evaluation. For those of you who would have seen me in Barcelona back in May in the Miners Conference, you would have seen a few of the same slides that we had presented at Barcelona.</p>
          <p>I'm not going go into the details at this time on the projects but I do want to highlight that we currently have $26 billion of major capital projects underway and tens of billions of dollars of projects that are in advanced levels of study, in addition to those very, very large important projects that are at earlier stages of evaluation.</p>
          <p>Our project portfolios focus on large long life competitive projects, of course, a wide range of products right in line with the strategy of focusing on the development of Tier 1 ore bodies. I spent some time talking this morning about exploration, technology, innovation, and a graph of materials on slide number 17. I firmly believe the quality of our growth program is underpinned by the strategic focus and leadership in two vital areas, first exploration and second the change in related technology.</p>
          <p>Our leading organization of exploration professionals have added significant value to the outstanding growth portfolio we have, either through the initial discovery of tier one ore bodies, the evaluation of other people discoveries to optimize the resource and development plan, before they're get a look at by others or by applying their expertise to turn minor deposits and smaller mines into larger Tier 1 resources.</p>
          <p>We see real benefits from our operation Centre in Perth, many of you have had the opportunity to visit it, from which we control the whole of the Pilbara supply chain, including 14 operating mines, 1,400 kilometers of rail and three port terminals. And we're looking forward to moving to the number of advanced other technologies, including underground mine developments and intend to prototype some of these in Northparkes in Australia in 2012.</p>
          <p>These steps change technologies, along with others to potentially develop significant value over the coming years. And I believe our approach will allow us to gain access to some of the best ore bodies in the world, either through discovery or value optimization. We believe that this will provide us with competitive advantage over the years to come. Many of you have heard me say that in the future, ore bodies will be found in more difficult locations or they are going to be more technically complex or they're going to be more deeper or some combination of the above.</p>
          <p>And I certainly believe that having operator competencies that are better than anyone else's, having superior exploration competencies, having the ability to develop more complex ore bodies and certainly from a sustainable development prospective having the ability to engage with a whole host and range of stakeholder groups to get these things in production, we will be conferring competitive advantage and distinctive quality to Rio Tinto compared to our competitors.</p>
          <p>So moving onto slide 18, and I would like to turn a bit to our financial strategy. We've had many organic attractive opportunities to grow and as I described our ratio &#x2013; our rate of overall capital spend continues to increase. We will retain a prudent balance sheet that'll allow us to continue to invest as appropriate through the cycle in our in our first class growth projects and in other opportunities as they may arise.</p>
          <p>Today, besides of having to &#x2013; moving us to have to a single A rated credit rating, as you know has been a corporate objective, today we announced an increase of our buyback program of $2 billion to maintain our current pace of buybacks. We would expect to complete this program by the end the first quarter of 2012, subject of course to market conditions.</p>
          <p>Finally, the important priority for us remains dividend. We have declared an interim dividend equal to one half of the previous year's full year dividend as in accordance with previous policies and this leads to payment of $0.54 per share.</p>
          <p>So to conclude the first half of 2011 has been another exceptional period for Rio Tinto. We delivered record first half earnings, record first half EBITDA, and record operating cash flows. In the near term we expect the demand for products to remain strong within a volatile macroeconomic environment. At the same time the strengthening of the Australian and Canadian currencies and rising raw material costs will continue to put pressure on the industry. And we cannot be complacent no will we be and we'll ensure that our costs remain well controlled.</p>
          <p>So this is in the longer term, our growth continues to gather momentum. At the same time, we are able to balance our investment program with return of excess capital to our shareholders through our enhanced share buyback program. Six months ago I told you that Rio Tinto was entering 2011 in a position of strength. Our range of organic growth options is larger than ever. Our business is generating record cash flows like never before. Our people are continuing to deliver industry reading operational performance and project development, which will be particularly important as we see supply strength  -- strengthen the sector.</p>
          <p>In challenging macroeconomic and market conditions, those companies with the best assets, the best people, and the best operational capability will be very &#x2013; will be the most successful. I want to establish strategy by focusing our long life cost competitive expandable assets, together with our expertise and sustainable development exploration technology and innovation that allow us to enhance shareholder value over the longer term.</p>
          <p>Thank you with that, I'll now turn it over to you operator for any questions we may have from the audience.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentleman [Operators Instructions] Our first question comes from Tony Robson of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Hi, Tom, hope you've had time to scrape off the makeup after your TV interviews this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I always take off the makeup before I see you Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. At least for the comments, but I won't in front of the mixed audience. Thank you again as always for taking the time to have a U.S. call, especially after a good solid earnings release by the company.</p>
          <p>Two questions if I may, please? One a more boarder question, one at the micro level, you mentioned this morning that apart from some acquisitions like targets like Riversdale, you're still finding it very difficult to identify accessible Tier 1 assets in the marketplace plus commodity prices are still relatively high, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:45) low, does that what tends you to look at M&amp;A more than your organic growth, that will be my first question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Tony, again as I've said this morning, that they are difficult to identify, a lot of stuff that we see out there would not represent a recent discovery, certainly not a first tier. But things that had been retreaded over a couple of cycles and we just have to be quite realistic about that.</p>
          <p>I think, it also abides that even in some cases, where there are potentially attractive opportunities, generally there are in quite complicated corporate settings and the ability to execute actually is not necessarily a foregone conclusion. And certainly we saw that with Riversdale, where it was a challenging situation it was uncontested, but we had some large strategic shareholders that I'd say for the most part, our &#x2013; the financial communities would have been deeply skeptical about our ability to execute. And I'm very pleased with the <mark type="ph" /> BOP's (21:39) ability to get that done &#x2013; quite cleanly in a reasonable period of time. But again, the &#x2013; sometimes the execution can be more challenging than otherwise would be the case.</p>
          <p>We'll keep our eyes on the landscape, of course you would expect that we'd keep our eyes on the landscape. But we have to look at that in the backdrop of having what we believe to be the single best set of iron-ore expansion opportunities in the sector. I think that the copper projects we have are some of the best of the organic growth opportunities in the sector, particularly in Oyu Tolgoi, particularly in the near term and things like now with Riversdale, I think we have pretty attractive suite of coking coal growth options to look out for the future.</p>
          <p>So I'd say in these market conditions given what we see, we'll probably be &#x2013; the most attractive option for us would be to continue to develop our own internal organic growth options. Of course, we have to always look at that from time to time, circumstances can change, financial markets can change but right now, I'm comfortable with that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Second question would be on the operational level, I thought, and at the ton level your costs in the Pilbara <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:52) were really quite good. Obviously keeping costs under control there, but I was rather surprised by what I thought was a <mark type="ph" /> blood (22:56) in the cash costs for ton levels for Queensland and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:02) for coal even taking into account the wet weather in quarter one. Is Queensland also facing very high labor inflation rates and input costs even as bad as or worse as the Pilbara?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think first of all, thank you for your comments on the Pilbara. I will pass them on to the team in West Australia because I want them to do a better job next quarter, but I think that when we look at the challenges we faced in WA, with people, with contractors etc., I would agree that they're doing everything they can, in what was a challenging weather environment, to deliver the goods and &#x2013; but we are looking for them to do a better job in the second half.</p>
          <p>I think in Queensland, we have two issues. First of all Queensland actually has a challenging labor market in the coal fields that you would see in WA, you have quite a bit of turnover, quite a bit of mobility, increasing use of fly in, fly out. So we are seeing as much labor pressure in Queensland as we do in WA, and that was definitely then further hampered by the weather related items.</p>
          <p>Guy [Elliott] in his presentation would have presented a pie chart showing how we would see the $1.2 billion of cost increase being distributed and there was a big chunk of it which was weather-related, about $245 million, I think almost all of that would have been in Queensland. So that just gives you a sense that we had not only a reduction in tons in Queensland, but because of the variable fixed cost nature of production, we also had an increase on the cost side of $245 million in Queensland. I hope it's just a one-off weather-related factor, but we do have those other factors in Queensland to deal with</p>
          <p>And Tony, as I look forward into the future and I talk to people say in the gas business, there seem to be further pressures both in WA and Queensland on skills. So I think if we are challenged today, we're going to be even more challenged in the next year and the coming years as we see not only mining projects beginning to ramp up but a number of these very, very large gas projects both in Queensland and in WA also ramping up. They will all be competing for the same people.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much for having the time to chat with all of us here. Your presentation slide on future CapEx has four dollar signs for Simandou, which look like it was the biggest future capital project or it was just one distinct project, I suppose to an array of Pilbara? Would you talk a little bit about the potential magnitude, whether it's $10 billion or $20 billion or more? And give us a little bit of a background on the $700 million payment made on to finalize your arrangements in Guinea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, John (26:27). I think first of all, I think what we said maybe a few years ago, that we'll be looking at Simandou CapEx to be plus $10 billion and that was recognizing the fact that the mining actually was pretty straightforward, but you had a very, very challenging, from an engineering perspective &#x2013; infrastructure perspective with about 700 kilometers of rail and a fairly shallow setting for a port facility and I think what we had said at the time was about two-thirds of the total capital, we would expect to be infrastructure oriented.</p>
          <p>Of course with what we announced with the settlement of $700 million is that the expectation is that infrastructure component would be part financed through government, other loans that would be basically not part of the Rio Tinto's investment. And of course, the Simfer investment would be split between of course <mark type="ph" /> IFP (27:24) for custom component and then we would have been investing, we would expect to see both Chalco earning into their portion up to the yearend but also their contributing the 43% of what would have been our share, so I think what we have done with Simandou project is &#x2013; and part of this is with the agreement with the Chalco part of it is would be the $700 million settlement with the  government of Guinea as we have structured something that we can bring what I consider some of the best highest grade iron ore to market in as quickly &#x2013; quick in to market as we can, but in a way which provides I think a proper partnership where the partners can actually add value to the overall project, but certainly I would say it provides us a way of &#x2013; we are continuing to run it, but in a way that I think manages properly the range of risks that are associated with it.</p>
          <p>So I am very comfortable with moving this forward on that basis. The $700 million was really addressing a range of issues that we have had with the Guinea government, the objective of that was first of all to be making the payment in a way which was completely in compliance with international standards around transparency, compliant with EICI, certainly consistent with our own principles around the way we work and we would expect that the funds that will be &#x2013; those funds will be basically reinvested in Guinea on a basis that is consistent with upgrading infrastructure, et cetera. And certainly the government is taking some good advice from international multilaterals and that's certainly important for us for that to be seen to be done.</p>

          <p>Does that cover all your questions in there Johnny.</p>
          <p>What I just wanted to say that I have been out to Simandou about a couple of times over the past couple of months, last visit was in May, with the chairman of Chinalco, he was incredibly excited with the quality of the ore when you look at some of the road cuts you see basically it's blue and it's just blue hematite and the whole mountain is like the blue hematite. It gives you a sense of the quality of what's there.</p>
          <p>I think that we will be seeing ourselves doing in the coming months, we'll be again focusing on the proper engineering approach, make sure we get the right realignment, make sure we get the right port setting, make sure that the facilities are designed and put in the right place first, because again these facilities will be there, but will be working off and leveraging off for literally a decade. We want to get the engineering done correctly and I would like to get &#x2013; in the meantime I'd like to get as much production as we can early on in the picture, certainly on or before 2015. And I think it's quite important for us to be getting that tonnage into market as soon as we can.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, thank you again for taking my question. In terms of what I'd have to say is your rather heroic target of a 40% EBITDA margin in your aluminum business by 2014, do you have any price assumptions on that, top line realized price assumptions or are you really looking at those three factors in terms of cutting costs and rationalizing your portfolio a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tony, I think, first of all, we would be looking at that as something we would want to achieve over a long period of time, so I would say that, that is almost entirely driven by those three factors I mentioned, the continued cost improvement and transformation of existing businesses, key expansions that we applied, I think, the ones that we have talked about this morning would be completion of Yarwun 2, the Kitimat modernization and AP60 in the Saguenay, and then of course, I think, expanding our bauxite production in Weipa with South <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:37) project.</p>
          <p>Those are the key like five important capital projects and I think that certainly we are not going to give them <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:43) any additional capital sort of same capital to get margin beyond those particular projects and then of course we got to look at the entire portfolio relating to <mark type="ph" /> outstanding (31:55) assets to make sure they are fit for purpose and that they complete the best gainer for those and I think we have flagged a couple things that we did. Strategic review for the U.K. and Europe and of course we look at that entire portfolio.</p>
          <p>A year ago I put the 40% EBITDA targets out there as aspiration, I said that to basically our shareholders that we've got an aspiration objective, you are not going to see the right outcome. And I've been seeing over the past 12 months that the team we have are thinking recognizes that that's what they need to do they only to be able to attract capital to aluminum compared to other parts, if we have lots of investment opportunities within Rio Tinto and they need to be seen to be generating an EBITDA margin consistent with our other option &#x2013; our other investment choices and they translate the vision to part of their fixed planning so that's part of their core KPI metrics for the next few years.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I since above the forecast currencies that Guy showed this morning both into you EBITDA margin assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think those &#x2013; that forecasted currencies I think there shouldn't be too much off what I would say the general market acceptance have discovered those currencies and as to report I think in generally aligned with the fact that they forward-look for many of our commodities would be showing some diversion in those the years and this is just the natural reflection, the natural hedge of the Australian currency. Of course, there is a risk the Australian currency would stay high in those years out there, but that means commodity prices are probably high too and on balance they're probably positive for Rio Tinto.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:57) million to be spent at resolution, you mentioned La Granja and of course greater things are coming on in Mongolia. Are you far enough along in any of your valuations to determine which new copper mine would follow Tolgoi, whether it would be Resolution, La Granja or some other project, what that timing might be given the planning cycles, working more towards 2020's or 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that John, to some extent it depends on progress that's happening on the ground, but also the configuration of the ore bodies. They're both quite large dual bodies, they're both inarguably world class in size. Resolution of course has the benefit of some exceptionally nice grades, but again it's deeper so it will take a longer period of time to put in a shaft and the underground network to properly evaluate it and then begin into production. Whereas at La Granja, for the most part, it is a large, open-pit low strip ratio but also low grade ore body that doesn't have really a sufficient level byproduct credit to write home about.</p>
          <p>Now what we've been doing at La Granja, we've been focusing on one particular ore zone we have identified perceptively last year that we didn't think could focus our drill activity in the past 12 months and that is the certifying the higher grade zone. And may be smaller in size to get earlier production, but at a &#x2013; on the basis of a higher grade, smaller capital cost sort of operation, which will allow us to start building a team, so as getting the core of infrastructure and essentially creating a series of growth opportunities for expansion, but not in the immediate future.</p>
          <p>These are the types of things that we will be looking at. I think in both cases &#x2013; I tell you the drilling that has been going on both by the major, has been opening my eyes. So if anything, the geology for getting the more interest in how things are going based upon the recent drill result in those cases.</p>
          <p>So we have to be realistic about the fact that there are issues about bringing those into production and I wouldn't want to be over saying or over commenting, so we've been properly circumspect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think well again these are big resources, some would be out there throwing a date up there and so we'll worry about it when the date comes but we do have, I think a pretty good track record, is not overpromising. We're trying to give you a sense of what the issues are there, both clearly world class resources, part of the recent copper prices are so high now is that a lot of the new discoveries that have been made, actually they have a range of issues that prevents them from getting to market earlier, which is again I think in everyone's mind. By the way, that also reinforces the competitive advantage that Oyu Tolgoi brings to the table. Operator, anything else?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Tom. Prior to last few days, there seems to be lot of focus on the markets on inventory levels and restocking in China, what do you seeing and hearing on that front and how is your visibility on those things? How is today versus three months ago, six months ago, a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think I'd say that given sort of what people are worried about when look at their computer screens or look into CNBC or anything else like that, the physical demand has been remarkably resilient in China. If anything, I think over the past, just the past week or so we've seen strengthening iron ore pricing while some see a product that are weak and maybe some increase in stocks I'd say on balance the steel markets are doing well, particularly the rod and stuff that goes into the residential market. I think if you look at what I would call some of the inventory movements and say some of the premium I haven't been fussed about the copper and aluminum.</p>
          <p>As a matter of fact I am just hearing some reports over the last half day or so that the Chinese made it back in to market building up stocks, and I think what we're seeing while we are seeing aluminum prices dropping, they're still at relatively high levels and we actually see the stocks in China dropping on a week-by-week basis. So, the physical market in China and actually frankly the physical market on the global basis, hasn't necessarily reflected what I told the drama in the debt and equity markets. And that's a good time so far. We did talk a bit in our comments this morning about that we are watching the international concerns about sovereign debt, et cetera with concern as that everyone would be if we do want to be realistic, but we are not seeing in our market. A couple of years ago, when things began to unravel when the financial markets didn't hold up, I think we would found that our physical markets were lagging rather than a leading indicator. So, I guess, it wouldn't &#x2013; if there is something going wrong in the broader financial community, we wouldn't necessarily see it in the first move in the physical market.</p>
          <p>So, I believe our business, particularly given the fact that, our iron ore is almost entirely priced on a four-month lag, and it's a quarterly pricing. But what I see that's in the first quarter this year, it gives us essentially pricing of iron ore now, until early part of December, so we've got a pretty good idea that we obviously sell into those markets, what our year looks like for iron on pricing.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, it appears as though the company earned $6 billion from iron ore out of the $7.5 billion. And the iron ore segment is very well and all the other businesses added together are about the same as the first half of a year ago reflecting a 24% decline in copper production principally due to grades, and the weather disruptions and other costs. Do you think the performance of the company aside from iron ore was non recurring events due to weather and grade, do you perceive any of these issues is a problem, such as a combination of one penny or dollar or decline in grades and could you just sort of elaborate and framing this to simplify it or too harshly</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, I think you have captured pretty well sort of comparative performance at a high level, I do want to emphasize that iron ore and coal and uranium and the diamond business in our goal and our bauxite and aluminum production were all affected by quite extraordinary weather event in the first half, and I wouldn't hope to see those repeat themselves next year and I think I still remember the pictures in newspapers where Brisbane was flooded we had at one point 1,600 of our employees without offices to go into, because all six buildings were under water.</p>
          <p>We had levels of water in <mark type="ph" /> Emerald (42:37) in the coal mining area that those levels not seen for sixty years and also we had quite exceptional sea swell events and rain event in <mark type="ph" /> Billborough (42:48). I wouldn't want to be seen impacting again, and again I think that was &#x2013; these were series of one offs that effected a wide range of businesses and certainly dampening overall performance and showed up in both volumes that are inside. Again as I said Queensland cost variances in sort of half on half. I think also in terms of your point about the currency, well, that has been a headwind. Frankly that headwind has been part of the natural hedge with the commodities, so with commodity strong we're taking some of that off with currencies. I think what we've seen and this is not just seen in the past few years as back to a decade and these commodities were to soften, we would certainly see the opposite move on the currencies take place. So, that again is a natural mitigating factor.</p>
          <p>I am concerned about labor rates and we do work on focusing productivity there on in terms of the copper grade decline while again these mines are getting mature particularly Grasberg which is moving into an underground phase. We will be looking at S&amp;B, we'll be looking at expansion, they're will be looking at ever and ever lower grades and again the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:07) getting deeper and deeper and deeper.</p>
          <p>With that all being said, what we saw in term of great decline for this year had been well planned as part of the mine plant and it's matched by great increase next year. So, again I would necessarily see that is something that you can write that in for 2012. John I think a year ago, have you probably asked me the question is this as good as it gets. With some of the same half and half factors on -probably went through the same explanation on the case by case basis. But last year in August of 2010, it certainly welcome as soon as we get.</p>

          <p>Thanks. We're looking further good results on the operations &#x2013; no natural catastrophes</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, may be if I just say that if you look at what we have guided for iron ore production for the full year that means a pretty strong second half and so far so good. Operator?</p>
        </plist>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Mr. Tom Albanese, we have no further questions at this point of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much and I appreciate all of you taking the time. We've had the pretty good audience today. Again, I think, everyone's probably either thinking about what's going on in Washington DC and what's going on in Greece or Italy, or what's going on the beach right now. So, the iron ore may not be the highest thing on people's general agenda, but from our perspective, we are continuing to draw a strong market. We are continuing to see those in &#x2013; and anticipate continuing to see those over the coming months. Our operations have recovered quite well from the difficult weather conditions and as we move in to the second half, I think, again we are seeing some of the things that we want to see beginning to take place.</p>
          <p>We are certainly mindful of the broader market conditions, but we are also recognizing in the bigger picture, we have got literally billions of people that are wanting more and more of our products and based upon part of which we talked about today, the supply is not going to necessarily grow to the rate that's amenable growth. So, we are going to continue to focus on those top quality projects.</p>
          <p>And while we continue to focus on those top quality projects, while we make $2 billion plus a month of cash flows, we are in a position to return excess cash to our shareholder &#x2013; capital to our shareholders and that's exactly what we be announced today by accelerating a $5 billion share buybacks from the end of 2012 to a $7 billion share buyback by the end of the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much operator and thank you audience.</p>
