        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As always we'll be dividing the presentation into four parts. In the first point I'll cover the basic management drivers for Q3. Then in the second point I will review the group's results. And the third point I will introduce our CFO, Mr. Jose Antonio Alvarez. And he'll analyze the results to different business areas in more detail. And finally I will conclude with some highlights about the year and about our priorities for the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>First point I'd like to convey is that the Santander has once again had an excellent quarter in an environment which is still difficult for the banking business. We can summarize the evolution the management aspects as follows. First the group's ability to continue to generate high recon profits, the solid business model of the Santander, the right management of the basic business drivers and their consistent diversification generated a recurring profit without capital gains of &#x20AC;2.221 billion in the quarter which brings us up to over &#x20AC;6.7 billion in nine months. The second point is the strong balance sheet and the group's solvency. All the capital gains obtained in the exchange offers and in the purchase of securitization bonds in the quarter as well as the favorable impact via capital gains and on the capital ratio of Santander's Brazil IPO in October are being fully assigned to provisions to strengthen the balance sheet mostly for generic loan losses and to improve our capital ratios.</p>
          <p>With this operation which we will see later which is not yet in the figures for September the generic provisions for loan losses will amount to 7.487 billion and our core capital would be at 8.4%. And the third point that the solid recurrent results on capital gains enable us to maintain our payout policy and guarantee shareholders high returns. We've closed the quarter with an ordinary profit of 2.21 billion and although this figure is slightly below Q2's as usual because of seasonal factors in the European summer means that for the first time in the year we have a number higher than that for same quarter of 2008 and further improves the quarter-on-quarter trend.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the chart we began the year with a 5% fall with respect to the first quarter of 2008. In the second the decline was only of 4% and in this third we're slightly over the third quarter last year and everything indicates that the trend will continue in Q4. With that the accumulated profit up to September was 6.74 billion which puts it on track to meet our target for the whole of the year.</p>
          <p>These profits I've mentioned and as I will stress are all ordinary. They are not extraordinary impacts from any of the operations I've mentioned. And these are profits that are driven by all our operating areas and the first thing I'd like to mention is the great diversity of our business. The Santander and Banesto branch networks represent 27% of our profits; Brazil represents 20% already and the U.K. 16%. The rest, Europe retail, Europe global and the rest of Latin America account for between 10 and 15%. This diversification bolsters the group's ability to withstand the current cycle.</p>
          <p>On this slide you can see the performance in Q3 and that's by geographic area, as you can see. The retail units in Continental Europe grew their earnings by 11% over the Q3 of 2008. In the U.K. once again we've demonstrated this quarter the sustainability of our business, Abbey has continued to grow strongly, plus the very positive contributions of Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley.</p>
          <p>Latin America was highly affected by the impact of exchange rates against the dollar, but in constant rates Brazil has been on a clear upward trend in the last few quarters and is already 42% above the profit of 2008. The rest of Latin America has felt the impact of our exit from Venezuela, as it has not contributed for the last two quarters, but the third quarter is basically stable without taking into account these discontinued operations. Lastly, I will also underscore the excellent performance in the last quarter of global wholesale banking. We've taken advantage of market opportunities and the gaps left by other competitors with very strict risk liquidity and capital management, as our CFO will discuss later.</p>
          <p>Second point I'd like to mention is the strength of our balance sheet in Q3 and in October we've had operations generating extraordinary capital gain of &#x20AC;2.247 billion, as follows. For the exchange of convertible issues 724 million, for purchases of secularization bonds 99 million and from the Brazilian IPO 1.424 billion. All of this will strengthen our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the chart you can see a first indication of how these funds will be applied at the end of the year. For our generic loan-loss provisions 1.4 billion. For real estate acquired estimated on the basis of the first results of the appraisals we're making, and which we will complete by the end of the year 600 million. The 600 million represent 15% of the book value in September which is 4.04 billion which has declined already in the quarter since the beginning of June it was 4.17. The remaining 1.2 billion will be assigned or allocated to other funds yet to be defined such as restructuring our latest acquisitions, early retirements and so on. The definitive distribution will be announced at the end of the year as we always do.</p>
          <p>As for loan-loss provisions, at the end of September we totaled 16.619 billion after rising in the quarter by 900 million from normal business performance. Of these, 6.069 billion are generic. In the quarter there's been a decline in Spain almost fully offset by the increases in Mexico, Brazil and in the U.K. If we add the 1.4 billion, which we will allocate to generic provisions, we obtained a result of 18 billion with 7.469 billion in generic. Of this amount Spain accounts for almost four billion, which means recovering or rebuilding the fund that we had at the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>As for our capital ratios, we've closed September with a core capital of 7.7%. In the quarter we have once again improved it by 20 basis points, and we have the capacity to keep on generating between 10 and 15 basis points of capital each quarter in the current environment of smaller increases in risk assets. Furthermore, after including the positive impact of the Brazilian IPO and the capital increase to be carried out in November to remunerate shareholders who have opted to receive the second interim dividend in the form of shares; the ratio will be strengthened further and will reach 8.4%.</p>
          <p>Three comments about this ratio; it is a very solid ratio, particularly taking into account the low risk of our plain vanilla balance sheet on our retail profile. These capital levels of about 8.5% are a considerable cushion for potential regulatory changes in capital requirements and the uncertainty which still remains in the macroeconomic scenario. And the third point is that we have achieved it without any sort of public funding or aid.</p>
          <p>Point three in my presentation is our ability to maintain our pay-out policy. This is the consequence of the two previous points, generation of earnings and solid capital ratios, and as reflected in our three most important aspects for our shareholders. We continue with our traditional policy allocation to dividends about 50% of the group's net ordinary profit. As you know, our goal for this year is to allocate to dividends the same amount as in 2008, 4.812 billion.</p>
          <p>Additionally we are maintaining a trend in the last years of constant rises in the book value per share. And lastly, our shareholder return, share price plus dividends, is much higher than that of our competitors, both in the long and the medium and the short term. In all of them, we are in leading positions and in the last 12 months we have reached the number one spot.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our income statement, I'd like to emphasize that this income statement shows only ordinary profit. It does not include the extraordinary results that are discussed above. Moreover, and as we've done in previous quarters, the first column of changes is the accounting column and therefore reflects the favorable impact of our increased perimeter and the negative effect of exchange rates. Therefore, we have included a second column which excludes the perimeter and exchange rate effect in order to facilitate better analysis of the underlying performance of our income statement.</p>
          <p>The income statement demonstrates the Santander's management priorities which are, first, very active spread management underscored by growth in our net interest income, offsetting the fall in fee income more affected by reduced business.</p>
          <p>Second point, strong cost discipline. Costs have remained flat with growth rates close to zero or even negative in all units. These costs are beginning to be favorably impacted by the synergies of the ongoing integration. The result of this revenue and cost improvement are further gain in our efficiency or cost income ratio and in our net operating income which has grown by 20% both on a like-for-like basis and also including the impact of exchange rates and incorporations.</p>
          <p>Third point is active management risk and recoveries which are beginning to show positive signs. The growth in provisions has slowed in the last two quarters, although it's still high in comparison with 2008 figures. In some way, our net operating income after provisions is 7.8% higher which as we will see now compares very well with previous quarters and is I think the best example of the underlying strength of our business.</p>
          <p>If we compare these percentages with the ones we reported in previous quarters, we see that the picture is improving. Our basic revenues continue to be solid and continue to grow overall at 10, 11%. Our costs are still shrinking. We've moved from 2% growth in the first quarter to zero growth for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Provisions continued to grow at a strong yearly pace, but there's a clear downward trend in the year. We started with a 68% increase at the beginning of the year, we're already now at only 45%. As a result, our net operating income after provisions, which declined by 2% in Q1 rose by 4% in the semester, and is up almost 8% in the first nine months, which ended September.</p>
          <p>I will now look at each of the main lines of our income statement. First, I'll speak about the robustness of our most commercial revenues, but if net interest income without dividend fee income, insurance revenues, all of which have had a very consistent quarterly performance.</p>
          <p>Our net interest income is more solid while fee income has been harder hit in some of its lines by the environment or by the fund capturing strategy for load, which has mostly affected those related to securities and mutual funds.</p>
          <p>In the future, however, it is to be expected that this trend will ease. And that there will be lower growth rates in our net interest income, but a better evolution of our fee income. Indeed this trend appears to have started already in fee income, since Q3 was already better than Q2 in units like Banesto, in the U.K. and Latin America.</p>
          <p>If we look at the charts of each of the areas, at the bottom of the slide, we can see that even in a difficult scenario like that of the last quarter, the UK and Latin American have maintained their growth trend and Europe has remained quite stable in the year.</p>
          <p>Second basic driver for our results is cost containment and excluding the perimeter and exchange rate effects, costs have remained completely flat, have grown 0% in comparison with 2008 and this reflects the good performance of all the units with growth rates &#x2013; costs at around zero in the first nine months, especially Brazil with a 4% drop. This implies as Jose Antonio Alvarez will explain that several units have already registered negative growth rates of their expenses in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And this successful cost containment what's involved is our usual controls, plus of course the impact of the first synergies from the integrations were carrying out. We are optimistic that we will achieve or even surpass our initial forecast for 2009.</p>
          <p>With that, we continue to improve our efficiency, our cost income ratio, which is at 41.3% for the group, below 40 without the latest acquisitions. And all the large areas have improved significantly.</p>
          <p>The third pillar, I'll mention are provisions. The global economic downturn has affected every country and has led naturally to an erosion of credit quality and a decrease (sic) [increase] in loan loss provisions everywhere. In the group, last quarter they increased by 44%, year-on-year, but the increase is only of 26% if we exclude the perimeter effect.</p>
          <p>Looking by geographies of these increases and starting with the left hand side, specific provisions we see that there is nothing new to add with respect to previous quarters. There's still a widespread rise, with a larger impact in Spain, both in retail networks and in consumer lending.</p>
          <p>Additionally there is a growth due to our perimeter effect reflected in Europe consumer, the UK and Sovereign, it's the generic provisions. And the group releases in their first nine months, amounted to 123 million mainly for Spain in our retail networks and also Global Banking and Markets, since the rest of the group's unit continue to build provisions. The generic provision for consumer credit remained in line with our forecast for the year, which we reported in previous quarters.</p>
          <p>In the current environment, the group's NPL ratio is at 3.03%, and our coverage at 73%. By area, the NPL ratio overall for all of our businesses in Spain is at 2.98%, Santander UK is at 1.65%, which is lower because of the bigger mortgage component and Latin America is at 4.2% with a coverage of over 100%.</p>
          <p>Some comments on these figures, coverage for the whole group rose in Q3 after several periods' reduction. Also since these figures are up to September, they do not include the 1.4 billion of capital gains that will be assigned to generic provisions. With them the group's and Spain's coverage will rise by around six percentage points and 16 percentage points respectively.</p>
          <p>Coverage, particularly in the U.K. but also Spain is affected by the weight of mortgage balances, which require fewer provisions as they have collateral guarantees which are not included here. In this sense, the average loan-to-value of residential mortgages in Spain and the U.K. is 52% and 53% respectively or in other words they have additional coverage with collateral of 190%. For our competitors and as we have shown in previous quarters we compare very favorably at the group level, but also very favorably in our three major geographies, Spain, the U.K. and Latin America. In all of them we compare very well, very favorably with our peers.</p>
          <p>After this general overview of the group, Jose Antonio Alvarez will review the business area.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. As we do in every presentation I'm going to give you more details on the different businesses. As usual, we're going to begin with the different geographical areas, starting by Continental Europe where the attributable profit for the year was 3.986 billion, 15% more than in 2008 without the perimeter effect. And this is backed by growth in terms that it's growing at two digits, at 10% and that together with flat costs allows us to increase our net operating income by 16% which absorbed the higher provisions in the segment operating income extra provisions by 15%. So the profits and the net operating income are better than in 2008. Although certain investments in the second quarter of 2009, the CEO mentioned that there was a seasonality effect because of the summer and the worse result in the wholesale business after a record second quarter with some very significant deals.</p>
          <p>We had the four large retail units joined us, income and net operating income increased by more than 10% while profit was only 3% higher, but let me separate this into two areas. The Santander branch network. The Banesto in Portugal also branches which have similar results. The gross income rose moderately by between two and 5%. This is a result of still a high net interest income, although they are coming down and also reduced fee income basically due to mutual funds. The three networks also have flat costs, which means that the net operating income is going at higher levels and also allows us to absorb the higher provision. There's a stronger growth in the recurring profit of the Santander branch network from variations in our provisions and an increase at Banesto, because at the group level it's extraordinary allocation of 115.5 million was carried out with extraordinary capital gains already mentioned in the presentation.</p>
          <p>Santander consumer finance is a particularly complicated environment and they are seeing strong growth and gross income and net operating income, 14 and 19% respectively, if we exclude the perimeter effect. And although profit was lower because of higher provisions, the trend is frankly very good as we will see later on in more detail when we talk about this business specifically. Okay, so we are doubling our results as compared to last year.</p>
          <p>If we look now at the different aspects of the Santander branch network, we see that there is good overall management of revenues, cost and recoveries against the backdrop of recession. And the volumes are helping us. Loans are flat. The net interest income is falling down a bit as the assets and liabilities are officiating. The rest of revenues, fee income and gains, financial transactions fell by around 30% and there's also a seasonal effect because of the marketing of some products in 2008 particularly in insurance and securities. Cost has remained flat since the start of 2008 with a further gain in the efficiency ratio year-on-year. And net operating income after provisions will grow 13% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>It is true that all the measures that we took are already showing positive results in the volume of entries as well as in recoveries which show great quality. In any case the market environment is still what it is and for the next few quarters despite this improvement we still believe that NPLs will continue to rise in the retail business in Spain.</p>
          <p>Banesto in the presentation already gave the main details. I would just mention here that Banesto has enjoyed a good third quarter and fulfilled its goals. Its credit quality ratios are much better than the market. The cost are under control and the net operating income after provisions increased faster in the first nine months than in the first half. With regards to Santander Consumer Finance, here there has been a change in the quarter because of the GE real business. This affects basically the revenue, although without perimeter, net operating income is also increasing.</p>
          <p>The second idea is that this area has performed very well in the last two quarters basically because of an improvement in the spreads. As you can see the spread on loans is going up consistently quarter-after-quarter. A good performance of cost, they have remained flat without the perimeter effects and also aided by the synergies that we are obtaining lately. Risk is being managed very actively. We can see that the entries and provisions are in level of 15% less than at the end of 2008 and the absorption of revisions of the net interest income is up two-thirds of this income and the last two quarters it has performed very well. And the &#x2013; given the context of the market, we can say that the performance of the Consumer Finance business has been reasonably good.</p>
          <p>Finally in the last area in Continental Europe that I'd like to cover is Portugal, which has a similar trend. Although there has been moderate growth in revenues and profits, the SME business is going up 7%, and this is thanks to the Portuguese government which has a program called In Invest, which is founded and formulated by the government. The growth in deposits is slowing, although we've seen a recovery in the past few months of the mutual funds, although it's still negative year-on-year. Costs remain flat and provisions have been affected by the cycle and NPL ratio remains at around 2%.</p>
          <p>And for now we take a look at the second geographical area, the United Kingdom, there's excellent performance there in terms of revenue and profits. We have been seeing this quarter after quarter, high growth in all the items of the income statement and here we have the perimeter effect but without the perimeter effect attributable profit growth at 28%, and all of this in sterling. Gross income on like-for-like basis increased 24% in sterling. Control of cost enabled the net operating incomes to keep growing at 45% on a like-for-like basis. And there is a positive contribution in the attributable profit of Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley of 219 million pounds in the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Where does this come from? Why do we get these consistent results and in our opinion it's sustainable results? Well the net operating income has performed very well. First of all the spreads on assets are going up quarter-after-quarter, and this improvement is in the new production as well as in the retention of loan mortgages at the standard variable rate the  SER apart from asset management of spreads and deposits and hedging policy.</p>
          <p>Then the costs we are in regards to the job, Abbey has been managing first of all for several years and its efficiency ratio is slightly over 40%. We were worst in the industry and now it's becoming one of the best banks in the industry. And our credit quality is significantly better than that of the markets with banks presence in high-risk products buy to let and the self-certified products with documentation provided by the customer. So these trends are the three elements and there is a fourth element which has a very good performance in the business. Particularly in this last quarter, it's been particularly good.</p>
          <p>The mortgage growth,  the mortgage stock because what we have here are residential mortgages while it's growing 2% although most of the growth has taken place in the last quarter the deposits and investments have grown at rates of 14%. In the last quarter there has been an increase of almost 6 billion, 5.8 billion in deposits and 800 million in investment products. Also those two companies although the stock points to a growth of 1% almost slightly we must bear in mind that here there are two different things, we have the products or segments that we are no longer working with order book for example that was &#xA3;2 billion in the books and additionally to that some of these segments where we've been showing interest to continue with explaining that will give us an 11% growth.</p>
          <p>In UPL, our policy, our traditional policy is to be very selective. We discontinued Decaho business and we're being very selective in this market and portfolio has been decreasing significantly there. And then our securities portfolio which shows what we save when we acquired BNL, a reduction of 4 billion minus 27%. Lastly the progress made in integration while scheduled there and throughout 2010 we will unify the brand, we'll change the brands to the Santander brand that has already happened in the credit card business. Now this business is using the Santander brand.</p>
          <p>In Latin America attributable profits, we were speaking of dollars, $3.816 billion, 12% less than in 2008 because of the exchange rate impact which subtracts 18 points. In constant dollars the growth of profit has been 6%. From now on, we'll be referring to the column without the impact of exchange rate. The net operating income grows at 28%, revenue 18% and the costs fall 2%. This was to absorb the highest provisions. Later on, we'll take a look at this by country.</p>
          <p>We have seen some improvements in some countries in this regard. The net operating income growth, 10%. In the first half, we see 6% more in constant dollars, which means that this has been the best quarter by far in the last two years. If we take a look at the next item, this snapshot, I think, shows a very good performance of the region as a whole. Revenue is 50% up and net operating income almost 35%, attributable profit 16%. With the exception of Mexico which remains flat in revenue and costs. With the performance of costs, we will see this in further detail later which we have double-digit growth in the net operating income which will point out Brazil here whose improvement quarter-to-quarter has been very important and in fact this quarter we are going at 22% and the previous quarter, I think, it was 12% and in the first one repeating as the last quarter of 2008. Also good performance in the other countries that are included in the rest of the area, as we call it, Argentina, Uruguay or the others, which Uruguay is, the others, with the exception of Santander Private Banking, 22% down, 153 million.</p>
          <p>If you look at it country-by-country in Brazil attributable profit was at $2.167 billion after our payment in the quarter $850 million. There is great strength of the net operating income because our retail banking as well as global business as income growth and high double digits and costs decline sharply. So the net operating income is almost 40% and the attributable profit which goes up 22%. In the third quarter the results from VisaNet's green shoe were recorded which were $131 million which have been assigned to generic provisions for loan losses with no impact on the profit, but we can see an increase in trading gain which is due to the green shoe impact.</p>
          <p>The result of 22% is a combination of good spread management, volumes in line with what is happening, although lending in Brazil as a whole is growing at very good rate. This is due to the public banks to their policy. We are growing at the same level, although there are internal differences. In our case we're growing well at 13% among individuals, but in car finance that is not growing that much, as well as other segments that aren't growing that much. They're focusing more on deposits or are going well at site deposits, but the terms times and deposits in Brazil remain flat and then strong reduction in operating costs. We are at minus 4% in local currency, bear in mind that is Brazil to give you an idea of the intensity there. It has inflations of 4 or 5%. So minus 4% is a very good figure. The integration is going very well and synergies according to schedule.</p>
          <p>Good risk management has been an increase in the NPO rate in the country. There's been an increase in unemployment and this affects our business, but in the last few months things seem to be picking up and it looks like there might be a certain change in the trend in the deterioration of credit quality. Our provisions remain stable, about 50% of the net operating income.</p>
          <p>Mexico, this year is being a difficult year in Mexico. Lending has fallen. The spreads as well as the volumes depend a great deal on the credit card business, which has significant falls in volume, and that has an impact on our spreads. It's bringing down the spreads. Nevertheless cost management, while we have two, we have double-digit costs and now we have brought that down, but if we look at the sequential performance, we see that quarter-to-quarter on the one hand the net entries into NPLs are falling. The level of effort in provisions, we are now at levels of 45% of net operating income in provisions. So quarter-to-quarter, the net operating income after provisions is going up, and probably towards the end of the year the comparison will be better than that, minus 25%, which we are showing this quarter because of how weak the fourth quarter of 2008 was.</p>
          <p>And now the case of Chile, $553 million in nine months in profit, basically in line with last year's results. Here there are several things that I should mention. Customer revenues are growing at 10%. Also site deposits are growing and &#x2013; but nevertheless, and we have mentioned this in previous quarter, the impact of inflation, the negative impact of the U.S. on the net interest income partly offset by gains on financial transactions with hedging of inflation and interest rates, but this is one of the lowest figures we've had 70 million on gross income. Profits have declined sharply, negative quarter-on-quarter as compared to 8% at 2008. So as inflation figures are normal or positive, we think the unit will be recovered.</p>
          <p>Corporate Activities, one billion difference between last year and this year. There you see the differences less dividends and income by the equity-accounted method, then the charge for Metrovacesa in the first quarter, reduced gains on financial transactions, the cost, the rental from the leaseback of the investments and other minor items and taxes for another 250 million less</p>
          <p>If we look at the secondary segments, retail banking, we are improving our net operating income and in the last quarter also our attributable profit. I'd like to focus more on wholesale banking. Although the quarter has been weaker than in the previous one, because the previous one has been exceptional, even so, revenues growing at 36%, so profit declined at more than 80%. The explanation here is the following.</p>
          <p>I'm going to try to summarize the next few slides, how we can explain this performance. The first aspect is that our wholesale business returned a good deal on the retail branches and the customer revenues accounted for close to 90% of the areas total revenues while we generate this revenue well in our core markets Spain, Brazil and the U.K. which account for almost 80% of the total. These revenues come from a diversified portfolio of products. The FX business and interest rate represents one billion or about 30% of the revenue. Investment banking is falling but that's a very small part of it. And the securities business, while it's still far from levels we had before the crisis, so there's a generation of the revenue with very good growth and well diversified.</p>
          <p>The second aspect is good cost management. Costs are falling 11% or 12% over the first nine months of 2008. This mean an adjustment in capacity to the environment and this can be seen in the fall of cost. The third aspect is that this has not been done with an increase of our exposure because loans to customers remained basically stable and these loans come from different parts of the world, basically the U.K., Spain and Brazil &#x20AC;59 billion, and risk weighted assets of the area have fallen in the last year, therefore very good performance without increasing global risk.</p>
          <p>And finally Asset Management and Insurance. Two trends here. Total revenue from investment funds and insurance amounted to 2.709 billion in the first nine months, 9% of the core revenues of the operating areas. Most of it was fees come from distribution recorded in the networks. Now the trend, particularly in mutual funds, seems to have changed. Assets under management we fell to levels of 100 billion from 130, and in the last two quarters, the trend is now positive and now we have &#x20AC;111 billion, therefore this trend would it seems to consolidate, will change the generation of revenue in the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>With regards to insurance, excellent performance in both Germany and the U.K., weaker in Spain. That depends on the liability policy if instead of selling bank deposits. We sell savings products that are linked to insurance, or the other way around. Last thing we saw about sub-insurance products and now we're selling more at conventional deposits.</p>
          <p>Finally a few words on Sovereign while Sovereign has reached break-even point right now, eight months here global consolidation. If we look at the trends they're reasonably good. We see that revenue is growing 9%, 3% in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter last year. Costs continue to fall 3% over the second quarter. $238 million, $221 million in loan losses, that is more than the volume that we are making provisions for. So this is why I say we have reached break-even point, and funds for loan losses have reached to 3.6%, which means that we compared very well with our peers. We are in the top five among the 15 peers which we compare ourselves with in the United States. Therefore these are very good trends, and right now the bank has reached break-even point.</p>
          <p>In terms of volume you will remember when we talked about the offering there were some businesses which we didn't consider to be core for us, therefore there are businesses that we have discontinued. The car financing business would have fall in the portfolio of 30%, and we have also discontinued parts of the business that they call Commercial and Industrial, which are not in Sovereign's footprint, it would have fall in these portfolios of about 15%. So there has been fall in lending because of discontinuing these businesses, together with the fact that the demand for credit right now in the U.S. is very weak, and this also has an impact, but most of it is due to the fact that we have discontinued these businesses.</p>
          <p>In terms of deposits, site deposits these are all performing well, and the fall of expensive deposits last year the bank raised a certain amount of deposits, which now we're being more demanding in terms of their return, and therefore there has been a fall in the volume of term deposits, particularly in the last quarter. The liquidity of the bank is very good. It is in the same situation that we had a year ago where our raising deposits was essential for the bank.</p>
          <p>After this overview, let me give back the phone to our CEO, so that he can give you the conclusions of the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will conclude by giving you a summary of the presentation. In this difficult context, like in this year's difficult context we have nevertheless managed to win it all, because we've managed to obtain a quarterly recurring profit of over 2.2 billion, which brings the total for the first nine months up to 6.74 billion, and this takes the advantages of our diversification, which this year makes the U.K., Brazil and GBM our main earning drivers &#x2013; also our ability to manage and extract value from the integrations that are underway and the Group synergies.</p>
          <p>Second element in the success is the strengthening of our balance sheet, thanks to our high capacity to build provisions. Our net operating income is 2.4 times the provisions because we have managed to generate a lot of free capital between 10 and 15 basis points per quarter and because we've been able to allocate extraordinary capital gains to strengthen our balance sheet. As a result our generic provisions for loan losses are now up to 7.5 billion and our core capital is at 8.4%.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, generate more value for shareholder consistently by sustained increases in the underlying value of the share or book value, which in September was already 8% above that of the end of 2008 and a sustainable payout policy which enables us to distribute a large volume of dividends to our shareholders each quarter. The two dividend charged to  2009 already amount to 2.1 billion, and a total shareholder return which is higher than the market. So, these three successes that few peer banks can match and which we have achieved while remaining on track to attain the targets for the year.</p>
          <p>Looking towards the coming quarter, our management will continue to focus on our traditional management drivers or traditional management model but obviously adapted to the macroeconomic situation in each of the countries where we operate. And from this point of view it seems that from the macroeconomic perspective, we will be seeing two different rates of recovery, slower in Europe and the U.S., but more v-shaped, faster in Latin America, but especially in Brazil with growth rates for 2010 of around 5%. As the recovery gets underway in the different geographies we will probably see interest rates go from low and stable where they are now, to higher interest rates.</p>
          <p>In this context the Santander's management drivers will become increasingly important, depending on each scenario. The greatest change will occur in the revenues where the management of spreads, volumes and fees will be adapted to the growth rates in each country. In all of the geographies we will continue to focus on cost containment, containing our &#x2013; and managing our profits and obtaining synergies, and also we'll focus on integrating the units in order to accelerate their contribution to the business. Another key point will be risk management and recoveries in an environment where it still seems premature to anticipate a full improvision.</p>
          <p>We will still need more time to see the recovery bring improvement in credit quality and therefore we will still see some rising NPL rates in some markets in coming quarters. As usual we will be very strict and disciplined in our use of liquidity and capital and all of that means we face the end of the year and the beginning of next year with optimism. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Good morning. We're going to begin with the Q&amp;A session. As always we will begin with those that we have been receiving from the Internet and as we have done in the last couple of quarters we'll be organizing the questions by subjects, so we can deal with them in a logical order.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first of these has to do with situation and outlook for 2010 and there's a question from Antonio Ramirez from Keefe about whether we're interested in acquiring the Royal Bank's branch network, which will be available. Any other assets we might be interested in, in the U.K. and can we say anything about our strategy for the SME and corporate segments? That's all for the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in the U.K. we've announced and in fact in some of the presentations I have &#x2013; we've already underscored that our growth strategy there is a clear organic growth strategy and has been for a year and a half already. We have been investing in growth internally through investment in the teams in technology; the acquisition of Alliance &amp; Leicester has helped us make a major leap. Because as you know, they had a significant SME and corporate unit, and so we're in that process which by its own nature is not too fast because organic growth takes longer, but that is and has been the strategy that we have been following and we'll continue to follow in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is another question about capital, and that's whether we're planning any additional IPOs for any of our units, and also about this concept, can we give any final data about the Brazilian IPO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not planning any additional IPOs, haven't thought of it, not at all a consideration right now. And the final number I think is 81.4%, if I'm not mistaken, around that. The latest figure we had I think was 81.4. 81.4 who have opted for shares instead of cash in the dividend, interim dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Another question from Antonio Ramirez, how we see Spain for 2010, financial margin and growth of volumes and the ownership of the GAAP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Spain in 2010, we are currently in the middle of a budgetary exercise through this last half, date of October and November and we'll have a clearer picture then. Without going into too much detail because again we don't have the numbers in a lot of detail yet, but clearly next year will be a year in which volumes will not grow, will be either flat or dropping, asset volumes that is. I better say volumes will obviously grow because the Spanish economy is in a deleveraging phase.</p>
          <p>We're seeing already this year strong growth of savings and much less growth of lending, and that will continue quite probably during 2010, so very little growth in lending or even &#x2013; perhaps even a slight decrease in lending. But on the contrary, strong growth in deposits, the customer funded side. What form will that take will be deposit or transaction balances or investment funds, we'll have to see. That's so far as volume.</p>
          <p>So far as margins, we will obviously, and given this situation with volumes, we will have some weakness in our net interest income naturally as lending shrinks. But on the contrary we think that we will once again see a normal performance of fees and commissions. They dropped a great deal in 2009, but also that was part of &#x2013; in 2009, rather &#x2013; but that was part of our product policy because we decreased our presence in investment funds, and that means less fee income. But in 2010 we will see a recovery of gross levels in fee income but our financial &#x2013; our net interest income will decrease.</p>
          <p>Net, probably a slight reduction overall because of the combined effect of volumes, a drop in net interest income and the rise in fee income, so overall I guess a slight reduction in our gross margin if we add up these two concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There are several analysts. Carlos Berastain from Deutsche Bank, <mark type="inaudible" /> from Fidentiis and Geoff Dawes from FPK and Francisco Riquel, from Cheuvreux who are asking about any write-offs. And how do we explain devolution write-offs. Anything worth mentioning? All the questions are about &#x2013; are requesting an explanation around that point and about risk. Carlos Berastain is also asking as <mark type="inaudible" /> from Fidentiis about the increase in cost of risk. Specifically in the U.K., if there is any particular factor how we predict the cost of risk and how it will evolve in the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I can't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head perhaps Jose Antonio can tell us more. But it's the normal effect of a growth in provisions; it's almost automatic as provisions grow and require more allocation scheduled. Once that cycle ends that means eventually transferred to write-offs but we don't have anything any different from the normal cycle, of these things,  it's very automatic. There's nothing, there's no event or anything that justifies that number beyond the usual cycle. That's the way it works, you get NPLs, you can use provisions, you use them up in growing percentages until you get to 100% and that's moved to write-offs.</p>
          <p>As for lending, there's nothing in particular to say. I don't have the impression that the cost of risk has grown very significantly. In the U.K. there was last year a release of generic provisions because of the foreign investment by Global Wholesale Banking and Markets, so some generic provisions were freed up. And so if we compare this year with that quarter, it may seem as if the provisions have grown, but they haven't actually really and there's no underlying worsening of risk quality. I don't really get the point of the question, whether they see something different or other than what I'm saying because we don't see anything in particular. In the presentation for the U.K., you have the breakdown of how those generic provisions were recovered in the second quarter '09 and in the third, and they have the explanation of each of those items that the CEO has just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Santiago Lopez from Credit Suisse is asking about restructurings in 2008 and '09, what percentage of recoveries in the Santander network are cash? Can we elaborate a little bit about this whole concept of restructuring in recoveries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'll just give you a couple of comments and then I'll give Jose Antonio Alvarez the floor. Basically we have been recovering between 60 and 65% of defaults. Two-thirds are being recovered in cash, the remaining third, in &#x2013; on occasions that's basically the number, so the remainder, about 20% or so of defaults are being restructured or refinanced with very strict criteria because the Bank of Spain has very strict criteria about how you may restructure or refinance these operations, as you all know. And they require that we comply as usual very strictly. That's the first point.</p>
          <p>Second point, restructuring or refinance does not mean that these items are no longer in default because that has nothing to do with it. Still accounted as an NPL, it only comes out of there if certain conditions are met. The payment of all interests pending, new effective collateral or certainty of payment and the balance we internally apply our own risk management function apply additional criteria and that is that we do not take it out of the NPL list until at least between three and 12 months have gone by, depending on the nature of the operation, checking that the interest and the monthly payments have been made. So you have to meet the Bank of Spain criteria plus our own risk management criteria before you can take an operation out of the NPL list.</p>
          <p>So there is strict &#x2013; the very strict criteria because risk quality is crucial for us. I don't know whether I've explained things properly but you can add that whatever you like. That's basically the idea, right? That's our policy and those are the numbers. We're recovering 70, 75%, of which two-thirds in cash on a quarter in execution of collateral. Only 20, 25% is being restructured or refinanced with these very strict criteria again. Because when you talk about refinancing or restructuring, it sounds like you're just giving it away, but we're not, we're following absolutely strict criteria, both those of the Bank of Spain that are in place plus additionally the ones that our own risk function requires.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the financial management area, a couple of questions about risks but I'll connect them with each of the countries. International management, questions about why that change in the net interest income in the corporate center? It's a question by <mark type="inaudible" /> from BBVA. And another question about the growth of non-interest income in Q3 without the perimeter or the exchange rate effect. That's in the general presentation. There's a column where you have that, without extracting the perimeter and the exchange rate effect. Or maybe you want to say something about the corporate center and the foreign net interest income there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Corporate center, that's a combination of different things and items. But basically financial or the net interest income you mean was minus 600 in the first quarter, minus 580 in the second, minus 480 in the third, so we're talking about relatively small changes. But here there are several factors at stake. Divestments, when you divest, of course you receive less dividend income, so you have more cash. On the other hand, that affects your financial revenue, as does the way in which you manage the parent company's lending or risk policy, traditionally that's corporate center. The exchange rate hedges we managed some will bring in financial revenue if the exchange rate is that &#x2013; currently that has been hedged is below the euro and negative if it's above. So that 90 million variation is due to CEPSA I think divestment, that's a big number so less dividend income plus some effect from ALCO and the exchange rate hedges, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had two questions come in about strategy and outlook, whether apart from the U.K. we're interested in any acquisition in Mexico, any savings banks and so on. And also whether we can elaborate a little, not just for Spain but in general about how we see net interest income evolving. Over the coming quarters do we expect volumes to pickup differently in different countries or geographies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first question I'll answer no, certainly not. We have no plan or intention of acquiring anything in any geography and I answered that earlier already, so. Second question is a bit harder to answer because I have to go to each of the geographies and say how we see it unit by unit and it might take longer. I spoke about Spain; Spain &#x2013; well it's been said. Brazil is another important unit and it has to do with some questions that have been received about how spreads or our margins will evolve in Brazil. And probably in Brazil there might be some pressure on our margins on the one hand but on the other we feel that risk quality will improve. Two, as the economic situation improves, also the net risk margin, not the gross margin which may possibly drop. The net margin will remain constant. In any case, Antonio Alvarez I forgot to mention that we're not supposed to talk about Brazil because we're still in the IPO period, so sorry I said nothing, forget what I've said.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, the volume effect should bring about a reasonable growth of margins. In the other Latin American countries, the growth will be strong in Mexico. And at Abbey although the U.K. is still in a difficult economic situation and next year it will probably still be difficult. With the work we're doing at Abbey, I believe we will be able to maintain our margins. The biggest threat really is Spain. The rest is no real issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> from Madrid is asking whether a separation of the insurance and banking businesses like ING has done, whether there might be some trends in this direction in Europe, if something that could be affected by these decisions, and there's some other questions about regulations in general and capital requirements. Well as you know, the person who's asking the question, there's a lot of changes going on in the regulatory arena. We're seeing all sorts of working documents and meetings from all kinds of levels, from Basel to the financial stability forum to the G20 Summit and so on.</p>
          <p>Two basic points. This would require a whole seminar possibly, but there's two points that matter to me. First, there will be regulatory changes. We don't think that it's going to affect us too much, since we are a bank which has a business model and risk profile, a level of diversification and a branch model which is succeeding right now in the world, and what's being recommended to solve these systemic programs.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we don't think there's going to be anything about regulations before the crisis is over. We will have time to discuss it, to look at it, to review it. Through government and through the Bank of Spain, we will be able to participate in this discussion, express our points of view, if we had any, and we do in some areas. But it's not going to be short-term. It's probably going to be more for 2011.</p>
          <p>Okay. About risks, there's two or three questions, somewhat technical questions. And so if you agree, we will answer them later, in investor relations part, net NPL entries in absolute values in Santander network, breakdown in corporate banking by spreading pieces and showing the trends in operations. And then Sovereign, whether it's partial write-off or not. And then there's a couple of questions from <mark type="inaudible" /> from BNP and Merrill Lynch about what we expect for NPL rates in Spain, specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. NPLs in Spain, every quarter we're asked about this. Every quarter we give our best estimate. And I'll go back to what we said at the beginning of the year. In January, February, I forget if it was January or February when we presented the 2009 results, we said in answer to some of your questions what we expected for the end of 2009 for Santander NPL rates in Spain. Then we said that we thought we would end the year &#x2013; and I'm talking about Spain, not the group &#x2013; at 4.5%.</p>
          <p>Later, I think it was in July, I think it was when we presented the results of the first semester, we reviewed that, we revised that number, because the first semester had done somewhat better than what we had expected, and we decided that we would finish the year at 3.5 NPL rate. What can we say right now? Well, I dare to say that possibly, we'll remain below that 3.5 we had predicted. We'll probably by December be at maybe 3.3% for Santander in Spain. Which means somewhat that we have managed to improve our forecasts in the various quarters.</p>
          <p>What will happen in 2010? As we move ahead, it's harder to make a forecast and the risk of getting it wrong greater. But we still think that &#x2013; and the whole sector thinks this, and it's in fact something that we discussed quite regularly in our meetings &#x2013; we think that the biggest NPL peak will be in the middle of next year.</p>
          <p>What will be the number? I wouldn't dare speculate for Santander but we'll probably say something about that at the end of the year. It will go up. It will continue to go up. And it will go up until it reaches a peak in 2010, in the middle of 2010.</p>
          <p>So probably that peak for provisioning will be at the end of 2010, because as everybody knows, there's always a delay between the peak in provisions and the peak in NPLs. But we will continue to use up generic provisions, and if everything goes as planned, we will see those peaks in NPL rates and provisions which will occur towards the middle of next year and then improve by 2011. But we'll probably be able to be more precise by the end of the year when we have the budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Several questions about the real estate we've acquired from developers. <mark type="inaudible" /> from Credit Suisse, I'll try and summarize them all. They're all similar in terms of volume of sales and allocation of real estate assets in Q3, that 600 million fund; whether we expect it to reach 20% of the value or not; how much have we bought; how big would be the impact if the Bank of Spain were to go from 10 to 20%. Portfolio right now, purchases, basically real estate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the figures we have, approximately it was 4.15 billion at the beginning of the year that we had bought. We now have four and a bit. I forget how much the bit is. It's 402 or 403, which means that we are selling. Second, we also announced that we weren't going to be buying anything else. And in fact that's so. We've sold 110 million. We have stopped buying as we said in June.</p>
          <p>But of course that's a policy which cannot be applied overnight. So there's been a gross increase of &#x20AC;13 million, but these are the things pending from other earlier operations. So that's one thing. And the other, as you'll know, when we buy this real estate, the Bank of Spain requires that we provision 10%, and now an application of our  capital gains we explained we'll be putting in an additional 600 million in provisions.</p>
          <p>And so those 600 million, as you can see, out of 4 billion, are 20%, 20% plus the additional 10% we had required by the Bank of Spain, sorry, 15% required by the Bank of Spain. So 15% required by the Bank of Spain would give us 25% provisions. So that's basically it. I think that more or less answers every question around this area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alfonso G&#xF3;mez from Citibank is asking about risk-weighted assets and capital. Why &#x2013; he's connecting the risk-weighted assets with the rise in the, in provisioning in the U.K. The other questions are <mark type="inaudible" /> Spain, and then one final one on core capital: Where we see core capital. So three questions, evolution of risk and assets, the losses in the U.K. and risk-weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What has happened, the drop has two consequences or two effects that have maybe another &#x2013; basically for two reasons first because the asset's not growing because lending's not growing pretty much in any of the geographies where we have strong assets, because, although we have assets in America too, but the weight of those assets is relatively low. So the assets not growing, the risk-weighted assets are not growing. That's the first reason. And the second reason is because we're optimizing the risk-weighted assets in order to optimize our use of capital, and assisting on every single unit, and in every single geographical location, and in all businesses. So that's the joint effect of both elements, can lead us to a reduction in the risk-weighted assets. And foreseeably, at least for the first reason, next year this will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Santiago L&#xF3;pez from Credit Suisse, asks about coverages, what type of results on the capital outside Spain are hedged for? What has been the profit in hedging activities in the third quarter, that net interest income is not as good as in other quarters, so what is happening with hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well with regards to exchange rate hedges, we have two types of hedges. One is for book value and the other one for expected results. And also, and this is where the difficulty lies, in &#x2013; there's a symmetry, an accounting symmetry because at the end the hedges are mark-to-market and the results are included in the exchange rate average of the nine months. So all the results of the hedges in terms of net interest income, and I think I answered this when I was asked about the net interest income and the corporate center. Well, the positive or negative carry of the hedge goes to the net interest income, and the mark-to-market is included in the trading gains.</p>
          <p>With &#x2013; the currencies that we deal with, we have hedged right now 100% of the pound sterling in terms of income as well as in terms of book value. We also have 100% of Chile and Mexico hedged forward, and we have also a low hedge right now for profits in Brazil, and we have a 90% hedge. So the hedge of Brazil is done with options, but the hedges in the U.K., Chile, and in the case of dollar in Sovereign, it's only with forwards. The same thing goes for Mexico where the results are hedged with forwards.</p>
          <p>So results are in those two lines. Well you have to go currency by currency, and I would like to add that the mark-to-market and the generation of income don't necessarily fall into the same period of time, because a currency might devaluate in the first quarter, but then remain the same during the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And to finish the area of financial management, <mark type="inaudible" /> from Merrill Lynch asks about the ALCO. Could you say something about the ALCO, where it is right now? The hedges there, et cetera? And from Citi the question on core capital, I don't think you answered that? And what about the evolution of the core capital, where it is right now and where do you see it in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In core capital, I think we've mentioned this in previous quarters, it hasn't changed in normal conditions with a payout of 50%, and with the trends we see it might change, but very little, because next year we hope a greater growth of assets in our loan portfolio in Brazil and in emerging markets. But 10 or 15 basis points of generation, I would say, is what we expect and what we've seen every quarter with regards to the core capital.</p>
          <p>And the question about ALCO and the portfolios, every ALCO &#x2013; every subsidiary has its own ALCO and it is self contained. ALCOs adapt to what every unit does. We have units where the position of a balance sheet is long, for example in consumer finance in Chile or in the U.K., and what we do there, take liabilities through the fixed rate. So, there we pay a fixed rate on the slots and then we have balance sheets which are short, basically those in Spain, Portugal and Mexico.</p>
          <p>Brazil is more or less balanced and it has small needs. And that's why we have ALCO portfolios of Sovereign bonds in Mexico with our portfolio. I think it's about five to $6 billion. And in the European countries and European &#x2013; continental Europe the portfolio is of about &#x20AC;18 billion in the three units in continental Europe to hedge for the interest rate. And this 10 billion compared with core deposits that don't pay interest of about 35 billion. So the duration of the ALCOs is of about three years. This is our hedging policy right now in the different countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So more specific questions now about the areas in Spain. There's one about the fees that are breaking down of fees. We'll pass this question on to the person responsible. And there are three questions, one from Antonio Ramirez from Keefe. The Group has lost three percentage points in the lending share. How do you think this is going to evolve in the future? I think he's referring to the market share of the savings banks. And then there's another question from Joyce Lewis. The Santander Network, how is it performing? And what is the impact of the gap there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all banks have lost the market share compared to savings banks, but we have to remember that this is very much linked to the real estate business where banks &#x2013; for example, we have a market share which is lower than our general business market share. We have grown less in this business, and this is to our advantage right now. The loss of market share is a very complex issue. We feel very comfortable right now with the market share we have, possibly because of the transformations which will certainly occur whatever the scenario, but there are going to be changes in the Spanish financial industry in the next few years, and that is &#x2013; indirectly is going to benefit us.</p>
          <p>We're going to see a reduction of the store capacity in the competition, and therefore this will give us opportunities to gain back that market share that we have lost in lending as well as in deposits. All of us have I think lost market share on both sides of the balance sheet. Now the other question was, I'm sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The gap of the Santander Network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. Yes, we are reducing that significantly. This year, only in Spain, lending has grown 0.4 or 0.3%, whilst deposits have grown 19 or 20%. So the gap is getting smaller very fast. In Spain I think we have reduced it by more than 12 billion in these first nine months of the year, but we shouldn't forget that this is also impacted by the macroeconomic gap. This is a reflection of the gap in the Spanish economy. We've been saying for months that the gap in the Spanish economy was up 800 million. Well those 800 million affect each one of our tiny gaps. But having said that, since the economy is de-leveraging and we're noticing that too in our balance sheet, we have closed that gap with &#x2013; by 12 million, million. The questions on the U.K. provisions have already been answered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now if we talk about Brazil, there are basically three questions about Brazil, from Arturo de Frias from Evolution, from Nomura and <mark type="inaudible" /> from BBVA. First of all, on the high return of the franchise, 3.2 return over risk weigh assets, how do you think that is going to evolve in the future? Do you think that the fall of spreads can be offset by increases in volume? And then trading gains, why are they so high in Brazil in Q3? And the third one is about risk quality. Do you see changes there and what about the total volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well three questions. The high return on assets; that was the first one. This is a characteristic of the Brazilian financial system. This not only happens in Brazil, Santander Brazil, but in Brazil in general. And I think we have been saying for some time that what we expect is what usually happens in these processes where you go from non-investment grade emerging markets to higher levels of rating assets followed by an expansion of the volumes together with a contraction of the spreads. In any case, I remind you that Brazil is a market where spreads are on one side of the assets. On deposits, margins are very, very low, abnormally low because there are some high ratios over core deposits. Despite the fact they have interest rates at 9%, the bank doesn't favor from that situation. So in the long term, expansion of volume and smaller asset spreads. And on the side of deposits, there's still a possibility to increase spreads.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is about the growth. I mentioned this during my presentation, I think in Brazil the 17% of the growth in lending, and this stems from two different situations. First of all the publicly owned banks, state-owned banks, which are growing at rates of about 40%, and private banks which are growing at rates of 5%. And this is where we get this average of 12%. Our average is 2%, more aligned with privately-owned banks and therefore there isn't much more to add there.</p>
          <p>Now with regards to the arrears rate credit quality, well I think I said during my presentation that the demand in terms of net margin of provisions in Brazil is of about 50%. I also mentioned when I talked about Brazil that it had been going up. Right now it remains stable, about 5.8 for the country, private banks 5%, and the estimates are that that will tend to decrease as the economic situation improves because the growth of Brazil next year is of about 5%, and therefore unemployment, the unemployment rate will go down.</p>
          <p>Oh yes, trading gains. I don't know whether I talked about VisaNet, the green shoe, the execution of the VisaNet green shoe was in June 2009. Therefore it was included in the results of the third quarter, and this has been used for generic provisions. So there is an abnormally high trading gain. I think it was $131 million which is offset completely in the generic provisions because we also see that the generic provisions in Brazil go up significantly in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From Brazil we have two more questions which have already been answered or which we can answer. One is from Alessandro Bruis. The capital gain, well we'll answer that later. And the update on synergies in Brazil from Sergio Gamez from Merrill Lynch, but we'll tell you about this later on. Thank you. We'll answer this later. So now Mexico, and with this we will finish. We have quite a lot of questions about Mexico, the performance of our franchise, the quality, how do we see it, have we reached the peak in the impairment of quality, do we see volumes growing, what is our policy for Mexico looking forward, the competitive environment as Arturo de Frias from Evolution and also the arrears rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think all questions are related to our vision on the franchise and the environment. The vision on Mexico of 2009, I think we already mentioned this in our last earnings announcement. It was not positive. It was actually a fall in the income basically due to low level of activity on the one hand because of the economic situation, and also because of NPLs and provisions. This situation, which in our case the arrears part, comes from the credit card business that has been refocused. So I think we can say very clearly that we have touched the bottom there in the NPL rate in Mexico, and that already is a very proper development.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to volumes, we are still not noticing a recovery because the Mexican economy is very much linked to the American economy. But all indicators, and what seems to be the consensus is that next year Mexico will start to grow, not too much; but they will grow from one to 2% like the United States. If that is so, which seems to be the case, then obviously Mexico will start to look different than in 2009. First of all because that's the way it is, and secondly because things are changing. In Mexico, I included in that vision of Latin America as a whole, which in our case includes Mexico, Chile and the rest of the countries where we have a footprint. And our outlook is very positive for these countries as compared to 2009. We will see growth in this part of the world, as compared to Spain and Portugal where the situation is going to be gloomier and that is what I have to say about this. I think we've seen the worst already, and from now on, without exaggerating, but I do think that 2010 is going to be a better year.</p>
          <p>What is our vision for Mexico? We'll consolidate, and consolidate and continue to consolidate our franchises. We don't have any ambitions, if that's what you were asking, of growing there. No. No intention to do that. Yes, we want to grow organically and to be better and have a wider customer base and have a better quality and a better quality of retail banking but we're not thinking of making acquisitions or anything like it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a question from Javier Bernat on Sovereign, what about the franchise there? You had said that you reached break-even point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Sovereign is a unit which we just started managing and it's going through deep changes and restructuring. We could compare it to Abbey in the first two or three years since we took over. So it's undergoing transformation and restructuring and there are positive signals. We don't see any negative signals, not even the arrears rate <mark type="inaudible" /> because the assessment that we did when we acquired the last part, we don't seem to see anything that indicates that we were too optimistic or that we didn't take into account write-downs that could surprise us, nothing new is happening nothing &#x2013; no bad news, no &#x2013;  nothing that we didn't expect. The real estate part perhaps is the most negative part, but all of that was in the script. We knew that and we had already accounted for that when we made the acquisition. And from thereon, gradually we are seeing not positive results but positive news I would say.</p>
          <p>First of all, in 2009 we have already reached break-even point. In October &#x2013; we reached break-even point and in October or December we will start making money. That which quantitatively speaking is not very important. From the qualitative point of view is very important, because we're on the right track now. The situation has been stabilized and we're ready to grow. Of course we are going through a very strong cost reduction program which isn't really too difficult there because it was not a very well-organized bank, and we are right now transforming the technology and we are reorganizing business lines and our teams there. So our outlook for next year is already positive and it has to contribute already to the group next year.</p>
          <p>Well those were all the questions I received over the web. And unless we have a question from the conference call, yes, we do have a question from the conference call, and this will be the last question. Can we hear the question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I assume you do &#x2013; It's Jernej Omahen, I'm here from Goldman Sachs, and thanks very much for giving me the opportunity to ask the question. I have three very short questions. I guess the first one is...</p>
          <p>[Foreign language] (102:13)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The target core capital ratio is around 7%. You're now at 8.4%, as per your slide, and I guess it's not too unrealistic to expect that if the dividend policy stays unchanged, you're going to be at around 9% by the end of next year. And I was just wondering how should we think about this? Should we think about the 7% still as the target and the difference to the current ratio is surplus capital? Or should we just think about it as something that are being more comfortable with a higher core capital ratio per se, and that's essentially being it.</p>
          <p>And the final question is on the coverage ratio, something that rebuilt it up to 80% again I think, including the Brazil IPO, which is a comparatively high level. I was just wondering when you &#x2013; how do you think about this coverage ratio. What is the scope to actually run the coverage ratio down if you chose to, i.e. given that you only expect the NPLs to peak in 2010? Or should we model something that is essentially one thing to have coverage ratio at around the 80% mark? So those are the three questions. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first question, which refers to the hedge of our deposits in the UK. I think I mentioned this when I talked about the corporate center. We had IRSs that in part hedged below the deposits, and I was referring to &#x2013; first we have IRSs for 18 to 22 million which has matured, now it's less. And this hedge, we have deposits in the UK of more than 100 billion pounds, so it was a very partial hedge and there was no way to offset 100% of the shrinking of the spreads on the deposits. So more than these IRSs we have the standard variable rate which in de facto is more than 4% and acts as a natural hedge for core deposits without having to take our positions in the market.</p>
          <p>With regards to capital, it is true, and we mentioned this in the presentation, when we did the capital increase a year ago, our intention back then was to increase our pro capital from six to 7%, now we are 8.4%, but the CEO mentioned during his presentation that there we have two uncertainties right now. The main uncertainty is a regulatory one because we don't know or we do know that there's going to be a new regulation on capital, that's what the regulators say, and other types of regulations, until it is advisable to be at levels of comfort so as not to have to look for capital later on. So it is a good thing to have this core capital right now.</p>
          <p>And the second point is that the macroeconomic environment is what it is, and that is the second uncertainty. The CEO made some remarks on how we see the future, but there is uncertainty regarding the economic situation and that also advises us to have these levels of capital.</p>
          <p>Finally, your last question is about coverage ratio or hedging ratio that we have in the group. I think it's 73%. I think you mentioned 80%. Well the coverage ratio is made up by many things. When you have a coverage of mortgages, these ratios are usually low. And our mortgage book, don't forget, has a very important weight on the whole portfolio, in round figures 700 is our loan book, well half of it I would say, or almost half of it, are mortgages. So this brings down the coverage ratio. If you look at it by business in Latin America where the weight of mortgages is much smaller and the consumer business is more than 90%, so what brings down the average, is the ratio in the United K. which is 40 some % and in Spain where the weight of mortgages are also very relevant. So coverage ratio has to be put into context with the assets that are being hedged.</p>
