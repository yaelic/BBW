          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the JPMorgan Chase fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.</p>
          <p>We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Cavanagh. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody, it's Mike Cavanagh. We'll get started off the presentation as we usually do. So if you start at the beginning, page one, I'm just going to refer you back to the legal disclaimers in the back about forward-looking statements which you've all seen and heard many times before, so take note of that.</p>
          <p>So going to page one, let me give you just a few &#x2013; I'll mention some firm-wide highlights before I spend the bulk of the time really walking us through the details for each of the business lines that we have. And so for the full year 2009, we had net income of 11.7 billion. That's earnings per share of $2.26 on record revenues of $108.6 billion and record pre-tax pre-provision profits of 57 billion. In the fourth quarter, it was net income of 3.3 billion, EPS of $0.74 on revenue of about 25.</p>
          <p>Skipping down to credit costs, obviously they continue to remain pretty elevated across especially our consumer businesses. And in that regard, we've added 1.9 billion to the consumer loan loss reserve levels, bringing the total firm credit reserves to $32.5 billion or 5.5% of total loans, obviously a very strong level.</p>
          <p>And then on the balance sheet and capital accounts, Tier 1 common capital continues to grow now at $105 billion or 8.8% as we estimate it for the end of the year, which as you recall, the level expected at the time of the stress test less than a year ago was 4%, so we're more than double that number obviously.</p>
          <p>I'm going to skip now pages two and three, which give you the numbers I just described, and go straight to the details of the Investment Bank on page four. And so here you see we had earnings of $1.9 billion in the Investment Bank on revenues of about $5 billion in the quarter. I'll take the revenue lines piece by piece and give you a little bit of color there; so Investment Banking fee line, $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter. That brings us to 7.1 billion for the full year, which is a record. And obviously we've talked about this every quarter how pleased we are with the leading position we have across all forms of capital raising in the Investment Bank, and you can see that for yourself on the stats we'll show you on the next page, which I'll pass over.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Fixed Income Markets, so here revenues of $2.7 billion in the quarter, down from the record levels we had in the third quarter this year, and I'll just say obviously this is reflecting the lower overall client volumes that we saw in the fourth quarter and the continued narrowing of spreads across essentially all products, both of those factors generally speaking across all products. And nothing really more than that to describe in Fixed Income Markets other than to say that the end of the quarter, particularly December, was weaker than the earlier part of the quarter in terms of very slow client activity levels, but we see that at least in the first several weeks of January. We see client activity levels rebounding from where they were in December, which is good.</p>
          <p>Equity Markets at about $1 billion of revenue is solid.</p>
          <p>And so just moving on to credit portfolio, here you see a loss of &#x2013; negative revenues of $669 million, and that's on swings to the negative in credit valuation adjustments and then the mark-to-market losses on the hedges we put in place against the accrual based loans we have overwhelming the positive net interest income we have on the loans in the credit portfolio. I'll just say obviously that's a number driven by the swings in the mark-to-market items.</p>
          <p>On average, you'd expect credit portfolio revenues to be a couple hundred million dollars positive because over time, those mark-to-market swings on CVA and DVA and the hedges should average out to zero, leaving with you on average a few hundred million positive, so just as you think about what to expect as "normal" there. Moving on to then &#x2013; that finishes revenues, so that gets you to the total 5 billion or so of revenues in the quarter in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>Moving to credit costs, obviously we have a positive contribution of credit costs, and that's really driven in total by the charge-offs, but offset by a release of reserves related to the decline in loan balances both due to runoff of loans and loan sale activities that amounts to the decline you see in end of period loans there on the left dropping from 85 billion a year ago to 60 billion last quarter to 49 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. So those factors together drive you to the need for less reserves, yet we still carry an allowance to loan reserves in the Investment Bank north of 8%.</p>
          <p>And just in terms of non-performing loan balances dropping from 4.9 billion last quarter to 3.5 billion this quarter, the preponderance of that, three-quarters or so, related to the loan sale activities during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Next piece is expenses, which are obviously down significantly from a year ago and benefited from the very low comp-to-revenue ratio in the fourth quarter of 11%. That brought the full-year comp-to-revenue ratio in the Investment Bank to 33%. Just remember, that level is lowered by a few factors. One is that with our organization, we have to take into account the compensation that's paid outside the Investment Bank employees in the corporate segments and elsewhere that support the Investment Bank activities.</p>
          <p>We also took some reductions in the compensation lines to offset, in part at least, the UK tax. And in addition, we've raised the level of equity that's given in compensation, and so that of course lowers the ratio as well. So those factors add up to a couple of points depression from what that ratio otherwise would be. And you can think of this ratio as on a go-forward basis of something in the neighborhood of 40% plus or minus. So use 40% as your baseline, but obviously know that it's going to be lower than that, the stronger the performance of the business and the higher the revenues, and the inverse is true as well, which you've seen us do over the past. So that's the story on comp-to-revenue and compensation in the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>So if I just bring all that together before leaving the Investment Bank and wrap it up, if you look at the $1.9 billion of profits I started with and just do a couple of the adjustments I just described, bring the credit portfolio revenues back to a slight positive, bring the comp-to-revenue expense rate into &#x2013; more in line with what I just said for a normal of about 36% call it, and bring credit costs as opposed to being a positive to a negative of about 100 basis points which is what we always talked about, that would get you to adjusted profits for the quarter of 1.4 billion or $1.5 billion is the way I think about some of those items that I just described.</p>
          <p>So moving on from the Investment Bank now, we'll just skip ahead to the Retail Financial Services drivers page. And I guess the overarching comment and reminder I'd make here is just the continued great progress and completion actually of the Washington Mutual acquisition is the ultimate driver of the business over the long period of time. But just looking at the quarterly stats, the only couple things I'll mention is on the retail banking side, the branch business, deposit taking, you see as expected some quarter-over-quarter continued decline in deposits from about 340 to 330, and that's just letting us have the high cost Washington Mutual time deposit CDs mature and roll off, which is good economics for us.</p>
          <p>Separately, you see the deposit margin expand a little bit as we continue to be a disciplined pricer of deposits and also see some shift away from higher cost deposit products, and you see that 2.99 deposit margin improve a bit to 3.06 in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving down then to the bottom of the page, the other division within Retail is Consumer Lending. You see in total Consumer Lending originated about $42 billion of new credit. That relates to firm-wide fourth quarter credit origination of 155 billion. And as you saw in the press release, that's a total for the full year of 600 billion or so. And you can just read some of the comments and look at the stats of what went on in each piece, nothing particularly noteworthy to report there though.</p>
          <p>So then if you go to the next slide and just focus on the income statement of Retail, I'll just take this again in the same two pieces. So Retail Banking in the middle on the left, you see net income of $1 billion or so on revenues of $4.5 billion, and that revenue was flat year over year. It goes back to the shift to the benefit in wider spreads from the shift of wider spread products, offset by some declines in the fee-based side of Retail Banking, getting you to that net income you see there.</p>
          <p>And then at the bottom, you see Consumer Lending continues to lose money. And so in this quarter, it was a $1.4 billion loss, two items I'll point out. One is the level of revenues at $3.1 billion, and that's lower than prior periods given the modest level of essentially breakeven 100 million positive on MSR risk management, which had been a big positive in some the prior quarters, that normally is more like what it is this quarter. And then as well, we had higher repurchase reserves put up on mortgage repurchase &#x2013; claims. On the credit side, you see $3.94 billion of credit cost, and that includes a $1.5 billion addition to the allowance for loan losses.</p>
          <p>So now let's just talk about those portfolios for a bit on page eight, the same slide we always show you here, giving you a little bit of detail on the top left of just the decline in balances you see as these portfolios run down from 101 billion for home equity and so forth. The charge-offs themselves you see are up a little bit versus last quarter, but running in an increased trend that's consistent with the outlook we have given you in the past, and that outlook for 1.4 billion of quarterly losses on home equity in the next several quarters, 600 or so in prime mortgage and 500 or so in subprime mortgage, continue to be unchanged for us as we look ahead.</p>
          <p>On the credit impaired side, the WaMu purchased portfolios, there you see we added about $500 million to reflect our estimate of higher lifetime losses in the sub-portfolio of option ARMs.</p>
          <p>Card Services now on the next slide, you see a net income loss of $306 million compared to a loss of 371 million a year ago. Credit again continues to be the story, not much different than what we would have expected here. You see the 8.64% charge-off ratio, which as we talked about last quarter benefited by about 60 basis points from the timing of this payment holiday we did, and that we'll see the other side of that with an elevated charge-off ratio next quarter, but that is continuing to trend to the 10.5 or so percent charge-off ratio that we expect to trend towards by the &#x2013; in the first half of 2010, exactly as we've previously said, so nothing really different going on than what we talked about before in credit here.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, end of period outstandings continue to behave in the same fashion, down a bit year over year and flattish quarter over quarter; sales volume up a bit year over year and up 7% quarter over quarter. We think we're gaining share, continue to gain share in card spend, but those factors together with charge-offs are putting pressure on overall outstandings year over year. And so that amounts to the modest revenue growth you see of 5% year over year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Commercial Banking, the next slide, slide 10, $224 million worth of profits; I'll just point out a few things here; loan balances of 102 billion (sic) [100.2 billion] on average, down a bit from last quarter, so we continue to see weak demand. We continue to see utilization rates on committed credit lines bounce around their lows, a little bit more indication that we might have some pipeline activity coming up, but we have to wait and see.</p>
          <p>And on the other side of that &#x2013; of the balance sheet, you see liability balances. This is cash and deposits our clients leave with us trending higher. That translates into the revenue you see above for lending and cash management products.</p>
          <p>And then one other point I'd make is we talked a lot a couple years ago about the investment banking opportunity out of the Commercial Bank. So for the full year 2009, we had just over $1.1 billion worth of revenues, investment banking product related revenues delivered into the Commercial Bank clients, and that's a full double of where it was at the time of the Bank One-JPMorgan Chase merger several years back, so that's the goal we set, and so congrats to that team for getting it done this year.</p>
          <p>Credit costs in the quarter high, $494 million, and the bulk of the activity there, 70, 80%, is driven by vigilance around making sure our commercial real estate activities are properly written down, and that's the driver there. Continue obviously to have very high allowance to loan losses. At the end of it all, up north of 3% as we ended the year.</p>
          <p>Next business on slide 11 is Treasury &amp; Securities Services; net income down year over year substantially and a bit quarter over quarter to 237 million. If you look at the liability balances line, you see the significant decline from the elevated levels we had last year as we experienced a significant influx of deposits at the height of the crisis. So that as well as the low rate environment we're currently experiencing and the pressure that's putting on deposit spreads is affecting the revenues here as well as some of the other items I'll let you read. But that translates into the 1.8 billion or so of revenues, down 400 or so from a year ago, and translates to the 237 of profits in Treasury &amp; Securities Services.</p>
          <p>Last business, Asset Management, net income of $424 million, up substantially year over year; revenues up versus a year ago, 32%, and that's on 10% increase in assets under management, which at $1.2 trillion reflect the higher levels of markets as well as positive inflows over the past 12 months, 28 billion up for that period, and continued good investment performance.</p>
          <p>The last contributor to the income statement for the company is the corporate segment, so let me just spend a minute here on page 13. You see Private Equity. We had pre-tax gains of $273 million in the quarter on the overall portfolio of $7.3 billion. It translates into net income of 141 million as you see on the left.</p>
          <p>The next piece is what I call the real corporate segment, that's the treasury bank within a bank and investment portfolio activity as well as all the corporate support activities that we manage in corporate. That amounts to an abnormally high 1.2 billion in the quarter. Think of that as benefiting from two things. It has been consistently high for several quarters given the large size of the investment portfolio generating high net interest income. But in this quarter we started to bring the size of that portfolio down. And in selling some of those securities, which were at gains, we triggered investment securities gains.</p>
          <p>We'll probably have some more of that &#x2013; we know we'll have more of that in the first quarter as we continue to make some adjustments to the investment portfolio. But once you get beyond the first quarter of this year, you can expect to see that number be more in the range of 300 million or so plus or minus. But obviously, we always talked about corporate being a volatile item, and it will certainly be affected by how we manage the investment portfolio from here forward.</p>
          <p>Tax rate, we had a little bit of benefit in the quarter with some one-time items running through the tax rate for the company that will revert to what it had looked like for the three quarters year to date. And then obviously the net interest margin going forward, guidance on that is embedded in the $300 million number that I talked about as the forward earnings in corporate.</p>
          <p>So moving past the P&amp;L to the capital section here, you see on page 14 again the total capital position of the company, $133 billion of Tier 1 capital, 105 billion of Tier 1 common, for the 11.1 and 8.8% capital ratios that you see circled there. I'd just make the point that with FAS 166/167 coming into effect this quarter, that will affect us by our estimate of plus or minus 40 basis points or so to the negative, so the ratios will continue to be very strong.</p>
          <p>We're obviously keeping an eye on all of the future changes that could come a year from now in terms of market risk rules as well as the further out implementation of Basel III, and we're going to spend time. We feel very comfortable with how we're positioned on the capital front with everything we know, but we are going to make some adjustments when we get to Investor Day to just true up and adjust the capital allocated to each of our businesses and bring them in line with our best thinking around that. So more to come on that, but the work we've already done just substantiates our view that we're in a very strong position overall on the capital front.</p>
          <p>The next slide, I will skip over. It just gives you a sense for the strong level of loan loss reserves and how the evolution of non-performing loans ratios relates to that.</p>
          <p>And then just wrapping it up with the outlook, I'll just remind folks that effectively nothing is different here than what we said at the Goldman Sachs conference last month. So read it and you'll see that it's very much in line, exactly the same as what we've said.</p>
          <p>Therefore, let me just wrap it up there. And operator, we can open it up to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then for the loan loss reserve build in RFS, how do TDRs and modifications contribute to the loan loss reserve build? Are there some automatic provisioning that occurs when you do modifications?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we've talked about foreclosure delays and modifications, we've tried to be vigilant both in the way we recognize charge-offs and the way we forecast them to not allow ourselves to get caught behind in terms of what the expected embedded loss is. And so we factor that into the way we forecast and put up our reserves. Nothing automatic, it's just our forecasting embeds our best expectation of what will actually happen.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it did. Increasing the amount of stock in our cash stock table across the board but especially for higher paid people drove the ratio down by a point or two...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question, just expense leverage in RFS, with the cost saves from WaMu, I would expect a little bit more of net expense reduction in RFS, including your outlook. Could you comment on what some of the offsets to the merger expense saves are in RFS?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's many of the items that you see on our outlook page. It's just the continued investment and growth of the business away from the shrinkage of WaMu together with continued levels of default and foreclosure related expenses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. On page seven on the RFS on the consumer lending comment, there was something &#x2013; a blurb on higher repurchase reserves. Is that a reps and warranty issue? And can we talk about that issue in terms of what is the magnitude of loans being put back to you all and how big of an issue it's adding up to be?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's early on that score. Obviously, it's picked up and you read about it in the papers. Everyone is looking at it.

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Reserve for it, okay, that's good, and maybe a quick comment on a reminder of if you took a very general view of your first and second over the past couple of years, what percentage was self-originated versus wholesale originated because that usually &#x2013; I don't have concerns over JPMorgan's documentation and dotting the Is and crossing the Ts, but some of the wholesale stuff seems to be the bigger issue these days.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Okay, a quickie going back to that comp issue at the IB. Just what kind of magnitude are we talking in terms of stock/cash split?

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And Mike, I don't know if this is too simple of a question, but lots of people starting to get a little antsy on the rate outlook, and I'm not sure how close to the middle you're aligned. But I'm curious on your thoughts on both rate forecast and positioning, and what's more important. Is it the actual funds rate, or is it the issue of stopping of some of the some of the purchase programs by the various government entities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our interest rate exposure was high and it's way down, okay? So honestly, I wouldn't worry about it that much. And Mike mentioned we're selling parts of the portfolio and reducing it as we speak. It does not mean we're guessing the rate is going up right away. We're just positioning ourselves to protect ourselves from both higher rates. And I think really the far more important thing is volume. Is the economy recovering? If the economy is recovering, then business will do much better.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Banc of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on how we should think about the Investment Bank balance sheet going forward. Total assets seemed to have stabilized after falling for four quarters or so, but the leverage ratio still runs about a little over 20 times on a gross basis. So just based on prospects that you see in the business and what you can glean from the BIS release, Basel III that you were talking about, should we expect assets to begin to grow again, and should we expect a meaningful increase in the capital that you allocate to that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you'll see &#x2013; I think assets will start a normal growth path at this point, not a lot more reduction. We had a lot of reductions of the Bear Stearns. Some of these are liquid asset which have been resold and certain loans, hung loans and stuff like that. I would look at fairly normal growth. Capital will probably go up to 40 billion approximately equity capital. And Basel III is really, really early. This tax that they just said could have some peculiar effects if you're really going to tax 15 basis points on non-deposit assets and liabilities because then all of a sudden you're affecting repo markets and matched book markets. So we don't know the effect of all that but the underlying business is strong. You can see a lot of corporations are funding. There's more M&amp;A talk. So the business itself is healthy and the balance sheet really will reflect that to some extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, just remember. When you think about leverage ratios, what we publish in our equity is equity, so think of that as common equity. So when you think &#x2013; when you do these comparative ratios, often you're looking at an attribution. You got to look at an attribution of all the rest of the long-term debt and sub-debt and preferreds that we have as a company in each of our businesses, including the Investment Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fair. Now as we talked about, the assets flattened out, but you continue to have a pretty significant decline in trading VaR [Value at Risk]. Can you help us understand how to reconcile that? I think it's the first time that we saw recently a significant decline in the trading VaR, even as the assets seemed to flatten.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I were you, Guy, I wouldn't focus too much on trading VaR. I've always said it's a good one point measure day to day, but it's really not an accurate measure of risk. Remember, for a lot of products, it's 12 months of historical volatility of the securities. And that means that every week, you're dropping out an old week and you're adding a new week. So all year or for the most part this year, you're adding a benign week and dropping out a volatile week, and that probably accounts for a huge amount of it. And then illiquid assets are down, and some of the more volatile classes are down, too.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, a couple questions, a couple simple ones first. On the FICC [Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities] line, are you going to be giving the mark-to-market numbers, the DVA/CVA components of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You'll see it definitely in the Q, but we're getting away from &#x2013; we're getting into a normal range, so no need to really call out these numbers in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is the normal range 2 to 3 billion? Is that what you would suggest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in terms of the P&amp;L, it swings a couple hundred million each way. It's not something that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I was talking about the FICC line normal range</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fixed income revenues, Betsy, what I said there is just we can't predict what the markets are going to give. But just the point of the 2.7 billion in FICC revenues we had, obviously the December slowdown that we're seeing some reversion to more normal levels of client activity gives you a little &#x2013; some lift from the levels that we ran at in the fourth quarter. That's the backdrop, normalized spreads from earlier in the year together with that. And it's probably a little bit of uplift from the levels we saw, but we can't really predict the future on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the other question I had is just on capital management. I know it's a little bit complex given the moving parts in the regulatory environment. But with NPLs flattening here and with the reserve builds continuing, at what point do you start? And with the asset coming down, how do you think about what you're going to be doing with the capital going forward? Is there a point at which you say look, even though the environment is still improving only slightly maybe, you have considerations to raise the dividend, and what's in the way of raising the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just refer to one benchmark, which is the Tier 1 common, okay? That's at 8.8. It goes down this quarter by 40 basis points or so because FASB 166, and it may drop another 30 or 40 in the first quarter next year because of new market risk rules. We don't know that number yet. It could go up or down. We're still very healthy. At one point, we're going to revert to normal growth which will use capital, right? But once you see a recovery and these earnings start to go up and start to come down, there will be plenty of excess capital, and that's when you might see us do something about the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you have to wait for just the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the other thing to keep in mind is Basel III, which is a probably a couple years away, also everyone is going to keep that in mind and how they're going to be looking at the balance sheet because no one wants to be caught short in capital, particularly if someone is going to be punitive about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you want a cushion, but as your NPLs are flattening out here and ostensively going to be improving in the not too distant future, this is going to become a challenge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're in great shape, and we're already thinking about what we're going to &#x2013; we've never stopped investing in people and systems and data centers and branches because we know we're going to have a lot of capital. There's an inflection point where instead of NPLs and all these things are using up capital, there's an inflection point at which we're going to be kicking off a lot of capital, not just for us but for all banks, and particularly when all these negative accounting things and negative regulatory things go away and earnings go back up and losses are going to come down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The industry will end up being overcapitalized. Everything is post-cyclical and the industry will end up with too much capital. In my opinion, it will happen in the middle or late 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there anything standing in the way of raising the dividend besides from your opinions and the Board decision? Is there anything that you have to do to raise the dividend aside from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, but I think we said we really want to see a real recovery before we do that because I don't want to have to do this again, just in case you have another dip down here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the capital ratio, you indicated at Investor Day you're going to be changing some of the allocations. Can you talk a little bit about what you're thinking about doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Jamie hit on the big one. I mean we'll probably take the Investment Bank's capital up from 33 to around 40. We're still working on fine tuning the numbers. And most of the other businesses are probably in the zip code that they belong but there will be tweaks to those levels. And the view will be our best ability to capitalize the businesses unique to their own type of activities under a Basel II type of regime with strong Tier 1 common type of targets business by business. So that's the framework we're thinking of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's a general one which is how much capital a regulator is going to set as the new real standard which the banks don't really know yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay because in the past, you've indicated Basel II is going to be a net positive for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basel II will be &#x2013; it's about breakeven. But Basel II moves all around, and Basel II is going to change.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got plenty of capital, but the question is what's the new standard? Not only are there capital requirements, the rules are adding to more risk weighted assets and more capital. But in the old days for 1-Tier, when the stress test took place, it was 4% Tier 1 common because you had to be able to maintain through the adverse case. We have double that. Is that 4% going to be 5% or 6% or 7%, and no bank is going to want to be caught short of that because the markets and the regulators and the government have become punitive of that point. Everyone is going to want to hold more capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, we don't know when the recovery is. What I said is I think you can have an inflection point where we're generating a lot more capital than we need, even after accounting for needing more capital to make up for the accounting change and the Basel II change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if earnings are going up, the balance sheet levelizing, and loan loss reserves are eventually going to start coming down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the quarter, I think Mike said you sold $1 billion of NPAs. So if you hadn't sold those on a core basis, NPAs would have been up 4% which is better but still higher. Is that math right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little less than that, Mike. I think it's whatever the decline was in the Investment Bank which is three-quarters of that, or so was sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And restructurings. Remember, a lot of loans have been non-performing. In the large corporate world, they're economical and restructured and taken out by DIPs, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The bigger question I guess as it relates to the new tax proposed, what are some of the potential unintended consequences or maybe intended consequences? Would you think about delevering some? Do you think about foreseeing core deposits more? Would you think about raising money more outside the US? What are your options to help mitigate the impact of that tax if it gets passed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we don't know what the real tax is yet, and it seems to cover US and non-US. That doesn't help you. I think the one unintended consequence in the back of my mind that is an issue is how it affects the matched book, the financing businesses, et cetera because that really becomes a real cost in a low margin type of business, so we're going to just wait and see. We run the business to serve customers and grow. We don't run it necessarily because of that stuff. We really have to wait and see the details and when it all sorts out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not saying I understand that tax either or would agree with it, but the bigger picture question is, if you're deemed to be too big to fail, and I know you disagree with that. But if you were deemed too big to fail or any other firm were, how should a firm like that be made to pay for that protection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think the real important thing is that we really don't believe that anyone can be too big to fail. Remember, the markets never traded financial companies like they were too big to fail, neither the stocks nor the bonds. They traded at huge spreads and stuff like that. I guess the model if you were going to have something is like insurance, like an FDIC type of thing or something like that, and it becomes a cost of doing business for certain sized companies.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then my question is we're reaching a critical point in terms of all the loan modification efforts. And this is an industry question, but then how it specifically affects your company. Given the fact that the industry feedback and statistics on the loan modification efforts are not good, so you question what's the next initiative? And the issue of principal forbearance, how much momentum do you think that has? Can you comment on what stage we are in terms of &#x2013; obviously the extension ends &#x2013; the last slug is over in February? So where you think we are in terms of the government's efforts to influence banks to do certain things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Remember, we do modifications of our own and we do the government modifications, and I do think they're new. It was complex, and I think people will get better at it over time. Meredith, we have not thought of a better way to do it than loan by loan, okay, which is does the person want to live there? Can they afford to live there? And we really think the payment, how much you're paying, is more important than principal. Even if you were going to do something in principal, really to do it right, you have to do it loan by loan, and it effectively becomes a similar thing. The difficulty is the loan by loan part, and we've asked the government and I think they tried to streamline a little bit the HAMP [Home Affordable Modification Program] programs because there was too much paperwork involved in it. So a lot of the reasons we're not getting to final modifications, half the time we don't finish the paperwork. In other words, they were meeting the lower payments but they weren't finishing the paperwork.</p>
          <p>And so we're trying to get better at it, get it streamlined. Honestly, we rack our brains to come up with a better way to do it and you can do it more macro than loan by loan. But once you start talking about macro, you're going to get involved in a lot of issues about whether people live there, whether they have the ability to pay, whether they were honest when they first told people how much their incomes were, so we're working through it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes because basically we put the up the reserves and the stuff is held off-balance sheet. That is the 40 basis points and it will add seven &#x2013; how much...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about 7 billion pre-tax of additional reserves, and that really drives the decline in capital and gives you the basis point impact on the balance sheet.</p>

          <p>No, it's just an accounting adjustment below the line, but it does reduce book capital by the after-tax amount. And there are some other adjustments in there, but it's probably about $4 billion of capital.</p>

          <p>I made no particular comments in the outlook itself. It's going to be dependent upon where the economy goes, Jason. As Jamie just pointed out, at some point maybe in the middle of the year, you could get to an inflection point, but that's &#x2013; we're not there yet.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>FICC was really across the board. There were a couple small negative one-shot items. I think it was cleanup, and so far this year it's fine. We expect buyers to be good.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I think at the last call, you had mentioned that your plan was to increase investment in the card business despite the fact that you were planning to still run hefty losses in the first half of 2010, and it looks like the revenue side came in relatively strong. Could you just give us an update in your strategic thinking on that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the financial side before any changes to reserves, the bearing, obviously the cost of credit, we're going to lose 1 billion in the first quarter and the second. There will be a point in time in my opinion that reserves come down. It's possible they're going to go up, but there will be a time they come down. So obviously the real impact might be different than that. And we took this as an opportunity to design new products. And if you look at &#x2013; if you watch TV at all, okay, you've seen our Sapphire ads and our Blueprint ads and our Ink ads and the new small business product. And we think we have some great new products and we're spending the money to roll them out.</p>
          <p>Marketing costs a lot of money in this business. You're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars</p>
          <p>So you didn't see us reduce marketing expenses. Or at least if we did, it was very modest in this recession. So eventually, we'll have a turnaround in the business and we have good products and good services, and we'll have done what we can &#x2013; obviously we've done all of this stuff we had to do for the law changes and you'll see turn in the business.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys; just a couple of questions. The first is did the UK bonus tax have any material implications for the tax charges this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing on the tax side. That's a when-it-happens item, so it could be first or second quarter of next year. We'll see. As I said, the anticipation of that cost took some money out of our bonus pools, and so you saw that in the comp-to-revenue ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us just a rough idea of magnitude on what you think it could be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would have preferred to book it, but there is not the legislation. It's hard to tell what legal entities were people who would relate to, how it relates. So we can't, but you're talking about several hundred million dollars at one point, and it could be more than that. It could be less than that. It really depends how the legislation turns out. That will be a first or second quarter item when it's finalized.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the second thing, what drove the decision to sell non-performing assets in the Investment Bank? Is that going to be an ongoing process, or was that a one-off cleanup process in the run up to year end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those decisions are made asset by asset. And like I said, some of those were not sales as much as they were restructurings. So we had non-performing loans and the company restructured, raised money, moved on, and the balance has come down to come out of non-performing. We try to make the economic decision. It's not a &#x2013; we don't try to manage the balance sheet or MPAs or something like that. It's just economic. Everything is economic.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then my last question, I guess just again back on Basel III, I mean was there anything in that proposal that really stood out to you as being particularly problematic or nonsensical I guess in terms of either grossing up of derivatives or anything like that in that proposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I separate accounting from capital, post up derivatives and stuff like that, it wouldn't matter as much. The initial ones that came out would require a lot more capital. And so we're double counting a lot of things. And then the liquidity one, I don't personally understand what they're looking for. Was that a Basel III thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But you know what, I put that one in the category of it's years away. It needs to be done right. It's years away. The industry is going to have plenty of capital before we ever get to those years. And I'm not going to worry about it that much, but the early indications they put out would be a lot more capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You mentioned that middle market loans are leveling out, and there's some early increase in demand in small business. Do you think we start to see commercial loans actually increase in the first quarter, or is this just very early indications of a turn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm talking about middle market now. It's possible &#x2013; I'd say level out. I'm not sure we're going to see an increase, but it's possible. And it really relates to &#x2013; again, it's really the economy. If you see the economy start to grow, yes, I think we're going to see those loans go up. The large corporate loans which are down a lot, that is more bond markets, the companies that can finance elsewhere and they're doing that.</p>

        <plist>

          <p>I was just following up on the small business comment. You mentioned a pickup in demand there, and there is a lot of initiatives in Washington to make credit easier for them. There are some tax credits they're proposing. And I'm just wondering how meaningful the pickup in small business demand can be for volumes overall?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was pretty significant quarter over quarter in terms of pickup. And what I don't know is we're doing a lot of advertising. And any bankers &#x2013; I don't know that the pickup was the whole industry or just us. And when you see other banks' report, you'll get a better feel for that. Obviously we've been trying to support in every way we can the economy and any small business program, and other things that people do would be great. I think what's going to drive small business would be the same thing that drives everything else, which is the return to health of the economy. That will drive most of these things. We don't know that any more than you do.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>No, there are so many items that go through something like FICC, but there are a couple hundred items, a couple hundred million dollars maybe. We hope to do better in FICC. I would say it was a little disappointing this quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. I just have I guess one follow-up, again related to FICC. So if we expect volumes to increase from the weak volumes in the fourth quarter, is there anything about spread going forward that makes you think it should tighten even further, or would you say that by the fourth quarter, trading &#x2013; customer spreads had tightened to where you think they will go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've seen a lot of the tightening, and they're back to pretty active markets, tight bid-ask. And they're driven by product, but I think you're back to a fairly competitive situation, which is good for the world and the economy. I'm just not going to say good for the trading books.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we have a fairly reasonably optimistic outlook that the volume will recover from the depressed fourth quarter levels, you wouldn't say that additional spread tightening would be any kind of an equal offset?</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Because it seems like the numbers they're putting out imply it is tax deductible and they're calling it a fee. But anyway, and then in regard to not only the NPLs but also the criticized loans, various components were down also. So I guess I'm surprised a little bit you're not making more of a deal of that as perhaps an inflection point.</p>

          <p>Right, okay. And then in regard to the comp ratio in the Investment Bank, you were running at 38% for the nine months and then, as you say, got it down to 33% for the year for the various factors that you discussed. It just seems like it will be hard to get the 40% given where revenue seems to be. I don't really see how you get there.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is up to us. That's how we get there. I mean, I would say if we were just trying to help you normalize it, it probably would normalize closer to 40, maybe closer to 38. Remember, we charge for capital and expenses and there's profit base and all that. So it can move around, but I think a good rule of thumb is to expect 40%.</p>

          <p>I would look at the third quarter year to date and that kind of rate. Ignore the fourth quarter true up. The fourth quarter in fact, put it aside and think about the third quarter year to date as a good tax rate going forward.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I'm just curious whether &#x2013; Senator Dodd and Representative Frank proposed had this Systemic Resolution Fund, and President Obama called this the responsibility fee and that it was to repay TARP. And is it your understanding that both are still on the table, or is it one or the other?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've got us. We see stuff like you see it for the first time. It might surprise you. We generally agree with the concept that the industry should pay for its own cleanup. But TARP got extended to a lot of things other than banks, like insurance companies and car companies. And so I don't understand why we should pay for that. In fact, we already paid for that.</p>

          <p>Hi. One nitpicky follow-up, deposits were up 70 billion on a period-end basis. Was that just some hot money at the end of the quarter? It didn't seem like it was on the retail side, I guess more on the corporate side. Could you give us some color on that?</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Jamie, earlier in the week, you mentioned commercial real estate, and I think you referred to it as being a train wreck but having already occurred. I was wondering whether that was something you were talking about specifically as it related to JPMorgan or the industry as a whole. I think there's probably some doubts that we've seen the worst of commercial real estate. So I just wanted to expand upon your thoughts there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was not referring to JPMorgan because we don't have a tremendous amount of real estate exposure and thus risk. But in the Commercial Bank, a good chunk of our losses come out of the real estate side.</p>
          <p>What I was referring to was that values are already way down. That has already happened, so different parts of the country, 20, 30, 40%. You're seeing new money come in and how it gets recognized on financial statements, for banks, some have reserved it. Some it's going to come. And it has obviously caused a lot of banks &#x2013; a lot of the banks are going bankrupt is because of their commercial real estate exposure. Some of it has been marked to market in CMBS. Some of it is held by pension plans and some is held by &#x2013; what I'm referring to, I don't think it's going to be a tremendous hit to the economy from here. I think it's in the numbers. It's in the values. It's in people's minds; and yes, quite a bit more needs to be recognized I'm certain on financial statements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. As you think about the commercial segment, I mean I know you guys had very, very strong reserves there. But obviously given the uptick in the credit losses there, I was a little surprised that you didn't add a little bit more to reserves; so just curious as to what it is you're seeing specifically within that segment and why it resulted in those actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We just did a very good end of the year scrub on everything in that space given all the focus on it. And net of it, we're still very comfortable with 3% reserves on the total book.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just lastly, certainly there's increased regulatory pressures on you guys and as it relates to the US consumer. Just curious as to does this change your thoughts or your outlook as you look at potentially getting into international consumer businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't change anything with international consumer businesses, which as you know we're not in. And that's a big strategic issue that we'll deal with over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I meant in terms does it change your outlook for strategically how you would approach going after that business and what timeframe?</p>

          <p>Good morning. Looking at mortgage refis, the FHA streamlined. Rules have changed so that going forward, you'll have to reappraise properties, reappraise or verify income.
