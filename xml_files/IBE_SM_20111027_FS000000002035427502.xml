        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We are going to move onto the Presentation of the Results of the First Nine Months of 2011. My apologies for starting late, but I am afraid that it's raining in Madrid and there's a big traffic jam and it's been very difficult to get to our offices.</p>
          <p>But we are going to be sticking to the usual format, that is, questions from the floor, questions from the telephone, to finish with the Web questions and we expect this event to last one and a half hours, not more than that. So I am now going to give the floor to the President of Iberdrola, Mr. Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you very much for coming. Many thanks to those of you that are here with us today and those of you that are following us on the telephone line. But I would like to give you the main landmarks of the last nine months.</p>
          <p>I will be talking about the regulatory situation, especially of Spanish and British markets, and then after that, Pepe S&#xE1;inz Armada will be giving you the details of all of these results, and will be talking about the financial position of the group. And I will finish with some conclusions and then we'll move on to the questions.</p>
          <p>And I would like to start with the first nine months of 2011. The profits have totaled to &#x20AC;2,143 million which is a 3.5% increase, which shows how capable the group is to grow, even when the market conditions are very difficult.</p>
          <p>From an operating point of view, the activity portfolio has allowed us to slightly improve our gross profits and we now have reached &#x20AC;5.5 billion. And we've also continued with our cost contention actions, which have maintained everything at a very flat level. And all this due to the increase in the gross margins have allowed us to improve our efficiency during these nine months.</p>
          <p>From the financial point of view, in the last nine months, we've carried out intense activity geared towards optimizing our balance structure. And the outcome of this on September the 30 is that the financial expenses have been reduced significantly, and our liquidity position has totaled &#x20AC;9.6 billion. And the operating cash flow has also gone up 2.3% and now stands at &#x20AC;4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>And this growth in results together, with an improvement of financial structure, have made it possible for us to maintain our financial ratios within the ranges that correspond to the A classification. And this has been recognized by the agency Standard and Poor's and Moody's, who have also improved the prospects of Iberdrola, now that there is a rating slump.</p>
          <p>But moving on now to the main aspects of the results of this period, I would like underscore that in these nine first months of the year, the group has become very solid from an operating point of view. So although the third quarter of the year has presented very severe conditions in the fiscal year, with a drop in production of nearly 6% and a very moderate evolution of distributed power, especially in Spain and the U.K., Iberdrola has managed to increase the gross margin by nearly 2% and now stands at &#x20AC;8,828 million.</p>
          <p>And the regulated business has played a very important role that nearly accounts for 50% of the group's gross margins. The 6% growth obtained in this item reflects the improvement in the remuneration businesses in the grids in Spain, the United States and the U.K., and the incremental contribution made by Elektro in Brazil, that compensates the divestitures of the gas companies in Connecticut. So the gross margin has grown 7.5%. That has been boosted by the very good behavior of the wind power activity, whose production has grown 15%, although there has been less growth in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally, the liberalized business shows a negative trend affected by the reduction of margins in the U.K. and by the increase in the levies applied to generation and commercialization activities. The group's &#x2013; the group has reacted by focusing on cost contention, which has made us achieve an evolution that has been practically flat in terms of the net operating expenses.</p>
          <p>And savings have focused on staff, with a 1% improvement in net terms and external services that have <mark type="ph" /> stumped at (4:49) 1.4%, although the inclusion of the collections for insurance in 2010 means that there has been a 2% increase. But we have to point out the reduction of costs in the regulated business, thanks to the improvement in efficiency obtained fundamentally in the United States and the reduction of costs that we've had in Spain, that compensate the increase we've had in the U.K. due to the lower level of activation.</p>
          <p>And then the operating expenses of Brazil have increased, because of the contribution made by Elektro, which at a global level, is practically compensated by lower costs because of the divestiture in the Connecticut gas companies that was carried out last year.</p>
          <p>As regards the liberalized business, net operating expenses are flat, as the slump registered in the Mexico and the flat progression of the U.K. contract and the increase in costs produced by the growth of the commercial activity in Spain.</p>
          <p>And finally, Renewables has improved its operating cost ratio per installed megawatt. The growth of the gross margin together with the cost savings has made it possible to obtain a slight growth of EBITDA, which stands at &#x20AC;5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>But I would like to talk about how well the regulated business is operating right now. And there has been a negative trend in the liberalized business that is affected not only by the complex operating environment of the U.K., but also because there has been an increase of more than 50%, and that are growing in Spain, and the U.K. and now have reached &#x20AC;469 million. And this account represents <mark type="ph" /> 50% (6:24) of the gross margin of the business, more than double than two years ago.</p>
          <p>Finally, I have to talk about the impact of the Guatemala business as regards divestitures. And the results have been affected by a third quarter in which there is not only a complex market situation, but there are some non-recurrent or <mark type="ph" /> absorption (6:45) factors that have a negative impact of the results.</p>
          <p>Just to mention those that I've not referred to yet, in the regulated business, the growth of EBITDA has been affected by positive settlements in the third quarter of 2010, which has increased the comparison base. And then because there were extraordinary expenses in the United States that are connected to the Irene hurricane, which we hope will be recovered over the next fiscal years according to the British regulations, but which have an effect on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And as regards the renewable business, the third &#x2013; in the third quarter, we've had very low levels of wind, which we hope will improve, and we're seeing how the wind is blowing very strongly, especially over the next few months.</p>
          <p>And on the liberalized business, I would like to underscore the lower levels of production in Spain produced by some of the programmed shutdowns of our nuclear power stations, and because there is less hydroelectricity. And the situation of the U.K. where there have been very significant slumps in demand, especially of gas throughout the third quarter, which are now being mitigated. All of this has been partially compensated by the improvement in prices after recent increases.</p>
          <p>Finally, I have to refer to the evolution of rates of exchange, which in the third quarter, had a negative effect of nearly 4.2 points relative to the growth of the EBITDA. And we trust that in Q4, the impact of many of these factors will be mitigated or will even disappear, which should allow us, as we'll see later on, to go back to the path conducive to growth, according to our plans.</p>
          <p>As regards balance sheet management and the current situation of the financial markets, we've put our stakes on &#x2013; on a very cautious political financial policy, thanks to which we have continued optimizing solidity and liquidity and we've resorted to the funding market for capitals and we've resorted to banks.</p>
          <p>And since the month of January, we have retained &#x20AC;6.5 billion through a number of operations in Euros, dollars, pounds and Reais. And in this respect, I would like to say that since summer, we've carried out, among other operations, issues of bonds totaling &#x20AC;600 million in the euro market, &#xA3;350 million in the U.K., R$300 million in Brazil and we've closed a number of transactions with the European investments bank.</p>
          <p>And this has allowed us to improve the profile of the debt, whose average maturity now stands at 6.4 years and we've obtained a liquidity in excess of &#x20AC;9.6 million, once we paid for the acquisition of Elektro and once we carried out the plan for the repurchase of shares, linked to the merger between Iberdrola and Iberdrola Renovables.</p>
          <p>So that means that we have our funding needs covered for the next two years, but I would also like to underscore that Iberdrola has collected this year more than &#x20AC;2.5 billion that have to do with the tariff deficit. And we hope that in the next few weeks, the issues that are linked to deficit will continue according to the program that has been designed by the Ministry of Industry.</p>
          <p>And the financial ratios of Iberdrola, as I said before, are situated very comfortably within the A rating ranges. And I have also said that the agencies Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's have reaffirmed the A rating for Iberdrola and they say that we are stable. And these improvements have taken place in an environment in which there's been a worsening of the credit rating of all sectors, and the electrical business too, in which most of the competitors of Iberdrola have had a reduction in their rating or their prospects.</p>
          <p>And to conclude this section, the solid progression of the company that has produced an increase of 3.5% in net profits and 2.3% in our cash flow, this demonstrates that this industrial model for growth is capable of generating results and cash flow in any financial environment and market.</p>
          <p>But now, I would like to move on to the regulatory aspects of the period. And I would like to start by underscoring that the sector has focused on the stage that is characterized by enormous investment need and this is not only so because of the degree of obsolescence of the generation assets and the current grids, and also because there are requirements imposed by the energy policy objectives and in particular, in terms of safety of supply and reduction of emissions in all countries.</p>
          <p>And we also have to add the investments that have to be made in the group business and commercialization to achieve energy efficiency and the fulfillment of these objectives requires a very careful planning process, a process in which you have to choose the generation technologies that are sufficiently mature and capable of achieving a reduction in emissions that is effective and has a reasonable cost.</p>
          <p>The fiscal year, we have to &#x2013; in this fiscal year, we have to understand the effect that the base technologies we'll have, like nuclear power, and scarcely predictable technologies like wind power. And we need to know to what extent we will have to maintain a number of thermal plants up and running. And planning, that also has to predict the impact that all these changes will have on the electricity transport grids. So we have to establish a program for their extension and reinforcement, according to our needs.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have to design stable and predicable regulatory frameworks that rationalize, to the greatest possible degree, the impact that all these investments are going to have in terms of costs for the end consumer. But if we compare all of these things in ideal planning process, with the current situation in Spain, we'll be able to see that the regulatory trend of recent years has conservatively reduced the rationality of the system. Recovering this will obviously be based on putting an end to the tariff deficit by collecting the amounts outstanding, and by revising internal and external costs that are supported by the tariff.</p>
          <p>But if we were to look at the costs of the system in 2010, we will see that 35% of that total costs correspond to energy policy decisions. And of this percentage, there has been an exponential growth in recent year, mainly because of the premiums applicable to the special regime, which since 2004, have grown by &#x2013; in an amount of &#x20AC;22 billion, which is identical to the tariff deficit that has been accumulated over this period.</p>
          <p>So this is why the Spanish system is one in which support for Renewables represents a cost per megawatt hour which is the highest figure in Europe. And in fact, in 2009, this cost already exceeded &#x20AC;22 per megawatt hour, vis-&#xE0;-vis less than &#x20AC;15 in countries like Germany.</p>
          <p>So as a result of this, each Spanish consumer will have to pay something like &#x20AC;250 as regards some premiums attached to the special regime. But the reason for the Spanish system to have created a bubble, which is the term that has been used by the European Regulator Council, has to do with the massive implementation of a non-mature technology, which is the solar technology.</p>
          <p>And right now, wind technology has achieved a sufficient level of development to provide an energy solution. And in this regard, its contribution to the system in terms of energy is very similar to the weight it has in relation to the total cost of the system.</p>
          <p>But solar technologies and PV and wind power only provide 3% of the power, although they represent 13% of the total cost of the system, that is solar power and PV. But I am sure that this figure will increase as the new <mark type="ph" /> Mercado (14:39) power stations are commissioned, and we have to do something about this over the next few years.</p>
          <p>So this is the main cause behind the deficit. We shouldn't forget that in 2010, the total amount of money that was spent on solar plants was 45% the money received by the wind power plants, although it produced an amount of power that was six times lower.</p>
          <p>So this situation could become much more severe in the next few years, if we allow the errors made with the PV plants to be made again with thermosolar generation. So we have rushed into the massive implementation of PV stations, which means that the nearly 4,000 megawatts already installed are going to obtain premiums of &#x20AC;200,000 per every &#x20AC;1 million invested over the next decades. And should we have waited for the technology to achieve its current level of development, these premiums would be much lower and they would represent between &#x20AC;70,000 and &#x20AC;90,000, in other words, less than one-third. Well, if we focus on the date of the pre-register, the mistake could be made all over again with the thermosolar plants, which, according to the current regulations, are as costly as the PV plants were a few years ago.</p>
          <p>And in this regard, the 2,500 megawatts that have been pre-registered for this technology could provoke an additional cost of &#x20AC;2 billion in premiums. And thus, if you calculate what has to be spent by each customer, it could be &#x20AC;100 per &#x2013; every year for the next 40 to 50 years. And from the environmental perspective, the thermosolar technology is considered to be less efficient than wind power and PV, because the need to use gas in the production process means that we have emissions of nearly 200 grams of CO2 per every kilowatt hour. So it's not a clean source. So that means that, practically half of what is emitted by a combined cycle plant.</p>
          <p>The additional needs for water-steam cooling, together with the additional process of mirror cleaning, means that these plants consume close to 10,000 liters of water for each megawatt hour produced, figures which are closer to those of a coal plant, of course, and much greater than photovoltaic plants, which practically require nothing, and much more than wind power production, that requires zero.</p>
          <p>So therefore, the massive deployment of thermosolar plants has no justification, neither from the energy, economic or environmental point of view. And we will have to wait for a massive deployment when the technology improves, as occurred with photovoltaic production when production costs were reduced.</p>
          <p>Another key issue in understanding the actual situation of the electricity sector in Spain and the sustainability of the prices makes it necessary to understand that the prices paid by the end customers include many more costs than those of generating and distributing electricity.</p>
          <p>According to the preliminary calculations for 2011, the energy and the grid costs represent less than 50% of the total price paid by the consumer. Therefore, it's urgent to rationalize this. And contrary to what some people are recently saying, there are sufficient measures available to us to avoid greater increases in prices than are strictly necessary to design a sustainable framework for the future.</p>
          <p>And this means reducing methods that are economically unsustainable. Therefore, the first thing that needs to be completed is a reduction in the extra costs or the additional costs that were incurred. We also have had to consider additional measures, such as separating <mark type="ph" /> over costs (18:36) the national coal from the electricity tariffs, or the possibility of using earnings from CO2 emission rights as of 2013 to reduce the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>These measures that could be carried out to put an end to the symmetries in the electricity system in Spain, and they are certainly more effective and go less against the legal and economic rationale than the imposition of the additional levies, which have already been paid and which in these nine months, represented &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>And we only need to look at the UNESA reports published each year to find that the profitability of the generation activity in Spain is already so tight that any additional levy would bring values close to zero or even take them to negative levels.</p>
          <p>Regarding the British system, according to the Ofgem regulator, the necessary investments in the next 10 years could amount to &#xA3;200 billion. And I would like to highlight two differential characteristic in the U.K versus Spain. First, is that the replacement process for the generation facilities and in particular, the construction of new low emission technologies is less advanced. And therefore, the various agents in the sector have the opportunity of learning from the mistakes made by others.</p>
          <p>And secondly, most of the reforms are being carried out through procedures that are considerably transparent. And <mark type="ph" /> at this sense (20:14), starting with energy transmission, we are establishing the remuneration for the period 2013-2021, a period in which ScottishPower is going to triple its assets base through the investments it's going to carry out.</p>
          <p>On Monday, Ofgem published the first assessment of the business plan submitted by the various agents and included ScottishPower among the companies susceptible for tariff approval through the accelerated procedure, thanks to the detail and the reasonability of its plan.</p>
          <p>According to the regulator in January, we will know whether this accelerated approval takes place. In any case, I would also like to highlight but over and above the procedural aspects, the key will be that it seems probable that Ofgem will recognize the major investment effort made in the final remuneration.</p>
          <p>Regarding the renewable energies, the key issues are the non-retroactivity in any modification in the tax regime according to the existing capacity, which has been clearly accepted by the authorities. This, therefore, is not under discussion.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the closedown of the remuneration applicable to the plants commissioned before the coming into force of the new system. And according to the proposal published last week by Ofgem, this represents a regime that will basically be a continuation of the present one.</p>
          <p>Within the traditional generation, as well as the regimes applicable to the new nuclear power plants, the implementation of capacity <mark type="ph" /> payments (21:53) for thermal generation are also being discussed, an aspect which we consider to be a key for the security of supply in the U.K. in the future and a fair sharing of transmission charges.</p>
          <p>Finally, the British commercial market is subject to controversy in recent weeks. We have to say that at ScottishPower, we are also trying to improve transparency in relations with our customers. We have published a number of measures to control in the best possible way our sales channels. And this way, as you will have been able to see, we have decided to create the figure of the energy consultant, separate from those in charge of selling products, and who will channel the relation with new potential customers.</p>
          <p>We would also like to add that the results presented today clearly show that the commercialization activity in the U.K. is currently producing losses and some of the figures published recently and that talk about our high profitability in this business are far from reality.</p>
          <p>We hope that this will be taken into account in considering possible reforms of the commercial market. However, the necessary reforms are underway in the U.K. and I would just like to say that the urgency of the problems and the need for new generation capacity make it indispensable to avoid any delay in the decision-making process.</p>
          <p>And I'll now hand the floor over to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada to explain the results for this quarter in much greater detail.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Chairman. Good morning. And now as usual, I will review the most important aspects in the accounts, the business developments and end up with an analysis of the financial situation for the group. As variations to the consolidation perimeter, the incorporation of Elektro since May 1 offsets the effect of the sale of gas companies in U.S., the electricity business in Guatemala, Neo-Sky, and some other operations.</p>
          <p>EBITDA grew 0.4%, net profits 3.5% and recurring profits 2.6%. Control of operating cost and good developments in the financial results have been key to optimize the results of the company during the period. The operating cash flow has increased 2.3%, reaffirming the <mark type="ph" /> recurrence (24:23) and the healthy cash flow generation of Iberdrola. Gross margin increased to 1.8% to &#x20AC;8.827 billion in spite of the fact that the exchange rate reduced it by &#x20AC;134 million.</p>
          <p>There have been growth in the regulated renewable and liberalized business in the U.K. that offset the developments in the British liberalized business, which fell &#x20AC;157 billion. Without this impact, the growth margin would have grown 3.3%. The consolidation of Elektro provides &#x20AC;277 million and compensates the loss of the assets sold in U.S., &#x20AC;257 million. Basic margin represents 1.9 million, more than &#x20AC;9 billion, since the value of the issue rights assigned in September 2011 is somewhat higher than those assigned in September 2010.</p>
          <p>The net operating expenses are stable. The lower expenses resulting from the sale of the various businesses, &#x20AC;75 million, are offset by the costs associated to Elektro that represent &#x20AC;81 million. It's also a period that is unfavorable compared to 2010, which included compensation of &#x20AC;49 million, which was offset by reclassification of the operating expenses to levies in the U.K. as I'll explain later.</p>
          <p>This year also includes &#x20AC;30 million, as the Chairman explained, as a result of Hurricane Irene and Lee storm in the U.S. So, operating costs only grow 0.1%. Net personal expenses are reduced 1.1% to &#x20AC;1.28 billion. The average head count has been reduced 1.2% even after the consolidation of Elektro.</p>
          <p>The net external services, including the impact of the hurricanes, show an increase of 2% up to 1.308 billion. There is a strict control over these expenses. GON improves &#x20AC;41.5 million, levies increased 19.1% to &#x20AC;821 million as a result of the increase in liberalized business levies in Spain and the U.K.</p>
          <p>If the same permits had been maintained and the same exchange rate, the like-for-like EBITDA for the group would have shown a consolidated growth of 0.9%. Reported EBITDA reduces its growth by 0.4%. This growth is based on a growth in the basic margin of 1.9%, while operating growth grows less than the basic margin. But the major increase in levies, 19%, penalized the positive revolution of EBITDA. The EBITDA growth is based on our diversified business model, with a growth in the most stable businesses, regulated and Renewables, which provide 69% of the EBITDA and which offset the volatility of the liberalized business, especially in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Analyzing the operating profits by businesses and starting with the regulated businesses, EBITDA which includes Spain, U.K., United States and Brazil with Elektro included, grows 11.5% to &#x20AC;2.839 billion. And this improves the growth obtained in gross margin by 6.4%, thanks to a reduction of 1.2% in the net operating expenses. All business areas provide a recurring group level, although the U.S. drops because of the different report perimeter. Driven by regulatory improvements, the cost savings and the synergies resulting from the start-up of the same efficiency standards and better practices in the overall business, the regulated business in Spain contributes 41% of the EBITDA, U.K. 21%, U.S. 16% and Brazil 22%.</p>
          <p>Starting with the regulated business in Spain, it grew 11.4% to &#x20AC;1.173 billion, thanks to an increase in gross margin of 7.2% and a 6.2% improvement in net operating expenses. The growth in gross margin is a result of increase in recognized earnings for the regulated business. And we have to remember that during the first few months of 2010, a provisional remuneration was registered, which was lower than that finally approved in the tariff model.</p>
          <p>And this way, the development in the regulated earnings for the business is not fully comparable until the fourth quarter of this year. The increase in 11.4% in EBITDA is higher than the 7.2% in the gross margin, thanks to the improvement in net operating expenses.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in September 2010, there were positive settlements amounting to &#x20AC;100 million that have a negative impact on the comparison. The regulated business in the U.K. reached an EBITDA of &#x20AC;593 million, showing a growth of 8.5% because of the increase of 7.4% in the gross margin, because of the greater investments made and scheduled.</p>
          <p>As a result of the new remuneration for the DPCR5 business applied since April 1, 2010, the net operating expenses grew 4.9%, lower than the level of the gross margin. The impact of the exchange rate was negative. Without this, this effect would be 10%.</p>
          <p>The regulated business in the U.S. provides an EBITDA of &#x20AC;439 million. According to the IFRS regulations, which represents a fall of 16.9%, the negative effect derived from the sale of the business in Connecticut which represents &#x20AC;21 million less in EBITDA, has to be added to the non-recurring impacts of Hurricane Irene and Lee, and the results of all this is this drop that has been shown.</p>
          <p>In spite of the effects mentioned, the underlying development in the business is positive and represents &#x20AC;49 million more in EBITDA and we have the increase in tariffs because of the new rate case and the contribution of the transmission line in Maine.</p>
          <p>The Brazil EBITDA increases 51.1% to &#x20AC;633.9 million after incorporating Elektro to the perimeter, which has contributed &#x20AC;196 million since May 1. Additionally, the revaluation of the real has contributed &#x20AC;13 million, an increase of 3.3%. And the new hydroelectric plants have also added to this increase.</p>
          <p>The gross margin for the business increased 56.6%. &#x20AC;277 million are a result of incorporation of Elektro. The GON rises 73.3% and there is also an effect of &#x20AC;81 million, as a result of the exchange rate and increases in inflation and higher output in Brazil.</p>
          <p>Without Elektro, EBITDA would have increased by 4%. EBITDA fell 14.6%, Spain fell 2% because of the major increase in levies; in the U.K., 47.8% because of lower margin, sales, output and devaluation of the pound. Mexico, 18.3% affected by the sale of the business in Guatemala and the dollar devaluation.</p>
          <p>The net operating expenses show a stable development, while the levies increased significantly, 50.7% and this severely panelizes EBITDA for this business. Starting with the liberalized business in Spain, there is a reduction in the ordinary regime output of 13.3%, mainly as the Chairman said because of a drop of 27% in hydraulic production and 4.9% in nuclear production.</p>
          <p>A sales price has been obtained around &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour. This has &#x2013; mainly possible to obtain a greater margin, in spite of the fact that the procurement costs are increasing. In this business context, EBITDA dropped 2% to &#x20AC;1.2 billion, because of the major increase in the levies paid, 33% more. That offsets the effect resulting from the growth of 4.5% in the basic margin and the control of the net operating expenses.</p>
          <p>There is also a non-recurring positive effect, as mentioned, of &#x20AC;100 million associated to the reduction in provisions from previous years. 100% of the estimated output for 2011 is sold at a price of more than &#x20AC;58 per megawatt hour. And there are already 40 terawatt hours sold for 2012 above &#x20AC;60 million. As mentioned in the previous transparency, the EBITDA for the Spanish liberalized business is affected by an increase of 33.3% in levies to almost &#x20AC;400 million. This represents a third of this EBITDA.</p>
          <p>In fact, in the last two years, our levies in this business have practically doubled, from &#x20AC;205 million in September 2009 to &#x20AC;398 million. According to our estimates, these levels represent, for our nuclear output, &#x20AC;13 per megawatt hours produced. Most of them are made up of the nuclear levy, which represent &#x20AC;146 million and the new levies associated to funding savings plans and the energy efficiency, which represent &#x20AC;112 million. And the rest of the levies represent &#x20AC;141 million, that include the Extremadura eco levy and which is being taken to court.</p>
          <p>The basic margin in the liberalized business in the U.K. presents a drop of 18.5%, in an environment in which there has been a slump in sales, 3% in electricity and 15% in gas compared to 2010. And there have been very low spreads, with procurement costs that have not been compensated by an equivalent increase in the electricity sale price. And there has been an 18% reduction in output, because of the low market spreads.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have shown a stable evolution. There has been a reclassification of the CERT and CESP levies, that are expenses imposed by the regulator for energy efficiency programs, based on GON, totaling &#x20AC;42 million. So that's why there has been a strong increase.</p>
          <p>The economic impact of this reclassification at the level of GON is compensated by the extraordinary revenue that GON had in 2010, because of indemnities in Longannet, which was &#x20AC;49 million and that has not happened this year. So consequently, EBITDA presents a drop of 47.8% and now stands at &#x20AC;228 million. The negative impact produced by the rate of exchange has deducted &#x20AC;3 million from the EBITDA.</p>
          <p>But as we pointed out in the third quarter, in August, there has been an improvement in the business, especially in the gas area, with increases in the unit margin that have to do with the increase in rates. We expect that in Q4, this will be much better with recoveries of margins in electricity and gas.</p>
          <p>And the EBITDA of the liberalized business in Mexico has dropped 18.3% and now stands at &#x20AC;260 million and the effect by the exchange rate has subtracted &#x20AC;22 million. And there is also a negative impact in the Guatemala business, totaling &#x20AC;45 million. And the underlying operating evolution of the business has improved 3.4%.</p>
          <p>And the main &#x2013; as regards the main operating variables for the Renewables business, operating capacity has grown 12% and now stands at 12,800 megawatts, and installed capacity has also increased and now stands at 13,450 megawatts.</p>
          <p>The average load factor stands at 24.9%, nearly 25% relative to the previous year, although as the Chairman pointed out, there has been a slump of 3.3%, because of the low levels of wind. And output has grown 14.5% and now stands at 20.7 terawatt hour. Prices, &#x20AC;68.5 per megawatt hour, which is below the &#x20AC;72.3 megawatt hour over the same period of 2010, because of the greater weight of the business in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So, the greater installed power has been partially compensated by lower price and by the negative impact of the rate of exchange. That has subtracted &#x20AC;40 million and has produced a growth of the gross margin of 7.5%, which means &#x20AC;1.5 billion, which in the Renewable business, is 5%.</p>
          <p>Total EBITDA has grown 6.6% and now stands at &#x20AC;1,035 million and EBITDA of the Renewables business has gone up 6% and now stands at &#x20AC;1,029 million. And the Gas business only has made a contribution of &#x20AC;7 million in terms of the EBITDA, although it has improved the position we had relative to last year.</p>
          <p>And the EBITDA of other businesses presents a slump of 22.4%, and the weakness of the real estate business and other industrial activities, together with the sales of Neo-Sky and stakes with IBV, have made the gross margin drop 14.5%.</p>
          <p>However, cost contingent efforts have the continued. The EBIT of the group dropped 1.5% and now stands at &#x20AC;3.5 billion. The amortizations and provisions increased 3.8%, with a growth of 4.4% in amortizations and drop in 7.9% in provisions. And amortizations totaled &#x20AC;1.9 billion because of the incorporation of Elektro which is another &#x20AC;64 million. And this has been partially compensated by the lower levels of amortizations produced by the sale of the companies.</p>
          <p>The greater installed power of Renewables and investments in the regulated businesses in Spain and U.K. have also produced this growth. The financial results have improved 19.7%, thanks, among other things, to the impact that has been brought about by the hedging actions and this nearly accounts for &#x20AC;90 million in relation to 2010, because as you know, Iberdrola does this to reduce the volatility of net profits by using financial derivatives. The Iberdrola impact has to do with reversal of provisions, that accounts for &#x20AC;85 million, and which is compensated by a similar impact in minority actions, although we know that they total &#x20AC;92 million this year, vis-&#xE0;-vis &#x20AC;34 million of last year.</p>
          <p>And financial expenses linked to the debt has grown 3.2%, because of a 0.2% increase in the cost of related interest, including the new debt in reais of Elektro and in fact that it is partially compensated by a reduction of the average balance of the debt, and this has been produced by the operations <mark type="ph" /> carried up (39:54) in the first semester of the year. That is a collection of deficit and the presence of Qatar, whereas in the first quarter, there was an increase because of the operations related to the purchase of Iberdrola Renovables. And then we have the higher tariff deficit that has had a positive impact of &#x20AC;29 million.</p>
          <p>Net profits show a growth of 3.5% and now stands at &#x20AC;2 billion and the lower contribution of non-recurring results can be compensated by the financial expenses and the lower effective fiscal rate, which shows a 2% reduction in the U.K in 2011, which is additional to 1% in 2010. So I would like to say that this is a sustainable decline. It's not a specific slump. So that means that this reduction for levies in the U.K. is going to be permanent, and that in the two years, it's gone down 3%. It's gone down from 28% to 25% and the recurrent net profits grew 2.6% and now stand at &#x20AC;1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>But to finish my part of the report and talking about the first nine months of 2011, there has been a reduction in the tariff deficit that is still pending collection of the &#x20AC;5.2 billion we had at the end of 2010, &#x20AC;3.2 billion remain. That is 39% less.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> It has to be said on this call (41:11) that in spite of the difficult market conditions, we've maintained the FADE emissions in particular. On September the 26, we had the fifth issue totaling &#x20AC;1.5 billion of the &#x20AC;6 billion, we'll take those ones we have an opportunity window in the market. And the government made it possible for us to move onto private operations, which gives us much more flexibility as regards issuing bonds.</p>
          <p>And until September 2011, we have new deficit, totaling &#x20AC;797 million and &#x20AC;2.5 billion have been corrected, thanks to the securitization. And we have to add another &#x20AC;266 million through regular settlement. And the deficit generated by the system is in line with the government's expectations and the company has continued with its balance sheet strengthening process and the net debt without considering the tariff deficit stands at a figure of &#x20AC;28 billion, which is higher than the figure reported for September 2010. This increase took place in the third quarter for the fiscal year and was brought about by the purchase of the minority operations, representing &#x20AC;2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Leverage is 47.2%. If we include the tariff deficit, we are talking about &#x20AC;31 billion and leverage, another &#x20AC;870 million, which has to do with the operations that I've already mentioned. And the balance sheet strengthening policy and the growth that has been obtained in cash flow has allowed the company to maintain the strength of its financial ratios, excluding the tariff deficit and they have been strongly improved, including the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>The FFO ratio is maintained within the 21% to 22% ratio and if you include the tariff deficit, it would be 19.1% vis-&#xE0;-vis 18.6% of the previous fiscal year. And the ratio RCF and net debt is maintained at 17.5% and if you include the tariff deficit, it would be 15.7%. We have an excellent liquidity position. We have &#x20AC;9.6 billion in liquidity and credit lines available to date, which allows us to cover 24 months of our financial needs.</p>
          <p>And as you can see on this slide, we only has &#x20AC;1.6 billion in maturities in 2012. There is not an excessive concentration of maturities in any of the fiscal years and these maturities, I think they are affordable for a company with the financial strength of Iberdrola.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would like to say that the board of Iberdrola yesterday approved the implementation of a SCRIP dividend payable in January 2012, which is equivalent to the amount related to the 2011 dividend. And the data on January the 3, which is when the trading period would open, together with the right purchase commitment and then on January 20, we would have cash payments for sale of rights and then, 25th, we'd have the trading of the shares. And the price at which Iberdrola will buy these shares will be at least &#x20AC;0.143 per shares, which is what we had last year. And the mathematical expectations of the price of these rights, we estimate will range between &#x20AC;0.146 and &#x20AC;0.147, in line with the price per share of last year.</p>
          <p>And the President will conclude this presentation. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Well, to conclude, I would like to underline that once again, the results of Iberdrola show how suitable our industrial project is. It's a project that is based on the energy business and it's a project that is always related to our operating efficiency approach. It's a project that has allowed us to optimize the risk of exposure to a specific area or activity through the geographic diversification of business.</p>
          <p>Diversification, it's a project that is focused on sustained cash flow and on maintaining an optimum financial structure. And in a period that has been characterized by a complex operating and financial environment, especially in Q3, this value creation process has allowed us to carry an improving result. And the gross margin has grown, thanks to the healthy situation of the regulated Renewable businesses. That account for two-thirds of the total that has compensated the trends in the liberalized business that is still affected by the situation of the British market.</p>
          <p>And the group has achieved these increases maintaining the flat operating costs. So this has allowed EBITDA to grow up to &#x20AC;5.5 billion, in spite of the increase in the levies applied to the liberalized business that have grown 50% in this period and which placed this item above &#x20AC;800 million in only nine months.</p>
          <p>And then, we have a strong improvement in the financial expenses that has to do with the contention of the debt and our very cautious management of the exchange rate hedgings, together with an improvement in the fiscal rate which has given us a net profit of &#x20AC;2.2 billion, with a growth of 3.5%. And also, I'd like to underscore the solid behavior of cash flow generation that now have exceeded &#x20AC;4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>And as regards the closing of the fiscal year, we expect that there will be an improvement in the complex situation we had in the first nine months. So in the regulated business, the effect of the regulatory improvements in the United States and the U.K., together with the positive impact of the contribution that has been made by Elektro, should serve to compensate the effect that the fourth quarter had in 2010 in terms of the settlements that took place in Spain. So we hope that the business will maintain its positive outlook.</p>
          <p>And the Renewables business, well, we expect there to be an improvement in results in all geographic areas in Q4, because of the increase in installed power and because there is going to be more wind, especially in Spain, where the production of Q4 last year was very low, which is what has happened this year in Q3.</p>
          <p>And finally, as regards the liberalized business, we expect that the higher prices in Spain and the recovery of margins in the U.K will allow us to partially change what we've had in the three previous quarters. Although and as regards the year, we expect the trend to be negative in a large extent because of this increase in levies that I mentioned previously.</p>
          <p>So we expect that the results of 2011 will allow us to fulfill our average accumulative growth ranges for the period 2010-2012, which as you know, stand between 5% and 9%, as regards EBITDA, as regards the recurrent net profit, and this is going to allow us to maintain our remuneration to shareholders, at least in line with the previous fiscal year.</p>
          <p>And as to what Pepe said, regarding the scrip dividend, the minimum purchase price will be &#x20AC;1.43. And we expect this figure to be exceeded one way or another. But in any case, and I'm going to finish with this, you can be completely sure that all of the women and men of the group are going to carry on working as usual, to make this project to have global growth, and we want to maximize results to benefit everybody.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, and now, we're going to move onto your questions from the floor or the telephone.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll start with the questions from the room. Are there any? Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Javier Garrido from JPMorgan. I had three questions. The first, as you can imagine, is about regulation in Spain. Everything you said regarding the possible solutions, regardless of how fair it is or not, how feasible do you think it is, in other words, taking externalities out of the tariff, using CO2 auctions to reduce that tariff deficit. They are feasible if it would be more public deficit. And in view of the current situation, do you think that can be implemented? Do you think it's a realistic solution?</p>
          <p>And, I would also like to know what your thoughts are regarding the possibility of a possible offer from the new government of an extension of the lives of nuclear power plants in exchange for a contribution from the utilities. If that proposal was made, what would be the position of Iberdrola? What would you be willing to accept or what would the red lines be?</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding the non-payments by local authorities, we've seen a lot of exaggerations in the press. But I would like to know how true it is that the amounts not being paid by local authorities has increased in recent months and to what extent does it concern you? And Brazil, can you give us an update on what the situation of your negotiations are with the Brazilian authorities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer the first question. Well, I think that there is a general awareness that the energy model we have is not sustainable. And, therefore, I have explained some ways of solving it, but there is no way of solving it the way we've been trying to solve it in recent years, by creating more problems. It doesn't make sense to continue to increase costs without also increasing earnings. This isn't sustainable.</p>
          <p>The energy sector worldwide is one of the few sectors that does not still depend on the national budget. It has its own funding capacity and it has a great capacity to create wealth and employment in the countries we operate in, and this is another multiplying factor. The factor is practically 10. For each person working in the utility sector, there are 10 people working around that.</p>
          <p>If we continue with the model we have, which isn't sustainable, we could become another one of the problem elements and instead of helping to solve the problem, we could become a further problem. So I pointed to some of the solutions, and the solution is to make an irrational situation rational.</p>
          <p>The other day, a German journalist said to me, talking about this document published by the European regulators, the question was, if the Spanish Green Party is also going to be paid for by the Germans. Well, Green, yes. And, Renewable, yes. Nobody has put more stakes on Renewables than Iberdrola, but let's do things rationally. We did things irrationally with the photovoltaic energy. Let's not do the same thing with the solar plants.</p>
          <p>Let's use mature technologies to produce green renewable energy, but not immature technologies that produce little energy and at very high costs. And energy, which in the case of thermosolar plants, isn't efficiently or environmentally efficient. It consumes major amounts of water and produces major amounts of CO2. And therefore, let's do things logically.</p>
          <p>So, I have pointed to some ideas, but I am sure that after the elections, there will be many more people that will have ideas. But it's true that society feels that we have a model that isn't sustainable and we don't need to build power stations to take pictures. There has to be more than that behind it, and somebody has to pay for the Green Party and Spaniards are going to have to pay &#x20AC;200, &#x20AC;300 and I don't know how many years to pay for the Green Party, when we could have done it for a quarter or a fifth or a sixth part of that, because we have the technology to do that.</p>
          <p>Spain has the capacity to build much more wind power, which costs &#x20AC;40,000 versus &#x20AC;300,000, &#x20AC;400,000 per &#x20AC;1 million invested in solar technologies. And I think that feasibility, I think things are going to change, because they cannot continue the way they are. Things cannot be done for just a few, without thinking about the many.</p>
          <p>The second point, the useful life or the working life, well, I think the Spanish legislation is very clear about this. There is a law that says that nuclear power plants, as long as they comply with the safety requirements, their working life will be that laid down by the competent technical authorities. This act was passed a year ago. So there is nothing new in this area.</p>
          <p>What's the spirit? Well, the spirit of Iberdrola is and always has been in every field, is to look for collaboration in all segments and in all areas. And in this area, as in other areas, we will always be open to discussing things and looking for solutions, practical solutions. But as the CFO said, in the nuclear area, we are paying in Spain &#x20AC;13 per megawatt hour. When they're talking about levies, we already have a levy of &#x20AC;13 per megawatt hour produced. And these levels are fairly similar to what the Germans pay, by the way, and we've done it here without making a noise. But public administrations, Paco, perhaps you can say something about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, debt is increasing. But in any case, it's a relatively small part of our portfolio. So the impact on the operating results isn't significant and the sales teams, well they always collaborate with the public administrations to find reasonable formulas or forms of payment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brazil. In Brazil, we are continuing with the discussions. You know what our position is. We bought Elektro, therefore we own it 100%. And in the other company, we are still having discussions with the partners to see how we can integrate all our businesses. But there is nothing new, at least not in the short-term, not eminently.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question from the room, Jorge Alonso.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, Jorge Alonso from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, I have two questions. The first is, whether you can give us an update on the strategic plan hypothesis based on the economic prospects, especially in terms of the exchange rates, which have been moving around considerably, the electricity demand both in Spain and in the U.K. and the commodities that affect electricity prices. And the second question is related to the tariff deficit. Do you see any alternative or how could the process be improved to accelerate the securitization, since it's taking longer than planned or longer than reasonable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the deficit, the CFO said that apart from the issues that have already been made, we hope that in the next few days, we will be able to make some more and the Treasury was planning one for the next few days. And there's also the private placements. I think that's another window of opportunity to do it, while this will continue.</p>
          <p>I think that the paths are open; so far this year, issues amounting to almost &#x20AC;9 billion, isn't it, Pepe? &#x20AC;9 billion. These are significant amounts. There is still a significant amount. But from the initial figure that we had at the beginning of the year, more than half in our case, I expect, will be completely securitized, so it continues. Additional measures, well, private placements, in the end we have to issue to the markets and make private placements. And regarding the hypothesis, do you want to comment on this, Pepe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are going to have a meeting at the beginning of next year, Investors Day, as we do every year, where all this will be discussed. So we are planning to have a meeting during the first quarter to discuss, as usual, the situation on all levels with all the figures. I've explained the forecast for this year and the expected changes.</p>
          <p>Well, yes, right now, the dollar is lower than we expected. As you know, the dollar is very volatile. And the fact is that our analysis and the market consensus in general is that the dollar should start slight appreciation against the euro soon.</p>
          <p>Regarding the regulated business and the hypotheses don't have too much of effect, on the contrary, we have the <mark type="ph" /> RBC5 (59:04), which is going well and the new rate cases.</p>
          <p>And regarding the liberalized business, it's true that we are having a lower growth in demand and perhaps lower prices at some point in time, but it's also true that we have been able to manage it in Spain with the margins that are in line with what we expected. And it's partly closed for 2012 and in the U.K., suitable measures have been taken to try to improve that evolution.</p>
          <p>So overall, it's true that we have some hypotheses that are weaker than was expected, but that's what management is for. We're working on the budget for 2012 and it seems that we could end the year in line with objectives established, as the Chairman said, a growth of between 5% and 9% in the accumulated EBITDA. Yes, more questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Manuel Palomo from Citigroup. Two questions please. The first basically is about Spain. In the first nine months, we've seen a major increase in the coal load factor and an effect in the load cycles. And I would like to ask what's happening with gas, the surplus gas that's being burnt? Is that gas being sold, is it all sold and on what markets and under what conditions? I'd like to try to understand whether these gas sales can also have an impact on the results of the liberalized business?</p>
          <p>And my second question is about the effective rate, I think it's been 18.9%. And in this last quarter, it's been especially low, 9.1%, and the CFO explained that this could be a result &#x2013; an effect of the levies in the U.K. My question is, is it exclusively because of the U.K. or is this 18.9% in nine months is sustainable in 2011, and also into 2012 and 2013?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Paco (1:01:22), can you comment on the gas situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

          <p>Yes, regarding gas, we had already said that our gas had been managed and placed some months ago. And that's the situation. The gas has been placed, and there is no pressure to burn it in Spain, when it can be placed at reasonable prices elsewhere under the present situation. What we've seen is that the rest of the gas in the system has currently been evolving towards this situation. Initially, there was a more pressure to burn gas at whatever price in Spain. And currently, gas is reflecting the opportunity cost, and we assume that the rest of the competition has done exactly the same, and placed that gas wherever it can be placed or sold in the world.</p>

          <p>The rate is slightly below 20, so, well, I'd like to repeat what I said you to you before, and that is that the rate in the U.K. is a sustainable reduction, from 28% to 25%, and I'm not sure if it's one point more &#x2013; it could be one point more next year, so this would allow us to maintain relatively reduced rates and I suppose &#x2013; or levies, rather and this could be 20% or 21% and I think that, that's going to happen next year too. So this reduction is produced by an element that is sustainable.</p>

          <p>Virginia Sanz, please?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My name is Virginia Sanz. I'm from Deutsche Bank I have several questions. First as regards the debt, I'd like to know if the objective you set for the strategic figure of &#x20AC;25 billion, do you maintain this with these operations involving Elektro and Iberdrola Renovables, or is that objective no longer in your minds? And how do you think that the debt should be closed at the end of the year, bearing in mind possible securitizations that could arrive? And these private bonds you've spoken about for the deficit, what kind of warranties are there? Does this have to do with the ratings of the companies or is at the same warranty that is given by FADE?</p>
          <p>And then the U.K., I have two questions on the U.K. I think that in your presentation, if I am not wrong, you are losing money. Commercialization of the margins are negative, and other companies have margins between 3% and 5%. So I would like to know if there are any possibilities of you to increase prices again in the U.K., or perhaps you would have to reduce costs to a greater extent then also in the U.K. as regards Renewables. And then, the regulation for the first proposal, I think that the offshore business is worse off than we thought initially, and I would like to know in this regard what it is you were considering as regards offshore investment beyond 2014, and if what you already have, do you think that's attractive enough or do you think it should be looked into?</p>
          <p>And then finally, as regards the privatization process, it seems that there are six companies that are interested, I'd like to know if in this process, would you also contemplate the possibility of selling the package you already own? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as regards the debt issue we &#x2013; fundamentally, we measure ourselves according to the financial ratios, because you have to bear in mind that when we initiated this plan, we did not consider the repurchase of Renovables, nor the incorporation of Elektro and if something happens with Energia, well, it could also affect us. So for us, the key element has to do with the financial ratios, which is what the rating agencies measure. So we maintain the ratings. We have an FFO <mark type="ph" /> related to it (1:05:12) of about 20% and we have a cash flow of something like 16% or 17% or 17%, depending on whether you look at it without or with the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>So, those are our objectives and we expect to finish the year in those ratios without any problems whatsoever. So this is what we feel very comfortable with. And as regards to the private placement, we don't do that. This is done by the FADE, the FADE. So they have the same warranties in the public placement and the only thing is that this is something that has not yet been done, because they are setting up mechanism for the right people to sign whenever a private placement is to take place.</p>
          <p>So they have the same warranties as the public placements and in fact, we know that there are certain banks that are already knocking on the door of the treasury or the ministry for some placements, but the warranties are exactly the same as in the public placements. And that is something we did outside the balance sheet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as regards to commercial issue in the U.K., we are talking here about the results for the nine months and I think that the CFO already said that since the price increases in August, the results are improving a little bit. However, throughout the year, the situation of nine months vis-&#xE0;-vis <mark type="ph" /> three (1:06:35) is going to present changes, but I think that the situation of the margins in terms of commercialization that are negative or practically negative, it is not only something applicable to ScottishPower. I think that it's widespread. And I think what you mentioned is the only one that still has some positive margin.</p>
          <p>But in any case, we are all affected by the same situation. And this is what has produced this price increase in energy prices and that was not accompanied by increases in the tariffs. But I hope that this will change, especially in relation to the future.</p>
          <p>As regard the increases in the future, I think that yesterday, in the meeting that took place with the Prime Minister, all of the companies, at least ScottishPower, said, and correct me, Paco, if I am wrong, at least until March of next year, the same prices would be maintained. Regarding renewable and offshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. The announcement that came out earlier in the week is &#x2013; that's the start of the consultation process. So it is important to remember that it's not &#x2013; what's been announced is not the final answer. It is the government's suggestion. We'll go through a six-week consultation and then we will get the final outcome of the renewable obligation bands.</p>
          <p>They have announced that they would like to see a reduction in the band for offshore wind. We expected that; we knew that would happen around about 2015, 2016. That was part of our expectation. With regard to our plans, West of Duddon Sands project, which is our first big offshore project, it will be built and operational long before the reduction in that banding. So it will be in the <mark type="ph" /> TULOC (1:08:20) category and in the <mark type="ph" /> TULOC (1:08:22) band.</p>
          <p>The impact in terms of reduction in the Renewables obligation, we will put that through our modeling. But at the same time as that reduction comes in, we will also see an uplift and an increase because of the carbon impact and the wholesale price, which we believe will probably offset pretty much any impact in terms of the reduction in Renewables obligation values. So that will help with that position.</p>
          <p>What we are also doing is we are working very, very closely with the government. We are heading up their task force to look at reductions in costs and efficiencies and offshore in terms of logistics and turbine manufacturing and foundation manufacturing. So we are right at the heart of the process with the government to drive down the cost efficiencies, which will also mean that a reduction in <mark type="ph" /> work (1:09:11) support will not impact our business case going forward.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as regards <mark type="ph" /> EDP (1:09:20), we will see how the privatization finishes. Well, there's the sale <mark type="ph" /> of the factor (1:09:22), which is 20%-something, and then we'll see what this whole issue boils down to. We have not holding any talks with them. We will see how the process finishes and then we'll see what happens.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question from the room. Okay, well, there are no more questions from the room. Let's move on to the telephone. I think the first one comes from Jose Javier Ruiz from BNP Paribas. Yes, Jose Javier Ruiz, please go ahead with your question.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everybody. I would like to ask you a couple of questions only. The first question would be that we have noticed that you've increased exposure in the United States as regards wind farms, because you've commissioned plants where you didn't close PPAs. But could you please explain, is this circumstantial or is this a new strategy? And secondly, in the U.K., if you are going to continue with the Scottish and Southern initiative of setting and sending into the market all production, all the output and what sort of advantages would that be &#x2013; would that pose?</p>
          <p>And then coming back again to Spain, could you please make a very quick comment on the new initiative of the socialist government as regards the regulation of Renewables? Do you think that this is going to happen? And rumor has it in the press that you were more or less in agreement with this regulation.</p>
          <p>And finally, could you please quantify the reduction in costs as a consequence of simplifying the organizational structure? So, do you have any initial figures that you could deliver here? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Javier (1:11:13), could you please say something about the United States and the new wind farms that are being built there? Speak into the microphone, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well what we are doing, we're building wind farms where we have PPA agreements, so that they can be commissioned. But what we have commissioned this year, however, in 2011, our wind farms date back to 2010 and where we still have to close some PPAs in certain specific areas. But we are more or less sticking to the values of <mark type="ph" /> 20-80 (1:11:53) and right now we have a position with the PPAs and with the hedgings which is in excess of 85%, just above 85%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Paco (1:12:06), could you please say something about the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. As regards the question on the market, well, we have a very extensive experience as regards operating in different markets. In Spain, all the production is sold to the pool, to the daily spot market and all demand is bought by the commercializers, whereas in the U.K., that is not so. That is not the case. There are lots of bilateral agreements. And the results don't change that very much, because the markets converge towards the marginal costs of production and this is what is marked by prices.</p>
          <p>But in the case of the U.K. and sometimes, we are carrying half the output that is they are taking into the market and it goes through the spot system. So although we've not made any announcements in terms of commitment or volumes, in practice, we are carrying up to 50%.</p>
          <p>And I think that this is more &#x2013; has to do with the substance more than anything else. Because this doesn't really change just because you have organized or non-organized spot markets. And I think that the announcement made by the company that was mentioned before is not going to significantly change the outcomes in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, in other words, the &#x2013; we know the system well. We've been providing in Spain for some time. And it doesn't vary very much relative to any other systems. And as <mark type="ph" /> Paco (1:13:12) pointed out, the convergence of market means that they always converge, no matter what path they travel down.</p>
          <p>But as regards the new modality of Renewables, I think that this has not been used properly by the media. They haven't explained Iberdrola's position correctly, because what Iberdrola wants and this is something that I've pointed out before, it wants us to plan and execute according to what has already been planned and not to plan things and then to stray away 10 times from the plan, because that could produce what happened in the solar sector, that is very difficult to digest.</p>
          <p>But if we plan a given number of megawatts of any kind, of wind power or solar power, whatever, perfect. We are going to use a maximum amount of money to pay for those megawatts. But if due to whatever circumstances, somebody wants to pay much more, great. That total amount will be divided by the number of megawatts that have been installed.</p>
          <p>And I am not inventing anything new here. That's the system that in other economy sectors is being used, like in the agricultural sector, the common agricultural policy works that way. It depends on production. And the maximum amount is x and if output is greater than that, you receive less money. So this is what we agree with, but we do not agree with the prices that they are referring to in the case of the premiums.</p>
          <p>So anything that can be planned and measured and fully defined, we agree with it, because otherwise, we will stray away from our current situation. And the system, at least, well, it should give freedom to people, but it should have some expectations that are reasonable. But it doesn't seem to be reasonable with the prices that have been announced or have been mentioned and correct me, please, Javier, if I'm mistaken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I think that you were crystal clear, because as the view we have in terms of wind power business is that right now, the support system is an absolutely sustainable system in the long run. And we also believe that it should be system that will allow us to transfer the savings that are obtained and they should be applied to the production of this power and should, therefore, be applied to the market and to the consumers.</p>
          <p>And finally it has been much more linked to market criteria. And I think that &#x2013; and this is covered by the current system, although we have the issue here of what should be a reasonable return, which means that some of the parameters that are being presented in the proposal will have to be adjusted in terms of hours and in terms of prices too. Jos&#xE9; Luis, would you like to say something about the structural costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, last year, we changed the management model of the company and we focused more on the businesses and we started off by centralizing and by integrating the corporate functions. And we defined a reduction, an objective which would reduce costs, totaling about &#x20AC;100 million. And that was the objective. And I think that we managed to achieved &#x20AC;120 million and most of them are recurrent relative to the future. But right now, the three main businesses of the group are analyzing the project, the integration project and integrating the structures in all countries. And I think that the cost reduction objectives, I think that they will be analyzed during the Investors Day, when we present the strategic plan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. Good morning. Thank you for answering my questions. I had two questions; the first about the possible regulatory measure that may be taken in Spain. Has there been any kind of discussion with the government or the opposition in relation to what the new government might do after the elections? And are there any timing expectations for these measures the first quarter, second quarter of next year?</p>
          <p>And regarding the United States, I would like to know whether the operating cost reduction we saw in previous quarters now affected by Irene, another extraordinary event, have these efficiency improvements ended or can further improvements be expected in the future? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well regarding the first question, you know that we are practically starting the election campaign, so it's not a time for negotiations. It's a time for the political groups to make their proposals. And after the results of the elections, it will be time to sit down with whoever has won and discuss things and negotiate with them, as we've always done in the past. We are, where we are as a result of that position that this firm has always had of trying to come to understandings and agreements with the governments elected by the citizens. Regarding the United States, Jos&#xE9; Luis, would you like to answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I mentioned it earlier. In the United States the regulated business in the United States is integrated in the group's regulated business and is participating in the integration process. The organizations from the three countries or four countries, in fact, Spain, United Kingdom and U.S. and Latin America. And as I said, the cost results or the costs improvement results we obtain will be seen in the next few months. But in any case, the efficiency improvement objectives never end. They're ongoing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the next question comes from HSBC, Jos&#xE9; Antonio L&#xF3;pez-Borges. Go ahead with your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I had two questions regarding the deficit, the dividend and finally, the U.K. In the presentation you mention that the deficit for 2011 was going to be in line with the government estimate. The royal decree of December 23, 2010 set a level of &#x20AC;3 billion. However, in the latest report, the estimate it was going to be &#x20AC;4.3 billion. So could you clarify what the current estimate is, please?</p>
          <p>The second question, since the credit rating prospects have improved, things have stabilized. Could you tell us when you would consider giving up the scrip dividend as a maybe capital increase?</p>
          <p>And finally regarding the U.K., the current low growth context in the U.K. and obviously, it's not surprising to see the amount of populism in relation to energy prices. And part of the competition is asking for an enquiry to be opened, since it seems that some of the competition have more confidence in technocratic institutions than in the Ofgem regulator, which seems to be more subject to political pressure. In that context, don't &#x2013; do you think that there is not so much chance of increasing the margin in the liberalized side of the business?</p>
          <p>And I don't agree that all of the suppliers have the same situation. <mark type="ph" /> Simplica (1:21:28) has more access to nuclear power and you don't. And there is going to be a difference depending on the &#x2013; or there is going to be a windfall for the nuclear power plants. And I think that you're going to be in the situation of structural disadvantage in the U.K. because of that. What is your opinion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jos&#xE9; Luis, would you like to answer the question on the deficit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the process to calculate the settlements each month is more based on Treasury situations that on actual collection situations. Our estimate is that the deficit at the end of the year will probably be slightly higher than the &#x20AC;3 billion objective. It will be around &#x20AC;3.1 billion, &#x20AC;3.2 billion, but not more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding the scrip dividend, well, I first have to say that as everybody knows, there are significant tax advantages. There is no tax &#x2013; no withholding tax and this means that the shareholders show significant demand. And if the shareholders want it and it's good for the shareholders, we'll continue to do it.</p>
          <p>We haven't made the decision or even thought about it. But if the tax conditions continue to be what they are, we may reconsider it in the future. But we haven't done it yet. We may reconsider a possible purchase operation. But we are not certainly planning to do anything, as long as it continues to be attractive to the shareholder and the tax system continues to be what it is.</p>
          <p>The U.K., well, in the U.K., apart from any noise, the situation on the market is not attractive in the short-term, but it is attractive in the long-term. It's a market that needs to radically change its generation facilities. An investment of &#xA3;200 billion in the coming years, as I said, the government is very sensible and very much aware of the situation and so is the regulator.</p>
          <p>And the one thing is what the sensationalist media say and something else is the reality of the country. It's true that the profitability for all agents is not particularly attractive. So, it's even less attractive to sell it.</p>
          <p>If you're going to sell a business that has a future, but which in the short-term, has some minor misadjustments, the price that will be paid for that business will not be very attractive. But if you stay in, you'll have clear prospects in the future. At Iberdrola, we have certainly never considered getting out of that business in the U.K. We will make the necessary adjustments. We are making major investments in all the computer systems, so that our customer management and our customer costs will be more suitable. We're putting major stakes on renewable energy, as Keith Anderson said earlier. And with the measures taken, it's is going to be even more stable and more predicable than what we have now.</p>
          <p>We have a team of people working on the joint project with Suez and Gaz de France to eventually make a decision in the future of building a nuclear power plant. We have a location for that concept. We have permits set to build some combined cycle plants, if the market requires. And I'm sure that the rationality of the market will again be imposed in the future.</p>
          <p>The Spanish energy model, as I said, isn't sustainable to continue to increase their deficits as we bring in inefficient technologies, from the economic point of view and it's not sustainable for all agents in the U.K to be in a complicated situation as a consequence of an isolated and temporary situation. So we are going to continue to put our stakes in the U.K. Our investments in the U.K. have more than doubled what ScottishPower was doing in recent years. And we're going to continue along that line.</p>
          <p>There are sometimes specific isolated situations where measures have to be taken and we are taking measures in the retail area fundamentally. And external issues, that are what we are doing in our discussions with the government and the regulators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are no more questions by phone. There is one via the Web that asks about the future of the <mark type="ph" /> CSF (1:26:46) technology after the decision we made in Longannet and this decision, how does it affect the future of the Longannet plant itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Iberdrola in that commitment with the U.K has been participating together with the British government and with National Grid and Shell to look into the viability. There was a feasibility study, by using an existing coal plant to carry out carbon sequestration, using the empty wells in the North Sea the Shell has and the pipeline infrastructure that National Grid has. And this viability study has taken three years, and the conclusions drawn are several. The conclusions from the study and we've dedicated resources and money to this. All the companies have &#x2013; we've had public aid, but it's cost several million pounds, I have to say this.</p>
          <p>So therefore, we have clearly backed the project. The British government has come to the conclusion that this viability study was very costly, and therefore, didn't want to continue with this project as it was put forward initially, because the investments were greater than their initial plans, that's what the feasibility study was carried out for. And the production costs with the coal and carbon sequestration technology amounted to very high energy costs.</p>
          <p>This study is not a study that is going to be thrown into the bin. This study is going to be the base to be reutilized for other kinds of technologies, such as the combined cycle gas technologies. And with the knowledge we've developed over this period of time, it will possible to continue along that lines, if the government consider it suitable.</p>
          <p>And this is something we're doing in the various countries at the request of the government, and that's what feasibility studies. But the government has come to the conclusion that it was very costly and economically inefficient. Well, I think that I've said the several times today. This is something we should have done in other countries with some technologies that we started to work with, and after installing millions of megawatts, we realized that they are economically inefficient.</p>
          <p>In our country, in Spain, we should have done something similar, a feasibility study on the technical, economical and environmental feasibility of some technologies that are now a burden on our backs and amount to several billion euros. The British government, with good judgment, made a feasibility study before jumping into a massive industrial project that would make British energy more costly and possibly not more efficient from the environmental point of view.</p>
          <p>So this is the results. And I think it shows once again, the degree of openness and collaboration of Iberdrola in those countries its present in, to develop things that can benefit all citizens and in the end the government's made the decisions. So we are pleased to have contributed with this feasibility study, and are open, if there are new projects, to be able to contribute our funding and our know-how.</p>
