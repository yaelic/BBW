          <p>Okay. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call. Our belief, the global economy remains favorable for Brazil that's why build the national liquidity total of which we have high <mark type="indiscernible" />[3:30].</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me ladies and gentlemen please hold while we wait for the workshop conductor. Thank you.</p>
          <p>[068WKM-E Domingos de Abreu]</p>
          <p>I don't know where we stopped sorry for the inconvenience. Let's continue. Let me start again. Please just at the beginning.  Okay, good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call. In spite the risks the global economic scenario remains favorable for Brazil backed by ample international liquidity, low aversion to risk and high commodity prices. In this context the economic scenario will continue to be favorable for financial and insurance activity. The expansion of spread including real estate lending is based on solid fundamentals such as the improved stock market, earning trends, and social mobility. Consequently, Bradesco is very optimistic and constituted <mark type="indiscernible" />[4:23] Brazil's future. Looking ahead 2011 tends to be a year of more moderate growth. The long-term outlook however remains highly promising. Bradesco's objective is always to do more and to do it better. In other words, Bradesco's objective is to continue to, on the same path which has proven to be successful, while improving at each opportunity. We will therefore maintain our presence throughout the entire country, while focusing on enhancing process and the quality of our customer service. We will now discuss in greater details our numbers, results and indicators for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 2 and 3 show Bradesco's main highlights. I'd particularly like to draw your attention to our adjusted net income which as you can see on slide 2, total R$2.738 billion, 27.5% higher than the same period last year. I would also like to highlight our total assets, which increased by 27% for the last 12 months, reaching R$675 billion in the first quarter 2011. Slide 3 shows our funds under management, that total R$919 billion resulting an evolution of 24.2% for March 2010 and our delinquency ratio, which we register as to a special decline in the yearly comparisons.  We'll discuss the other items in the next results.</p>
          <p>Slide 4, on this slide we present the reconciliation between group net income and adjusted net income summarizing all the events that in our judgment are non-recurring, and which affect our results in the respective periods. This quarter our results were negatively impacted by the constitution of provisions for civil contingencies for economic plan in the gross amount of R$54 million. After these adjustments, our book net income of R$2.7 billion grows to an adjusted net income of R$2.738 billion, generating annualized return of 24.2% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 shows our historical figures of our quarterly net income. The increase in the first quarter was chiefly due to the increase in the net income and the reduction in personnel and administrative expenses, partially offset by the reduction in net income reflecting fourth quarter seasonality and the high provisions for loan losses due especially to the greater volume of loans operation, given that delinquencies as we shall see later on remained stable. The 28% .improvement in our net income over the last 12 months mainly resulted from one, the upturn in net interest income due to the higher volume of operations; two, increased revenue from our insurance group, and three, higher fee income led by revenue from credit cards and checking accounts, all of which we will discuss in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Slide six shows our efficiency ratios. The blue line shows efficiency ratio adjusted to risk, which fell for the fifth consecutive quarter to 52.1%, a 0.3 percentage points improvement over the last quarter of 2010 and 3.3 percentage points in comparison to the first quarter 2010, reflecting an improvement in delinquency and the consequent reduction in provision for loan losses.</p>
          <p>The 12 month efficiency ratio, the red line remains flat over the last quarter 2010. When analyzing the quarterly ratio, we can see that the improvement in the relation to the previous quarter was due to -- one, the reduction in personnel expenses as a result of lower expenses with profit-sharing; two, the decline in administrative expenses, and then three, the increase in the net interest income resulting from a higher business volume.</p>
          <p>Despite our recent organic growth, we believe the 12 month efficiency ratio will remain close to its current level in the short-term. In the mid-term however, we expect this to improve, thanks to the conclusion and maturation of projects related towards that growth, improvement of client segmentation and IT.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 as already mentioned total assets reached R$675 million recording an evolution of 27% when compared with March 2010. Return on average assets remained at 1.7% while adjusted return on average equity as mentioned before totaled 24.2%. The Basel ratio posted BIS at 15%, a level we consider comfortable to sustain the expected growth in our operations. Improvement this quarter was mainly due to a capital increase for R$1.5 billion last February. In the yearly comparison a decrease in this ratio just to remind you, is explained because in the first quarter of 2010 we allowed the addition of provision for loan losses to the calculation of BIS ratio.</p>
          <p>Slide number 8, this slide shows relative share of our main operations in net income. The quarterly comparison financials account for 72% of the net income.  Securities did particularly well raising their share from 7% in the first quarter to 10%, thanks to higher quarterly gains.</p>
          <p>Slide 9 realized gains remained high, totaling R$9.6 billion in the first quarter. The quarterly valuation was due to the reduced price of loan operations reflecting increase in interest rates and two; relative devaluation of marked to market securities, essentially fixed income securities, partially offset by the appreciation of some of our investments especially in Cielo and Odontoprev. Please note that these figures do not include a potential goodwill from our own properties in the total amount of R$2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 10. On this slide you can see that our net asset income increased by 3.8% again due to the high volume of operations. Growth of the non-interest earnings portion was increasing from insurance and securities operations. In the comparison I would particularly like to draw your attention to the interest earning portion, which increased substantially by 19.5% compared to the first quarter of 2010 mainly due to the high volume of operations originating from the <mark type="indiscernible" />[13:11] segments as we shall see later on.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, annualized net interest margin, which amounted to 7.8% in the first quarter of 2011. Thus remaining at the same level as both the previous quarter and December of last year.  In the short term we expect this indicator to stabilize or even present a small increase. However, we expect that the indicator to decline in the medium term due to the inclusion of lower margin operations, which should be offset by the increase in business volume. Therefore net income should continue to widen.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, this slide presents the breakdown of net interest income. The quarterly highlights were income from funding and insurance operations, resulting from both the high volume of business and the increase in the average price.</p>
          <p>The annual comparison, the highlight was the funding line, which grew by 70%, chiefly due to the increase in the average volume of funding, as well as increase in interest rates.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, this quarter net interest income from loans remain visually stable in comparison to the previous quarter. The red area shows the provisions for loan losses which represent 38% of the gross margins, increasing by 2.8% primarily due to the growth in loan operations. In the annual comparison 11 % of the evolution in net interest income was strictly due to the increase in business volume, given that the average balance of the loan portfolio grew by 23% in the period.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, that shows our expanded loan portfolio, which reached more than R$300 billion in March 2011, thus reporting a 3.7% increase in the quarter and a 22.6% increase in the yearly comparison. This growth was mainly driven by loans to micro businesses and guarantees, which increased by 4.4% at the quarter and 29.4% in the last 12 months, as well as loans to large corporations, which grew by 5% in the quarter and 22% in the year. The corporate portfolio highlights were <mark type="indiscernible" />[16:08] and credit cards as well as operations with guarantees and other securities.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, as expected the delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days remained stable at 3.6% following five consecutive quarterly declines. Our expectation is for delinquency to remain at the current levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, this slide shows that we continue to maintain high provision levels, with a substantial surplus of R$3 billion in relation to the amount required by the central bank or of R$8.1 billion in relation to expect gross losses for the next 12 months, as noted on the blue line or even R$10.5 billion in relation to expected losses net of recovers below the purple line, also for the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>These provisioning levels leave us in a highly comfortable situation should there be any reversal in the current stable economic scenario. We do not expect that to happen, however, it is important to maintain this provision.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, underlining what I mentioned in the previous slide, here you can see the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses, which has to be maintained at comfortable levels. The slight reduction in this quarter was already expected due to the nominal increase in nonperforming loans, which tends to follow the growth in the loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, first quarter fee income reported a slight decline in the relation to the previous quarter, primarily due to the seasonal increase in business in the fourth quarter, and to reduced business in investment banking. In the annual comparison, however income increased by 12.4%, the best performers were: income from consortium, with 24.7% increase, credit cards with 18.8%, checking accounts with 19.7% and the loan operations with 16.7%, chiefly due to the expansion of the client base. In turn, really by organic growth, as well as the greater number of service provide to our clients.</p>
          <p>Slide 19, operating expense trailed by 3.7% when compared to the last quarter 2010. The reduction in personnel expenses was mainly due to the loan restructuring portion, which was impacted by the reduction in the profit sharing. In the annual comparison, the increase in these expenses was primarily a result of the 2010 collective bargaining agreement and net addition of 18,700 employees, really because of administrative expense detailed in the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, on this slide we have segregated the impact of our organic growth to provide a better idea of the behavior of our operating expenses. We opened 23 new branches in the first quarter, and strengthened our retail services structure by hiring around 1,500 new employees.</p>
          <p>As you can see if these impacts were excluded our operating expenses would have presented a larger decline in the quarter and the evolution of 15.2% if compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, administrative expense fell by 3.6% in the first quarter, chiefly due to the reduction in expenses with advertising in data processing, compared to the same period of 2010, the growth in the administrative expense is flat, in our understanding, compatible with the expansion of the distribution network and increase in business volumes.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, this slide shows the revenue from the insurance segment, which fell by 13% in comparison to the fourth quarter, basically due to the life and pension plans whose contributions are seasonally concentrated in the final quarter of the year. The annual comparison, there was increase of 9.1% led by health insurance and savings bonds. Net income totals R$761 million impacted by one, the reduction in the revenue; two, the increase in the claims ratio; and three; the increase in expenses from the collective bargaining agreements for insurance and insurance related professionals, that took place in January. Improvement of 8.3% over the last 12 months was mainly due to higher revenue and gains from the financial results.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, this slide shows some of the main themes from our insurance activity. The combined ratio reported 86.1% in the first quarter, thus presenting an increase of 1 percentage point when compared to the previous quarter, mainly due to the increase in claims in the health segment, and decrease in revenue due again to fourth quarter seasonality. Our total financial assets amounted to around R$100 billion, while technical provisions reached R$90 billion of which R$78.5 billion are related to the life and pension fund.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, shows our economic department GDP, interest rate, inflation, exchange rate estimates for 2011, 2012, while considering the current scenario of inflationary pressures, following a period of strong GDP and gradual expansion. Despite the lower economic growth expected this year, we would like to highlight the excellent prospects for the recovery of these indicators in 2012. I'd like to add that our economic team just revised the expectation for Selic in 2011. Now we predict 12.5% or another true increase of 0.25%.</p>
          <p>Slide 25, as we've already disclosed our projects for 2011, will be maintained with the exception of fee income to which we are increasing our guidance from 6% to 10% to 9% to 13%.</p>
          <p>To conclude we would like to say that our first quarter results in our understanding were highly satisfactory. We were particularly pleased with our delinquency ratio, which remained unchanged despite the growth in the loan portfolio and the reduction in liquidity in comparison to the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our operations have recorded consistent growth, thanks to a solid customer base and distribution network, expansion of which has been the focus of our strategy supported by constant investment in IT and infrastructure thus ensuring improvements in operating efficiency.</p>
          <p>This quarter alone we expanded our network by more than 2,300 new service points among which I would like to highlight 23 new branches and 1,545 new Bradesco Express. Certainly, the maintenance of economic activity although at a slower pace, has allowed everyone to carry out their activities and meet their targets in a sustainable manner. It's within this context that Bradesco maintained its long-term vision, supported by social mobility and institutional progresses, thereby providing our product sectors with a more solid platform for continuous expansion, thus generating more jobs and wealth for the country. Thank you very much for your attention so far, and we are now available to answer any question you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Jason Mollin with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone. Abreu, you just mentioned that Bradesco's economic team has raised their forecast for interest rates for this year slightly by 25 basis points, and I believe given the <mark type="ph" /> Copan [26:43] minutes that were published recently highlights that we won't see -- we won't see the inflation meeting its target, not even in 2012, I mean do you think, or does Bradesco think that there is upside risk to that forecast, this base case 12.5%, and really how should we think about higher rates impacting the guidance that you have given us. The one change we saw was as you mentioned was in fee income, but how would it impact the other guidance that you give? And perhaps you could also talk to us a little bit about why you are raising your fee income guidance at this point in time, what's driving that new expectation? Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When do you see this change for 0.25, I would say that should be have a big impact in a different light and it just, let's say refine the projections, let's say, I don't think the impact should be, was- would have a significant impact on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Abreu do you see, do you see that there could be, I mean is a bias for higher rates or more increase in expectation of rates? In fact we have seen some economists raise, including Goldman Sachs, raise their interest rate forecast on the back of the <mark type="ph" /> Copan [28:12] , that's what we've done. So I'm not sure if this is a trend or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think we were more optimistic about the increase in interest rates than the market level I guess. Because the market was and has in mind is 12.5. I don't think it's necessary to, okay &#x2013; to see what's going to happen, but in my understanding we were, I think behind the market in this expectation I guess, right? In terms of the guidance for these just see, we have just picked something that is we-I think we made some-we have some, let me give the guidance at the beginning of this year when we consolidate the numbers for our many activities that we have, we made some mistake in the numbers that we, to be honest. So we are just fixed it, in a sense, let's say. Right? To be honest with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So really it's just reflecting. What line items will be the fastest growing in fees?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general in the credit cards, in the credit lines, in the asset management. They are all lined up, we have not so we don't have -- the projection is more uncertainly, normally the, the lines related to investment bank. So it's more, depends more on the market, of the market but the rest I think you can observe sustainable growth in all the lines that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just from the monetary policy perspective, as a follow-up on the prior question, and we have been talking about macro-prudential measures, since they were introduced in December. How is Bradesco thinking about further measures and are you anticipating that we see some and does this guidance anticipate other macro-prudential measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we really understand the economic environment in Brazil, the market has been, let</p>
          <p>'s say the impact for by the current level off inflation. All right? So that's why the market is demanding more pressure in terms of central bank in order to increase more interest rate or to claims that &#x2013; to claim for new, to expect more macro-prudential. I think we have an expectation of a reduction in the inflation, the current inflation the next quarter, this quarter to be honest in order that you see that we now understand that it won't be necessary to have new macro-prudential measures, with this an average of 12.5% interest rate, we don't think it's necessary to have more additional macro-prudential measures, but of course we don't discard that if you can have.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning Domingos, quick question on slide eight, where you show the contribution of the different business lines to net income, insurance has traditionally contributed about a third of your bottom line, and indeed that was the exact number a year ago in the first quarter of 2010, 33%. For the last two quarters however, you have fallen below 30%, it's been 28%, 29%. Is that the new structural level?  Could you explain what has produced that decline and or do you think that over time you will come back to represent about third? I think a lot of people would have agreed and you have made a point in the past that insurance has very good profit, and if anything probably even better gross profit than banking, so I'm little surprised that the contribution seems to have settled below what has been traditional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Daniel it's important to emphasize that &#x2013; the financial, it's important to see that the financial sector has lost relative participation in this time, during the price period, we suffer more in the sector of, in the credit sector mainly, due to the decrease in delinquency in those times, so that's why the insurance gained more representative, for example the first quarter 2010 was 33%. So it's natural to expect once we have the recovery in the debt portion, the other lines should lose their participation. I think they should loss their relative participation, but the result of this has been successful that has been good results. There is no &#x2013; I have to say that we understand that something around 28% to 30%, it should be &#x2013; sometimes you have the bank part of the banking the financial portion being better sometimes you will have insurance being a little bit better, but I think something around 28% to 30% should be what we have in mind. 33% I think was too much, it was more, because the reduction &#x2013; the results in the credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>I do have very good expectation from the insurance business, it's important to emphasize, when we have a move like this, we have increased interest rates like that. You gain more in security, you gain more in funding for example, of course, it will,  you just change the rate of your lines of gain, but insurance continued to be very important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Domingo, and quickly on your outlook for the NPL ratio, I think that you mentioned that you were very pleased with what you saw in the first quarter and that you expect your delinquency rates to stay pretty much at current level. If I look at the performance of Brazilian banks here in recent time, it seems that the market is more nervous and expects that as interest rates go up and the economy goes down, we could see some increase in the NPL ratio and in some cases even more pronounced. How confident are you with that outlook or flattish NPL ratio in the context of an increase in interest rate scenario and slowing down economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we have in mind a scenario where Brazil will grow at 3.8%. It's a big reduction when you compare it with the growth in 2010, but it's still a very good growth. So in this scenario let's have in mind we the unemployment rate, we continue to be in a good path. So that's why we are comfortable to give this guidance that to have, should be our NPL ratio is stable, let's say.</p>
          <p>Of course, in the beginning of the year we have the short-term delinquency, normally it increases. We have observed this in our numbers, but we understand that this is a seasonal movement, normally it reform. We had the same move in 2010 and we have seen the same movement now, but I don't think it should transfer to the high and [modernized delinquency [36:54] for example going forward. We are not seeing any signs of this reaction, that we can have a duration there to be honest.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone, good morning.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick question on your net interest margin. Your -- I'm trying to understand your guidance, you're guiding for 18% to 22% growth in net interest income, which is ahead of long growth guidance of 15% to 19%, so you're assuming expansion in net interest margin. We didn't see that in the first quarter and I guess the expectation was that we were going to see that especially given the big increase in spreads, in lending spreads due to the macro-prudential measures, but yet your income from loans grew less than 1% whereas you loans grew actually close to 4%, consumer loans close to 2%, so it seems that we're not seeing that trickle down the margins. Can you walk us through the expectation for the rest of the year, how do you get to those numbers? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's see, to have the slides <mark type="inaudible" />[38:39]- In slide 12.  Okay. In fact loans you cannot see this growth, I believe you, but when you look funding side, you see it slows to 10%, but the total growth was 3.5%, right? We consider, not consider. We think that we've the some factors in the first quarter, for example in terms of, when you consider [inaudible][39:14], business days, when you compare the business days the appropriation have some different, difference here due to, and we understand that we can see in this lower portfolio that recovers and the growth in the spreads that you see going forward because we are growing spreads. So you at the same time are given lower spread in the portfolio, so you can see that.</p>
          <p>Or in terms of funding, loans once we have growth have grown in the Selic rate you have growth in this portion, right? So that's why even security, you see that when they are growing, the liquid rate will have this portion growing too, so that's why, the guidance that we give in net interest income is from 18 to 20 -- 18, sorry, 18 to 22. I would say we are comfortable with that, Jorge. We are not seeing any signs that we cannot meet this guidance going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And is it possible that the reason your loans- interest from loans grew less than 1% even though the portfolio grew more, because of the deterioration in the mix, whereas customer loans are growing much slower and they have much higher margins? And if that just continues to be the case for the rest of the year, and I get that we've already seen probably most of the increases on Selic, and I still don't know how you get to those numbers, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You have a part of that business expense for the point that you mentioned, but it's important to emphasize with these numbers, when you give these numbers. We consider lower and we have a kind of a mix about loan funding because we consider the cost of funding to calculate it as marginally lower. We consider the cost of the funding, not the fixed rate that you gave me, for example. So sometimes you will see when we have this movement of Selic going up you can see &#x2013; maybe you cannot see as much growth in loans, but you can see in funding. So when you have the opposite situation, you have a reduction maybe you can see the improvement in loans and the reduction in funding, right, just it's a kind of &#x2013; that's the way that we calculate this <mark type="indiscernible" />[42:08] it's important to see both together, it should be better.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me just ask one last question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Apart the explanation is of course we're going more in, for example, large corporates where the spread is lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So let me ask a different question. On the taxes you still have the same 32% effective tax rate in the first quarter as it was the case in 2010. At what point are we going to see the increase that you guided during the last fourth quarter conference call, does it start in the second quarter, how is it going to play out through the rest of the year, and what magnitude of increase should we expect to see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will start the next quarter, it will increase the next quarter. You can consider something close to 4% to 5% to add to the current level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Abreu.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask you two questions, first one on your loan growth guidance right, you maintained your guidance of 15% to 19% and this guidance was given before the most recent introduction of macro-prudential measures. So does it mean then that you expect the impact to be fairly small on your loan growth?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to your expenses, they are running at 17% above the year ago level, I know it's just one quarter, we shouldn't make it too big of deal but you have maintained your expense growth guidance at 11% to 15%, so if you can just give us an explanation why you expect your expense growth to start slowing down. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mario. I think the reason &#x2013; when we gave the guidance, we already have noted that the biggest macro-prudential changes remember it was in the beginning of December right. The following measure wasn't so big in order to give you big impact in our projections, that's why we are keeping the same guidance. Maybe once we have gone from 15% to 19% you can adopt the expectation around it. If you are more in the high level now we are more close to the middle of the guidance.  We can accommodate it in the range, right?  In terms of expense, we have in this quarter in fact two things that impact that is what we want to continue to have, we have implementation of the, we know that we bought the payroll of Pernambuco states last year and for implementation of this process, we expanded a little bit more during this quarter, we don't think we have going forward. In the same time you have a change in some kind of expense that, we have a change in the way that costs used to be in other operating expenses, we changed this for administrative expense.</p>
          <p>So we have this impact. It will continue to have but maybe, but again we can absorb using our guidance, so don't think to be big movement. We, in fact we are running this quarter was, we gave the guidance based on our budget and that the expenses this quarter, consider it, if you don't consider this extra movement that I mentioned right now is below our budget-- that's why we understand that the &#x2013; we are comfortable to be in this level, unless we have a big change in the expectation for example in the new agreement with employees going forward or I don't think it will be necessary to change that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Saul Martinez with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my call. I have two questions as well. I want to drill down and ask again about the asset quality because you mentioned, Domingos, that you're seeing &#x2013; that this is the short-term delinquency, you see seasonality there. But the Central Bank data did show a very meaningful increase in early-stage delinquencies 15 to 90 days, for most individuals from 5.9% to 6.5%, your own loan book had a bit of an uptick in delinquencies below 60 days. And we are also seeing, your new nonperforming loans before charge-offs also did increase sequentially quite a bit. Can you just discuss what why, what exactly you're seeing, you said that you're not seeing any signs that things you are getting worse, but can you just discuss &#x2013; if you can discuss what you're seeing that gives you confidence, gives you so much confidence that NPLs will be flat because it seems like the indicators seem to be pointing in the other direction that we will see an increase in the nonperforming loan ratio this year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I do want to ask about net interest income from lending activity. How long does it usually take for lending spreads to start to translate into better lending &#x2013; into better net interest income growth for lending activity, if I recall in '08, it took two, three quarters for higher spreads to start to lead to higher NIIMs. When do you start to see interest income from or net interest income from lending activity to start to accelerate at a stronger pace? Is it second-quarter or third quarter, if you can just kind of give us some color as to when you think the lending spread starts to really have an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I start with delinquency ratio. It's in the greater percent of delinquency that it has some deterioration even in the more than 90 days for the market. In our case, we don't have that, right? I don't know if it's the kind of mix of our portfolio or not, but we are in fact we are performing better with the market, if you make this comparison.</p>
          <p>When we look at the slide, the additional slide that we have, 38, you see that more between 61 and 90 days or the delinquency ratio continues very stable too, all right? What you don't have here is the delinquency from 15 to 60 days, all right? In our case, we have services that we have growth in this early stage delinquency, but we understand this is a seasonal factor, we have the same movement in 2010 and to give us return for this quarter, the delinquency <mark type="indiscernible" />[50:29] because it's a very problem to have this movement in, at the beginning of this, we have put in this movement for seasonality, right. But we're not seeing, we understand that the unemployment rate in Brazil continues to be in a good movement where we don't see any movement, maybe you have some companies that can suffer more with FX rate or something, that perhaps some movement like that, but assuming that, we're assuming that we'll continue to grow our economy 3.8, it means that the unemployment rate will continue in the level that is at, that there is no reason to imagine that we can translate this into delinquency. That's what we have in mind. In terms of the margins, we understand in the next quarter, we already can see some movement. Once we are, we replace the [indiscernible][51:42] I think the next quarter to see a better movement in the market, global market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for that. You're not seeing any signs in your own portfolio of any stress emerging? Your portfolio, the performance is doing well from a credit quality standpoint? You're not seeing any signs of trouble there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far, we are not. I know that the market has seen some movement, the market, you see the data of the Central Bank here yesterday and if you see our numbers, we are not disappointed.  Maybe you <mark type="indiscernible" />[52:18] market, but I don't know it's a kind of mix of portfolio or the portfolio that's suffered more than the portfolio that we have, but in fact our numbers, we are posting numbers in terms of delinquency better than the Central Bank posted yesterday.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. My questions have been largely answered, but just to stay with what Saul was talking about on the asset quality, I mean, we did see a slight pickup. It was only 10 basis points in SME MPL ratio. Anything there that stands out is that, can you give us any color in terms of may be any sector or any type of export industry that perhaps maybe suffering here from a very strong Real, any sort of color you can give us here in terms of the worsening or is this, again do you believe this to be more of a seasonal thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Victor, I actually put this more for the mix of the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that we are growing more in the very small SMEs than in the larger SMEs I would say. So I actually put this more product change in the mix than the duration, again to refer to SME but we &#x2013; we talked before with the question--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's basically a higher natural rate of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we see the long term perspective, look that all the lines received for individual for example nowadays we are in the lower level that we even had before the crisis period, right. That's a big improvement and see the large <mark type="indiscernible" />[54:32] on the common level, but when you see the SME, you see that we are in 3.5 that is much more than it was in the period of prior the crisis. It is very clear for us that it was a change in the mix portfolio because here when you see segment by segment, we are not seeing this deterioration in the long term. We see to say again we see some movement in the low &#x2013; the short period, between 15 to 60 days again, we can see this movement to increase, but it's the same movement that you have for example at the beginning of 2010 but we understand that if you want to adjust for, is more for seasonality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one quick follow-up on maybe on costs, could you update us Domingos on where you are in your IT investment program, and how you see that, what's the timeline on that in terms of conclusion of that? I know you saw it running into 2012, but is there any change in terms of that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far we don't have any change. We expect to be finishing this year around 80% from both of these, you expect to <mark type="indiscernible" />[55:50] we talked about this the last front of this project, right? Remember this 28 fronts, we are just finishing the most challenging part of that, the newer tech system, we are expect to be around 80% at the end of this year and we expect to finish this by the middle of 2012.</p>

          <p>Okay. The estimate is, this year we are investing R$5 billion, R$4.3 billion is in IT and in telecommunication. Okay? But all of this program is something close to the total program is R$1.8 billion let's say and just as you expect to something close to R$700 million total, but looking just the numbers that you are investing in IT, right we don't have the numbers that we have for example for the department that they need to &#x2013; the department that you need to deal with the new system, you have to have people working in two different system during this period, so of course we are observing this as an expense, we are not posting this as investment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. I have two questions, I want to-- I'd like to go back to your long growth guidance for this year you know the 15% to 19%, can you comment a little bit on the opportunities for you to gain market share and in this market, and which segments you'd see some opportunity, because my impression is that your guidance does impact some market share gains versus the market.</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding your provisioning policy, I mean it seems that there is a trend for some of your peers to start provisioning according to IFRS &#x2013; under &#x2013; in Brazilian GAAP and I think I understand that you still provision based on the 2682 resolution. So is there any, are there any plans from Bradesco signs to start adopting expected loss provision is net up incurred loss provision in Brazilian GAAP, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We saw that we gain very small portion &#x2013; as I said it is quite a bit when I saw and we are gained this in more in SME segments when they taken in the large corporates, let's san and individuals, those I think we keep, the even &#x2013; lots of part of this I don't know exactly which segment it was, maybe in <mark type="indiscernible" />[59:38] probably, we are [ph] twice [59:45] in this market in the more competitive environment, we try to keep the spreads higher. So that's why we are not looking for much in this market to be honest.</p>
          <p>We gaining I think in &#x2013; Peru we are gaining market share. We have a little bit, and for companies we are gaining in different segments from &#x2013; in terms of provision and policy, we continue to use the 2682 we are not planning to in Brazilian GAAP to change that. We have &#x2013; if you look your, we post our numbers in IFRS you see that we &#x2013; for that criteria, we consider part of the additional excess a part of using the expected loss.</p>
          <p>We understand that if you adopt this expected loss at the moment, I guess we probably should have less provision level at the moment, but to be honest we don't have this numbers to tell. But in our case, we continue to use 2682 because we understand that have a discussion of additional provision in next stage also to 2682 is an answer to base the changing in the &#x2013; when you need to change when Central Bank adopt that and we did understand that the best &#x2013; we don't think the Central Bank we expect to use the exact IFRS model. I think they will continue to use to 2692 and change something, but again we need to see. But against the first report we understand that the disclosure of provision that we have, we cannot ask to make these adjustments, we don't think that would be to &#x2013; have an impact when you need to change them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on the question I made on the Portuguese call regarding  <mark type="indiscernible" />[62:24] stake that we saw on yesterday's release that it went down from 7.1% of the OEM shares to 6.5% and apparently the stake was acquired by one of the holding companies of the controlling group and CF participation and just to repeat for the audience that wasn't in the Portuguese call, is there intention I mean to acquire the rest of this stake if [indiscernible][62:57] has intention to sell and as a follow up, is there any relation to this, to the request for approval of a ATR problem for the other share.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is regarding the other operating expenses that went up more than R$300 million compared to the fourth quarter, you mentioned in the release that the major reasons were related to the incurred but not reported and health insurance provisions as well as provision for civil contingencies, could you explain with more detail the nature of these expenses and also do you expect to have this targeted amount of expense again in next quarter? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Regina. In-fact we- when you see this movement, we bought a part of portfolio in that &#x2013; the <mark type="indiscernible" />[63:53] last quarter what I understand that if there is [indiscernible]63:57] if they need to sell this portfolio, our holding company should be I think the natural buyer of this position.</p>
          <p>The second part of this question is that nothing to do, I think the position nothing to do, which is or in other words this, ADR, common share ADR program that we launched has nothing to do with this movement. We didn't even have an idea that they should sell this portfolio all right. So no it's not necessary to &#x2013; there is no -- any correlation between this situation right.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In-terms of other expense, let's say they have &#x2013; we think a technical department inside our insurance company, that's they revised the model that they calculated, the provision semester, let's say. And they are preparing, they understand that they will need to have this to increase this provision, that's why they are, they build this <mark type="indiscernible" />[65:16] of provision, this first quarter, till you analyze in the next quarter, that's when they have the definitive calculation. It is necessary to increase they need to make more or maybe they can even to reverse a part of that, we don't know exactly, but we need to have the calculation going forward.</p>
          <p>They are other expenses of contingencies, it's very difficult for us, these lines of benefit are always the most difficult part to predict. I think this quarter we have two big events that have created this close to a R$100 million more than the normal that we have. Again, it's very difficult for us to give a prediction for this line, but I think, we should, nowadays we are with 1,900 million, the last part was 60 million. I had a word with something in the middle of that with R$750 million. But again, it's important to emphasize that is very difficult to predict this.</p>
