          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Total Third Quarter 2011 Earning Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode and we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Just a reminder this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Patrick de la Chevardi&#xE8;re. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I will be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello and thank you for calling. I am very pleased to begin by saying that operationally, we have had one of the best quarters ever. We had the start-up of Pazflor, the largest FPSO in the world, giant exploration discoveries and very good upstream production performance relative to our peers.</p>
          <p>We reported a clean set of third quarter results that are in line with the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was stable despite the weaker environment. Upstream result decreased mainly due to lower hydrocarbon prices and higher upstream tax rates. The Downstream posted a strong increase despite the decrease in European refining margins. Not included in these numbers is $1.5 billion of gains on asset sales and $7 billion in cash flow that we collected in the third quarter. It is important to point out that our strategy to unlock value by redeploying capital from major assets to gross assets is working very well.</p>
          <p>For the environment, the Brent price has remained well above $100 per barrel. European refining margins have been volatile but on average, weak for the quarter due to high oil prices on one side and weak product demand on the other. Chemicals have also been affected by softer demand during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Over the past few months, we have been very active. We started at the Pazflor field in Angola ahead of schedule and on budget. In the third quarter, we reported a giant discovery in Azerbaijan, another giant discovery in French Guiana and a promising discovery in Norway. So this has already been an outstanding year for exploration. In addition, we are currently drilling another high potential well in Brunei as well as <mark type="ph" /> frontier (03:04) wells in Malaysia and Argentina and we should have some result in the coming months.</p>
          <p>In the Downstream and Chemicals, we announced a very broad reorganization project that will lead to creation of two new segments, an industrial one and a commercial one. Upstream production was 2.3 million barrel of oil equivalent per day in line with the previous quarter. The ramp up of Pazflor and Trinidad had a positive but small impact on the third quarter production. Normal seasonal maintenance was slightly lower than in the second quarter. Asset sales, mainly CEPSA and normal declines partly offset these positives.</p>
          <p>Regarding our operation in Libya, we restarted the Al-Jurf platform in late September and the onshore Murzuq field was restarted a few days ago. In 2010 our average production in Libya was 55,000 barrel per day. We expect to restore about 10,000 barrel per day of production on average in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In Yemen, one of our pipeline was blown up in mid-October. Nobody was injured and repairs have been completed. We had scheduled maintenance at Yemen LNG so this event should have a limited impact. The LNG plant has already restarted production. In addition to Yemen LNG, the fourth quarter will include the turnaround on Sn&#xF8;hvit.</p>
          <p>We are very confident about our outlook for 2012 production growth above 3%. In 2012, we will benefit from the ramp up on Pazflor, Trinidad and Islay. Novatek will continue to grow. Libya is being restored and we will have new startups like Usan and Angola LNG.</p>
          <p>All of our major developments are progressing essentially on time and on budget. In addition we expect to sanction Ichthys, Egina, Ofon 2 and Tempa Rossa in the coming months and possibly Shtokman depending mainly on negotiation for the tax treatment. So 2011 and the years to come should be very strong in term of reserve replacements.</p>
          <p>Average net operating income per barrel in the third quarter decreased compared to the second quarter. Two obvious factors that are driving part of the decrease are the lower hydrocarbon price and the higher Upstream tax rates.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, production from Pazflor and Trinidad will be accretive this year to our profit per barrel. The end of seasonal maintenance will be positive and our 2012 startup, mainly Usan in Nigeria will be accretive as well.</p>
          <p>On the Upstream tax rate we have an increase of about 2% in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. Half of this increase is due to a mix effect and the other half is due to the one-off impact of changing the tax consolidation method but this is offsetting the Downstream, Chemicals and holding so the net effect of the change for the group is neutral.</p>
          <p>For the Downstream, marketing was stable. The contribution from refining increased in the third quarter and this was mainly due to very strong supply optimization, lower turnaround and the higher contribution from the new Port Arthur coker.</p>
          <p>For the Chemicals, base chem were relatively stable but we had a lower contribution from the U.S. and Europe that was offset mainly by higher contribution from Qatar and Korea. Specialty Chemicals were down slightly and this reflects mainly the sale of part of the resin business.</p>
          <p>And finally at the corporate level, CapEx, excluding acquisition, was $4.7 billion in the first quarter, in line with our $20 billion budget for 2011. Year-to-date, acquisition of $9.8 billion have been balanced with asset sales of $9.1 billion. At the end of the third quarter, our gearing was down 15% reflecting the benefit of our strong cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>We announced that we will pay the third quarter interim dividend on March 22, 2012. This is stable compared to the second quarter dividend that will be paid on December 22. It is in line with our policy to maintain an average payout ratio of 50% over time.</p>
          <p>One last word on the reorganization project for the Downstream and Chemicals, this is very important for the group. This reorganization will help us to improve the profitability of these segments by 5% over the next four years and this is very significant. But this project has the potential to do more than increase profitability. If you look at the way we have revitalized the exploration program then you see how this reorganization could revitalize and unlock the value in all these businesses, refining, base chem, Specialty Chemicals and marketing. This project is a major positive change for Total.</p>
          <p>That concludes my comments and I am ready to start the Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There will be a short silence while participants register for questions. We have a question from the line of Theepan Jothilingam. Please go ahead, announcing your company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, Patrick. It's Theepan from Nomura. Just a couple of questions please. Just going into 2012 in terms of production, could you just talk about how you think the progress you're making on Angola LNG and Usan? And then what do you think maybe is a sort of reasonable assumption for production from Libya into next year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I mean, it's very noticeable, a strong performance in the Downstream in spite of the deterioration in the margin. I was wondering if you could sort of comment perhaps just on the delta in terms of the benefits from the supply optimization. That would be very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Theepan. So your first question was about the production for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just on Usan and Angola, when you think they may start up in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Usan, it's first quarter next year. Angola LNG is first semester next year. And we think that our production should be above 3% next year. We will benefit mainly from the ramp up of Pazflor and the start-up also of Islay by yearend and Usan and Angola LNG as you mentioned.</p>
          <p>So your second question about Downstream, basically what I like to tell you is that Q2 was very low with high turnaround and poor operational performance. Q3 is high with a lower turnaround with the effect of the Port Arthur coker and a very good supply optimization. If I have to make a guess on what should be an average net operating income coming from the Downstream, this is between those two figures, the second quarter and the third quarter. In average, that should be a good target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from the line of Mark Gilman. Please go ahead, announcing your company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrick, good afternoon. A couple of things, I want to go back to your comment about the tax rate and the tax consolidation. You indicated it would be neutral overall. Is that a total earnings comment or a comment on the tax rate because obviously the earnings contribution pre-tax of the Downstream and Chemicals is significantly below the Upstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My comment was related to the overall tax amount to be paid after we change our methodology of cost reduction for tax. The so-called cost we have on the Upstream is offset by the gain made in Downstream and Chemicals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could just try one more, Patrick, I just don't really understand where all of this profitability benefit from the Downstream reorganization is going to come from. It seems that you've committed at least, to some degree, not to reduce workforce, so where does that 5% come from? Is that an increase in marketing market share? Is it an increase in margin? Is it a reduction in cost? Can you flush this out just a little bit for me, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that we are under the process of consultation with the union currently and that I cannot comment so much on this matter. But I think that, basically, all sites including the headquarter will benefit from the internal merger by bringing competencies and LNG resources under the same umbrella, basically. I think it is also a good opportunity to share best practice and move the business forward. And I am sorry but I can't comment so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I could just go one more, were there any effects associated with the change in the statutory Upstream petroleum tax rate in the UK that impacted the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let me think about what was the amount. The incremental tax we paid due to the new tax rate in the UK, I think, it is in the range of about &#x20AC;60 million per quarter, additional tax to be paid in the UK</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But there was no one-time or prior period booked in the quarter? Was that done in the second quarter, if I recall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was done in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from the line of Alejandro Demichelis. Please go ahead, announcing your company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Patrick, Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Just one question, in terms of the reorganization and the discussions with the different unions, maybe you can give us some kind of timeline in terms of how long the process you think is going to take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, our priority now is dialogue and consensus building. Such a project, this has to be solidly embraced across the company. And subject to the completion on the ongoing process, our objective is to be able to start working into the new merged organization from early 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from line of Martijn Rats. Please go ahead, announcing your company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Martijn Rats from Morgan Stanley, I have two questions. First of all, in the outlook statement, you said that you expect that the net debt by the end of the year will once again be in the sort of 20% to 30% range, which actually suggest an increase, after the sort of 15% that you reported at the end of the last quarter, which actually suggest that after a couple of quarters of very good free cash flow, the free cash flow would actually turn negative into the fourth quarter. And I was wondering whether you could elaborate why free cash flow was suddenly sort of reversed quite a bit as suggested by that guidance.</p>
          <p>And secondly, what I wanted to ask you relates to capital expenditure. There was guidance during your recent Capital Markets Day for $23 billion on average over 2012 to 2014. But that now, that 2012 is coming a little bit closer, I was hoping you'd give us a bit of an idea about how the increase in CapEx will actually sort of play out in terms of the profile. Would you expect it to jump to $23 billion straight away or can we see more of a gradual increase where it starts below $23 billion and then ends that three-year period at the level above $23 billion? Can you give us a bit more idea about the profile of that increase, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Martijn. Your first question about net debt, so at the end of September our gearing was 15%, a 9% decrease compared to the end of June. In third quarter of this year, we paid the first quarterly dividend and completed divestment of CEPSA approximately $5 billion, and the regime also approximately $750 million.</p>
          <p>By end of the year we should also close the acquisition of Uganda about $1.5 billion and the sale of our UK marketing. By the end of the year we expect our gearing to be in the lower part of the 20% to 30%. You may also expect an increase of the working capital in the fourth quarter that's why we target in the lower range of 20% to 30% for our gearing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So your second question was about CapEx expenditure. You know that usually we do not provide details for the next year prior our budget being approved and you will be updated by our road show in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Martijn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from the line of Iain Reid. Please go ahead, announcing your company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patrick. It's Iain Reid here from Jefferies. Can I get back to the tax rate in the Upstream? It was 63.9% in the third quarter. Now I think you said there was one one-off effect there due to this tax consolidation. Does that mean that that tax rate going forward could be lower or should be lower looking at what the mix effects might be in the fourth quarter? And can you give us a kind of general guidance for that for 2012 and onwards?</p>
          <p>Second question is I saw you said on Lindsey that if you haven't sold it by the end of the year, you're going to keep it. Is that the case and maybe just comment on the level of interest you're getting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First question on the tax rate, if you take the average of the nine months you end up with a tax rate of about 61%, which is a good idea for normal tax rate in the current environment. Just to give you another figure, the so-called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:38) effect, one-off effect of the exit on the tax consolidation, if you exclude this on the tax rate of the Upstream, the tax rate from the Upstream will come down about 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So about Lindsey, Lindsey is still on sale and we have extensive and, I would say, long discussion and negotiation currently going on. It takes longer than expected, but I truly recognize that. We could decide to put the site for sale on hold until the market condition improve if we are not successful by year-end. But as of today, I am still optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if you're a betting man, when do you think it's going to be sold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned to you, if it is not sold by year-end, we will keep it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Patrick, it's Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Just a follow-up on Lindsey to be clear, if you say you're going to &#x2013; if you were to maintain the facility, that does not mean you would convert it to a terminal? You would just continue to operate it, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct, Blake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Secondly, I wanted to follow up on the two Brunei wells that you mentioned. As I understand it, one is already spud and we should have results by yearend. Could you give us an update on any specifics on that well, and then secondly, when the second well will or has spud?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, I don't know. What I know is that we spud the first well which is under drilling now and I don't know about the second well. I'm sorry, Blake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's okay. The last one I have for you, Patrick, Pazflor started up a bit early. Any clue when we may see a peak of 220,000 barrels a day next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I can tell you is that Pazflor is currently producing at the rate of 120,000 barrels per day and it's still ramping up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Patrick. Oswald Clint, Sanford Bernstein. First question, just on Novatek, I wonder can you say or give us the contribution this quarter? And also, I guess since they haven't reported this is an estimate at this stage and &#x2013; are we going to be having these kind of true-up effects going from quarter-to-quarter after Novatek does report? And then secondly, on your North American gas, it continues to increase quite strongly. I guess that's the Barnett. Is that still your intention just to keep growing within that asset despite the gas price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Oswald, for your first question, it was about Novatek. In term of production, we are at around 125,000 barrel per day for our share in last quarter, an increase of about 8%. On Novatek results, I can't give you anything as Novatek is a listed company and you should wait for their conference call to be updated. I remind you that we have around $35 million per quarter of amortization of the acquisition premium and this is the only figure I can give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on Novatek basically we expect and we see that this contribution to increase over time as Novatek production growth and domestic gas price in Russia increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the U.S., that's a good question by the way. Are we still going to keep growing in the U.S? Honestly we are coming from very low figures if you have a look on our press release. It's slightly increasing. That's correct. Are we going to continue and increase it? I think gradually, yes, we can do it. But as we are not very optimistic on the gas price in the U.S., it should be limited.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Patrick. Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. I wondered if I could ask about whether the sanctions in Syria are having any impact. And the second question is there's clearly been- yeah, a little bit of a teasing problems in terms of Yemen. You've got the sort of maintenance now planned for the fourth quarter. What are your expectations for volumes from Yemen next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First question about sanction in Syria, you know that, first of all, the contribution of Syria to our net operating income in 2010 was extremely limited. The production was about 40,000 barrels per day, but the contribution in term of net income was extremely limited. Currently, the sanction has an effect that the production is slightly going down and we are prohibited to make any offtake of oil production from Syria. That's the practical effect of the sanction on us. I remind you that the operations are managed by joint operating company in Syria. We are not the operator. This is a joint operating company, which is the operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About Yemen, since we started again our production two days ago, the production is ramping up and we will reach plateau again quite quickly. If I may give you an estimate for our share of Yemen LNG, it should be in the range of 75,000 to 80,000 barrels per day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Jean-Luc Romain, CM-CIC Securities. You mentioned you expect your production from Libya to be around 10,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. I realize the situation is far from clear there, but do you have an estimate when you could be back near 2010 levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Libya, we started up again the production from Al Jurf. The Murzuq field operated by Repsol already started again a few days ago and it's currently producing about 60,000 barrel per day. And our own estimate is that both production will gradually ramp up and we anticipate that hopefully we could be back at the 50,000 barrels per day second half of 2012.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first question, I can answer yes. To your second question, I can't answer because the Russian are still negotiating for other partners to enter and I cannot disclose the price we paid.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Okay, Patrick. Can you talk at all about the impact of SunPower on the quarter and where we would find it in the statements?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the same kind of response that I can give on Novatek is the same on SunPower. SunPower is a listed company and they haven't published their results yet. What I can tell you is that the amortization of the premium paid, the acquisition premium is around $35 million per quarter.</p>

          <p>You know that under French law we have to publish our books in euro. This is the same in Italy. It is not the same for a UK company.

So, as of today, I'm sorry, but we will stick to the euro.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, it's Jon Rigby from UBS. Hi, Patrick. Two questions, the first is it looks like your LNG sales year-over-year are basically flat. So, is it quite a good chance to sort of do a comp? Are you able to give me a sort of change of, say, the split of where those LNG sales were directed third quarter to third quarter, so I could get some idea of sort of which hemispheres you were selling it and the sort of structure of your LNG sales? And the second question is you said that you were looking to complete the Uganda transaction in the fourth quarter. You clearly farmed into Kenya during the quarter. I mean is East Africa somewhere that you're looking to deepen your position further or are you content with what you've now got? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. About LNG, we sold, during the third quarter, we sold 3.4 million tonne, mostly in Asia and there are gradually in both Asia and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:58) sales are gradually increasing quarter after quarter. The second direction is Continental Europe for about 21% where Asia was 63%. Then we have I think one cargo in North America last quarter and that's it.</p>
          <p>In Uganda, we hope to be able to complete by yearend, but you know that we are still waiting for the approval from the Parliament in November. But it is correct that we wanted to make East Africa a new pool for us that's why we acquire several blocks in Kenya, the same in Tanzania, and the same in LDC. That's why we are confident to be able to build a new pool 32:56) in East Africa.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Can I just ask one other question actually? There was a deal signed a few days ago involving <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:07) where you have entry rights, I believe, actually for export. With your sort of footprint globally, is that something that you, Total, would be interested in also participating in, i.e., trading U.S. gas into global markets?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Patrick. Bertrand Hod&#xE9;e from Kepler. Can you give us an update on your different progress on final investment decision on your Nigeria project naming Ofon II and Egina? And we also hear some contractors talking about the potential awards of Brass LNG award into 2012. So I was wondering about your thoughts on a possible, I would say, final investment decision on Brass LNG and where do you stand exactly on the project in terms of, I would say, fiscal incentives needed like on the early days on Bonny Island, or is there enough gas to seek the development at such stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very simple answer. On Ofon II, it's pretty soon. In Egina, first half of 2012 basically. You know that on Nigeria LNG, there were some technical issue, which leads to a decrease in the uptake of gas from Nigeria LNG. On Brass LNG, is it for 2012? I don't know honestly. I don't know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you think that Brass LNG can be or you really don't know if this could be part of, I would say, the -because this is obviously a very big project, so/</p>

          <p>Sorry. Lucas Herrmann, Deutsche Bank. Patrick, hi, afternoon. Just going back to the comments you just made on Nigeria, I presume that you've obviously sorted out everything to do with tax life Ofon and Egina at the present time then. You're not going to take a decision ahead of a petroleum bill being announced some tax changes, are you?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon to everybody. Sergio Molisani from UniCredit. Two questions, if I may. The first one on the cash flow generation of the different business area, in particular, Upstream recorded earnings in line with second quarter but the cash flow generation was significantly lower. On the other hand, the cash flow generation at Downstream was very healthy on a quarter-on-quarter basis, even if I suppose that in this case most of the improvement is attributable to networking capital movement. Can you give us more colors on the factors driving this evolution of the cash flow into the two business area, please? And second quarter, is that the possibly that you have an idea of the contribution of the Port Arthur coker in third quarter 2011? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So your second question first on Port Arthur, Port Arthur contribution is about &#x20AC;45 million per quarter. About your question about cash flow generation on Upstream and Downstream, over nine months the net operating income went to &#x20AC;7.6 billion from &#x20AC;6.3 billion the same period in 2012, so an increase of 21%. And the cash flow, the adjusted cash flow increased by 15% basically. So it's roughly equal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because if I look at your tables here so that the cash flow from operations in second quarter in Upstream was &#x20AC;5.6 billion while it was &#x20AC;3.2 billion in the third quarter 2011. So I was wondering whether there is some specific factors justifying these huge fluctuations in the cash flow generation of the division.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
