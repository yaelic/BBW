          <p>Good morning and welcome everyone to FEMSA's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, management may discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning FEMSA's future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company. These forward-looking statements reflect management expectations and are based upon currently available data. Actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties which can materially impact the company's actual performance.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Javier Astaburuaga, FEMSA's Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to FEMSA's fourth quarter and full year 2010 results earnings conference call. As always, Jose Castro from Coca-Cola FEMSA; Juan Fonseca IR, FEMSA join me today.</p>
          <p>As was the case in the second and third quarters, our results reflected different impacts of the Heineken transaction on our income statement and balance sheet. We will, of course, be happy to address questions on the subject during this call at any time, later time through our Investor Relations teams.</p>
          <p>In terms of the operating results, as we have stated previously, we will not comment on the beer operations going forward and will therefore focus on FEMSA Comercio and on Coca-Cola FEMSA, although many of you likely had the opportunity to participate in Coke FEMSA's conference call on Tuesday.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by spending a brief moment on our perception of the environment and the drivers for consumption, particularly in our key Mexico markets. While typically manufacturing activity is measured by the <mark type="inaudible" /> are up mid-single digits year-over-year and then employment numbers continue to improve, we are seeing a certain lag in the amount of <mark type="inaudible" /> on fast moving consumer goods in general.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, extreme weather events and a growing sense of insecurity in certain geographies contributed to make 2010 a complex year for us. And yet, we managed to deliver a solid set of results. That's spectacular but solid. And as we move into 2011, we're optimistic that consumer demand will catch up with the macro data and that we will have an easier comparison base for several of our operations. So we can look forward to an exciting 2011 we're sure.</p>
          <p>And now let's move on to discuss our consolidated quarterly numbers. On a comparable basis that is without the beer operations, total revenues increased 4% and operating income grew 7.5%. For the full year on a comparable basis again, total revenues increased 6% and operating income 7%. Excluding one-time fees and expenses related to the Heineken transaction, operating income would have grown 9%.</p>
          <p>Below operating income, the line for other expenses actually showed other income this quarter, reflecting several non-recurring items that include the income from the sale of our flexible packaging business, as well as the continued restructuring of certain compensation plans.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, the line labeled participation in Heineken results represents FEMSA's implied 20% participation in Heineken's fourth quarter net income. For the full year, the line represents FEMSA's actual 20% participation in Heineken's May to December net income, derived from Heineken's full year numbers reported last week.</p>
          <p>If we keep going down the income statement, you'll see the line labeled gain from transaction with Heineken net of taxes. This represents the difference between the market value of the Heineken shares as of April 30, 2010, representing an equity interest of 20% and the book value of FEMSA's beer operations as of the same date, net of transaction taxes. We show no change in this line during the fourth quarter, however, it is relevant if you're looking at the full year information.</p>
          <p>The next line, net income from FEMSA's former beer operations is also relevant only in the full year information and corresponds to the first four months of the year reported transaction growth. And those are basically the lines that I believe requires special mention to the income statement. Obviously, if you require further clarification on these, Juan and Max will be happy to follow up.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet, as was the case last quarter, for December 2010, you see that the assets of the beer operations are no longer there. For comparison purposes in the 2009 column, the figures of the beer operations were subtracted from each line and are being presented grouped in four specific lines in accordance with accounting standards.</p>
          <p>On the asset side, we're showing lines for current and non current assets of the beer operations. And we are doing the same on the liability side. Those four lines go to zero for 2010. And conversely, the line investing in shares now reflects our position in Heineken.</p>
          <p>In terms of our cash <mark type="inaudible" />, during the fourth quarter, we went from having a consolidated net cash position of Ps. 1.2 billion at the end of September to now Ps. 2.4 million at the end of December. This increase includes the proceeds from the sale of our flexible packaging business as well as cash generated during the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the subject of potential uses of cash and the pursuit of strategic opportunities, we continue to make progress. On several fronts, we're moving from the initial conceptual analysis to a phase of exploration and development, developments of certain initiatives. So we have some projects in the initial stage still and some that are beginning to take shape, always under the light of long-term value creation.</p>
          <p>As you know, these processes take time, but we think we're very much on track on this. We should also highlight that our Board of Directors have approved a proposals to pay ordinary dividends of Ps. 4.6 million from fiscal year 2010. It represents an increase of 77% in pesos over the previous year's dividend and a 184% over the dividend paid only two years ago. The decision is consistent with our approach on balancing the financial flexibility with balance sheet efficiency under these times.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to discuss our operations. I'm beginning with FEMSA Comercio. Well, we should mention that the rollout of new store openings continue to move forward according to plan. We opened an all-time record of 415 net new stores during the fourth quarter, which means we opened 1,092 stores in 2010, ahead of our objective of just under 1,000. These figures include 12 new stores opened in Colombia, taking our total in that new market to 17 stores, as we continue to adjust and develop our value proposition in that market.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we should expect a similar number of net new stores opening and I think close to 1,100 would be the number to take into account.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the quarter for FEMSA Comercio increased 19% and 16% for the full year. Same stores sales were up 8% for the quarter and 5% for the year, reflecting improvements in both traffic and average ticket.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, gross margin contracted 20 basis points. It was basically driven by changing the structure of commercial terms for certain supplier and partners. While the impact of these terms used to be skewed towards the fourth quarter, it is now more evenly spread throughout the year.</p>
          <p>For the full year, the gross margin expanded 70 basis points, driven <mark type="inaudible" /> by the effective collaboration and execution with our key suppliers and partners, combined with an efficient use of promotion related marketing resources, a positive mix effect from the growth of higher margin categories and to a very low extent, the final stages of the consumer shift towards electronic recharges, as we have described in the past.</p>
          <p>In terms of operating margins, this quarter FEMSA Comercio posted an expansion of 10 basis points, mainly due to operating expense growth containment, as well as the fact that IT and business were heavier in the second and third quarters. For the full year, FEMSA Comercio's operating margin expanded 10 basis points to 8.4 of revenues. And we have talked about this in the past about the very tough comparison base we faced in 2010 as a year and also on the fourth quarter, given that 2009 was extraordinary in terms of margin expansion, with 180 basis points of the operating level.</p>
          <p>Along with the significant commercial and operational improvements achieved across FEMSA Comercio, also in 2009, we had some help from the migration to electronic wireless top-ups from important subsidies on electricity tariffs that have now gone away, as well as from our deferral of certain projects and initiatives due to the crisis back in those days.</p>
          <p>So our colleagues at FEMSA Comercio did a terrific job expanding their margins an incremental 10 basis points given such a tough comparison base we think. For the following years, our long-term objective remains to deliver margin expansion of 10 to 20 basis per year. And however, as we have said in the past, we will not reduce the pace of investments required to strengthen our platform and develop the capabilities that we need to keep Comercio growing into a cutting edge retailer.</p>
          <p>In other words, we will always privilege investing in the long-term fundamentals of the business over managing the margins for the short term.</p>
          <p>And finally Coca-Cola FEMSA revenues as you know for the quarter decreased 4% versus the comparable period of 2009, basically impacted by the revaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, which was partially offset by revenue growth in Mexico. Operating income increased 5%, margins expanded 20 basis points at the gross level and 150 basis points at the operating level. This is basically on the back of good operating leverage in Latincentro. If you are unable to participate in Coke FEMSA's conference call last Tuesday, you can access a replay of their webcast for additional details on the results.</p>
          <p>And finally a small brief comment on our migration to IFRS. As you know, we had a regional plan to accelerate the process in order to be about one year ahead of schedule and again reporting under IFRS in 2011. However in second reviews, we have determined that this will post an unnecessary burden on our team and generate unnecessary expenses in the short-term. So it is more efficient we think to stick to the timeframe set out by the Comisi&#xF3;n Nacional de Valores. And therefore, we will begin reporting under IFRS in 2012.</p>
          <p>So summing up, we rounded off a tough year with a solid set of numbers for the fourth quarter. 2010 was a transformational year for us, a complex year but one that sets us for a strong 2011, we're sure. We're certain that opportunities will once again be plenty and keep us very, very busy.</p>
          <p>And with those comments, I would like now to open the call for questions. Thanks, Operator.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The question-and-answer session will begin at this time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And your first question comes from the line of Gustavo Oliveira with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon. I have essentially three questions on the OXXO business. The first one is, what is the strategy to renegotiate contracts with suppliers given the increasing input costs that we're having across-the-board. And if you think that your gross margins could actually expand in 2011 when compared to 2010?</p>
          <p>The second question would be whether you feel that you're ready to accelerate the growth in Colombia or it's something that is still going to be more of a pilot test into 2011? And if you're not ready to accelerate growing Colombia, what would &#x2013; what are the key points that you are still looking for to feel more comfortable with the operation there?</p>
          <p>And then the last question is more related to CapEx, whether you could provide us some &#x2013; a CapEx guidance for 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, hi. On the first topic, the dynamics on the retail industry is pretty clear, it is every single retailer is trying to comply with the value proposition that it's presenting to consumers. So any from time to time that most consumer good products &#x2013; and we're on both sides of the equation, on the consumer goods side as well as on the retailing, there is plenty of conversations and discussions among producers and retailers and I don't think this is going to be a significant different situation from the one we have had in the past.</p>
          <p>Consumer good manufacturers tend to adapt their product portfolio when times are rough. And I wouldn't say that the economic-wise the demand is going to be soft from the consumer side. But of course there is going to be a lot of pressure on the input side for the guys that produces fast moving consumer goods.</p>
          <p>So all in all I think that it'll &#x2013; in the end it will be I would say hopefully a productive conversation as always in terms of what can the producer can do in order to face these input pressure to provide with retailers and consumers with some flexibility for them to adapt to the new circumstances. Some of that input pressure we think is going to start trickling down to products and into final consumer prices going forward but I don't think we should be expecting here significant changes in the number of the, I would say, products which are the base of what you can find in an OXXO Store when you go and visit one of our stores in Mexico. So I don't think that again this is going to be a significant issue. Of course, it's an issue that needs to be addressed and managed during the year but I think we've done it in the past and we know how to handle these situations for sure.</p>
          <p>Margin expansion, I think you should stick with what we're trying to aim for in the long-term, which is once this business has reached about 8% of EBIT, as a margin from revenues increasing more than 300 basis points in the last three years. The long-term objective for the business is to continue to grow the top line both through expansion of the store base as well as same store sales and on the margin expansion side a moderate increase, maybe 10 to 20 basis points is a long-term objective that we have set ourselves, now that we have reached a very important level of profitability.</p>
          <p>On the second one, next year, I mean not next year, but this 2011, we're still planning to open a good amount of stores in Colombia but still not &#x2013; we don't think we're yet there in the phase in which we can accelerate the expansion. We're still working, as I said, in a process to adjust and develop the winning value proposition. We're doing a lot of adjustments to the value proposition in the stores that we already have open in Colombia. So you should assume that we will continue to open a reasonable amount of stores that still provide us with a scale that would allow us to test and learn from changes we're making in the value proposition but not to make it on the one hand unmanageable. I mean that the scale not being the right one for still being able to test in short cycles what the success of the different actions that we're putting into the stores. And also of course not to accelerate expansion until we feel that we have a winning value proposition for consumers in Colombia that would make a safe bet putting much more capital into Colombia in the OXXO business. And the last question on CapEx, I think that in OXXO you should expect a similar number as the one we had in 2010. That is roughly $250 million.</p>

        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gustavo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Alan Alanis with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. How are you? Good morning. My question is to do with the dividends. Could you explain to us how did you reach, how did you came up with that amount? And I have a follow-up but I'll make it after we discuss this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Alan. Roughly our thinking here is coming out of a de-leveraged phase of the business, which included striking the Heineken transaction, it would imply also taking off our books a significant portion of the debt we used to carry. And looking at the different potential opportunities that we might have in the short and medium term for the business, and by medium I mean three to five years, we also took into account the extraordinary financial position of the company having net cash position at the end of December.</p>
          <p>And I would say that all in all looking again at these three variables as well as what we should consider comparable dividend yields and payout ratios from different companies in the space in which we play. We can mock that up increasing in a significant way the dividend for a second year in a row. It was the right thing to do, taking into account again keeping maximum flexibility on the balance sheet for the time being.</p>
          <p>But at the same time, sending a strong signal to the market that we would like to return cash to shareholders in the way of dividends paid to them. And of course we are moving into what I should call a song, which is I would say more in line with what the payout ratios and dividend yields of comparable companies look like. So all in all, we recognize that we are still retaining a significant strategic flexibility from the financial structure point of view. We think that is the right thing to do within the time boundaries, within the phases of the thinking on how capital allocation should look like in this company for the future. But at the same time we are also recognizing that we have a very, very healthy financial structure and we are convinced that this is the right thing to do at this point of time.</p>
          <p>As you know, there is not here in either a crystal ball or a magic stick to come up with a number that makes sense to everybody around but I think that the consensus within the finance committee as well as with the Board was to go ahead with recommendations that management presented on paying the dividend that we just announced this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. But it will continue to be I guess on a case-by-case basis every year. I mean, this is not that &#x2013; we're not so close to establishing a more formal dividend policy. Correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we've thought very, very thoroughly about doing this and looking at again the room to maneuver on our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities that we are sure are going to be out there for us in the next three to five and I wouldn't envision that the company really going lower than at least the levels of both the combination of dividend yields and payout ratios that we have reached with this announcement. So this is not something that we're announcing to then maybe coming back and telling you, well &#x2013; because again, we think we're retaining sufficient financial flexibility on the balance sheet side too and that we feel comfortable with the strength of the business just in terms of its cash flow generation and the numbers make a lot of sense to move to the kind of numbers that we're moving at this stage to be comfortable that we're going to be able to spend those for the medium-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And my last question has to do precisely with these short to medium term opportunities. Any color that you can provide in terms of your thinking, anything that has changed since the last conference call, since the last time we met regarding how are you viewing these opportunities Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a lot of specifics. Sorry for that. But again the decision of increasing a significant way the dividend but still retaining a very large financial flexibility on our side I think sends a message that we are optimistic that we're going to be able again to allocate capital in a consistent way with the strategy that we have put in front of you, which is to invest around our core businesses, that is Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio. We have spoke in the past that &#x2013; we have talked about FEMSA Comercio. We are basically a very large, the largest now we think of sister operation in the Americas but we have other businesses around Comercio or OXXO that is &#x2013; that we think also can be taken advantage of. The footprint, the capabilities and the financial flexibility we have for them to be expanded and we have also said that we would like to again increase our penetration in other categories in the non-alcoholic and ready-to-drink space and I think we're proving that with the Panamanian acquisition that we hope we're close to be, to be closing.</p>
          <p>But what I can share with you is again that the line of thinking is still the same, is how can we leverage our existing businesses, sets of capabilities and financial flexibility to allocate capital in a reasonable &#x2013; both risk return and strategic thinking way, and again, we think that we have a number of opportunities and of course opportunities are sometimes elusive, sometimes take time, sometimes they don't really get anywhere.</p>
          <p>But I think that we are very, very early into going out of a de-leverage phase of the company and still very sharp also into business phase of thinking of new opportunities. So all in all, a long question not &#x2013; basically to give you a lot of color, which you that's what you wanted, but hopefully giving you a sense of a conviction that we feel that we are on the right track and that we are optimistic that we are going to &#x2013; that we're going to be able to strike and to provide good news for you in the coming future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Antonio Gonzalez with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning Javier, Juan and Jose. I wanted to ask you about OXXO and this 8% growth in central sales. In the press release, you mentioned a sequential improvement in consumer sentiment in Mexico and I think that it's somewhat rare except for probably the retailers that are targeting the very high income segment in Mexico to feel more upbeat about the consumer dynamics in recent months. So I wanted to ask you how much do you think is coming from a healthier consumer and how much was triggered maybe by different push in new categories that you have been emphasizing over the last year or so like prepared foods or maybe even the IT improvements that you pushed lately that have enabled you to manage better your commercial proposition? Can you give us a feedback on what do you think have been the drivers so far? And what have you seen year-to-date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Antonio, hi. I would say a little bit of a number of things. Again this is not something like we are only doing one thing and one thing correctly, but we're doing a lot of stuff, the guys at OXXO really never stop on thinking. And I think, in the end I think that the success of the format is basically thinking of consumer needs all the time.</p>
          <p>And I'm just trying to find the better way to provide solutions in the intersection of categories and consumption occasions and purchasing occasions. And I think that you might find good examples in every single category. As a matter of fact, I cannot think of any category which there was not a lot of work during the year. And that will continue of course going forward.</p>
          <p>But I wouldn't say that this is again driven by one single thing. I can think of the increase on the service category, which is providing additional traffic, which at the same time of course is also increasing the purchase of people which are going there to solve an activity that is time-consuming, such as paying an electricity bill. But at the same time being able to satisfy another need which might be just buying a liter of milk or having an impulse of having a hotdog at the store.</p>
          <p>So I would say that the service categories is proving to be there. I think that we have made a lot of effort also in developing and improving our offering in the fast food category and that is on solids on food as well as beverage fast food, which on the coffee we continue to perform excellent basically all over the country. And the Andatti brand building a lot of brand equity into it. And I would say having a very, very defined, well positioned and very attractive positioning in the minds of consumers when they are thinking of coffee.</p>
          <p>I would say that also the first year of the transition from us, in the past managing the beer operations from now the Heineken guys run the show, I think it proved to be also a very, very smooth transition period. So we have very good coordination among the two organizations and results from the category development of beer. We made a lot improvements; Heineken guys brought a number of ideas to put in place from other markets, which proved to be successful. And I would say that fine tuning the way promotions are developed and then executed was also an important, I would say, element on the performance of the business. For some categories I think that also is now turning itself into a definite and I could mention <mark type="audio gap" /> (30:42 &#x2013; 34:45).</p>

And Antonio just finalizing the answer, long one already, I would say that those were the main drivers as well maybe also the bank pools of credit card related tickets, which have been well received in the Mexican market, now being able to pay with credit cards and debit cards, debit cards and also all over the boards.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Thanks, Javier. It seems from your answer that you are referring mostly again to initiative that you've been undertaking for the last several quarters. And I just wanted to hear your thoughts on whether do you think it's a fair assumption then to think about OXXO gaining a lot of market share, maybe against the rest of the community stores, the mom and pops or the specialty retailers, or do you think the category as a whole is seeing some stronger demand and you know on consumer sentiment is coming back across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I can tell you that we are obsessed again with improving the way we saw consumer needs in the main categories that are part of the value proposition. If that translates into us performing better than the industry as we have done in the past going forward, we'll be more or less happy to do that. And I think that that's basically the aim of every single retailer, not only in this country but all over the world. So my comment will be that we are confident that we have selected the main efforts we think we need to do in order to be a better alternative for consumers and will continue to work as hard as we've done in the past to make this as a better business going forward.</p>
          <p>And other maybe a comment that I didn't mention I think that the more the organization keeps on growing, on building this culture of being consumer-centric I think the more powerful the culture is in bringing opportunities to the table of management in order to be addressed and one example that I didn't mention as well might be also having the ability to implement a broader segmentation model on the nature of the store, due to its location. So having the ability to adapt and adjust the assortment and the value proposition of the store because of its environment, its surroundings, its competitive landscape it's also a capability that I think it's going very, very strong within OXXO and it's also I would say part of the reason why we're performing extremely well against the industry.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And just very quickly, if I may, can you just clarify where are the changes in seasonality in terms of gross margins at OXXO coming from and just to make sure, if it's going to normalize in 2011?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I think 2011 will be more like 2010, maybe not I would say identical or exactly the same development quarter-by-quarter but I wouldn't anticipate such a big change as the we had from 2010 as compared with 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. My question is just related to your comments on capital allocation et cetera and vis-&#xE0;-vis dividends. Given that the opportunities that you're looking at the likelihood &#x2013; is likely to change over the course of the year. And you only pay dividends once a year. So you're only really coming across this decision once a year. Is it possible that you would look to other ways of returning cash to shareholders such as reactivating the share buybacks in order to be able to make mid year corrections or really any time of the year corrections to this balance of dividends, cash return versus the needs of the your investments in the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Jos&#xE9;. We will retain the flexibility and there will be proposals every year to the shareholders meeting to be held now in April. We will retain the flexibility of having the ability to implement the repurchase program, not a big one considering the size of the company. But we will retain that, it is hard for me to say, we're going to use it or not. If you push them a bit, I would say I think it will be hard, you can never discount that there will be &#x2013; I don't know, something in the market that would be, that would make it as good idea to do so. Or if I would say that if the market doesn't in really tell you that there is a big opportunity out there, because of the valuation of the market as all of the company specifically, I would tend to believe that in the short term and that is the next year from here to next year, I would tend to believe that it will be hard for us to go out and do something significant out there for the rest of 2011. But as I said, we'll retain the flexibility to be prepared to do so. We think that is the right thing to do.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. I know the company will be adopting international financial reporting standards in January 2012. My question is about this. Do you have some impact of these changes in rules, specifically in sales, inventories something like that, some color about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Christian, hi. We have already and we announced basically in terms of conference call last week, last year in October that we were going to start in 2011 during that. So you can imagine we were basically prepared to go ahead. And we already agreed with the auditors on the discretion that IFRS provide you on selecting which methodology or criteria you're going to use to move to the convergence of IFRS. I mean all of that is already solved. We already have working programs in place to start working but at the end of last year, we reviewed the program and we looked through another set of priorities that we have in the business for 2011 and we can come up with the conclusion that it would be much better to face the implementation of IFRS in 2012. At this point of time, you can feel sure that we have already designed which criterions we're going to select to adopt IFRS in 2012.  Of course we are not disclosing those at this point of time because it doesn't really have any use. We think for the market and but we'll go into 2012 with the criteria we've already designed.</p>
