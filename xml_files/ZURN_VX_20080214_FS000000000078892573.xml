          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Zurich Financial Services 2007 Annual Results Conference.</p>
          <p>Today we'll have James Schiro, the CEO; Dieter Wemmer, the CFO, making presentations. Following that, we will have the normal question-and-answer session. This is being videoed.  It's live on the web and so when we get to that I would ask everybody to use the microphones in the room. And we'll take questions from both within the room and on the telephone.</p>
          <p>Looking at telephones, please make sure if you have one, it's switched off.  And I also refer you to the disclaimer on the screen, in particular, I refer you to the piece in capitals at the bottom if you'd please refer to that. Because of US Security Laws, we are not distributing details of the press release in the US.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will pass on to Jim Schiro to start the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Malcolm. Good morning to all of you and welcome to Zurich's Full Year 2007 Results Announcement. I don't have to tell this audience, that clearly today's market environment is a challenging one. But the strength of our balance sheet, diversity of our risk portfolio and our ability to execute on our strategy delivered excellent results in challenging markets for 2007, and make us confident in our ability that we will continue to drive successfully going forward.</p>
          <p>Net income rose 22% to a record $5.6 billion. Business operating profit increased 10% to a record 6.6 billion. And our after-tax business operating return was 18.7%, far exceeding our 16% target.</p>
          <p>As today's current financial environment highlights though, success in this market, particularly on this scale, demands a deep commitment to financial discipline and risk management.  It requires a profound understanding of the risks one assumes on both the asset and the liability side of the ledger.  And it requires a strategy and careful execution that leverages all the capability an organization can bring to bear on behalf of each and every customer.</p>
          <p>Suffice it to say, we are proud of our success, but we are not surprised by it.  The disciplined strategy we have put in place, aims for profitability, as we have said in the past, no matter what the financial markets, nature or our competition presents us with.  It is why, for example, our investment portfolio continues to hold up strongly in spite of today's credit crisis.</p>
          <p>We exited the Credit Default Swap business in 2003. We deliberately pass over asset structures that are so complex we cannot understand the risk-reward ratio.  And we mark all our investments to market values, not against opaque models. This same disciplined approach to our business is also why we continue to absorb significant losses like the UK floods by balancing a diverse portfolio of risks worldwide. And is why display both the creativity to grow our top line in those markets where the opportunity was right and the discipline to focus on margin where market conditions suggest otherwise.</p>
          <p>Our success in executing on that strategy is also why our Board of Directors will be proposing at the April AGM a gross dividend of CHF 15 per share, representing a 32% payout of earnings and a 36% increase over last year's dividend. And in addition, we are announcing that in line with our capital management strategy, the Board has authorized a share buy back program of up to CHF 2.2 billion or $2 billion over the course of 2008.</p>
          <p>These actions allow Zurich's shareholders to benefit directly from our excellent performance in 2007, while leaving the group with sufficient capital to pursue opportunities for further growth or transformation be they organic or through acquisitions. We take pride in our ability to generate such a high level of shareholder value, as well as in the Board's confidence in management's ability to maintain that level going forward.</p>
          <p>The real strength of Zurich's strategy though is our peoples' ability to apply the global capability we possess with strategy focused on three main levers: achieving sustainable profitable growth through customer, product and distribution excellence; building off the Zurich way to drive operational transformation throughout our businesses; and deploying sophisticated capital, investment and risk management techniques. In fact, if you look closely at the successes we have already achieved across the group on each of these levers, one begins to see how well-positioned Zurich is, for whatever financial or market conditions emerge in 2008 or beyond.</p>
          <p>From a growth perspective, all three success factors are bearing fruit.  First, our customer base continues to expand. In some cases that means expansion into new market segments, like our business catering to private equity and M&amp;A transactions, or our new Global Specialties Network, our North American commercial technology push. Other times, it means geographic expansion through acquisitions like Russia or Turkey or through new branches like the one Zurich International Solutions opened in Qatar and Singapore. In fact, today's emerging markets account for 23% of Global Life's annual premium equivalent, signaling a significant shift in how we define our customer base.</p>
          <p>Second, growth is also being driven by enhancements in our product offering. For example, by systematically comparing its customer propositions against the needs of the market, Global Life continues to launch attractive and relevant products, like UK protected funds that are being very well received in this environment. Switzerland's targeted homeowners initiative, the Latin America's entry into the D&amp;O market, or Global Corporate's rollout of its second generation multinational insurance proposition before the competition has even matched its first, are other good examples of how we are constantly improving the value proposition we offer our customers.</p>
          <p>Similarly, Farmers. At Farmers the integration of Bristol West which only began in the fall has already provided agents across the country with new products to sell, allowing us to keep tens of thousands of customers from having to choose another non-standard carrier.  The third and final growth focus is successfully enhancing our distribution capabilities, ensuring that we can effectively and efficiently deliver our broadened product lines to our ever expanding customer base.</p>
          <p>Zurich Connect's now being rolled out across Europe is the classic example of leveraging our pan-European capabilities through a new direct channel and an increasing number of customers want to access. For other customers, Zurich and Farmers have over 50,000 tied or exclusive agents selling products in the US, Europe and internationally. And last year alone we recruited 3,100 more of these types of agents to join our ranks.  Furthermore, we introduced new compensation rates, improved training and development and established succession planning processes that mitigate turnover or often policies. That means we have more tied agents operating at higher productivity rates, which naturally results in sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>On the independent agent front, the focus is less on expanding the number of distribution points and more on increasing and improving the shelf space we occupy with the most productive and profitable agents in the market. We're driving this by better aligning Zurich's brand promise with customer strategies, with select distributors and bolstering our value proposition through tougher and tighter relationships, a broader product suite and stronger sales practices.  These efforts have different names at different businesses, but they're all united under a single The Zurich Way work stream that builds off of the best practices and sets consistent metrics for success. In addition to improving our own distribution capabilities, we're also expanding the partnerships we enter into to expand our reach through other channels.</p>
          <p>Our international expatriate business added a new banking partner in Citibank, contributing to a 15% increase in our emerging Market Life business. And earlier this year, Zurich was appointed one of HSBC's tier one preferred strategic partners for their insurance business in Europe and North America.  Our growth plans then, whether deliver through organic or inorganic means are benefiting from a disciplined and strategic approach to customer, product and distribution excellence, and are proving successful as we focus and grow in our targeted markets.</p>
          <p>Top line growth, even in targeted markets is not enough though. Operationally, we continue to drive improvements not only achieving our ambitious targets through The Zurich Way, but increasing and extending those targets as well. In fact, building on that record of execution, we have begun to test all we do against three core factors. Can it be more customer-oriented? Can it be more effective? Can it be more efficient? While these may be fundamental questions, you would be surprised at how enlightening the answers can be. Particularly in how answering one tends to answer all the others as well.</p>
          <p>For example in our German operations, we streamlined a series of legacy corporate entities and customer service structures that evolved through acquisitions over time. As a result, we not only expect to achieve sustained efficiency gains, we also succeeded in establishing a unified platform that allows us to effectively target profitable segments like credit and surety, where we grew over 12% and quickly integrate through acquisitions. Together these actions allowed us to grow and to grow profitably in what was otherwise a flat or benign market environment.</p>
          <p>At Farmers, we automated processes, we simplified business rules and we implemented new IT platforms in both front- and back-end processes. This allowed us to roll out new products aptly named Easy Home and Easy Auto, through their ease of use for both the customer and the distributor.  And not surprisingly, these products are selling well and help to contribute to Farmers' market beating growth in 2007.</p>
          <p>At North America Commercial which continues to maintain profitability in a challenging market environment, a new fast flow IT platform for the five billion commercial market segments for this group is improving rate submission turnaround 30% and reducing system down time to nearly zero. Together, these examples illustrate the many steps we are taking to build off our continued success with The Zurich Way and begin making deeper changes to our operating models. Those changes will make us more effective and more efficient, but most importantly, we must become increasingly more customer-oriented.  In addition to growth and transformation, we also continue to focus on all dimensions of capital management, deploying the most sophisticated risk investment strategies to ensure prudent use of existing capital, while streamlining our corporate structures to maximize return on capital.</p>
          <p>The entry into more EU markets through our Irish operations, recently adding Denmark and Norway will drive further efficiency of our capital base in Europe. The increased granularity of our risk management processes will continue to ensure a well-balanced approach to operational and business issues. And of course, our continued focus on a disciplined investment philosophy will effectively and prudently align our assets with our liabilities, taking together our focus on targeted growth strategies in selective market segments, our ability to leverage The Zurich Way into deep operational transformation and our disciplined utilization of capital, investment and risk management techniques that drove our record results in 2007. And it is this that make us confident about our ability to execute and deliver in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Ultimately though that confidence is rooted in the capabilities of the talented people, which is why talent management is the foundation of our success. The recruitment, training and development, compensation, succession planning and performance management are the tools necessary to maintain a vibrant human resource environment. And in each of those areas, we're rolling out global approaches that balance proven best practices coupled with what is needed in the local customs and cultures.  Beyond these tools, deep employee engagement, coupled with the freedom to grow and the knowledge that you are making a difference is what motivates people to excel and everyone this leadership team and myself included are responsible for mentoring and encouraging these people to do it. And this is one of the reasons that Zurich is increasingly finding ways that challenge how we think and how we define our role in society.</p>
          <p>Our active efforts are micro insurance as well our recent launch of a climate initiative, are good examples of how expanding your perspective and challenging conventional wisdom can generate real business opportunities and help motivate employees and attract the best and the brightest into this company. They're also good examples of how we are applying our deep understanding of risk to help us deal with the challenges of tomorrow with the customers' interest as our driving motivation.</p>
          <p>So thank you again for joining us on this busy morning, and now Dieter will walk you through in more detail with a review of the numbers.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everybody. So I'm delighted to be able to report a set of results, the strengths across all business segments of Zurich. We have demonstrated strong top and bottom line results and have made continued progress in line with our strategic targets.  We continue to demonstrate underwriting discipline in General Insurance and strong growth in both Global Life and Farmers Management Services. We are pleased to announce a very strong 2007 financial results for our General Insurance business underpinned by the actions of our business globally. The power of Zurich Way in action, particularly in underwriting and claims as well as conservative reserving have led to a beneficial claims experience, which supported by our investment performance has produced a strong result in spite of European weather events and stormy financial markets.</p>
          <p>Global Life showed a 20% increase in operating profit.  Adjusted for the one-off unlocking of deferred acquisition costs in the US which we reported at the half year, the increase was 11%. This is strong new business performance in Life, so it adds up to a very good result.  Farmers also had a strong result with operating profits improving by 4%.  The income on Other Business was positive as well.</p>
          <p>I will go through the result of each of segments in more detail, but first, I would like to compare our progress with our strategic ambition on the next slide, Slide 9. It is important that we link our progress as a business against our strategic targets. In this slide we have plotted each of our business divisions on the slide I shared with you at the May Strategy Day. However, this time I have included a measure of volume growth and margin growth both of which are detailed on the slide. And you will be pleased to see our actual performance is remarkably aligned to our strategic escalations.</p>
          <p>In Farmers, we have successfully grown revenues precisely as we intended while defending a strong margin position. In Life we have been able to show significant growth in new business volumes, while further broadening margins. In EGI, European General Insurance, our margin was deflated by caps, but our gross investments have increased top line.  In International business, we have maintained but not improved profitability with an excellent level of volume growth. As intended for both Global Corporate and North America Commercial, we have reacted to market conditions reducing top line, but by focusing on operational improvements, have increased our margins.</p>
          <p>Let me now take you through the details of our results starting with the top line on Page 10. Across all our segments, we have seen a strong performance that's close in line with our strategy as I just showed, particular Farmers, Global Life, Europe and International business.  In General Insurance, Zurich has been successfully through this more difficult rating environment by adopting a market strategy that focus in on retention, securing the newer business at typically more stable rates, profitable segments, targeting growth on the best segments and shrinking the least, underwriting discipline, including being ready to sacrifice volume where rates are not adequate. After reinsurance actually networking premiums have gone up by 2% in local currency following lower sessions to the reinsurance.</p>
          <p>At this stage in the cycle with rates still reducing we are pleased that our growth initiatives are leading to neutral overall top line, which we have achieved through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. For instance we have integrated and re-branded Nasta into Zurich, establishing a new organizational structure, strengthened leadership team, and have maintained a local organic cost PWP growth at 30%.  We have consolidated -- if we would have consolidated full year's premium from our combined Russian operation, this would have added over $350 million to European General Insurance revenues in 2007.</p>
          <p>Gross written premium are up 4% in dollar terms and flat in local currency. Across General Insurance, rate decreases were 2.7% and the trend in the market conditions over the last few quarters has continued, but with our experience, varying by business division, line of business and segments.  Europe General Insurance, gross written premium remains ahead of 2006 year-on-year in local currency at 3%. Gross written premium actually for all countries is ahead of prior year, despite rates on average across Europe falling by 1%. The pattern of mainland European rate increases largely offset the reductions in the UK, Italy and Ireland. In Ireland, rate reductions are in double figures, but in UK and Italy reductions of 1 and 4% respectively are more modest and stable. By line of business the main reductions are within Liability about 7% driven by the commercial segment in UK and Italy, rates in Motor and Property rates are more stable.</p>
          <p>Looking to the US, in a market with significant pressure on rates, North America Commercial has successfully defended its margin and achieved growth in targeted segments. Overall, premium has fallen by 3% in line with rate reductions over the period. North America Commercial continues to use the stock market segmentation approach, enabling underwriters and management to optimize account performance. Rate reductions have been greatest within property lines, although our experience in North America Commercial remains some way ahead of the deteriorations indicated in industry service.</p>
          <p>Global Corporate continues to post good results with record levels of profitability and  gross written premium now only 2% below prior year, the position that has improved each quarter after a slow start to the year. The performance is a result of the ability to offer appealing customer propositions in our product offers and new propositions like the new M&amp;A units. ZIS has become fully operational over the last few months and despite the slowdown in M&amp;A activity, has generated premiums approaching $50 million to date.  Furthermore top line pressures are being eased with initiatives like cross-sell. ZIS has achieved nearly $400 million of premium in 2007 across all General Insurance businesses. With innovations like ZIS throughout Global Corporate we have been able to maintain our excellent retention level of 90% despite increased competition and rate reductions of 8%.</p>
          <p>In International Business, deployment of advanced statistical tools has allowed us to gain greater customer insight in markets around the world, allowing us to win profitable new business as well as retaining the best of our portfolio. For this reason premium has grown by 10% in local currency with emerging markets in Latin America up 15%. Across International, business premium growth has been supported by a rate increase of 1% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Success in implementing our Zurich Way initiatives has allowed us to execute our risk selection and pricing strategy with confidence so that we can remain resolute in walking away from business that does not meet our target return aspirations and be able to deploy that capital in other, more promising areas. The market is strongly challenging with strong competition battling for business.  Nonetheless, our market-leading positions, our drive to execute on Zurich Way and growth initiatives and our top-tier talent will allow us to outperform dueling adverse market conditions.</p>
          <p>Within Global Life the new business key figure of annual premium equivalent shows that there is 11% growth in local currencies. Looking at gross written premium, policy fees and deposits, these show a 4% reduction in local currency. The different trend and the metrics is driven by two factors. Firstly, gross written premium is still adversely affected by the off-balance sheet transfers in Switzerland, which are now substantially completed, and the strategic condition of the business to unit-linked and the run off of legacy products in the UK.  The second effect is in deposits, where a trend towards more annual premium and less single premium has a different impact within IFRS compared with the annual premium equivalent calculation. We believe the APE measure is a more meaningful indicator of our business growth.</p>
          <p>Farmers Management Services remain on track with growth in fees of 6%. This is in line with the continued good level of underlying premium growth at the exchanges of 5%, and the result of organic and inorganic growth initiatives such as Bristol West and emerging market initiatives.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to a look at the General Insurance segment in more detail on Slide 11. The General Insurance business has generated an increased level of profitability with business operating profit at $4 billion. This is despite the European catastrophes of $750 million and a more difficult market environment. Prudent asset selection has enabled us to benefit from our strong cash flows.  With higher levels of invested assets and an environment of higher interest rates in 2007 compared to the year before, we have achieved higher investment income. This additional investment income has, along with a higher level of net earned premium, supported our good performance.</p>
          <p>As part of our actuarial studies which we will come back to later, we have reviewed our experience in loss-sensitive rated business in Global Corporate. Changes in loss assumptions have led to $122 million adjustment in the provision for return of premium to policyholders, giving a one-time hit to the overall General Insurance combined ratio of 0.4 percentage points.  As we have said before, we manage our business on risk-based return measures, as we believe these are better profitability targets. At the year end, the General Insurance adjusted business operating profits return on equity before tax was strong at 28%, compared to our 25% long-term target.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a more detailed look at the expense ratio on Page 12. In this slide, we explore the components of the expense ratio development between 2006 and 2007. Firstly, we see higher levels of commission as the portfolio shift towards more profitable business, the impact is 0.7 percentage points on the expense ratio. Furthermore, the addition of the new Russian business, Nasta and Global Corporate loss-sensitive business premium adjustment, which I have already explained, drove another 0.2% increase.</p>
          <p>Of more interest though is the impact of Zurich Way. We continue to invest in our General Insurance business with an aim to build capabilities and undertake initiatives that will be accretive to earnings in the years to come. In particular, we have been making the necessary investments in 2007 to realize our Zurich Way benefits from growth and operation transformation initiatives. The total initiative expense was $250 million in 2007, an increase of about $200 million over 2006 levels, which represents 0.6% of our expense ratio change.</p>
          <p>Examples of such investments are what Jim mentioned, the German business model, which incurred 21 million and Zurich Connects which incurred $43 million in 2007. Although most of the benefits of our Zurich Way investments appear to the loss ratio impacting either claims costs or premiums, there are also beneficial impact on expenses.  Within the Other column we see a favorable movement of 0.3 percentage points which can largely be attributed to the maturing of earlier Zurich Way expense initiatives. Overall the impact of this movement is 1.3% increase and the expense ratio to 25.1%.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the underlying loss ratio, this slide illustrates our underlying loss ratio and demonstrates the benefits of our Zurich Way methodology. The underlying loss ratio for both prior year development and major reported CAT events, you can see in total, the 2.5% impact of the European storms and floods, as well as a 3.6% favorable impact of prior year development that I've just described. In fact, the impact of prior year developments should be considered after taking into account of the return of premium on loss-sensitive business in Global Corporate.</p>
          <p>Looking at the underlying loss ratio, we can see an underlying deterioration of 0.7 percentage points. But allowing for the rate environment in which we have seen rates falling by nearly 3% in the year, and effect of claims inflation, this is a great result.  In fact, walking our 2006 underlying loss ratio for 2007 allowing for premium changes and claims inflation, we would expect a loss ratio about 2% points higher. This outperformance has been fueled by The Zurich Way.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the impact of Zurich Way underwriting initiatives like market segmentation or technical price certification are leading to a significant reduction in claims frequency. This reduction occurs as the averse risks are priced more accurately, we're moving their disproportionate impact on performance. The impact of underwriting initiatives can be seen more quickly and so appears as an organic development in the current year loss ratio.  Secondly, we are continuing to see improvements coming through the reserving factors as a deferred result of claims initiatives, which impact the average severity positively. As we continue to produce economic benefits from claims initiatives, we expect to see the unwinding of this good news in prior year developments.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the development of our loss reserves on Slide 14.  Loss reserves increased by $3.9 billion to $54.7 billion, of which 1.6 billion was due to currency translation effects. The reserve quality remains prudent and unchanged.  Of the favorable prior year development of $1.2 billion, 1.1 billion arose during the year in our General Insurance segment, with the remaining $140 million in our Other Business segment.  Like any reserve release, this is composed of movement in the gross and seeded reserves, following detailed actuarial reviews.</p>
          <p>Over the year gross reserve movements amounted to $734 million. These were more significant than the seeded movements as the actuarial trends, particularly in Europe General Insurance indicated cross reserve redundancies.  As I have already mentioned, we are increasingly seeing the positive impact of our initiatives in prior year development and we are in a position to continue to recognize this late in the fourth quarter.  As already reported to you in the first quarter, the movement in our reinsurance reserve is largely as a result of a reinsurance recovery. Our US reserves had a net adverse movement of 29 million, almost unchanged from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>On Slide 15, we can now look at our non-Life triangle. Another way to explore our prior year development and current accident year loss ratio is to look at our loss ratio triangle. It actually shows The Zurich Way of reserving at work.  Looking across the top row, there appears to be volatility which can be explained by taking out CATs of 2.8% in 2004, 4.6% in 2005 and 2.5% in 2005 &#x2013; 7, sorry. It's then easier to interpret the underlying quality provided by our prudent reserving.</p>
          <p>Looking at the UK floods which are the major component of the 2007 CATs, we have booked an end year -- end of year number which is $12 million lower than after nine months. This means that our original estimate for the June and July floods has reduced from our original guidance of $660 million to an end of year position of $567 million.  Our philosophy on estimating the cost of these large events is the same way as we apply to The Zurich Way of reserving. Namely, if we see development in the prudent numbers that we provide, on average it should be positive.</p>
          <p>On Slide 16, we can look at our Global Life business. We are very pleased that Global Life achieved its new business growth target in 2007 with an 11% increase of new business in local currency.  Together with a sharply higher new business margin of 24.7%, exceeding the target of 20%, the new business value is up 35% to $729 million. This means that we are very well on track to achieve our new business value target of 850 million in 2010.</p>
          <p>Annual Premium Equivalent growth was particularly strong in our global expatriate business of Zurich International Solutions, our domestic business in Hong Kong and also in Ireland. The US, UK and Germany have new business value improvements from higher margins, driven by the development of business models and improved product margins.  Our unit-linked business had an APE growth of 16% in local currency and now represents nearly 60% of the total. Protection business forms another 11%, meaning that our main focused product are over 70% of our total new business volume.</p>
          <p>Looking at the distribution channel, independent brokers have shown the greatest growth, now generating nearly 50% of the total new business, with banks providing over 20% and the remaining channels consisting of tied agents, open work and the exclusive agency force at Farmers.</p>
          <p>The embedded value operating profit showed a strong increase with some one-off operating variance items.  I will come back to this later. As I said earlier, business operating profit benefited from the one-off debt unlocking in the US already reported at the half year. In addition, we saw improvement in business operating profit in the UK.  This arose from favorable claims reserving and mortality experience along with improving results from open work and higher shareholder investment income.</p>
          <p>On Slide 17, we can look at the new business in more detail. Global Life new business generation has accelerated with a growth of 11% in local currency for the year, up from 2% at the first quarter, 5% at the half year and 8% after nine months.  The growth for the fourth quarter standalone was 17% in local currency. This developing momentum has been driven by product launches, enhanced customer propositions and sales campaigns.  Additionally, our emerging markets of Zurich International Solutions and Southeast Asia continued to deliver strong growth in line with our strategy.  We continue to target double-digit growth although this is a challenging target in some market positions. We have specific campaigns in Germany, Italy and UK plus other Zurich Way initiatives which we believe will maintain the momentum.</p>
          <p>Taking now a brief look at the performance of Global Life's emerging markets.  Slide 18.  The strong growth story continues in emerging markets, where the new business APE grew 49% and the new business margin improved almost 2 percentage points to 26.6%.  The extraordinary growth in Southeast Asia was a major contributor to this increase.  Additionally, we expect further growth to be fueled by Zurich International Solutions' enhanced ability to write business.  ZIS is expanding its business geographically.  It has obtained two additional geographic licenses in 2007, bringing the total to 11, with another two licenses in the pipeline for 2008 and further expansion plans.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets are accounting for the increasingly important part of our new business production and now represent almost a quarter of our total Global Life new business, up from 18% last year. These emerging market numbers do not include our 20% strategic investment in the fourth largest life insurer in China, New China Life, which is not consolidated.</p>
          <p>With that, let's analyze the Embedded Value results on the next slide. I have already mentioned the strong growth in new business value. The positive operating variance is driven by a number of factors. The disposal of the UK annuity book which is being accounted for as reinsurance in 2007 generated embedded value profit of $176 million, reflecting our conservative assumptions on longevity.  In addition, there were positive variances to Embedded Value in Switzerland from a revision of the earned interest margin and in Germany from improved efficiencies in our service companies. Adverse movements included the cost of developing new administration functionality in the UK, which are fully expensed in our Embedded Value calculation as well as a revision of consistency assumptions in the US and the UK.</p>
          <p>Economic variance was negative in the UK, US and Ireland and was driven by higher risk free rates and equity volatilities as well as underperforming equity and property markets. This was partially offset by a positive variance in Germany which was driven by the increase inverse fee rates and reduction in implied volatility.  Overall, the return on Embedded Value showed good improvement resulting in the strong increase to improving Embedded Value of $16 billion while paying dividends and other capital movements of 651 million.</p>
          <p>Moving onto the Farmers results on Page 20. As mentioned above Farmers Management fees grew by 6%, driven by the growth in premium at the Farmers Exchanges. As we pointed out before Farmers Management Services continues to make investments to assist the Exchanges with greater market segmentation and the expectation of higher premium growth.  In 2007, an additional $67 million was invested in strategic growth initiatives and technology. These initiatives are showing results and the Exchanges' gross written premium is growing as expected continuing to outperform the industry. Despite these investments, business operating profit increased by 4% to $1.3 billion, primarily due to increased revenues, higher investment income and gains on the sale of operating properties.</p>
          <p>The gross operating margin is at 46.6% net of investments made to generate further growth. This margin translates to 6.8% of the Exchanges' gross earned premiums. We feel that this KPI provides a more direct view of the underlying insurance business and the Exchanges and their profitability through Farmers Management Services over time.</p>
          <p>With that let's move to the performance of the Exchanges. As I mentioned, ongoing investments and profitable growth is producing results where it matters in the Exchanges, which we manage but do not own.  They achieved overall premium growth of over 5% in a challenging market, 3.4% resulting from organic initiatives, while 2.0 was achieved from integrating Bristol West. This growth was well ahead of the industry and was one of the strongest among multi-line carriers in the US.  And let me remind you, this growth is not price led, but it is based on a multitude of product and distribution initiatives.</p>
          <p>In addition to Bristol West, the emerging markets initiative is contributing profitable growth.  To focus on the fast growing Hispanic market and the Southwest of the US, 277 new agents have been appointed and these initiatives have generated more than $60 million in additional premium.  Furthermore, Farmers continues to introduce new tools in its effort to improve the productivity of its tied agents. One such tool introduced in 2007, as a value insurance package which supports cross-sell. Early results indicate that frequent users increased sales productivity by 10%. I am pleased to add that this top line growth is profitable as adjusted combined ratio at 92.3% demonstrates. This is a higher ratio than in 2006, as the California wildfires in the first quarter added 1.7 percentage points.</p>
          <p>More importantly, the Exchanges have been filing rate increases since the beginning of the year, in response to higher Auto and Homeowner loss trends which we were partly driven by above average reserve related losses on Homeowners policies. In 2007, the Exchanges took rate increases of 5.9% in Auto and 7.5% in Homeowners excluding California state mandated 9.1 rate reduction.</p>
          <p>Farmers plans to continue to file additional rate increases in 2008 as loss trends warrant. Net surplus grew by $444 million in the year, bringing the surplus ratio to the same level as last year, just under 40%. This was after absorbing the acquisition of Bristol West which technically reduced the 2007 surplus ratio by 0.9 percentage points and the wildfires in California which as stated have not materially affected the Exchanges' solvency.  At these current levels of profitability, the Exchanges will be able to fund growth, while keeping the surplus ratio at a healthy level and therefore allowing the Exchanges to support the planned mid-term growth.</p>
          <p>Let me now give you a quick update on the Bristol West integration. I'm happy to report that the integration of Bristol West is running smoothly and accordingly to plan.  By year-end 2007, of the 29 tied agent states have -- 20 of the 29 tied agent states have been rolled out including large states such as California and Texas. And we expect to complete the rollout in the first half of 2008. This rapidly expanding product distribution through Farmers tied agent is already showing tangible results.  In December, tied agents wrote more than 11,000 new policies and in January more than 16,600. This represented about 35% of Bristol West's total new business sales for each of the months.</p>
          <p>Turning now to look at the performance of our Other Businesses and Corporate Function segment, on Slide 23. In line with the Exchanges, Farmers Re continues to deliver a consistent business operating profit contribution. Centre continues to outperform the planned sustainable underlying profit target of $100 million per year that we discussed previously.  There was some reserve strengthening in Q4 allowing -- following a reserve review of the visibility book and this drove the reduction in operating profit. The line marked Others includes our centrally managed businesses which are also mostly in one-off. Here an increased level of permutations give rise to crystallization of the surplus of undiscounted reserves over fair value, generating operating profit and positive prior year development.</p>
          <p>Corporate Functions is broadly in line with prior years. Higher investment income, offset higher debt charges and the early redemption charge on the $1 billion Zurich Capital Securities redeemed and replaced in May by new lower-cost more rating-efficient subordinated debt of 1.5 billion as already reported.</p>
          <p>Looking now briefly at the performance of our Group investments. Net investment income has increased by 9% or 3% in local currency, which was largely driven by positive cash flow in our General Insurance business, invested at higher interest rates. This together with a broadly stable capital gain has resulted in a higher investment return through P&amp;L of 5.3%.  Higher interest rates led to revaluations of the Group's available-for-sale bond portfolio, which drove the negative movement in net unrealized gains included in equity. These movements reduced the total investment result by 2.7 billion for the full year 2007, which is similar to the position after nine months.</p>
          <p>Let me recap some highlights on Group Investments on Page 25. We discussed our investment approach at our last Investor's Day on investment management on December 6. These robust results demonstrate that Zurich's disciplined approach is structured and works in extremely volatile financial markets.  As emphasized, we are very comfortable with the quality of our investments and our asset allocation.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through some highlights here. You can find further details in the Appendix of this presentation. Our equity exposure is well-controlled and amounts to 5.4%, taking into account our hedging programs, which protect about a third of our equity exposures. We continued to have no concerns on the credit quality and future performance of our high quality debt portfolio, including our very small CDO and subprime exposures.</p>
          <p>Responding to specific requests, we have included further details on our corporate bond and asset-backed securities portfolio in the Appendix. Our bond portfolios continues to be of high quality incurring only minimal impairment of seven base points or $87 million in 2007, underlining both the quality of our portfolio and its diversification. Our exposures to assets wrapped by monolines is about one billion. We consider the potential impact of losing wraps on this one billion to be insignificant as the underlying credit quality of these debt securities is between A and AA on average.</p>
          <p>Our CDO and subprime exposures remain very small and of high quality. Each continues to represent about 20 base points of our total Group investments and both have incurred only minimal impairments of $27 million in aggregate for the full year. You'll find more details in the Appendix in particular on Page 53 and 54.  Since the end 2007 our subprime and CDO exposures have developed as we expected, with no material deterioration in value.  In particular they have not been impacted in any material way by rating agency actions in January 2008, and impairments were booked in 2007 on a few securities affected already.  We do not have to resort to modeling to get asset prices. We mark our portfolio to market.  This is an indication of its quality.</p>
          <p>While talking actually about subprime let me reiterate what we said about the Insurance Liability side. At the half year and nine months reported, our exposure to losses from liability claims as a result of coverage in US subprime lending issues continues to be immaterial as well. As Jim has said, we do not sell CDS products. Despite very challenging financial markets in January 2008, our investment portfolio has proven to be resilient. The value of our equities has decreased by 5% after hedging, while the value of our bond portfolio has increased by 1.2%. This illustrates the message we gave you at the Investment Management Day, that our sources of the returns and risks are well-balanced.</p>
          <p>With that, let me conclude with a comment on the financial strength and capital management of the group on Slide 26. Shareholders' equity at $28.8 billion is up 13% on the restated 2006 year-end closing number. We are particularly pleased with this increase, as it is after paying a dividend of $1.3 billion, buying back shares of a billion, purchasing additional treasury shares to hedge future employee plans for 0.6 billion and absorbing unrealized losses on investments of another 0.6 billion.  The latter was largely driven by higher interest rates on our available for sale bond portfolio as just discussed.  Both the reduction of our pension deficit and consolation adjustment added each half a billion to our equity. Obviously, the material movement in equity was a $5.6 billion of net income after tax, which reflects the benefits also of a sustainable reduced tax rate.</p>
          <p>In fact, the shareholders' effective tax rate for 2007 is down to 24.7% resulting from continuous improvement in the tax efficiency of our operating model. While talking about net income, we have provided you the source of net income by currency in the Appendix.</p>
          <p>With that, let me discuss how we are planning to use and return earnings to shareholders on Slide 27. On our Capital Management Day, we laid out our capital strategy. We have updated our capital model and the development of the available financial resources and the risk-based capital shows a strong improvement in our surplus position throughout 2007. You will find the updated slides with more details in Appendix as well.</p>
          <p>This slide summarizes the capital actions taken in respect of 2006 earnings, as well as those taken and proposed in respect of 2007. Our confidence in our sustainable financial strengths has allowed us to increase the dividend and initiate another share buy back program.  After these actions, our financial resources remain within the 10 to 20% surplus over risk-based capital that we indicated last March to be our target range.</p>
          <p>Comparing this with earning per share on Page 28, you can see that our earning per share increase by 17% to CHF 46.37. The dividend and share buy back program we carried out in 2007 represented about 50% of 2006 earnings.  In addition, during the fourth quarter 2007, we purchased treasury shares as a hedge against committed employee participation plans. This purchase was in respect of 2007 earnings. Elements of the total payout including the treasury purchases, the new dividend and the share buy back program represent a payout of 78% of 2007 earnings. We consider the CHF 15 to be a highly competitive dividend level. The new buy back of CHF 2.2 billion or roughly $2 billion will be actioned in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize the results on Page 29. Business operating profit has increased by 10% to 6.6 billion, with well-diversified contributions from all businesses. Our BOP after tax return of 18.7% is well above the 16% target. Although, slightly lower than last year simply due to the higher average equity.  Average equity in 2007 was about 4.1 billion higher than in 2006. Our net income, up by 22% to $5.6 billion is at a record level. This is also true in terms of quality as the net income includes a similar level of capital gains as in prior years and has absorbed sizable catastrophe costs.</p>
          <p>We exceeded the 700 million target from The Zurich Way in 2007 and have increased the outlook for 2008 to $800 million, totaling 2.4 billion over the next three years. Let me remind you that these benefits are always net of investments we have made or will make. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen with these results, along with the high quality investment portfolio with its unchanged low risk profile, our strong risk management and a well-reserved and diversified Channel Insurance Liability book. The strength of our operating performance and our solid balance sheet has allowed us to increase dividend by 36% and to achieve a payout ratio of 32%.</p>
          <p>Throughout the presentation, I have demonstrated how we have been successfully in implementing our strategic approach of differentiating volume and margin by segment or business division.  We have achieved volume growth without sacrificing margin by targeting attractive business opportunities in all segments.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we are confident that the combination of disciplined underwriting, continued benefits from The Zurich Way and financial strengths give us a platform to perform well in challenging markets.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and now back to Jim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dieter. Now I think what we'll do is take some questions from in the room and online, Malcolm?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay, so the rules of the question-and-answer session you wait for microphone and you identify yourself please. We'll start with the room first, if we could have question that mic, would you like to ask a question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Michael Klien from Chevreux. I've got two question if I may. Firstly in terms of the reserve releases, could you maybe give us some more details in terms of reserve movements overall in 2007 in terms of where you had to increased reserve as you already gave some indications, so we can have a better grasp in terms of the overall size of the reserve releases? And secondly also going forward, what kind of reserve releases we can expect thinking of The Zurich Way impacting the loss ratio, thinking of your conservative reserving and thinking that probably in future that there shouldn't be any areas where you should be, at least from December now increasing reserves? Second question in terms of unit-linked, that represents now about 60% of new sales.  It's highly-geared obviously to equity markets, with equity markets having come down quite substantially, what is your expectation in terms of sales on the unit-linked side in 2008 and going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So while Dieter is taking up all the answers to the detailed reserve question, let me just reiterate the philosophy around reserves and if you look at Slide 16 -- Slide 15 you can see really where the change in our thinking around The Zurich Way where we adopted more conservative reserving assumptions. And at a meeting of the Executive Committee and the Board the other day the Chief Actuary phrased this best. We don't want be looking at reserves from the bottom up. We want to be booking them and looking from the top down.  And you can see how they are developing. So we move to more conservative reserving assumptions. You can see exactly where we did that in The Zurich Way initiatives, when you look at Slide 15. And as we've reiterated in the past, our plan in moving to that is that we would move that we would continue to have a net run-off in a positive sense on reserves. And that's what we plan for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually as a loss ratio triangle shows you exactly the years that 2006, 5 and 4 are the years where we released reserves.  Or it's actually, if you just take the 2007 net earned premium you could roughly calculate it year-by-year by multiplying it with a change in ratio.  And then it has been booked in some older years but that is a smaller amount. So it is exactly following as we said that we are taking a prudent approach for the younger years and when they are maturing,  we are more confident about the final outcome and approach the loss ratio from above year. For the future, yes, we believe that our reserve level compared to a year ago is unchanged in quality.  We will certainly not make any definitive forecast number for the prior year development as we are also not forecasting our combined ratio for the year-end 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on unit-linked, Paul do you want to answer the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, to answer the last part of your question, our expectation for growth over the three years period has not changed. You have to realize that what you've seen in October, November and December, which was already at a troubled market has seen one of our highest growth rates ever, 17% growth over the quarter and even January was a great month as well. You were talking about geared equity funds, you do have to realize that we have and have launched a range of lower risk funds and protection funds in the last couple of months to offer continued new business opportunities to clients with a lower risk appetite to apply to their needs. And that makes that we are quite responsive to the market trend.  It might be stickier, but I do think that we are able and it's all about distribution, that we have a high-quality agent force and financial advisors in the various countries to serve our clients and to sell these products according to their need maybe for a lower risk appetite.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe we should add that we are less dependent on single premium products.  We have a fairly high share of annual premium products and if you pay your premium every months then actually it's &#x2013; the level of the stock market where you start to invest really doesn't matter over 20 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can we take a second question then, please.  In the back, on the left there, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas Frick from Mindfirst. Just a follow-up question on this reserve issue, or maybe even a clarification of that.  My question would be from this positive prior year loss reserve development, how much is gross and how much is net, i.e. how much is gross reserve releases and how much is reserve strengthening?  For example you mentioned on Slide 23 is that Centre Hamm showed small reserve strengthening. So, how much was the reserve strengthening and how much was the release to gross number? And then please can you perhaps give us a little bit more detail on the rate developments by lines and by regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I mentioned that the gross reserve release was 847 for the Group of which 734 million was for the segment General Insurance. The reserve strengthening, I mentioned for Centre we bought a disability book.  That means that it's following the Life accounting rules and is not included in the General Insurance reserve movements. That was a roughly $200 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me comment on the pricing, then I might ask John Amore to fill in some more detail.  Look, when we started into 2007, we entered a difficult environment in lot of ways from a pricing standpoint as well. What our job is to demonstrate that we can manage through the cycle, and by doing that we manage where we're writing our business and how we're implementing The Zurich Way initiatives, where we can maximize the benefit in the particular, as it relates to our technical price and the ability to continue to drive our business profitably.</p>
          <p>So while in some sectors prices are falling, the improvements that we're getting from The Zurich Way initiatives are improving our margins in some of those businesses. So I can assure you particularly when you look at the bottom line results here, we're writing business above our technical price and we will only write business profitably.  And I will ensure that we continue to write business in that manner. That is the discipline that we have instilled in this organization.</p>
          <p>We are seeing softening in some pricing &#x2013; in some sectors of the market and benign or strengthening in others on a market-by-market basis. We monitor that again because of the tools that we have in place. We can monitor that almost in real time and we're able to react to that in that way in terms of where we're placing our capital best to make our bets as we go forward.  And so that's why we feel confident about our ability to manage our way through the cycle, as you saw the 2007 results demonstrate, and we feel confident about our ability to continue to do that in 2008 and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So when we talk about pricing in General Insurance, of course it's a global enterprise and so there's lots of different movements around the world.  And I'll try to summarized some of them, and Dieter's already given you some of that, but maybe I could add a little bit to that. And I think the first point that we make is Jim's point, that we do exercise rigorously our technical price disciplines and our risk-based capital disciplines and look all of our portfolios consistently throughout the year and take action when we see action needed.  And overall right now we still see the General Insurance marketplace as attractive. Dieter mentioned that our rates did move downwards overall last year between 2 and 3%.  And basically the way we saw that happening is in our commercial businesses, especially in the US and the UK, they had the biggest downward impact and our global business in particular we saw that in the high single-digit range. Our smaller commercial business generally speaking was in the low single-digit range.  And there's a difference between the UK and continental Europe. In continental Europe, we see much less price pressure than we saw in the UK.</p>
          <p>Now we also started to see some improvements, and a lot of the improvements we saw was because as we saw businesses approaching our technical price criteria we took action. So you saw this in Latin America, our prices were actually up marginally over prior year. In South Africa we took action because there again, we saw large loss inflation occurring and we had to take action to address the large loss inflation. So pricing is up there.   Overall in our International business we saw prices actually slightly up over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>And there's a difference between personal lines and commercial in general. Our Personal Lines businesses are usual -- right now zero, around the zero stable ranges. We see some slight movements upwards now in our Personal Lines businesses, so a little bit healthier environment for them. So as I say, the picture for our General Insurance you have to really take a little bit of a walk around all our geographies and our lines of businesses.  So hopefully that was helpful for you.</p>

          <p>Okay. I think I'll take a question from the telephone please.  If I can, take two from telephone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Paul Goodhind from Bear Stearns. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello and good morning to you. It's Paul Goodhind from Bear Stearns. Could I ask the couple of questions?  Firstly on Page 14 where you've given the losses paid, can you break that figure down for the current year and prior years, for the '06 and '07 years, please?  And secondly on Page 23, the $347 million figure, that's a reasonably large number.  I think you indicated that was due to positive run off development.  Could you explain that further and give us a feel for whether that sort of figure is sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul. Sorry, you're very faint.  Could you repeat the two questions please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. The first question is the, on Page 14, where you have the development of reserves and you've got net losses paid for 2006 and 2007. Can you break that figure down between the current year paid losses and paid losses that prior years?  That was the first question. The second question relates to Page 23 and the Other section within Other Businesses of 347, could you just explain what that relates to?  I think you mentioned it was to do with prior year releases.  What kind of business is that?  And is 347 a sustainable figure going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So actually the breakdown of payment figures for current year and prior year you can actually find in our financial statements. So we disclose it every year so you will find it on the website, but I can give it to you, that is the current year is 7.4 billion and the prior year 11.4 in General Insurance. On Page &#x2013; the other question about the sustainability of the seeded reserve, I think you have to look at the prior year development as a whole.  And it is probably quite difficult to make any individual judgments and projections about the seeded part of it, as this depends actually, what is the nature of loss reserve developments.  And I think that that is probably too difficult to explain in this meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Paul, I interpreted your question on Slide 23. You were asking about the other, the 347, which was an increase and whether &#x2013; and that resulted from the commutations and you were asking us whether that was sustainable. Am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this commutations in one-off businesses and that we are not giving any sustainability of this figure here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Could we have the next question then, please?</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. James Quinn from Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, three questions please. The first one's just on the comment about the US reserving. I think you mentioned there was a 29 million adverse in that. I wonder if that's an increase in IBNR or late notified claims or is it effectively that you would expect to see similar cushions in those reserves that you see for example in the European business, but you'd really rather wait for a few more years before taking the benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The US reserve 29 million net in the first quarter was mainly a small movement in our asbestoses reserve ,so that goes decades back. We have not changed here our recent reserves in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Dieter is it the case that you would expect to see similar types of reserving trends there but you are hanging in there because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think The Zurich Way of reserving is being applied in all areas and we don't make exceptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second question is I've got is just on the overall P&amp;C profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Translating from another American speaking to you, I think the answer to your question is yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yes. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go for your second question, James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The second question is just on the overall environment of P&amp;C profitability, because we've got some sense pricing but could you give us some sense of how you see underlying claims trends? And if you could split that between claims inflation and claims frequency that would be very helpful. And then the third question is just on D&amp;O, I wonder if you could remind us of what your exposure is to financial institutions, whether you had any notified claims, whether it's written on a  claims made or what basis?  And really I guess whether you see this is in any way, shape or form an issue for you?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the P&amp;C profitability is probably facing for 2008 not a completely different situation than in prior years. So we have created The Zurich Way program to manage in the insurance cycle and that is what we continue to do. So the rate movements are comparable, actually what we have seen last year and also started already two years ago. And claims inflation is a cross support on a similar level as in previous years. There is no significant movement which we can single out and saying it is easier of us than in previous year. So that means that's a challenge for the year as comparable to the earlier challenges and that is what we are set up for to master it. I mentioned that the D&amp;O exposures are overall to subprime lenders, are related parties is pretty small.  We have some small loss cases building up.  In total it's about 20 losses, which is in the overall line of D&amp;O actually not really a relevant movement of the overall loss frequency you would expect for the line anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that 20 across the whole line of business, not 20 on subprime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no it's 20 on subprime related issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's 20 cases rather than 20...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>20 individual cases, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Can you give us any sense of what you would see as a maximum loss from this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just add something to both of these, and as you know when the subprime crisis first started most people were focused on the asset side and we were immediately into our book, looking at the liability side and looking at our exposure here. So we've had a pretty good handle around that in terms of the types of clients we had.  And you also have to realize from a competitive standpoint D&amp;O has not been, we are not one of the top players writing D&amp;O exposure here. So from a frequency standpoint, I think you would expect us to have less exposure then others and also from a severity standpoint given the size of the institutions are writing in the here, that goes hand-in-hand.</p>
          <p>Let me come back to the claims piece as well. One of the areas now we have been moving into several years ago and we've come into it now with more aggressiveness, we saw a lot of the benefits when we adopted our claims approaches in terms of challenging the way we settle claims, the way we manage claims.  And this has nothing to do, we have a contractual obligation to people who buy our policies to settle those claims quickly to help them during these times, get their businesses back up and running. So we've got to focus more on our own internal efficiency and how we handle claims and effectiveness. We saw that we could really reduce our claims cost by responding much more quickly in Katrina.  We've seen the same kind of impact in the floods and how we handle there and we're taking that same kind of expertise, Christian Orator who's our new Global Chief Claims Officer with John Amore. We're looking at how we use legal council, how do we monitor and measure claims when we actually settle.</p>
          <p>And so in an effort to better and more efficiently and effectively break down the processes in this area.  And so under The Zurich Way initiatives we'll continue to see progress in terms of the benefits to our loss ratios of managing those claims.  And you saw some of that coming through this year and we'll expect it to continue to come through in 2008 and beyond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can we take a question from the room now then, please? Any more questions in the room? Thomas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just one question on the capital management actions, the Slide 27. When I sum up all the approximate amounts that you -- what you planned to do with your capital, I end up with 7 billion. Net profits have been 5.6, I think so you're actually using more capital &#x2013; you're doing more with the capital than you were in 2007 and I wondered what -- where my thinking is wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, it is not the overall net income which is driving this only.  This is a comparison of our available financial resources and they --  this means our year-end equity, but also what you have to add as actually the increase in hybrids we created during the year 2007. So therefore, there is more available financial resources available than just the net income. That means that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this I think it's roughly the number we are explaining here. Plus a little increase in our buffer over the risk-based capital, which is now closer to the 20% level. That is on this Page 50-something in the Appendix.  You'll find probably the two numbers better and then that explains the movement maybe a bit easier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can we take a question from the phone, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you very much. I had three quick questions.  One of, can you remind us the cost of this earlier payment of your debt in mid-year?  I just wanted to make sure I could assess the earnings correctly for that. And second, as I try to translate back the Life trends in your technical reserves excluding currency, the numbers stand out exactly the same as in the growth in your business. But I think related to assets they're actually huge. Zurich International plus 20% rise in unit-linked reserves on like-for-like currency, Ireland up 16 and surprisingly Germany up 14.  Just wondered if you can comment on that what we could see going forward?  Growing a book of business by 20% a year is a bit racy.  And the last thing is on the non-Life cash flow, I was trying to-- you said non-Life cash flow very strong.  Maybe you could explain exactly what happened? Investments on slide, no, Page 5 of your supplement is 5 billion Total Group General Insurance versus 78.7 the year before. If I add the reserves where you say the figure was 3.9 billion, it's actually moved up from 82.6 billion to 85. Just wondered, what I am missing here?  If the cash flow from reserves is 3.9, is it you've put more capital in there or, I don't know, just to have an idea. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I must say the telephone line today is not really great so its -- it was very hard to understand.  So therefore I can only answer the parts I have fully understood and maybe you have to repeat some of the questions. So the first question was, what were the costs of the early redemption?  That was about $52 million when we early redeemed Zurich Capital Trust in May last year. ZIS and -- Zurich International Solutions growth is explained, it has already been mentioned. We added an additional banking partner in sales and we opened up two new areas where we are selling, that was opening a branch in Singapore and Qatar. And also I think we are now better known in the market, so actually also the market position in itself is fueling the new business growth. Ireland is seen in the market locally as a provider of a very attractive product, the track record of the underlying funds in this unit-linked and pension products is very good.  And also the Irish management knows how to grow business. So the third question, I must say, I got a bit lost so could you please...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably me getting lost, but I'll I repeat it.  I hope it's clear. Page 5 of your financial supplement, total Group investments in General Insurance went from 78.7 to 85 billion. You mentioned the figure in terms of reserve movements of 3.9 billion. So if I adjust to that, the movement would have been from 82.6, '06 including the reserves to 85 reported for '07 and I just wondered what the missing bit is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I think we will come back to you on this question. We'll talk to you separately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Have we got one question from the room here then, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Limans of Motive Tatung.  Maybe a question concerning the Slide 11. Could you elaborate a little bit about the quality of this jump of Group Reinsurance?  You mentioned some recoveries, but maybe we should have the wider specter of how this activities of reinsurance have to be read in on the whole company level. Looking forward, I mean how consistent is this or is it something like a volatile figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- well, Dieter's probably on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Group Reinsurance is an internal department, so that is actually a run off of internal reinsurance contracts over the past and it is still some ongoing reinsurance, but it is always in the company. So it is not an external business. And this, you should just see it as an integral part of the overall segment channel insurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're very clear, we have no subprime exposure and we don't sell reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we're running out of time so I think we take one last question from the telephone, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Brian Shea from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I had two questions please. One, on reserve releases you say that you set reserves with a release planned.  The loss ratio development triangle we can see, the year one movement over the past couple years has been about three to five points.  Should we take that as an indication of what you plan or have things actually been a lot better than you had expected over the past couple years? And then the second question, Dieter when you were on Slide 13 you read out some numbers that were very interesting, but I had trouble getting them to add up. You said that rates have dropped by nearly, I think you said about 2.7%. We can see the deterioration in your loss ratio was 0.7%. And I think you said The Zurich Way is designed to produce a benefit of 2 points. So all that adds up, except implicit within that is claim inflation of zero.  Could you just tell us what is the claim inflation and how do these numbers all add up, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It doesn't end up as a claim inflation of zero because if you calculate it through, it's not just additive.  You have to multiply the rates and the loss development, so what we have calculated is if you use the 2.7% rate decreases and use an inflation assumption of 3%, you are ending up roughly two percentage point higher in the loss ratio than the development on this Page 15 or on the other page would show. And that is the impact of Zurich Way, roughly two percentage points of combined ratio without going to the rounding.  And that is what we have indicated also as the long-term impact of The Zurich Way program when we started it some years ago, that this is our target.</p>
          <p>And on the reserve releases, I think we &#x2013; our reserve set-up is -- and reserve quality is unchanged. Actually if you look at the table which shows addition to reserve during the year and you take out the foreign currency impact, you can see that we have in 2007 and 2006 added a net of $2.3 billion of reserves, which underlines that we are actually moving in a pretty straight line.  And that is compared to premium volumes, which have also over this period only changed a little bit. So I think we are in a very stable environment, how we treat our reserving process. We still will continue not to make any specific forecasts about prior year development or the combined ratio for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the very last question from Heinrich. Did you want to say something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two questions. When you mentioned the 2.5% combined ratio addition from UK flood and major CAT, what is the percentage you priced for and how do you see this figure for 2008? And the other question is retention and reinsurance buying. Now that reinsurance becomes a bit cheaper on the other hand, you said your underlying gross business is still above the technical point. What is your tactical adjustment with the retention and reinsurance buying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. 2.5 to 3% is a reasonable CAT load for the year, which we assume for the beginning of the year. We have only highlighted it in this 2007 result in comparison to 2006 because if you compare the movement of the results, 2006 had zero major catastrophe events. So on the reinsurance purchases, it is true that we have now to look where it opportunistically might be good to buy more reinsurance when the rates are favorable.  But still overall we expect for 2008 that we continue to reduce reinsurance. That's actually a couple of hundred million dollar of premium, we will buy less in reinsurance than the year before because we have still found pockets where it is more profitable for us to keep it in our retention and not to cede it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we can bring this to a close. Again, I'd like thank all of you for coming. I think what I'd like to do is to just end with a few comments.</p>
          <p>Our strategic direction that we outlined last May focuses on three key levers. Dieter put up a Slide 9, which I'd ask you to continue to look at as you go through the year, and this is our targeted growth strategy in selected markets. We are not deviating from that.  We're going to continue to pursue that.</p>
          <p>We're going to continue to leverage The Zurich Way into deep operational transformation. I still believe that this is an industry model that we are pursuing to fix, that we can drive much more efficiencies and margin enhancements which in turn helps us to drive our operating margins for greater profitability. And we will be relentless in protecting and continuing to strengthen our balance sheet through disciplined capital management, but most importantly through the risk management techniques that we have honed over the last several years.</p>
          <p>Saying all of that when you're in difficult market environments and you're in difficult economic environments, the ability of people to continue to follow these paths is not easy, which makes me especially proud of the Zurich people. It shows you clearly there's a change in the culture in this organization.  There's a change in the determination that we've embarked upon a strategic manner and focus into which we drive the organization.</p>
          <p>I'm especially proud of the Investments Group and how they stuck, even under a lot of pressure over the last couple of years to enhance yields and drive yields in a different way and different direction. But our risk management philosophy, our ability to measure and when you measure, that's how things get done, kept us into a good place.  And we're bearing the fruits of that even under what was two years ago a lot of external pressure that we were going and should be managing the company in different way. But we have chartered the course and we will continue to chart that course no matter what the distractions are that put in front of us or what the competing priorities are.  We are going to run our business in the course and way we've seen it and it is proven as you can see from the outstanding results in 2007.</p>
          <p>So that maintaining our focus on the disciplined strategy can make a difference. Charting your own course can make a difference and it can make a difference whether the overall environment is good or bad. Our job is to deliver these kinds of results throughout the cycle and that's the focus that we will continue to have.</p>
          <p>So in the end though, as well the diversified portfolio, once again we saw it in 2005, we saw it in 2007 and we see it here again. The diversified portfolio helps us to manage our business in a much more efficient way. We understand the risks that we operate in.  We meet and communicate and talk about those risks.  We've got better tools to manage our business today then we did five years ago, to manage these risks.</p>
          <p>So over the long term, I think all of this is a winning combination. It's not the ultimate combination. We will continue to look for continuous improvement and that's what the culture and methodology of The Zurich Way is.  And most importantly we keep our customers and their needs in our forefront.  So we posted record results. We had difficult CAT environment in 2007. You can never underestimate, just pick up the newspapers, how difficult the financial environment is, and we're well underway to continue this type of performance in 2008 beyond.</p>
          <p>So thank you all for coming and we really appreciate it.</p>
