        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I am very pleased to be with you this morning to present our Annual Financial Results in a new year -- with a new year of strong performance for EDF Group. Year 2007 was contrasted with a number of components that conditioned our growth.</p>
          <p>Let me start first of all, by mentioning the oil prices, which neared and even exceeded twice in November, and yesterday exceeded a $100 per barrel although, with relatively high volatility of course. And the second highlight for 2007 in my view is the new public awareness, and awareness of political authorities, on the climate issues.</p>
          <p>As for EDF was a year of major strategic breakthrough that will enable the group to take part in the nuclear renaissance throughout the world. Indeed for the very first time in our history we have put intact as we announced namely to become joint owners, operators and cooperators of nuclear power plants in the world. In 2007, we have signed two agreements on the subject of the two key energy markets in the world, namely the U.S. and China.</p>
          <p>Lastly, its 2007 similarly 2006 was as a year where we kept our commitments and from an economic standpoint and we even exceeded our financial goals. Daniel Camus, our CFO, will give you more details of the figures later on.</p>
          <p>So our targets for 2007 were not only reached but exceeded. You have the figures here with sales revenue slightly up, EBITDA up 6.1%, attributable net income &#x20AC;5.6 billion and 4.7 billion for the net income from recurring operation up -- excuse me -- up 10.6% versus 2006. In line with the guidance we gave at the IPO, I intend to propose 50% dividend payout of our net current income namely the -- including 1.1 billion that were already paid out early last November.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you briefly on the commitments that we achieved. Number one, performance, you remember the Altitude project program covering the period '05, '07. We had announced 1 billion gains and we actually achieved &#x20AC;1.2 billion on EBITDA in 2007. And I'd like to congratulate EDF staff, who have contributed to this success.</p>
          <p>The second commitment I have made at the IPO is the disposal program. Our target was 5 billion. We actually completed &#x20AC;5.7 billion in divestment with the latest disposal of the Mexican plants. That was finalized last December.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at operating income, which has been up within all countries. In France of course, the Altitude program contributed greatly. In the UK, EDF Energy consolidated its customer base in the difficult and intensive competitive context. And then at the end of the year we were able to recover from the difficult situation earlier in the year. EnBW whose CEO is with us today also increased its electricity sales and volumes and Edison has improved its sales margin on electricity sales, as well as optimized its gas contracts.</p>
          <p>These performances were achieved in the context with highly contrasted elements in our context. Many of which were unfavorable. This is the case for example, with the rise in raw material prices and capital goods costs. We'll come back to that. We've seen -- it's started in '06, it continued in '07 and will continue in '08. This rise in raw material and capital goods costs will continue.</p>
          <p>In addition, the climate, the weather was relatively atypical and unfavorable. We had a mild winter, which had a major impact on gas volumes, primarily in Germany, Italy, but also on electricity sales in France. And the autumn was rather cold, which combined with a less availability of the nuclear assets, which limited our sales in the wholesale market.</p>
          <p>In addition, the fiscal year was marked by new regulatory changes in Italy. For example, the new regulation system applied to the old power plant with regulated margin, the so-called SIP6 system had an impact on our accounts in Germany. Even the new regulator has imposed a lower transmission prices, and in France we've had increased tariffs, implementation of the TARTAM transition price as well as the enactment decree on the nuclear waste law, all of which were reflected in our accounts.</p>
          <p>The year 2007 was also marked by the full opening of the residential market to competition in July. This market was therefore opened to for the residential market as of July 1st this year, and we created a new distribution subsidiary called ERDF, which has been operational since January 1st, 2008. So with the market opening plus the creation of a new distribution operator, you can well imagine that these caused major upheaval and it mobilized major human material and financial resources to carry out. Everything went smoothly and that is a success in itself.</p>
          <p>The new distribution operator during the preparation work has been given by myself, two goals. Number one, to ensure non-discriminatory access to all network user and suppliers in line with French and European regulations. Second goal is to guarantee to all of our customer a similar service level in full respect to our commitments of public service, of course.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we also crystallized my formal announcement, namely speed-it-up investments since 2005. In 2007, we invested a total of &#x20AC;7.5 billion, a 50% increase over two years. In France, our CapEx reached &#x20AC;4.5 billion and turning EDF into the largest French investor in the country. Thanks to our operating cash flow, we were able to finance this expansion without penalizing our financial structure, and our operating cash flow exceeded 10.6 billion, so that we could fund all our investments as well as limit our net debt and improved ratios.</p>
          <p>The CapEx growth covers the various businesses and geographic area of the company. In France the most visible of these investments is of course the renewed investment in generation assets. For many years, we have not invested in our generation capacity. Over two years, we will have invested nearly -- to create 1,500 megawatts in France, we've renovated the Portiaville plant, the Cordonmay plant as well as the combustion turbine in V3.</p>
          <p>1,650 new megawatts were connected in Italy and over the year, we've launched a number of other projects. In the UK, for example, we've launched a CCGT project in West Burton in England and a supercritical coal-fired Kozville in Germany. In France, of course, we have continued to work on the building site at the EPR nuclear reactor at Flamanville, in line with the calendar as well as the plan budget.</p>
          <p>In France, we've also consolidated our industrial asset by developing heavy maintenance programs in hydropower and nuclear power. We've also increased our investment effort in transmission and distribution with a 13% growth in CapEx since 2005.</p>
          <p>In the field of renewable energy EDF Energies Nouvelle our subsidiary has continued its sharp growth, and has exceeded the 1,000 megawatt threshold of operating wind power.</p>
          <p>Another important announcement I made regarding strategy was the crystallization of the announced strategy that has now been made possible. That is a corporate strategy as investor and operator in nuclear project internationally. You may remember that we identified four target countries: the UK, the U.S., China and South Africa. In 2007 we crystallized these expansion in two of the four countries.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. and in China, we signed two contracts. In the U.S. in July, we signed a joint venture, 50-50 joint venture with Constellation Energy providing for the building and operation of four nuclear reactors, EPR-type reactor initially on sites that have already been identified. EDF has already invested $350 million in this joint venture. The commissioning of the first reactor is planned for 2015 at Calvert Cliffs in the state of Maryland.</p>
          <p>In China, last November we signed an agreement creating a joint venture with CGNPC, who has been our partner for the past two decades. But this is the very first time we'll be investing jointly with CGNPC, and we will be -- we will own 30% in a joint venture to build two EPR in Taishan in the province of Guangdong, South of Hong Kong. The very first of these two EPRs should be commissioned in 2014.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom last July, jointly with ARIVA, we filed a license application and our objective there is to develop at least four EPRs in the UK. We're currently negotiating to identify site and conditions.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in South Africa, a few days ago we submitted our bid for the turnkey construction of two EPRs under consortium including ARIVA, as well as the South African group, AVENG. We ambition here, of course, to support this nuclear program in South Africa as an investor by the side of ESKOM, which is the South African electricity operator.</p>
          <p>Before we move on to the actual financials, I would like to say a few words about industrial relations. As you know we have backed the reform providing for a harmonization of the gas and electricity industry pension schemes in line with the public service schemes. The Lackmann Decree has been published and we were involved naturally in discussions and negotiations within the professional branch that is electricity and gas industries as well as within EDF. The idea was to find a new balance for our social contracts.</p>
          <p>In that context, a wage agreement has been signed and discussions are continuing on a number of topics, in particular the implementation of the supplemental pension plan, a group savings plan or the improvement of our provident schemes. In this area our ambition -- my ambition is clearly for us to reach the best standards of the best European companies.</p>
          <p>I would now like to give the floor to Daniel Camus, CFO, to give you more details on the financials and the financial results for fiscal year '07.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I'll give you more details, Pierre gave you the main figures for our financial results, and I'll walk you through the details. Key results; sales, they were published few days ago. Plus 2.5% with slightly faster growth in the second half, 2.8% with 2.2 in half year one. EBITDA is perfectly in line with what we had in the first half 5.618 for the net income which is a record high naturally for the group. But better quality net income is that includes virtually 400 million of extraordinary items less then the '06 figures where we had a strong impact from the Brazilian disposal, which has a major impact of course on terms of extraordinary income.</p>
          <p>Net current income up 10.6% reaching 4.677 billion plus 12% on constant scope. Let's take a look at EBITDA growth. Of course exchange effect is not that important since the rest of the world is only 2% of our total sales, so exotic currencies play a minor role. Hence, the exchange effect is negligible, very little even though we do have the sterling.</p>
          <p>Most negative element is the disposal of light accounting for 846 million out of the 756 in EBITDA. And positive is the consolidation of a number of subsidiaries where we increased the scope, SSE and a couple of other small subsidiaries in Eastern Europe. So 2.5% and 6.1% organic growth of EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at the geographic breakdown of the EBITDA. Let's &#x2013; I won't go into detail for each country. You see that the electricity industry performed well virtually everywhere in Europe, and like the gas industry, which lived through some dire times for reasons of climate and competition as well particularly in Germany and in Italy.</p>
          <p>Regulatory measures, which of course are constant in the life of our company in France and elsewhere sometimes sharpening in other countries, in Germany, for example, regulations had a significant impact on the German EBITDA as well as from a non-operational standpoint. So, Germany had a major impact in our consolidated results.</p>
          <p>7% -- virtually 7% was EBITDA growth rate in France. If you look at the rest of Europe plus 10%, Germany only slightly under 1%, UK positive growth, 2.1%, and Italy continues to improve on a constant basis.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at France in a more detailed manner. Let's take a look at the major changes in sales and EBITDA in France. 32 billion sales with an organic growth of 1%. Gas is becoming highly visible within the group's scope. You see this growth of 164 billion for gas for a total of &#x20AC;725 million in gas sales in France, 126,000 sites, 33 terawatt hour, just to give you some facts and figures.</p>
          <p>Services, embryonic activity for the time being, 32 million in growth, we started from scratch basically.  A few words about analysis that is always of concern for every one, prices and tariffs. Four, plus 416 million, three components in that figure.</p>
          <p>Let me slow down because I think some of you are particularly interested in that particular aspect. Pure integrated tariff 1.1, 1.5%, 342 million positive. TARTAM effect, negative of course, &#x20AC;127 million. That is the decrease in sales from the concerned customers. The total impact you will see later on is more significant. I'll come back to that. So 127 negative and positive price effect of &#x20AC;201 million for VPP, VPP contracts which we were contracted in '06 that are unwound in '07. So that's it for prices.</p>
          <p>Climate was not favorable to us this year. The total climate impact at the beginning of the year with mild winter and cold autumn with the net-net scissor effect, 7.4 terawatt negative impact year-on-year. So we are missing, as I said, 7.4 terawatts in the sales figure. The 148, that's variations that results from volumes, growth of demands over the -- plus 13 terawatt, and lower sales on the wholesale market 10.6 terawatts, particularly because due to the lower nuclear power availability, and I'll come back to that as well.</p>
          <p>Now let's try and be as concise as possible. The sales volume, we've seen the impact betterment will go, but what about the availability of our nuclear fleet? That comes into play here. The availability of our nuclear power plants in '07, well, it was a difficult year for EDF in that respect. The availability was in '06 was 83.6% and at the end of '07 it stood at 80.2%. So we are missing 3.4%, that's the variation in other words of this Kd coefficient, as we call it, for that period.</p>
          <p>Now the explanation is, one half is due to the steam generator maintenance issues. You're familiar with that issue. It's a bit lesser in impact than we foretold because we've managed to improve our utilization coefficient at the same time a bit, so it's -- the impact is only 1.7, it could have been more. We thought it would be more. And also the other 1.7 is because of fortuitous shutdowns, Paluel mainly, that power plant. So 1.7 and 1.7. 1.7 for the steam generators and 1.7 for Paluel unplanned outage.</p>
          <p>So the total impact of the steam generators that is a shortfall, the lost earnings last year is &#x20AC;330 millions that we couldn't market, and 80 million additional operating expenses. In all &#x20AC;420 million of lost earnings, of less EBITDA for the year. The 412 million negative, that's mainly because of transformation cost representing 100 million, maintenance cost also.</p>
          <p>On the positive side you see the payroll expenses, representing only &#x20AC;7 billion, it's only 13 billion, but out of the 7 billion there is a drop of 0.2%, less payroll expenses in France, thanks to the Altitude program, the Altitude program. Drop in head count of 1.2%, which increased up 2.6% over the period. So Altitude has come up with the goods, so to speak. And there has been a substantial contribution made by that program to our financials.</p>
          <p>I won't go into the other items here, but I'll just flag up, one point, which is the effect of the CSPE. But also the effect of the Bureau Act on the storage of waste that represents 262 million in the positive on the one-shop basis in our accounts for '07. We'll perhaps go back to that later on. That's the dissecting, so to speak, of the EBITDA for France and the main factors that fed into the overall results, several positive, several negatives, we can go back to it in the question-and-answer session if you like later on.</p>
          <p>Now regulated and unregulated, how does that pan out? You see we've increased the unregulated portion of our business 61.4%. The regulated business has gone down a bit just by 3%, but it's gone down by 3%. The non-regulated impacted by what I have mentioned mainly, and for the regulated businesses, negative impacts. The income affected by weather conditions and the upswing in the commodities in their wholesale prices, &#x20AC;445 million in the negative. That explains the drop in the result in the regulated businesses. The negative impact of the wholesale prices and the increase in the cost of the network losses and the fuel purchases.</p>
          <p>Energy, now, I don't want to overstate this, but the EBITDA you see now is going up by 2.1% at the end of the year. So clearly the second half has been a lot better than what happened previously because we set up a plan called the recovery plan. Quite simply, in EDF Energy and the management people of EDF Energy harness all their efforts to the margins, the OpEx, all of the levers, the drivers that they had at their disposal. And they were helped out at the end of the year by the IAS 39 positive impact this time around. It was negative impact the previous time around. So you see the strong performance of the regulated businesses here, 80% of the EBITDA of EDF Energy being regulated businesses and the network tariffs positive impact too. The network fee increases and the EBITDA was stable in the competitive businesses. There was no drop in the price of electricity.</p>
          <p>Last year you see in the UK, EDF Energy was able to win 40,000 customers. And since the beginning of the year it made its first price increase for quite a while. That was in January of '08,  was the first time it adopted price for quite a while. 10% in gas also. So that's EDF Energy. Difficulties in the first half, but the company got back on track in the second half of the year and very well indeed.</p>
          <p>EnBW, we have somebody from EnBW here with us today. You've presented your results yesterday, so you probably know all the details on the EnBW figures. I've nothing new to add really, but just 45% of the figures that were presented yesterday for them, contribution to the EDF revenue, 6.9 billion to the EBITDA a bit more than 1 billion.</p>
          <p>And I tell you what these figures are what there are. It's because the electricity revenues went up by 21% and the gas figures went down by 14%. That's because of the weather conditions and so on. So as you see here, the gas business is 11% of the EBITDA scope of the group, but that's helped to flatten the overall results. And secondly, the impact of regulations in Germany. So this is the first year we've seen the full impact of regulations on the -- impact in the distribution networks in that country and here the lost earnings impact is &#x20AC;230 million was negative, that's for EnBW.</p>
          <p>So overall the EnBW results are very good. The net income as communicated, the adjusted cost on gas business going up by 11% and the EBITDA going up by 0.9%.</p>
          <p>And then the impairment I would like to mention here too. The adjustment of the transmission tariffs 11%. That meant that we impaired last year on distribution 318 million last year. And we had to do further impairment &#x20AC;143 million worth of impairment on the goodwill in respect of the transmission and network impairment for EDF that were due to the lower transmission fees notified by the regulator.</p>
          <p>Italy, nothing huge to flag off here. We've been refocusing on customers naturally and reduction generation of power in Italy. So the start-up of Turbico and Simrig. So we gained four terawatts additional power generation. And Edison is continuing to come up with positive results. We have got the disposal of Cerenay Edison rate case and a few marginal business lines here that did belong to Edison. So Edison is continuing on track quite positively and EDF as a shareholder is quite satisfied with what's being done by Edison in Italy.</p>
          <p>The rest of Europe, a lot of growth. Three growth drivers, Eastern Europe, I won't detail what we have here, but Eastern Europe, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland they are driving growth. EDF Energies Nouvelle is fairing very well. Their accounts are to be published on the 25th, so they're not listed so I can't communicate the results even though I'm familiar with them. But EDF Energies Nouvelle doing very well. 1,000 megawatt going to exceed the 1,000 megawatt result capacity in the first year. And EDF is trading, after a year that wasn't quite as good in gas and electricity, that wrinkle, it will probably get back on to a more favorable trend this year. That's the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>It's important it's called the rest of Europe, but its 1.6 billion worth nonetheless. So you know that's as much as Edison and EnBW combined more or less for EDF, so the rest -- it's called the rest, but it's a big contributor nonetheless. And those business lines are growing sometimes in double-digit figures, very often in double-digit figures. When we say the rest it sounds as if it's only the remainder, but it's a big rest. Now, of course, which is for more than 5.7 billions.</p>
          <p>What about the productivity efforts and future performance efforts. The EBITDA impact, we see on the screen here, we're going to be talking about Altitude here for the last time because it's rounding itself of now. We've stated our ambitions regarding the working capital requirement impact and the EBITDA impact, we have over shot, as you see, these objectives by 22% and 24% respectively, so that's our first performance program called Altitude.</p>
          <p>You see the breakdown of those impacts, so we've really more than achieved what we wanted to do with this Altitude program. We've come up with the goods continually, sustainably. We've managed to improve our operational performance and I say that before we start to address our up coming program. Now the operating results, here you see, not going through it line-by-line, and I don't want to swamp you with figures, but there are a couple of comments we should make regarding the salient trends to perceive here. 12.3% operational expenses, 8% France, 16% international. In France, it's a progression of 412 million, that's a transformation cost and maintenance cost for the steam generators in the UK, it's almost &#x20AC;200 million worth.</p>
          <p>We have re-insourced once again certain activities. I won't go into the details of here, but the explanations are that they're one-shot operations. And then 73% for other operating income and expenses. It looks a lot, but it's only a mechanical variation. In CSPE 406 million, the TARTAM transition tariff, additional provision set aside here 240 million set aside. It's a positive variation that is it's a lesser provision this year than last year to 148 million additional provisions, therefore, compared to 470 last year. So 406 and 222, that's 620 million out of the 740 in all.</p>
          <p>Let's continue going through our P&amp;L. Now the earnings was a natural result and I know there's a lot to be said about that. Actual results a bit better, almost 170 million better. That cost more or less stable. We've improved the yield in terms for our long-term investments, we unwound the discount, nothing in particular here. Apart from the corporate taxation rates, now the corporate taxes were very much in our favor last year because of the Brazilian effect, it's 16.4%. But this year the actual rate will be 24.5%. So we haven't got the same positive effects. We have one positive effect from Mexico, all right, that's what we find here but the &#x2013; the rate remains quite favorable. It's quite below the standard rate 33, 34% we see in France.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring and recurring items. We'll I'll comment on a couple of line items here. What's new? Well, you've got the impairment of 111 millions including 143 millions that we had gross, 104 million net because of the EnBW effect transmission. Then capital gains and disposal of assets almost 80% of that is accounted for by Mexico divested before the end of the year. And also concessions, this was in the half yearly accounts too. The last point is the exceptional impact of the tax reform in Germany. We know the taxation rate will go down from -- corporate taxation that is going, it will go down from 39 -- 38 to 29% in fact. And that will have deferred tax assets in our books. EDF part, it's a one-time exceptional 304 millions non-recurring effective tax reform in Germany, the net income from ordinary operations 4.677 billion.</p>
          <p>A word on the cash flow and the debt just to conclude. Now the cash flow, the free cash flow in '07, in the non-monetary items, it's, well there are bigger variations than last year. Write back for provisions for pension schemes and recurring provisions in nuclear. We can go back to that if you like. Last year we had 300 million, corporate tax 200 million more than last year's figure. FFO 10.6 billion. The regional working capital requirement 300 million. What's important here is the strong impact of the increase in the capital expenditures going up by 26% in the year. The 7.5 billion, largely financed by the cash flow, but it of course, takes away from free cash flow. Last year it was 6.7 billion free cash flow, and now it's 3 billion this year. 3.7 of a difference 1.6 billion of an increase in CapEx. 1 billion in the working capital requirement variation, because last year there was an advance made, so technically there was a differential, working capital requirement 1 billion of the difference. The FFO here, it was 11.2 last year, so 600 million less, plus 500 million. So the tax effect and miscellaneous effect, &#x20AC;3 billion worth of FFO.</p>
          <p>Now, dedicated assets 2.4 billion appropriated at the pace we're familiar with now. It will probably be stepped up this allocation, right, because of the Bureau Law, and under the effect of inflation 2.4 billion here. Disposals 1.2 billion, including Mexico for 1 billion, so it's nearly all of it. Acquisitions, a plethora of taken acquisition which you've got Constellation &#x20AC;380 million, that's a big one. Dividends, atypical in the amount here because you've got 12 months of 2006 plus the interim dividend 1.5, 6 billion. So that's a year and half of dividend payout. And the debt at 16.3 going up at a constant dividend payout ratio. The debt is exactly at the same level in spite of substantial increase in the investment level, it's exactly, give or take 300 million, it's at the same level as the previous year. And we will see the ratio that remained quite significant.</p>
          <p>So the dividend was 50% of a payout, 50% of a payout on the net income from ordinary operation 1.28 per share of which 0.70 per share will be paid out, that remains to be paid. So it's a -- last year it was &#x20AC;1.16 per share. So the financial ratios, while you're very familiar with those, the three major rating agency ratios are here. First one going down a bit. There was an increase in the debt, reduction of the cash flow going from 75 to 65. And then the other two are continuing to look up with the balance sheet structure and the financial flexibility that's left intact.</p>
          <p>For a company's in spite of the considerable stepping up of our investment spending in France, our capital expenditure program, and I'll conclude on this, but spend some time nonetheless because we want to look to the future to the financial outlook. So as to give you some guidance and one thing is not guidance as such. It's outlook really, not guidance. Because we've committed to communicate specifically on the new program for operational access and we will do that, but I'll give the floor to Pierre on that who will detail it out for you. But just want to set in perspective the guidance that we did give is going to end up in 2008, we are in 2008, so that means that we feel quite comfortable with the idea that the average growth figure that is between 3 and 6% given the figures we've recorded in '06 and '07, those figures would remain pertinent. But I'll have to give you some explanations.</p>
          <p>The multi annual increase in double-digits that will continue to be the case we think given the performance of the last two years so we can reassert that we're committed to those two changes. We are sticking to that, and no matter what happens we'll stick to those. Now in '08, well we got to extend more we are going to do in '08 because it a year that's going to witness some substantial impacts. Some will be one shot, others will be more continuous. So firstly, we are coming into a phase where the upswing in commodity prices, energy prices, and equipment prices is becoming a harsh reality for firms in France, outside of France, everywhere, and sometimes for certain energy sources the increases are in double-digits, in double digits.</p>
          <p>And equipment just to illustrate you'll find it in the financial charges since depreciation. But on equipment if we look and particularly in the projects that Pierre described we look at projects in France and abroad. We look at the same projects a year later and we find that the bottleneck -- the congestion that exists in terms of supplies in the energy industry is such that a project can go up 20, 30, 40% and this is something you see quite usually. So everybody in the industry is currently experiencing that situation, which of course will be reflected in excess cost once you make the actual investment.</p>
          <p>Second factor that you may not be familiar with is the pension plan reforms in France. The pension plan or pension scheme reforms in France will detail the full accounting effect once all of the enactment decrees are published, which is not the case today. But normally, they should be ready over the coming weeks. What we'd like to do is give you a detailed accounting impact at the time of the half-year result conference provided that of course all the decrees are published by the Committee, that should be the case.</p>
          <p>The Phase I impact that we already know and I'd like to detail here because it does have an impact will have an impact on the '08 EBITDA is what we call the supporting measures. Yann Laroche can probably give you more details because he was the one involved in the talks on behalf of EDF. The supporting measures particularly wage increases, which will be higher than expected than in previous fiscal years, this will give rise in 2008 to an excess cost estimated between 220 and &#x20AC;250 million that will be reflected of course in the OpEx reducing the EBTIDA, accordingly. Then the charges remained -- the extra charge will be somewhere around &#x20AC;100 million extra charge due to these supporting measures. This is very recent news and of course this will have an impact on the 2008 EBTIDA.</p>
          <p>Third important point, Pierre will detail it later on, we are engaging into a new productivity project, which we have named, its in the same spirit as Altitude, we call it Operational Excellence and that should produce another billion euros by 2010 in gains as measured against 2007, an ambitious productivity program that will deal with OpEx, and will deal with synergies and it should carry its first impact in 2008 already.</p>
          <p>I would just like to inform you to the best of our judgment today and to tell you that the EBITDA in 2008 should only grow slightly. And when I say slightly we -- I mean less than 3%. Net income should not grow and in the best of our judgment it should not grow, net income. This being said, one important thing is that regardless of what happens with the net income, though it will impacted by recurrent and non-recurrent items, we are committed to keep the same dividend in absolute value that we presented today for 2007. That's a major outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>What about the post '08 era and, by the latest, end of this year, we will be updating our formal guidance with the years after 2008 for new time period. But we'd like to tell you already that regardless of what happens we're committed to improve our operating income as measured by the EBITDA growth between 3 and 6%.</p>
          <p>So even though 2008 in itself may be slightly or could be slightly below the previous year's growth we are -- we nevertheless make the commitment, it is a goal, it is an objective to grow at the same rate of anywhere between 3 to 6%. We'll be reviewing this formal guidance but this is already something we wanted to share with you today and highlight.</p>
          <p>Pierre is going to take over to tell us about the strategy and operational performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel, for this detailed presentation of financial results. I'd like to say a few words about our outlook and strategic priorities at EDF for the year 2008 and the coming years.</p>
          <p>As I said earlier, we are living through a key era in the energy industry with key energy challenges that are clearly in front of us today. My own conviction is that these energy challenges are actually a tremendous opportunity for the energy industry in general and for EDF in particular. By this I mean that this climate change and climate emergency is now understood by all and the security of supply, which is more fragile in view of uncertainties on hydrocarbon resources that have become scarcer and more expensive although the demand is increasing. We're looking at a long-term outlook, if you will, with the oil resources bound to be taken over, superseded by other resources. You're all conscious of course that our investment cycle is secular nearly, hence our vision is indeed a long-term view.</p>
          <p>In this context let me remind you that already to-date EDF contributes significantly to the security of supply of our country. Indeed each year we generate electricity volumes that are equivalent to the oil production in Kuwait. And while we are by far the first nuclear generator in the world with our 58 reactors, we are also a leader in renewable energy, thanks both to our hydropower assets and to our subsidiaries EDF Energies Nouvelle. Hence we enjoy an unparalleled industrial asset in the world and we're probably in the best position today to consolidate our leadership in generation -- in the generation of safe carbon-free energy.</p>
          <p>Allow me another reminder in this context. In France 95% of our generation is CO2 free. And you see here on the right hand side graph, if you'd look at our business in Europe, our group emits three times less CO2 per kilowatt hour than all other operators in the industry with production costs below our competitors. Now obviously rising oil prices and CO2 issues reinforces our competitiveness, thanks to our nuclear power generation assets. The left graph here is very important as well. We have here the production cost of electricity generated by the nuclear power plant at Flamanville, which is currently under construction.</p>
          <p>We know the cost since the project is currently being built. Here you have &#x20AC;46 per megawatt hour equivalent 2005. So this production cost you can compare it with the production cost of electricity produced either in the coal-fire plant, supercritical coal plant or in a CCGT Combined Gas Cycle Turbine. And you probably all know that electricity prices today on the European wholesale market is around &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour, and it's remained quite flat for the past few months. So this is the context that we operated.</p>
          <p>Based on our experience in nuclear power operation we are positioned as the leader, the major operator in the new investing cycle that is opening up in order to tap and export our industrial model as builder and operator of nuclear power plants.</p>
          <p>Let me get back on performance ambitions. On the short-term we will be pursuing productivity efforts in France, naturally, but throughout the group. And on the longer term we are preparing for the future by investing in the renovation, upgrading and maintenance of our industrial assets. Let's look at the short term. As Daniel said earlier, we will be continuing to improve our operational performance similarly to what we had done in the first three-year cycle with the Altitude   performance program. Altitude program that was definitely a success.</p>
          <p>We therefore, intend an ambition to once again succeed in a new performance program, which we have called Operational Excellence designed to improve in a sustainable and continuous manner the group's performance in all of its dimensions. The program will cover the period 2008 &#x2013; 2010 and will be implemented, it will be wound up gradually. The goal of the Operational Excellence program is to reach, to achieve &#x20AC;1 billion in gain on EBITDA by 2010. Similar ambition as the previous Altitude program. Everybody knows that second time is sometimes harder than the first, so we'll need to innovate.</p>
          <p>The program covers the optimization of our margin, naturally, but also control over our operational expenses, two-thirds in France and in another third internationally. So how can we improve our operational performance? We intend to rely on three key drivers. The first of these drivers is to improve all operational processes for all of the group's business activities; commercial, generation or even any supporting services.</p>
          <p>On the generation side, we already addressed it earlier, we intend to improve substantially the performance of our nuclear power plants. We started to work in great depth on our processes for the purpose, with our goal or target being an availability coefficient close to 85% on the mid-term.</p>
          <p>Second driver for improvement deals with procurement. We've already made major progress in this respect and will continue to optimize our procurement process, as Daniel said, in order to limit there the impact on our own costs of the currently expense tensions in these suppliers proposals, both for raw materials and equipment. We'll be streamlining all of that and adopt a global approach to our supplies panel.</p>
          <p>Third improvement driver will involve developing synergies between the group's component companies. We started to work on that at the CoMex. A number of measures are currently being implemented. For example, a few months ago we issued a joint tender together with EDF Energy on turbines for the gas cycle and we would be systematically extending the pooling on procurement for a number of equipment and materials. On the longer-term, we will continue to invest. We'll invest both to extend our growth and consolidate our performance.</p>
          <p>Let me give you three development drivers that will back these investments. First avenue, to consolidate our leadership in Europe, as well as a competitive edge on the long-term. Second line for progress would be to promote renewable energy as well as energy efficiency, equal efficiency. Third avenue will be to be one if not the leading player in the global nuclear revival or renaissance.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at the first of these drivers, that is reinforce our European leadership. Over the '08 to 2010 period we plan to invest &#x20AC;35 million, i.e. an increase of 35% over the past two years and this will concern our French as well as international operations. One area for investment will be naturally to develop new generation capacities. I have already told you what we achieved back in '06 and '07 and our vision in France this time is to develop 6,000 megawatts in new capacity by 2012, approximately 1,000 new megawatts annually. Natural gas we're targeting 15% market share by 2015 in the four major markets where we already operate.</p>
          <p>Lastly regarding external growth and acquisitions, let me remind you of our key criteria: strategic consistency, financial profitability, and since we are talking about the key strategic common goods that is electricity, we also wish to be welcome in the countries where we invest. So, we ambition to carve out these positions in Europe, if possible, to grow our presence in markets where we do not operate. Let me remind you, we're already, we're present in four countries: France, Germany, Italy and the UK. I already told you that there were two other key countries with common borders namely Belgium and Spain where we are not present yet. So we keep a close eye to the various developments that may occur on these markets. Regarding Belgium, of course the ongoing merger between Suez and Gaz de France will be causing two major assets to be put on the market namely SPE and Distrigaz and we'll be looking at that and interested.</p>
          <p>In Spain there are a number of restructuring process shifts expected and we have started exploratory discussions. But at this stage no decision has been made.</p>
          <p>Second avenue will be to promote renewable energy and eco-efficiency. Renewable energy sources have a great role to play in our energy mix. It is clear that the European commission and the European Union has set forward highly ambitious goals for renewable energies. 20% renewable energy now mix by 2020, and believe me this is an extremely ambitious target.</p>
          <p>EDF intends to play its part in achieving that target. Our own target is to multiply by three our installed capacity base for renewable energy in, or rather, by 2012. This growth of course, will originate primarily from wind power and well as from photovoltaic solar power.</p>
          <p>Second component of promoting renewable energy involves our integrated offerings. This under our brand, commercial brand Bleu Ciel d'EDF we are now offering three types of innovative offerings to our customers, innovative offerings, response to the market opening as well.</p>
          <p>We're proposing demand managements offerings, supports to home renovation, as well as offerings for decentralized renewable energy generation, the solar heating heat pumps, and so on. Ultimate goal is to contribute to make this emerging market grow in a dynamic way by increasing by 50% on average year-on-year the number of offerings subscribed by our customers.</p>
          <p>Lastly regarding the fight against the climate change, we also need you innovate more. Massive R&amp;D efforts have been dealing with technologies that will generate no or low CO2 levels, such as submarine energy, photovoltaic solar, electrical vehicle, or capture and storage of CO2.</p>
          <p>Third avenue for the future development is our ambition to become a top player in the renaissance of global nuclear power. Let me emphasize that in my mind this is a major development for EDF. Our goal in that respect today is to invest and commission and operate more than 10 EPR type nuclear plants by 2020.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you that the agreements we've already signed in China and the U.S. has contributed to this goal and we also have ambitions in the UK and South Africa in nuclear power. Naturally, these developments in the nuclear sector should take place in full compliance with international safety standards and rules, which exist in the four countries. They also must be investments that will enable us as an investor, because this is a novelty, this is the first time that EDF would be becoming an investor operator abroad, a strategic breakthrough that we currently implemented. But it means that these investments must be profitable, naturally.</p>
          <p>And thirdly and I repeat we wish to be welcome in these countries. In order to achieve this ambition the key challenge will be linked with the renewal of our expertise and skills. We recently announced a creation of the European Foundation for Tomorrow's Energy that will be dedicated to funding, teaching and research in the field of greenhouse gas free energies. We ambition to recruit 5,000 engineers over the next decade in order to support this growth in the nuclear sector.</p>
          <p>As you are seeing we are acting on the short and mid and long term in order to improve our operational excellence and we are investing to secure our long-term industrial growth, an industrial growth that will be sustainable. I have full confidence in EDF's ability to assert itself as the leader of tomorrow's energy.</p>
