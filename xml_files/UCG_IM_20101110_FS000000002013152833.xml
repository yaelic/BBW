          <p>Good morning. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Group Third Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Federico Ghizzoni, CEO of UniCredit Group. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, everybody. Before starting, a couple of communication, first of all, I am here with my colleagues Marina Natale, Roberto Nicastro, Paolo Fiorentino and Sergio Ermotti, that will support in case of questions at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>And then now the second communication, we are organizing for the 2nd of December in London, a seminar dedicated to CEE business, where we'll discuss in detail our CEE platform. So I would be pleased to invite all of you again at the 2nd of December in London. It will be a full day dedicated to CEE business for us is very strategic with particular focus to the main countries like Poland, Turkey and Russia. So I am looking forward to see all of you in the London, again, the 2nd of December.</p>
          <p>Also Karl Guha joined us for the meeting. So let's start with slide number four, executive summary. So the quarter comes with a net profit of 340 &#x2013; &#x20AC;334 million, up from &#x20AC;140 million in the second quarter '10, that would have been &#x20AC;310 million adjusted for goodwill impairment related to Kazakhstan, as you probably remember. Revenues are stable quarter-on-quarter, despite the third quarter seasonality, where we have seen a pick-up in the trading income that has offset the summer decline of commission and lower dividends and net interest, especially in retail and private banking business.</p>
          <p>Cost shows still positive trend with a minus 0.7% quarter-on-quarter despite a one-off in staff expenses. Net of this one-off, it would have been a minus 1.7% with still a good reduction in general cost and staff, where we see a decline of 689 FTE. Operating profit is up 1.1% to &#x20AC;2.5 billion with strong contribution from Central Eastern Europe, almost 11% increase; and CIB with 1.3% increase again offsetting the seasonal weakness of Retail and the Private.</p>
          <p>Good news on the loan provisions that are 4.8% lower, compared to the previous quarter to &#x20AC;1.6 billion. Cost of risk goes down to 117 basis points. Gross impaired loans are still growing, but with a lower growth pace. We are growing 2.3% and it is the lowest level since the second quarter '08. Total asset, a slight increase 1.5%, with loans stable. Important is to understood &#x2013; to note is that we have a 94.9% loan to direct funding, that means that we have a space to grow, should the recovery be coming in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>Funding and liquidity structure are kept at extremely comfortable level, very conservative level, thanks also to our solid customer franchise and our diversified access to market. Finally, Core Tier I is increasing 20 basis points to 8.61, driven by retained earnings and risk weighted asset decrease mainly in CIB.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to see more details, I will start with slide number six, as we can see, the main message we have in this slide, net interest plus net commissions shows a decline versus previous quarter, again it's the seasonality effect, but as you can see the decline is less than one year ago. In absolute term, the number year-on-year is improving. Operating expenses, once again, in a declining trend, despite the one-off I mentioned before, and the same in term of net write-downs on loans declining since several quarters.</p>
          <p>On the revenue side, again, net interest showing a moderate decline year-on-year; mostly due to trading related interest and increase on cost of funding year-on-year. Net fees reflecting summer season, but with solid growth year-on-year. Finally, trading income after a very poor second quarter, goes up to a very good results.</p>
          <p>Slide number eight, we have two points. Year-on-year as you see, Euribor is growing 18 basis points. We are now at 0.87. It is substantially the same level of one year ago. Net interest almost stable, we have a reduction of 3% loans. Nevertheless, we keep stable net interest levels due to re-pricing. There we have been I think very effective, and on the constant focus on optimizing the funding conditions.</p>
          <p>Quarter-on-quarter, there is a decline of 1.5%. It is a composition of higher Euribor that start to have a positive effect on our P&amp;L. It has been offset by lower trading related interest in market, and higher cost of funding due to the fact that we have &#x2013; we went to the market for some bank capital issue and we have improved &#x2013; further improved our liquidity buffer in order to have a very stable and strong position in this respect.</p>
          <p>Page nine; we split commission between investment services and other commission. The seasonality effect is mostly the first one where we have a significant decline, but once again, better than third quarter '09, more stable other commission with a slight decline of 2.3%.</p>
          <p>Cost, as I said, overall, trend is positive. We are in a declining trend. Once again without 38 million one-off in staff expenses, we would have reduced also here minus 0.6%, if there is a 1.1% increase. Other expenses showed a decline of 3.3%. It is quite good. Staying on the cost side, is very good, the trend in term of reduction of number of people despite of the fact that in Germany, we have hired 342 apprentices, still the number overall in the Group goes down to &#x2013; by 689 FTE.</p>
          <p>Important is to register that we have reduced 5,252 people year-on-year, and if we take the peak of number of people it was March '08, we have reduced almost 20,000 people. It's a number that we show for the first time, and I think is pretty significant. We'll have a particular positive effect as soon as the recovery will start again, so 20,000 people reduction since March '08.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to loan loss provision and cost of risk. So this is the fifth quarter in a row where we see declining trend. Quarter-on-quarter is minus 4.8%. We are now at 1.6 billion, and as you see on the right side, the overall cost of risk as well is improving from 122 basis point to 116 with improvement in retail in particular. CIB is slightly up in Germany and Austria, but is down in Italy.</p>
          <p>Overall CEE division is declining from 244 basis point to 203. Let's keep in mind when we refer to CEE division, we don't include Poland, if I remember correctly, but I have to ask my colleagues to check with Poland is around 165, 168 basis point.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, again asset quality. This is the trend of gross impaired loans, as I said is still growing, the total gross impaired loans, but with the speed that is much less than previous quarter's 2.3% increase, equally distributed in gross number for main loans and other gross impaired loans. And particularly, Italy that as you know is one of our major problem, is slowing down.</p>
          <p>Germany as well is coming with a significant decrease, mainly in NPLs and doubtful loans, and see same trend with decrease, especially in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, where we show significant increase in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Coverage, slide 14, is substantially stable, 45.2%, with some improvement in Germany that goes back to the level of December '09, increase in CEE mostly coming from Russia, Kazakhstan and Czech Republic, and slight decrease in Italy, but any case close to December '09 level.</p>
          <p>To be noted that the General Reserves are about &#x20AC;3 billion, representing 4.5% of gross impaired loans of 7.8% of NPLs.</p>
          <p>I think that this slide 15 is particularly good, the red line shows the cost of risk, as you see, from the second quarter '09 is constantly coming down. We are now at 117 basis points. The blue line is representing impaired loan additions, in terms of bps, also in this case as you see, we have a reduction quarter-after-quarter starting from the peak of the second quarter '09.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, shows the flow from performance to impaired loans, also in this case, I'm repeating myself, there is a decline in trend since second half '09, it is particularly positive. In particular, if you look at the reverse ratio moves from 52 first half '10 to 59 third quarter, 41 was in the second half '09. So a quite significant improvement.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look now to the work from operating profit to consolidated net profit. We start with an operating profit of 2,583 million. If you remember, it was 1% up. We have already commented the net write-downs of loans 1.6, 32 million, provision for risk and charges. The level of tax is still very high. Tax rate is 43.2%, mostly coming from Italy due to the IRAP effect.</p>
          <p>Minorities 122 million, of which 63 million Pekao Group, Zagrebacka, 13 million and 35 million HVB GACO. PPA 57 million at the end, we end up as we said at the beginning to a net consolidated profit of &#x20AC;335 million.</p>
          <p>Some comments about our balance sheet. Total assets increased 1.5%, mostly due to higher market and &#x2013; sorry, mostly due to hedging instruments rather than increase of loans. So loans are stable quarter-on-quarter. Tangible equity is slightly improving. Now we have tangible equity per share at 2.01% and the leverage ratio that is stable with a very solid 22.3%.</p>
          <p>Customer loans, as I said, substantially stable. I am looking to slide 19. We had actually negative effect due coming from FX. So in reality, since the Eastern Europe at constant rate shows an increase in volumes, but due to the FX effect becomes negative growth, overall stable, as I said.</p>
          <p>Customer deposits are increasing, and it's very positive the &#x20AC;11.2 billion of increase in direct funding that comes again from the deposit and securities issued. We have realized that September 82% of our funding plan, we have continued to go in the same direction and today we are at level of 96% of the plan realized.</p>
          <p>Trading assets slightly up. We have an increase in financial investments due to the need to invest our liquidity, having, as I said, loan book substantially stable, internet banking significantly down.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 is about again the structure of our balance sheet is a balance sheet driven mostly by customer driven. Our banking book is basically 76% of the total asset. As we said, we have very solid funding base and the position loans to direct funding 95% so give us space and flexibility to grow and to push on the loan side as soon as the demand will come back.</p>
          <p>Finally, the third quarter confirms our ability to access funding with very good condition. On top of the retail bond we came to the market during the quarter with 2.5 billion covered bonds issued on average price of 3 months Euribor plus 80 basis point.</p>
          <p>Liquidity position, slide 21, is extremely safe and conservative. Our internal rules is to keep structural liquidity ratio of 0.90. We are today at 0.99. Counterbalancing capacity is approximately &#x20AC;100 billion and there is substantially zero utilization ratio at this moment. So we have a very prudent net liquidity reserves also thanks to our customer base. So we feel to be very safe in this respect.</p>
          <p>Capital position, slide 22. As we said already, Core Tier 1 is increasing 20 basis point. We reach 8.61% with Tier 1 at 967. Regarding dividend, the accruals is in line with previous quarter. The growth in Core Tier 1 is driven by retained earnings and by risk weighted asset, it has slightly decreasing, no effects from changes of rules &#x2013; or Bank of Italy rules.</p>
          <p>Risk weighted asset again decreasing by minus 1.2%, especially in markets. Then slide 23, I think, quite important, is the estimation of Basel 2.5, Basel 3 on UniCredit Group. First of all, it is important to say, and everybody knows that it's difficult to have a definitive number, considering that some rules are not yet completely clear.</p>
          <p>Most important, I think is to understand what is UniCredit? So understanding our business mix and understanded that we have a structure are not exposed to the heaviest aspects of the new rules. We have a relatively small trading portfolio. We have a limited derivative business. We have no large financial stake portfolio; and once again, a very solid retail funding base, with a very prudent internal liquidity rules.</p>
          <p>Having said so, rather coming with precise numbers. Our internal estimation are telling us that considering the cumulative retained earnings by 1st of January 2013, and here we consider a consensus October 26 is equal to 140 basis points. So we consider that with this, with the commutative retaining earnings, will be sufficient to offset the full impact of Basel 2.5, Basel 3, even assuming no phase in and having a very conservative assumption on mitigation.</p>
          <p>In other words, under the current versions of the rules, UniCredit is already compliant with 2013 capital requirement. On top of now to the time of the adoption of Basel 3, we will have the possibility for further mitigation action that we are now analyzing and this provide, that will provide additional buffer to us.</p>
          <p>Few words now about the new structure. It has been approved October 26, as you can see, very simple structure with COO having as a direct report, CRO, CFO. We have two main business, one is CIB that will be managed by a Deputy General Manager. We have a General Manager as you know Roberto Nicastro that will be also directly responsible for retail private banking Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Asset Management reporting directly to me and Paolo Fiorentino responsible for the overall machine and for this has been appointed as a COO. So very simple structure with very important focus on the machine one side and the two main business CIB and Retail and Private Banking, what we call commercial banking.</p>
          <p>Finally, One4C that has been for us and this for us very important achievement. As you know, from the 1st of November, we moved from seven banks to one bank in Italy. The migration has been successful. We have not experienced any particular problem in the network and with customers.</p>
          <p>We have almost completed also the transfer of customers to the new segment. As you know, we have changed the threshold for corporate. It was 3 billion before is now 50 million. So we have families, individuals. We have SMEs up to 50 million and then corporate.</p>
          <p>And important, we have reach an agreement, as you know, with Unions to reduce by 2013, 3,000 people that will bring a benefit of &#x20AC;190 million to us. It is a very successful project, very complex, but implemented regularly in the 1st November this year.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude before going to the Q&amp;A. Summing up the quarter, so again, still difficult quarter affected by market condition not favorable. At the same time UniCredit maintain &#x2013; UniCredit franchise maintains remarkable strength from our point of view. First thanks to the diversification by geography and businesses.</p>
          <p>We still see a significant growth potential especially in Central Eastern Europe, as you remember in the presentation, in term of contribution to GOP is 11% in the third quarter. We have very healthy balance sheet after a deep restructuring. Cost efficiency is ongoing, still we have room to improve and definitely we have a very solid capital ratio and a solid liquidity ratio.</p>
          <p>The governance is now well-defined this puts us in the condition to work on our strategy with a strong focus also with a strong eyes on the simplification of the Group. In other words, we think to be in the position to improve our results in the future quarter. Thanks a lot and now we are ready for Q&amp;A.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me this is the Chorus Call conference operator. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Ms. Francesca Tondi of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Ghizzoni, good morning and good morning to everybody. A couple of questions here. I would &#x2013; I mean the first of all, a little bit of, your comment on how the funding situation is progressing. I know you saying margins in Q3, you were impacted by the issuance wise, what you have to <mark type="inaudible" /> particularly that is specific situation. How do you see the funding cost progressing, and how do you see your ability then to effectively bring that increasing cost, which we see for all banks and on to your client base, especially, in Italy I would be, you know, very interested in your comment there? And then a more general comment on your slide 26, in first bullet point, you say the results currently are still impaired with the difficult market condition, they do not reflect the full potential of UniCredit.</p>
          <p>I know that you've obviously been on board as a CEO only for a month, but you have been part of the management and part of this bank for a long time. From your &#x2013; so, I mean, a top down view, gut feel, where are the easy area or easy area, where you can work on that you think will help the group to achieve the full potential? This is not just a question of asset quality improving, the macro improving, interest rates moving in a big way, do you see the broad area of actions could be? And if you can give us also a quick update on the Pioneer sale, that will be great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first question was about the funding situation, as we said, we have completed our plan almost. Because today, we have done 96% of our funding base, also leveraging on the capability to get funding, quite good pricing. Then, may be Marina will explain more in details, what is the cost of &#x2013; what has been done in the expected cost.</p>
          <p>In term of passing cost to our client base, I think that in the last quarter we showed this capability, if you remember we have a decline of loans year-on-year, but this has not substantially being reflected on the net interest income. So I think that there is still space to go in this direction. And charging customer is not easy, but we have a space in Italy, but also outside Italy to continue in this direction. So repricing will continue maybe not with the same speed of six months ago, one-year ago, but definitely is an activity where we cannot give up.</p>
          <p>Marina now will give you more details about the cost of funding and then we will go to the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Cost of funding on the, during the third quarter, UniCredit increased the cost of funding mainly due to two specific insurances. So we issued the tier 1 and tier 2 and as a result, our cost of funding went up from 81 basis point over Euribor amounts to up to 158 basis point. So has been major to the remix and the type of the issuance and just as I understand you are asking also how is the cost of funding going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, progressively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, the &#x2013; we are already working and we have already developed the 2011 funding plan, and we think that we will manage to keep also at a higher level versus the levels given in 2010. But we will manage to keep cost of funding under control trying to work on the type of instruments. So we will leverage on a significant portion on &#x2013; of covered bonds, network bonds and the portion of bank capital will be limited in comparison with the other instruments. And as a result, we think that we will be able to keep a descent level of cost of funding and not to exceed in a significant way the one, we overall are experiencing for 2010, which stand at the level approximately of 80 basis points as of today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So from what you say, Marina, the margin, the cost of funding is going up, but you are confident that with the mix that you can play with you maybe able to offset some of the underlying increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Coming to the second question about potential of the Group, well, I think that looking forward, we have some benefits that can come from the external environment should the external environment improve. I'm referring mostly to the trend in term of rates, clearly, if we will have an increase of euro, Euribor will have a significant impact, positive impact on us, especially on the deposit side. As you know, we have only &#x2013; we are only partially hedged in this respect. We have been penalized in a descending trend, but we will have a positive effect should rates going up, significant positive effect.</p>
          <p>Another positive effect coming from the improvement of the situation is the cost of risk. We have been affected negatively by cost of risk especially in some countries also Italy, but we expect equally good improvement should the market condition coming back positive. Also the liquidity position that we don't want to change. In the case, it's very conservative and good and this could pass, again should the market improve. Internally, so we have a lot &#x2013; we have a lot to do.</p>
          <p>We have already started working on this in the past. We will present to our board our medium-term plan soon. I would say that without going too much, now in order &#x2013; in Italy, One4C is not only to cut cost. Reality, I am expecting from One4C stronger impact, positive in term of revenues. I want to remind that for individuals and SMEs up to 50 million turnover we are giving a lot of authority to the network in term of credit approval for example. We estimate that 90% of the proposal coming from customer will be approved locally. That means improving significantly the time of response to customers, it means in my opinion, if you are able to utilize this potential to have a significant positive impact in terms of revenues. Also for large corporate the credit process has been completed redesigned in order to have only one step between branch or customer, let's say, and the final decision maker.</p>
          <p>In Italy, still especially on the retail side, we are growing through a deep restructuring on the network side. We have reduced 600 branches in 18 months. We are decreasing actually our market share in term of physical network, but we are increasing our market share in terms of multi-channel approach, with a clear benefit both in term of revenues and mostly in term of cost. So overall, Italy, it is one of our key market with some problem, Italy will have to come with a turnaround already 2011. Then we have CEE, CEE is for us the area of growth. I read the past weeks some strange, say comments that I would like to reduce our presence in Central Eastern Europe. Absolutely not, it's not true, I would like and I want to see an increase of revenues coming from Central Eastern Europe. Clearly, we will focus on our major countries, where we have already a strong position like Poland, like Turkey, like Czech Republic, like Russia. So we will invest and we see future &#x2013; we see positive 2011. Just remind one number, the last we have seen Poland is expected to grow around 4% 2011 versus a 3% this year.</p>
          <p>CIB finally as well is not an area where we want to disinvest, opposite. I think that if we look the expectation the next few years, I think that CIB could grow more than retail. Retail will be under pressure until we see the current level of unemployment in Europe. So CIB is an area where &#x2013; that has to grow, including investment banking and thus in this case, I see a lot of potential in the Group including much larger penetration than something that we said we're already doing in Central Eastern Europe, where we have countries for example, Russia that for business are very important and significantly growing.</p>
          <p>So overall, I'm &#x2013; a lot of things to do, but this is the reason why we put the phrase, the sentence you mentioned before. Pioneer, the strategic review is ongoing. Now, we are checking, we have received some offers. We are checking which one of them is feasible, which one of them is meeting our expectation. So it's difficult not to say when and if the deal will be concluded, but there is no change the same &#x2013; same old strategy. So what has been declared six months ago versus Pioneer is still there. We are working on it, even though again, it's difficult to say what will be the end of the story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. But at least, you are still on track on that sort of disposing or reducing in there, in that area, if that is not...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, good morning, Mr. Ghizzoni and all your colleagues there. Many questions, but I'll limit just on one aspect really on asset quality on the numbers. On the provisions things are getting better, but if I look at slide 72 on your presentation, I see 2.2% increase and 18% increase quarter-on-quarter year-on-year on non-performing loans and then I notice 22% increase quarter-on-quarter on restructured loans. So the question is &#x2013; the first question is when can we expect that the peak of non-performing loans rather than a provision is going to finish?</p>
          <p>Second question, if you could give us a bit of color on this peak on restructured loans and also where the small increase in non-performing loans is coming from geography wise? And then a question on Pekao, I am looking that the consumer credit book is increasing quite significantly and it should be around 15% to 17% of the loan book, and the provisions are going up in Poland, but I see that the corporate side still remains very low 437 bps. So a comment there, is because the economy is going so well that you actually do not think that provisions on the corporate side will have to be higher or it's because the profitability of the Group is at the moment so low that you think when the profitability is going to improve, you would have more time to increase the coverage on the corporate loan book. So to just have a little bit of color on the better part of the loan book there, which is accruing solely the provisions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About asset quality, we will leave them to Karl to comment about the peak when it's expected. For restructuring loans just a general comment. I think that looking forward when we talk about recovery and restructuring, in my opinion we'll have to be even more effective in the sense that the contribution to the reduction in term of net provision is expecting coming from reduction of the write-downs, but especially in some countries Italy included, I think, we have to be more, as I said, efficient, effective in the recovery and the restructuring itself. So the peak will come, but also the &#x2013; due to the fact that we will go in this direction from a strategic point of view.</p>
          <p>Before going to Karl, Pekao, first of all in term of consumer lending in 2010, Pekao has given a lot of attention to this business, where we had an &#x2013; we were underpenetrated versus the natural market shares in loans. For example, if you compare six months ago, beginning of this year, consumer lending book versus mortgages, consumer lending was much less in term of market share versus mortgages. So we have seen big, say commercial effort in this direction. The coverage in term of corporate, no is not what you say. If you look the coverage of Pekao overall versus peers, I think that we have 15, 20 points higher than the second best, so by far Pekao is the most covered bank in Poland. Corporate, honestly, also due to the very prudent, let's say, policy of Pekao, we don't have major problem so far. So no substantial NPLs and this explain properly the coverage. But again, as bank in total we are by far the best in Poland.</p>
          <p>Going again to Karl to comment on the asset quality and when it's expected to peak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I have a question on strategy to you after. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. With respect to the question on peaking of asset quality, I think the first thing that's a little bit of tempting to say as to when it might actually peak. But the long and short of it is that you may recall in the direct one-to-ones in the sessions earlier this year, we had indicated that over a three-year, we expect 125 basis points in the portfolio on an annual basis. And what you do see is that, in fact since early part of the summer, that the actually migration is slowing down. In fact it's bottoming out and in fact it's actually improving.</p>
          <p>So the net-net of it is, how long will the credit lag, it has a tall &#x2013; it has a long tail. So it might take three, four quarters to completely move out. But that's not the point. The material point of it is that also the recoveries, which the dynamics is completely changing. So if you look at the ratio to net provisions to overall recoveries that should pick up. So if you look at the net effect, we're already beginning to see the &#x2013; have we reached the ultimate peak? No, we're heading in the right direction in terms of the recovery picking, what you will see in the coming quarters in short, is that the recovery pickup materially and the actually provision levels continuing to go down. And if you look at the trend, it's already down to something like 24 basis points if I remember correctly on top of my head.</p>
          <p>Let's see this, yeah, it is 24 basis points, which is come down. So effectively, the net addition that you see in terms of additions to gross impaired loans from its peak of 98 basis points, which was June of last year, we are down to 24 basis points. So that should be the direct answer in terms of directionally where you are heading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Then on strategy, you gave some color to, by geography area to the previous question, but what will really interest me is, number one, if you could share with us a few words which kind of mandate you've been given by the shareholders. You must have a lot of talks with the shareholders, how they want the group be shaped in terms of timetable of this happening. I am okay with Italy. I am mainly referring to the CIB. You said we are now going to disinvest. But you have half of your capital tied up in this area with very poor return.</p>
          <p>So either the capital location is wrong, or the business mix is wrong, or both, and I believe, probably there is a room to change the business mix there, divest certain businesses. I know it's early stages, but everything you could tell us today in terms of how you see the CIB business evolving, which kind of businesses you want to reinforce and which kind of businesses and geographies you want to exit, that will be really useful.</p>
          <p>The second point on area, which is very familiar to you, the CEE growth. I think you should, as you said, you should really put more capital at work there, but you should simplify because you got four or five countries which represent most of the revenues and the pre-tax profit. So I am actually one of the analysts which is saying not to lower the capital allocated there, potentially to increase it, but to exit the marginal countries, where market share is very low, pricing power is very low, funding is imbalanced. So would you agree with me that maybe over the next one of two years, probably one year rather than two, we might see actually UniCredit exiting three or four small marginal countries and I exclude the Baltics, where you have seven branches, so to me is a non-issue the Baltics?</p>
          <p>And also the final question here will be how you are going to do that. I strongly believe asset swaps among banks is going to happen. I would love to hear your views on this. And finally on Germany, can you tell us if in Germany you think you are going to stay there given that the market is at least the retail market continues to be structurally inefficient, or if you are politically compelled to stay there, but over the medium term that might be an area that you are looking to disinvest. Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Longer question, I try to be short in order to leave space also to other colleagues for their question. Broadly speaking in term of capital allocation, as I said, we are working on the finalization of our five years plan. But what I can anticipate is for sure we'll have a different mix of capital allocated among business and geographies.</p>
          <p>In general terms, the capital allocated to Central Eastern Europe will grow significantly and the capital allocated to CIB will decrease proportionally. Retail overall will remain stable. This &#x2013; that I mean that again the focus on CIB will decrease, it means exactly to go for a different mix of business with business less capital absorption, but contributing in term of revenues to the Group possibly even more than what is up to now. It is already good. Okay, so in term of capital allocation we will go for definitely a shift versus what is undertaken today.</p>
          <p>CEE as I said, if we allocate more capital it means that we want to go towards a growth pace. I am not excluding these investments from some countries. What is important anyway is first that to have a clear strategy in term of growth because for us this is the market of the future. Then again, I can agree that we have some complexity and we may also consider to disinvest something or to have a different activity in some countries. But again I will focus on the growth rather than just imputed investment.</p>
          <p>Asset swaps, this logic of growing and simplifying. We are also ready to talk with other banks for potential asset swaps. Even though, honestly speaking, up to now, we've not seen any concrete realization of ideas. But again, we have nothing against discussing with other banks in this respect.</p>
          <p>Germany, once again, we want to stay in Germany. There is no intention to disinvest from Germany, because it would be illogic in my opinion to leave what is the major economy in Europe and one of the fastest growing economy in Europe. We know perfectly that we have better scale in CIB versus retail. We're now working also with Roberto to define more effective retail strategy. But any case as a country, I think that we cannot leave or even thinking to leave Germany.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning to everybody. Focusing on the slide regarding Basel 3, you say, you are confident with the introduction of Basel 3, because your capital generation will absorb the impact of Basel 3, but my question is, where is the common equity ratio bar? I mean whenever you say you're confident, which kind of common equity ratio do you have in mind? Because one thing is the 7% of Basel 3, but on top of this, we might have &#x2013; if you buffer and for example, UniCredit is a 1 trillion asset bank and seems to me systematical important player. So I guess that 7% probably is a minimal level. Then, I have another question regarding the non-performing loans on &#x2013; in general terms, the bad loans.</p>
          <p>Maybe today CRO, if I can. Where do you see the normalized coverage of bad loans going forward? Because if I look at the group, and I look at the past, the bad loans were covered at 57% in 2007, so at the end of 2007, right now is 45%. So I am not saying that maybe you should be at 57 tomorrow, but maybe if you can guide us in order to understand which kind of improvement in terms of coverage we might consider.</p>
          <p>Then I had a question on the return on risk-weighted assets. If I annualize the return on risk-weighted assets for the first nine months of 2010, I have 29 basis points. My question is, how can you finance future RWA growth going forward with 29 basis points of return on risk-weighted assets, considering that maybe your core tier 1 ratio Basel 3 compliant might be 9%, not 7%?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on net interest margin at group level. Even this quarter, it is going down. I see, sorry, 281 basis points using end of period numbers, while it was 285 one quarter ago and the Euribor rates were up more or less 15, 20 basis points in the third quarter. So question is when can we expect net interest margin to start increasing? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the &#x2013; as you can see what we are highlighting in our presentation is that within that the consensus, so expectation on our earning generation will be enough to offset the impact of Basel 3, which means that the level &#x2013; we will remain at the level we are. You're right, we have the unknown element of <mark type="Inaudible" /> of the systemic risk. And we have &#x2013; only have hard reference point today the 7%, but this is, say, still work-in-progress and we are not in the position to assess the potential impact of CIFIC. But again the level we will be in 2013 as pointed out in the slide will be at least at the level we are today.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see today we are at 8.61% so in the north of 8.5% and we think that our earning generation or at least the consensus earning generation because this is what we are using will beat the ratio we have today. There is another element we are not embedding in our presentation for the time being is the full impact of mitigation. We are only considering a &#x2013; the small portion of mitigation, because we are still working in order to have a better assessment of the potential mitigation of the impact of Basel 3.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...follow-up if I can, which kind of organic RWA growth are you considering? Because if you say that organic capital generation will offset Basel 3, I am wondering how you can finance organic RWA growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was saying that the organic earning generation will offset the impact of Basel 3. And so I think that these, say &#x2013; and the mitigation will help us to do even better. So I think that this is what we can tell you today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is important to keep in mind that the page 23, substantially we have given you a ceiling that can be improved through mitigation actions. So rather than going for a number that maybe then has to be re-discussed, we prefer to have a conservative approach, saying that today without mitigation actions only assuming retained earnings consensus. We are already at a comfortable level, it can be improved. NPAs I think Karl.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I terms of, again, I think the question that you are asking is a very difficult one to answer on a generic level, because you have to look at the country and the portfolio, but I will try to answer it in terms of what should really be the normalized coverage ratio. The normalized coverage ratio across all of the impaired classes should be around on a consolidated basis roughly around 50%. So it may also laid between 47 and 50 and as the cycle improves you will see that automatically improving. But the key item to really focus on is the last item, which we call <mark type="inaudible" /> or what we just call them, the real, real impaired. And then there between what you have provided for and the collateral value that you have, you should have a close &#x2013; 100% or slightly above. So if you take the total stock of provisions we have taken, and the NPL in itself, we are at that number. So net-net I think that's the real essence of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the question about net interest income, when we can expect to increase. In reality, as I said, in the quarter, third quarter you have seen increase of 18 basis point in EURIBOR and this has been translated in the P&amp;L, if I remember correctly, we have more or less 60 million positive effect coming from that. But in the third quarter has been offset by non-recurring, let's say, items, mostly distress on funding, it was described before by Marina, with an additional cost, it has been &#x2013; it has offset the positive impact on &#x2013; coming from the increase of the rate.</p>
          <p>We had 35 million precisely, non-recurring items, 35 million of lower trade related interest and 20 &#x2013; and 16 million coming from the funding &#x2013; long-term funding activity done by the CFO, in order to improve the funding for the group.</p>
          <p>But again, we &#x2013; it works. So if we see rates going up, there is an immediate effect on the P&amp;L. Again, 18 basis points they were around 60, 65 millions. Risk-weighted asset return we know, it is one of our point of weakness. We know that we have to improve return on risk-weighted asset if we compare ourselves to some of the best peers. And definitely is one of the area of major focus for us looking forward, especially 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have three questions; strategy, management structure and capital. On strategy, it's a very straightforward one, do you think UniCredit needs to have access to some sort of in-house asset management manufacturing event for JV or can you just exit the business completely?</p>
          <p>On management and Group structure, if you can give us your rationale of the new organizational structure mainly on two points; the reason of moving private banking from the supervision of the management taking care of CIB under the management taking care of retail? And secondly, the implicit downgrade of the CIB division in the reporting line vis-&#xE0;-vis the other divisions?</p>
          <p>Finally on capital and Basel 3, if you can give us, let's say, the distribution of the impact between numerator and denominator that you have assumed, what you have assumed in terms of securitizations, and what are you assuming regarding the Bank of Italy stake and savings shares? Yesterday Intesa gave us quite, let's say, an aggressive treatment of these two specific items. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding, starting from the question about moving private banking from CIB to retail; it's not related &#x2013; it's only related to the fact that we think that private banking is &#x2013; should be part of what we call commercial banking. So we want to have a better distinction between networks; so commercial banking for us is individuals where we have retail and we have private banking and SMEs versus CIB should be focused on corporate and investment banking. It's also worth to say that also in the previous organization, Sergio Ermotti was responsible for two divisions, but separate. One was CIB and one was Private Banking. In any case, the focus on private banking is not going to be reduced.</p>
          <p>Then as well what you said CIB downgraded, it's your interpretation. It's not our interpretation as I said, I am repeating once again in our strategy, my personal strategy the weight of CIB has to grow rather than decrease, and so this is totally disconnected by the fact that we have a General Manager and a Deputy General Manager. We decided to have one General Manager in the Group, because the General Manager as you know has basically a double function; one is a position that has to support the CEO in the implementation of the strategies defined by the CEO and approved by the board, so it's a wider, let's say, position. Then we have two managers; one is the General Manager itself responsible for one business that is retail and private banking; and we have another guy will be a Deputy General Manager, but will be head of the CIB, and we report equally as it is for the General Manager to me. So our two businesses are this one and they are equally strategic. So I don't accept the fact that because there is a different ranking, there is a different weight or different attention given these two business.</p>
          <p>Then there was a question was about Pioneer Asset Management. So again, for us, Pioneer is not &#x2013; the reason why we are discussing is because of the need or the possibility to find a strategic partner for Pioneer, is because we think that Pioneer needs to increase its size in order to have better economies of scale. This doesn't mean that we want to give up entirely the asset management activity in the sense that as a product is key for our customers. So let's remember once again that we are a Group with 40 million customers. So we are the largest franchise in Europe and clearly, we need products like asset management to be sold to these customers. Then this will be done through Pioneer or with a different Pioneer, is a completely different topic. For us, it's important to find the best solution for Pioneer. It will be at this point also the best solution for UniCredit.</p>
          <p>The question about securitization, again, Marina?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On capital, I'm going to give only, let's say, one element for your analysis, which is out of the impact that we are foreseeing for Basel 3 today, within that slightly more than half will be due to risk weighted assets sold to CIB and CDR 3, while the remaining portion will be due to deduction. And about deduction, you were asking about saving shares, so we don't have the specific issue in <mark type="inaudible" /> and about <mark type="inaudible" /> stake. We do have and it's included in our deduction.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everybody. My question regards fiscality can you please tell us what you have included, if you did, in the third quarter on the Hungarian banking levy and more in general, what is your expectation for raising taxes in Austria, in Germany, in the U.K., and maybe in other CEE countries. I saw the comment on Italy, but I am more interested to know what you see as extra burden in 2011 from the other countries?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the four &#x2013; One4C project, you said 190 million net benefit from 2013, which is very good, can you please tell us what is going to be on the positive side, the fiscal benefit from the already made multi-mergers you did in Italy of the legal entities there, and on the other side, how much you expect to have to charge as restructuring charges for the layoff, you said, management had agreed with the trade unions? Finally, a small point, you charged only 30 million &#x2013; 32 million of risk and charges provisioning. You were previously running from 100 to 150 million per quarter and that amount is there some one-off there, what is going on? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Okay, about fiscality first, Hungary is the only country where this year we expect an impact. We had already 14.5 million booked in the third quarter, and total will be 28 million. So the difference would be in the second quarter. So in total 27, 28 million is the effect of Hungary to us. If you look also the performance of Hungary, Hungary is the only country we haven't seen that is declining in term of net results in the third quarter also due to this effect.</p>
          <p>For Austria and Germany, so Austria still discussion are ongoing. I met personally last week the Minister of Finance. So the range what could be the tax is not defined yet. Discussion between banks, insurance company, finance institution, governments are ongoing and also discussions inside government are ongoing. Anyway if we estimate the maximum impact for what we know today should be in the range of &#x20AC;80 million, &#x20AC;90 million again in 2011, because I don't think it will be introduced this year. For Germany, we estimate as well something around &#x20AC;120 million. In other countries as far as I am aware the only country is considering a tax introduction is Poland, but we had several assurances that will be very limited. In my opinion it could be also zero. We'll see. Other than Poland other countries...</p>

          <p>Once &#x2013; you had a question about FTE, One4C, as we said we have reached first agreement with the unions about 3,000 exits, including also 600 coming from the old agreement with Capitalia, and there is also &#x2013; this will impact on the synergies up to 2013. After 2013, there is second agreement in principal with them to discuss and order reduction. It is in the range of 1,100 people. So if we assume, sorry, the synergies coming from the first 3,000 plus the second 1,100, we reach the level that we have anticipated sometime ago in introducing One4C. The synergy to now &#x2013; today is 119 with the 3,000 included will go close to 300 including goals for the second wave of discussion for the 1,100 people. But this will happen after 2013.</p>

How much you think you have to charge one-off, and how much that will be offset by some fiscal benefits I guess, you are getting, from the multi-mergers of the legal entities?</p>

          <p>On One4C this year, we are going to have for sure some costs in relation to the transaction, let's say, the merger, we have some &#x2013; the severance, which will amount around 220 million. We will have gross. We'll have the tax impact of this severance and the overall negative impact will be anyway offset by the fact that we are going to have a positive impact due to goodwill deductibility from IRAP resulting from the merger of the legal operative, legal entity into the holding company. So as a result, we will manage to be positive rather than negative due to the severance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Better, yeah. On Basel 3, you said that you expect retained earnings to offset the impacts you kind of calculate for today. And you also say that you expect retained earnings or the consensus expect retained earnings to be a 140 basis point, which would make sure that 2012 Basel 3, Core Tier 1 will be at the level of today, so 8.6. So is it &#x2013; does it imply that you roughly see a 140 basis point impact from Basel 3 today, is that how I should understand this? The second question, could you clarify please the jump in risk weighted assets in retail Austria? It jumped quite a bit in the quarter, and on funding, you mentioned covered bonds, could you give us a bit of insight as to how big potentially cover pool is and how much <mark type="inaudible" /> covered bonds <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Basel 3, once again, first of all in term of retained earnings is a consensus, so that we have taken.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's not as internal, it's a consensus, the last one October 26. And in term of impact, our choice has been to give you as I said before, what is expecting from us to be the maximum impact that is basically 140 basis point. This number should improve thanks to mitigation actions that we are now trying to understand better. So we prefer to have &#x2013; to give to the market, let's put it this way, the worst case scenario and then working on improving the scenario. But already at this level we feel comfortable in term of capital. Then Roberto can talk a bit about Austria retail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the increasing risk-weighted assets in Austria is basically entirely related on the impact also on for cyclicality of the increase during the quarter of the average Forex rate of the Swiss Franc versus Euro related to the Swiss Franc denominated mortgage portfolio we have in Austria. In light of the trend that the exchange rate then from 30 of September onwards, we expect this to be reduced depending once again on the evolution of the rate in the next one month and half in this quarter. In the &#x2013; there will also be a reduction in light of some potential new instructions coming from the Central Bank on the calculation of the TD.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question was about, let's say, the part of assets we can use for covered bond there is not only &#x2013; it's not only the only driver as for the availability of assets, but also is the market appetite. So we cannot project we have the ability to project for the next year that we think to issue let's say we almost 7 billion, 8 billion of covered bonds. It will be let's say overall the collateralized bonds will be in the northern of 9 billion, but the split between covered and Pfandbrief and the other securitization will be function of the market appetite, and so let's say I am giving to you the order of magnitude, let's say up to 9 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's for next year, but one thing you probably can tell me, I mean, if you look through your book right now and you look at mortgages in retail, in commercial real estate, public sector assets that you can put and that you can use as collateral for covered bonds, how big is this in total?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Two very quick questions, the first one just to clarify your answer on the provision for risk and charges, just to be clear, should we assume that it's going to go back to the previous level and that this quarter was just the impact of the revocatory, clawback however you called it? Number two, the very quickly, if you could comment on the trend in CIB provisions that were up I think on the quarter. Just &#x2013; I just remember last quarter we talked about something that happened in Germany towards the end of the quarter. I mean, is that explained by any one-off there or this is a genuine deterioration there? And then last on page 19 the slide, where you talk about financial investment, so they have gone up, if you could a little bit explain is this a basically covenant bonds where you are parking liquidity, you're basically sitting awaiting for loan to pick up. Is this the way I should interpret this as a strategy? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question about risk and charge, I will follow-up since I was the last answering about it. Let's say &#x2013; let's put in the middle, we had some releasing good news in the last quarter, but may be bad news in the previous quarter. So you don't &#x2013; don't use the last one as run rate may be you have to look at both to project for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>CIB provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the provision trends in CIB. I think the overall picture is certainly getting better, but I think you need to break it down into component parts to get a better picture and a more accurate picture. So if you look at Italy, Italy is getting better, but it's still going to stay challenging for the next few quarters, because the intrinsic nature of that portfolio is such and the macroeconomic stage of recovery in Italy is such that the portfolio is going to be challenging throughout 2011. However, the main thrust of Italy, what is different from this year is going to be on recovery. And we're going to not only redouble the effort on recovery but that's &#x2013; what that means is that in effective terms the net should come down. But in terms of asset quality, it is still a challenge.</p>
          <p>The Germany, we have seen material improvements and I think there is nothing in the portfolio that would suggest that it is any different at this point in time. But unlike in Italy, the Germany, the portfolio is very different. You have large corporates and large names, so you have volatile swings. So when it's going the wrong way, you see large increases in one quarter. And when it's going the right way, you have recovery you see movements the other way. So this is the nature of the German portfolio.</p>
          <p>Italy is much smaller, I mean, I think the vast majority of the provisions that you're looking in the corporate is all sort of 15, 20 and it's quite &#x2013; 15, 20 million and quite widespread.</p>
          <p>Austria, I think net-net, it's absolutely heading in the right direction and I think you will see a continued improvement in that portfolio.</p>
          <p>Poland, that portfolio is actually in very, very good shape. There is nothing really to incremental to say or to add. So net-net, I think it's certainly getting in to the specifics of it.</p>
          <p>If you &#x2013; the other bit that I think in may become as an issue is that, whether you adjust the overall CIB and you adjust it with a so-called LPAC portfolio, which is the leverage finance, project finance aircraft and commodity finance portfolio, the net trend is certainly heading in the right direction. And Germany, which if you look at intrinsically again, is in positive territory actually as we see it and because of recoveries. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding financial investments, substantially we have invested part of the liquidity coming from the funding activity in the range of &#x20AC;10 billion in EU covering bonds and covered bonds, mostly from Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, Scandinavia and France, et cetera. This also in order to enhance our liquidity management and to straighten our counter balance capacity. It's clear that should, loans picking up, the liquidity will go also to the loans book.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just three short clarification, on asset quality, gross impaired loan formation this quarter was less than half the average of the previous five quarters, a very positive trend. It's a trend that somehow you see in Italy as well because we only have the group level. Then on Basel 3, if I try to back calculate the risk-weight asset increase, I come out with round 40, &#x20AC;50 billion increase in risk-weighted assets. Am I far from reality or that is number that makes sense.</p>
          <p>And then last point, we read recently several press articles about a potential tax litigation and potential fines for Italian banks related to all the tax optimization structure done between 2004 and 2007. When do you think you and us will have more clarity on this issue? And do you think this could represent a significant burden for the Italian banks? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the first question that you raised in terms of the gross impaired loans, and the addition, if you look at the Group consolidated, as I mentioned earlier, it's certainly trending down towards 24 basis points. The peak was last year in June, when we had 98 basis points. If you're looking at the Italian perimeter, we also peaked last year round June, when we were north of 100, I think 105, 106 basis points. And if you look at it now in terms of September, we're down to 31 basis points. So the trend is absolutely directionally heading down.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everybody. I've got few more questions on Basel 3, and other topics. With respect to Basel 3, could you give more detail on your expected risk-weighted assets inflation? I see on, I think the page 76 of your presentation that you've got risk-weighted assets at about 12 billion. How much do you expect that to inflate by on Basel 3? You've also talked about counterparty risk-weighted assets. And how much are they exactly as they currently stand? And how much do you expect those to inflate by, and presumably, in aggregate, the counterparty risk-weighted assets and the market risk-weighted assets inflate by about 40 million to 50 million has been previously commented.</p>
          <p>Secondly, what's &#x2013; can you give some sensitivity analysis for your net interest income for movements in EURIBOR? Obviously, EURIBOR is at about 0.85%. for &#x2013; that's for the one-month EURIBOR. So what would your quarterly NII be on a normalized basis, given EURIBOR at that level? And then thirdly, how worried are you about the strong appreciation in the euro with respect to Italian exports? Are you seeing some early warning indicators there that that might be an issue for your credit quality going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So starting from the second question, our assumption, our calculation is that each &#x2013; for each 100 basis point increase, EURIBOR, we should have a benefit in the range of &#x20AC;370 million. Regarding Basel 3, as we said already for the previous question, the expectation internal risk-weighted asset growth is in that range. Up to now, we don't have other major information we can provide. We are working on try to understand more in detail the rules supplemented to Basel 3. And we are working, as we said on the mitigation actions that we can put in place.</p>
          <p>To be honest, we know some of them. But before giving numbers, we want to be sure that they work. So we have activity in progress, let's say. I'm repeating myself once again. We feel comfortable with the number we are giving to you today. And we feel comfortable with the fact that this number can improve. Other than that, we would prefer to, do not &#x2013; we would prefer to not give you further information until we are not sure about numbers. This is our approach, maybe different from other competitors. But we feel it's more at the end fair and transparent to the market. So there was another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that was on your insights as to the impact of an appreciating euro on exports.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, the euro's appreciated a lot recently. Do you fear a negative impact on Italian exports? And are there any early warning signals that you see that maybe you might have a deterioration in your credit quality as a result of an appreciating euro?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say first of all <mark type="Inaudible" /> . Euro appreciation at this level doesn't show major problems for customers. Let's keep in mind we have a pretty diversified customer base. In Germany, I would say that 140 is probably the ideal level because of the quality of export of the German manufacturing. Italy is more or less in the same situation. Export in Italy is performing very well, is really the &#x2013; Italy is now the second, just to keep in mind the numbers, the second highest country after Germany in terms of export per capita. And export is growing. So we don't see in term of export negative effect at this level. It's clear that should the euro keep growing, this will cause some question mark. But this level is okay. In term of &#x2013; regarding Central Eastern Europe, up to now as well, we see some currencies linked to euro, like for example the Polish zloty or Czech Republic. But we don't see a big change versus euro itself. So they are following more or less the same path. Currencies like rubles are more linked to the dollar when you talk about import, export. So we have countries, euro based, but also several countries still dollar based. In term of effect on quality of loans, based on my experience in Central Eastern Europe, it seems strange but the volatility of the local currencies versus euro also on the retail side, where in some countries we have seen pretty high level of effects in mortgages, so far has not generated major problem. Actually in 2009 and '10, the level of NPLs in FX mortgage Central Eastern Europe has been lower than in local currency. So in summary, this level we are not expecting any deterioration in term of quality of risk and in term of negative impact on the business of exporters. Should go up and up, we would have to review this position clearly.</p>

          <p>Hi. I will be very concise. Two questions from me. The first one is on net interest income, which was very weak in the CIB division. There was a decrease of 100 million, if you can give us some description of what happened there? And the second one is on the commissions, which have been relatively weak in Italy. They were down 90 million, that's broadly in line with what we've seen with Intesa Sanpaol, but they held very well in the CIB division, and seasonally CIB division is weak in the third quarter, so where this strength is coming from? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So on the drop of NII, first of all, I think that the major driver was clearly the reduction on volumes compared to previous quarter, also the impact on higher funding cost and also a slight dilution in terms of margins charged to clients. In &#x2013; and yeah, that basically explains the situation, so is a mix of volume spread and cost of funding, and also then take in account the 35 million that were mentioned before, that were trading related NII activities that as you know we are &#x2013; every quarter, we have a little bit of volatility between the two lines. So 35 million trading related and the rest spread in volumes. I think that in terms of the commissions flows, I think as you know we have a &#x2013; geographically speaking, a different mix of businesses and therefore, making &#x2013; drawing a line between us and Intesa is not appropriate.</p>

          <p>Commissions, yeah, let me say that the drop in the third quarter compared to second quarter was more or less in line with the drop we had one year ago, because it's overwhelmingly driven by the typical seasonality. Now there are some may be minor differences. One of them has been a little bit of erosion in the DIFA, the commitment fee that we use once the maximum overdraft commission had been dropped. But for the rest, we are not seeing unusual drops in the level, and as a matter of fact, the weeks in September and in October are started again to go totally in line with expectations.</p>
