        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for attending Telef&#xF3;nica 2008 full year results conference call. Today I have with me Julio Linares, Chief Operating Officer; Santiago Fern&#xE1;ndez Valbuena, Chief Financial Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica, and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe.</p>
          <p>During the Q-and-A session you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to them. We have released today a very solid set of results in a more challenging environment, for highly diversified portfolio, proven execution of skills, and as our differentiated, integrated business model allowed Telef&#xF3;nica once again, to deliver on commitment, meeting or exceeding Group guidance on all metrics. A very strong performance recorded in Latin America has boosted our growth profile.</p>
          <p>We have fully exploited the organic growth potential in every single region of operations. And despite worsening economic conditions towards the end of the year, we have been able to maintain organic revenue growth, close to 7%, while OIBDA and operating income posted double digit growth rates well ahead of top line growth. At the same time, the high cash generation delivered shows our continued focus to enhanced efficiency. Finally, in 2008, we have further strengthened our solid balance sheet, leading to a very comfortable position that allow us to prioritize shareholder returns for the use of the free cash flow.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we have reported 10% of Telef&#xF3;nica <mark type="inaudible" /> market capitalization to remunerate our shareholders and we have recently announced a solid dividend increase for 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me now share with you the drivers behind this performance. Reported year-on-year growth rate are negatively impacted by the capital gains on the sale of Airwave and Endemol recorded in 2007. Changes in the perimeter of consolidation and forex movements. But the underlying performance of our business remains very robust. Organic growth rates aren't much across peers, showing a significant acceleration from top line to operating income.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth, in organic terms, reached 6.9% in 2008, but it is stable versus the first nine months' figure. Organic OIBDA rose close to 15% year-on-year compared to growth of 10% up to September, leading to a very healthy 13.7 organic OIBDA margin showing our ability to balance growth and profitability.</p>
          <p>Organic operating income growth rose close to 29%, 11 percentage points more than the Group recorded in the first nine months of the year. Net income reached roughly &#x20AC;7.6 billion, while operating cash flow almost doubled the figure and totaled &#x20AC;14.5 billion in 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 5, 2008 net income was below 2007 reported figures, but excluding the impact for an asset disposal in both periods and are proportional stake in the impairment charge taken by Telco on its investment in Telecom Italia, the bottom line boasted an outstanding 38% year-over-year growth.</p>
          <p>Reported fully diluted earnings per share reached &#x20AC;1.63, 41.4 more than in 2007 in underlying terms, reflecting the lower number of shares outstanding due to our active share buyback activity.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact from the purchasing price allocations, earnings per share were reached &#x20AC;1.78 in 2008. Reported free cash flow per share rose to &#x20AC;1.97 compared to &#x20AC;1.86 in 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me quickly review guidance for three months. In 2008, despite more frustrating conditions than we were anticipating, we had met by far all our growth targets for all the Group metrics. After adjustment for guidance calculations, revenue growth was 7.3, just topping the middle point of the guidance. OIBDA grew 10.6 at the top of the 7 to 11 target range, and we achieved our operating income target with a 20.4 year-on-year growth under guidance criteria. CapEx in 2008 was total in line with our full year guidance.</p>
          <p>Group diversification and subscriber growth pushes our results and that outlined on the slide number 7.</p>
          <p>Our commercial focus to fully exploit growth potential, mainly in mobile and fixed broadband, allow us to reach 259 million accesses at the end of December, 13% more than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Our operations in Latin America continued to drive our solid performance, contributing 60% of organic OIBDA growth in 2008, while our European operations, including Spain, contributed to nearly 50% of the growth.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 8, which shows the high conversion rate of top line growth into operating cash flow expansion. This is true not only for the Group as a whole but for every single region of operations. Despite pressure on revenue growth in Europe, a significant investment in overall market, we continue to capitalize efficiency measures as always and endeavor to manage OpEx and CapEx, increasing cash flow generation across businesses and geographies. As a result, organic operating cash flow growth rate reached 20.2 in 2008, 13.3 percentages point over the top line growth rate.</p>
          <p>Slide number 9 provides more color on the reinvestment in 2008. Total CapEx reached &#x20AC;8.4 billion in nominal terms, with a 4.7 year-on-year growth or 7% in organic terms, driven by a higher CapEx in Latin America to further expand our wireless network, both in terms of capacity and coverage as well as the <mark type="inaudible" /> of broadband and pay TV infrastructure.</p>
          <p>CapEx in Spain fell 7% with significant cuts in the last quarter of the year that evidences clearly our ability to retain control of our investment process. In Europe, CapEx <mark type="inaudible" /> are roughly &#x20AC;2 billion in 2008, most of it to build the high quality proprietary network in Germany. 77% of the Group CapEx was devoted to growth and network transformation project. This proportion shows that if trading conditions were to deteriorate in our market, we have ample room to maneuver and achieve our cash flow targets.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over the call to Santiago.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, C&#xE9;sar, and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. For the next couple of minutes, we would like to review our regional performance starting with Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2008, economic conditions further deteriorated in Spain, but our revenues declined just under 1% to leave a 1.5 revenue growth for the whole year, or 0.5 percentage points below our guidance. We have been able to cope with lower voice usage patterns and the market growth slowdown across businesses, thanks to our market leadership and our integrated approach.</p>
          <p>Integration efficiencies and cost management pushed up OIBDA growth to 7%, according to guidance criteria, just in the middle of our 2008 guidance. We have adapted CapEx to the current environment, and as a result, CapEx to sales ratio decreased almost 1 percentage point versus 2007.</p>
          <p>Better efficiency ratios led to a &#x20AC;1 billion increase in operating cash flow with a year-on-year growth above 14%. If we were to exclude all non-comparable effects in 2008 and 2007, operating cash flow growth would stand at a noteworthy 2.6% growth ahead of revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 11, let me highlight that revenue performance in the fourth quarter of the year was pretty similar to the one recorded in the previous quarter, excluding the Universal Service Obligation impact leading to a 2.7% top line expansion in wireline and a flat performance in wireless for the full year. Wireline operations growth trended down in the last quarter after Universal Service Obligation revenues were accounted for in the third quarter, and we noticed lower usage, but more costly voice products such as international long distance and fixed-to-mobile put pressure on traditional voice revenues that had raised 2.3 percentage points of revenue growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Internet and broadband added 1.2 percentage points to revenue growth in the quarter, as total market growth decelerated through the year. Wireless revenues remained flat in 2008 mainly impacted by regulatory measures, while customer revenues added 0.0 percentage points to revenue growth in 2008 or negative 0.2 percentage points in the fourth quarter affected by a lower year-on-year customer growth as a decrease in outgoing ARPU, incoming revenues subtracted 1.5 percentage points from revenue growth in 2008 and 2.2 percentage points in Q4. Due to the cumulative 17% cut in mobile termination rates and lower wholesale roaming tariffs.</p>
          <p>In slide number 12, we analyze wireline operating performance. Fixed telephony lines declined 3.7% year-on-year. Let me highlight that 83% of the lines lost remain as Telef&#xF3;nica's wholesale lines, and, as such, continue generating revenues for the company.</p>
          <p>We added 0.6 million retail broadband lines in the year to reach 5.2 million, maintaining our market share around 57%, with a solid broadband ARPU performance declining less than 4% in the year. In the pay TV market, we are capturing most of the modest market growth, increasing our market share up to 14%. Approaching the high proportional double and triple-play bundles, total wireline ARPU went up 3.4% to &#x20AC;69.5 in 2008.</p>
          <p>In wireless, during 2008, we focused on the higher value segment to reach 23.6 million mobile customers, up 3.4% versus December '07, driven by the good performance of the contract segment, which increased 6.8%.</p>
          <p>Churn is key. Even moreso in a highly penetrative and competitive market, and we have been able to, in 2008, to contain it at 1.9%. Quarter-on-quarter ARPU trend improved along the year. In Q4, the year-on-year decline only increased by 0.3 percentage points, driven by the improved performance of outgoing voice ARPU. We continue to monitor usage performance very closely to see if this trend is here to stay.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight this pushing data revenues fully driven by the outstanding performance of connectivity revenues, up 65% both in the year and in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me now continue with a review of our operations in Latin America, where we are successfully managing growth, transformation and profitability. 2008 results were very robust, allowing us to exceed all our guidance for the region. During the last quarter of the year, we continued posting a very strong revenue organic growth close to 13%, in line with the performance recorded after September with Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Mexico as its main contributors.</p>
          <p>The outstanding top line performance and enhanced efficiency levels led to a ramp up in OIBDA growth during the last quarter of the year, with a significant margin expansion, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. The OIBDA margin reached over 41% in the fourth quarter of '08, more than four percentage points above the margin recorded after September. Despite strong CapEx, operating cash flow topped &#x20AC;4.4 billion with a remarkable 22% year-on-year increase in organic terms.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, we outline our Latin American wireless businesses. In 2008, we showed very healthy customer growth across markets with double-digit rates in most cases. Penetration in the region reached 82% by year end, 13 percentage points above December 2007. We ended 2008 with more than 123 million mobile accesses in the region, an 18% organic increase versus a year ago. Mexico has now become our second largest market in Latin America by mobile customers.</p>
          <p>ARPU performance stood stable versus the first nine months of '08 impacted by the strong customer growth and lower mobile termination rates. Initiatives to foster usage drove outgoing minutes of use up 14%, leading to a 1% organic growth in outgoing ARPU. Data revenues kept growing at a strong pace, north of 36%year-on-year with still a very high potential.</p>
          <p>We delivered outstanding margins in the fourth quarter of the year showing an OIBDA margin expansion of close to seven percentage points compared to cumulative September figures as we leveraged further commercial efficiencies and scale economies.</p>
          <p>In wireline, we are accelerating the transformation of our operations. In 2008, we pushed broadband and Pay TV through bundles promotions already representing 49% of our GSL accesses, which reached 6.1 million or a 20.5% increase on an annual basis. It is worth to highlight the growth recorded in Columbia doubling last year's figure and the sustained increase in Argentina and Brazil.</p>
          <p>In Pay TV we continue to gain momentum with close to 400,000 net adds in the year.</p>
          <p>The higher adoption of double and triple-play offers drove total wireline revenue per access up 6.4% year-on-year in constant terms in 2008, ramping up from the growth bridge of September.</p>
          <p>The transformation of the businesses is shown in the increased contribution of internet and TV revenues to total revenues that ranked at across the region 18.6% were in advance of 3.5 percentage points over 2007.</p>
          <p>Let me also highlight profitability levels with OIBDA margin stabilization around the year reducing the year-on-year decline to a 0.6 percentage points in 2008 versus 5.6 percentage points in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On the next slide let me review our main operations. In Brazil, 2008 results recorded higher growth rates than in 2007 on the back of very solid performance at both Telesp and Vivo.</p>
          <p>Telesp posted a strong line expansion along the year ramping up to close to 11% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, 3.2 percentage points more than in the first nine months of the year with an improved trend in quarterly OIBDA margins since the beginning of 2008.</p>
          <p>Vivo reaffirmed its market leadership with a very strong commercial activity in the fourth quarter. The remarkable operating performance led to a 16% annual growth in outgoing service revenues in 2008, ramping up in the last quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Revenue evolution coupled with higher efficiencies resulted in a 22% annual organic increase in OIBDA in 2008, expanding margins by 2.1 percentage points.</p>
          <p>TASA also delivered very positive results with double-digit revenue growth in local currency in 2008.</p>
          <p>In terms of profitability, the OIBDA margin reached 34.4% practically flat versus the first nine months of 2008.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, we have strengthened our competitive position. With more than 15.3 million customers, we already have an estimated 19.5 market share. Outgoing service revenues increased 38% in local currency versus 2007 while the economies of scale and better efficiency ratios led to an annual OIBDA margin of 25.7%.</p>
          <p>The OIBDA evolution in the fourth quarter was outstanding, doubling the amount reached in the same quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>To sum up, Latin America as a region presented a year of very healthy growth, with a performance recorded in the fourth quarter being stronger than in previous quarters. We delivered solid top line performances in most markets of operation, driven by double-digit growth in mobile outgoing service revenues in most cases and notable year-on-year growth rates in broadband and TV revenues.</p>
          <p>OIBDA growth was also strong across the region, leveraging on efficiency measures put in place last year that are paying off this year.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to slide 19, we show that Telef&#xF3;nica Europe has delivered the strong set of results in 2008, successfully meeting all financial targets. Revenue grew almost 6% in the year in line with the performance of the business in the first nine months.</p>
          <p>OIBDA growth, close to 5% for the year, stood at the high end of the guidance range overall maintaining margins over 2007 on the back of a more focused commercial approach across businesses and efficiencies being achieved at the Group level.</p>
          <p>As a result, operating cash flow achieved &#x20AC;2 billion in 2008, leading to a sound 31% growth on an organic basis and 7% on a like-for-like basis.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 20, Telef&#xF3;nica O2 UK outperformed again the U.K. mobile market in financial and operational metrics, thanks to a consistent focus on delivering against customer needs which has been rewarded again with the best contractual rate in the market and confirm that the clear leader in customer satisfaction in all categories.</p>
          <p>Commercial activity was strong in the year,6 with prepaid to contract migrations improving customer mix and proposition so it's a simplicity, the iPhone and the refreshed mobile broadband being amongst the main drivers for contract customers growth.</p>
          <p>Total ARPU showed a 1.4% year-on-year growth in local currency in 2008 and a decline of 1.7% in the quarter, as improving customer mix towards contract is not compensating the year-on-year declining voice ARPU, reflecting the more optimizing and budget-conscious behavior from customers.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenues showed a healthy 8% year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year, with increasing contribution of non-SMS data revenues.</p>
          <p>As revenue performance comes with normal level of customer acquisition costs, leading churn rates and import deficiency, the whole equation is positive in terms of OIBDA generation throughout 2008, plus 9% year-over-year growth on a like-for-like basis reaching a 26% margin in 2008.</p>
          <p>In Germany, the business continued growing in a more competitive and overall smaller market with 1.7 million net additions in the year with a significant contribution of 0.9 million from partners.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, Telef&#xF3;nica O2 Germany returns to positive mobile services revenue growth and still positive taking into account the like-for-like effect of mobile termination rates in the month of December, as the business had successfully built on its foundational strategy. Network infrastructure is on track, distribution network is ahead of the target with 805 retail shops open so far. Migration of customers from legacy to new tariffs already completed. And a new commercial approach was launched in the fourth quarter towards a new and more efficient acquisition concept and the increasing contribution from SIM only tariffs which had an encouraging start in the direct channel which drives the seven percentage point year-on-year margin increase seen in the quarter in like-for-like terms.</p>
          <p>In summary, an enhanced performance towards the end of the year, both in terms of growth and profitability. Let me also mention that the operations in the rest of our European geographies are improving year-on-year trends in the fourth quarter notably the fixed line business in the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our financial profile, on slide 22, I want to highlight how we continue improving on a few points. The first key point is that we have been able to make compatible and enhanced shareholder remuneration with solvency improvement which was considered essential in the current environment.</p>
          <p>Our leverage ratio has been reduced by 0.4 point to place our net financial debt at 1.89 times OIBDA as of December. When adding our cash commitments to the financial debt, the ratio stands at 2.02 times within the low part of our goals. Our progress in these fields has been acknowledged by three rating agencies in the last quarter of 2008. Fitch, Standard &amp; Poor's and the Japanese agency JCR upgraded our ratings to A minus or A, and in the first quarter of '09 Moody's upgraded the outlook to positive. These upgrades paved the way for improving our maturity profile in early 2009 to the issuance of a 2 billion bond and by agreeing with the banks the option to extend &#x20AC;4 billion of our syndicated loan facility maturing in 2011 will bring 50% one year later and another 50% two years later.</p>
          <p>As such, our average debt line now achieves six years with an increase of nearly 0.4 years due to the refinancing which is longer than the time we need to fully repay it.</p>
          <p>The second point to highlight, are the results of our financial management. Our foreign liability, our foreign exchange liability mix has been the major contributor to debt reduction as the depreciation from the pound and the Latin American currencies in 2008 led to a &#x20AC;2.1 billion savings in the value of our debt when measured in euros.</p>
          <p>And finally we slightly beat our 6% target for our financial expenses which finally stood at 5.95% of our average total debt despite very difficult market conditions throughout the year. Let me now hand the call back to our Chairman.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Santiago. Let me run you through our 2009 guidance which clearly aligns our focus on maximizing operating cash flow generation. All through all this time we have decided to provide only Group guidance. Telef&#xF3;nica continues to be a benchmark in the industry in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> with the market. Our 2009 guidance assumes tough economic conditions in the European market while we expect Latin America to outgrow most markets worldwide, despite showing a deceleration compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Group revenue is expected to grow mainly driven by <mark type="inaudible" /> expansion in Latin America where the growth potential both in mobile and broadband is still on track and further revenue growth at Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. We anticipate consolidating OIBDA to go up between 1 and 2, 3% in 2009, leveraging our flexibility to manage OpEx, economics of scale and the benefit of an integrated management model.</p>
          <p> Both our CapEx should be below &#x20AC;7.5 billion in 2009 which <mark type="inaudible" /> year-on-year increases <mark type="inaudible" /> against most of the CapEx will be allocated in Latin America. As a result, operating cash flow is expected to reach an outstanding year-on-year growth in the range of 8 to 11%. Market conditions change across regions leading to different regional priorities, which are base outlined on slide number 24.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we aim to maintain our leading competitive position, focusing on commercial airports on customer loyalty for the rational approach. In a difficult environment, our primary focus will be on operating cash flow on the back of <mark type="inaudible" /> measures.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we've been working to maintain our performance in the U.K. While we will capitalize for enhancing their work in commercial platforms to further grow our business in Germany. Growing operating cash flow across markets to enhance profitability is a priority for the region.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, our commercial push will focus on capturing additional growth potential both wireless and broadband while we aim at further expanding OIBDA margins and increasing our operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>In summary, we are totally focused on a submitting our strategy to fully exploit our organic growth potential in those markets that keep growing and to maximize cash flow generation in others where trading conditions in 2009 are more adverse.</p>
          <p>The slide number 25 shows some examples of the actions we are already taking to sharpen OpEx and CapEx efficiency initiatives. <mark type="inaudible" />, but the message I want to press is that despite being an industry benchmark in terms of the profitability there are several areas where we can clearly enhance our performance and we are already working on them.</p>
          <p>Our confidence in preserving our <mark type="inaudible" /> generation profile is proven by the continuous delivery of very attractive shareholder versions. In the past, we have stated that our first priority for the use of free cash flow was our shareholders' remuneration and it continues to be so. As our remaining ambitions are very, very limited and focused on markets where we're already present and there is no need for further deliveries.</p>
          <p>In 2008, combining dividends and share buybacks we reported &#x20AC;6.3 billion or 69% of our free cash flow to shareholder remuneration. And for 2009, we have already announced the proposal to increase by 15% the dividend per share to &#x20AC;1.15. While we might use share buyback programs tactically to further enhance shareholder returns. Our current dividend yield is 8.2, which is in my view is too high for a worrying company. We are currently ranked among the top 20-50 companies in the world and in market cap we are ranked number two by dividend yield and we are ranked number four by free cash flow yield. Why? We are showing a strong earnings per share and free cash flow 20% growth for the coming year, as we are going to see it in the next slide.</p>
          <p>And now let me &#x2013; now explain a few words on our earnings per share and free cash flow per share 2010 targets, which have been subject to increasing sufficient yields our 2008 hasn't followed.</p>
          <p>In a weakening environment, and a sudden and significant depreciation of the real and the pound, have led many investors to think that these targets are not achievable. We have a highly diversified portfolio and proven executional skills. In a weakening environment the starter of or efficiency excellence we become in the moral sensed in the outlook, we are more conservative on capital environment we are in.</p>
          <p>We continue to operate in a very resilient industry, relatively separate from cyclical pressures and we continue to investigate the cost on land in fact the fullest environment to a foreign exchange policy &#x2013; pricing policy.</p>
          <p>However, in order to assess the impact of extrapolating good and economic weakness, our specific trading outlook in the specific policy through the end of 2010, we have run a stress test that will indicate this is the same point.</p>
          <p>We still get to 2.1 earnings per share and &#x20AC;2.50 free cash flow per share under this scenario. And let me state clearly that we are not changing our targets, but testing our results under extreme conditions.</p>
          <p>Nowadays when other companies are not providing the stability either on the short or medium term, Telef&#xF3;nica continues to commit delivery on 2009 and 2010 goals and we take guidance very seriously. Since we started to provide Group guidance back in 2003, we have never missed it. In my recent motive analysis even under the 2010 stress test scenario so in my opinion is this kind of sight or a stock offer at current prices.</p>
          <p>To recap, capitalizing on a strategically diversified asset portfolio, execution is key. An integrated monetary model, we continue to show a decent profile in the industry. Combining organic growth, growth with finance acquisition and a strong free cash flow analysis, we have once again fully delivered on our Group commitments.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we are giving absolute priority to cash flow. We still are diversifying the Group opportunities we see in our markets, mainly in Latin America. We are fully committed to offer very attractive stockholder's repense We have a sterling track record of execution and I am sure we will deliver a strong personal month even in these adverse economic conditions styling the current or more given its stronger and more competitive than ever.</p>
          <p>Under the current circumstances, we aim to be one of the most reliable companies among the top 50 large companies worldwide.</p>
          <p>Before starting the Q&amp;A I would like to invite you all to our seven investor conference which will take place in Madrid, next October 8 and 9 which I think is going to be very interesting. Thank you very much for your attention and now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Luis Prota from Morgan Stanley. I have a question on the extreme scenario that you are describing in the last slide. You could elaborate a bit more on the assumptions behind that, whether you are using a spot rate for Latin American currency or you are expecting a further devaluation? And also what are your assumptions in terms of GDP slowdown, you are looking at the same conditions today or you are expecting further deterioration?</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be on domestic mobile, did you see further pressure from increasing churn in 2009 and what could be the impact on OIBDA margins in that, in this year? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Luis. This is Santiago. Let me give you some color on the extreme scenario on the stress test. What we have done is we have used 2008 average exchange rates and subjected them to a closer board, 10 to 20% depreciation assuming that the euro starts, that's the FX part. And I'd rather not be much more specific about which currencies might fly more than the others. In terms of GDP we have just extrapolated the current trading environment, which is one of negative growth. We assume that we are going to continue for the next four quarters, I am sorry eight quarters, the way we have been in the last two. And I emphasis this because the extreme weakness is not a one year event, it has been a two or three quarters event.</p>

          <p>This is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding the question on domestic mobile churn. Well as you know, we defend very well in 2008 the churn. It went up from 1.8 total churn to 1.9 in full year. Last quarter it is 2.0 so there is a slight tension on churn. But this is still best in class compared to any other operator in Spain and to many others in Europe. As you know, we mentioned in the qualitative priorities, is one of our priorities customer loyalty, and we'll keep a focus on that. We aware a hard time, but is one of our key priorities. And again our focus is operating cash flow and that will be the priority, no?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Brian Rusling at Cazenove in London, two questions. The first one is why didn't you complete the share buyback by the end of last year and has it now been completed?</p>
          <p>The second question is really for Matthew. In the English press release for O2 Europe, you refer to the German operation and you talk about 2009 and you say that the plan is to deliver over OIBDA margins that are on a par with the UK. Does that mean we should be expecting 27% margins in Germany for 2009?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Brian, it's Santiago, again. Let me take the share buyback question. What we decided at the end of the year was that the cause's top price was recovering, but we couldn't be sure that the recovery would be the final one. We would rather save a few million shares of the buyback program and extend it on the first quarter of 2009. Unfortunately, for our share price, that's exactly what happened and what we have been doing over the past couple of weeks as the year started is complete it. Just a few million shares remain to be executed and they will be so in the next week or two.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian on Germany, I think you're actually referring to a comment that says the 2008 quarter 4 margin was inline with the UK. And that was designed to highlight the acceleration in our OIBDA margin in Germany in Q4. Clearly, for 2009 we are not guiding on margin by specific businesses. But it's just to highlight the fact that we drove profitability very hard in Q4, 2008.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Jesus Romero from Merrill Lynch in London. I had a question regarding the level of debt. You highlighted that there is no need to de-leveraged further, should we assume therefore that two times EBITDA should be de-levered going forward? And perhaps we should expect the year buyback?</p>
          <p>And then the second question was on CapEx. Are you including in the 7.5 billion of lower CapEx number any investment in spectrum in Mexico? And if you can say when do you expect this spectrum in Mexico the auctions to take place, please? Thank you.</p>

          <p>This is Santiago again. Let me take that question. We think we are in comfortable territory at about two times net OIBDA. Our small tax expected to increase. We would expect not to have to exercise any pressure on the absolute level of debt. That certainly when we meet our expectations for cash flow should free up as the year progresses and not a significant amount of cash flow that will be reported, as the first priority as explained by the Chairman, to shareholder remuneration.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's David from Deutsche Bank in London. A couple of questions on the outlook for mobile pricing. I think both for yourselves and Vodafone have alluded to lower prices in domestic mobile to support market share. Can you give us some sense of how those price reductions, whether they have already been put into the market? How the market is reacting perhaps in Q1? Or if not, what are your plans are? And then following that, I think I noticed fixed broadband ARPU down a little faster in Q4. So should we be expecting similar pressure on that price? And just very finally as an outside question, Venezuela CapEx looked very low around about the 10% of sales market. In maturing lifetime markets is that the kind of level we should be looking at now? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding mobile pricing, two things. Of course in this type of environment there is some segments of the population that might be a little more price sensitive. So &#x2013; and of course all the companies will be focused on retaining customers and that might or not lead to some price efforts but we do not want to enter any price war and our focus is not market shares in terms of lines, it's market share in terms of value.</p>
          <p>So for me it's much more important to retain a large corporate line than a residential line. And of course we will continue focusing on having a very strict policy in terms of admitting customers, especially managing the insolvencies, which you know is below 1% of our revenues, it's a very good number. And also, we will keep the same strict policy regarding measuring the activity of prepaid lines, which is not the case in other operators. So for me it's value market share &#x2013; and pricing is a tactical too, l but we will not enter and follow any price wars.</p>
          <p>There will be some segments that we will be looking for savings, but also savings is control. Many of our customers are turning to us to buy more flat rate and to &#x2013; so they have more predictability of their expenditure. We welcome that and we'll foster that, but we will not do any crazy thing, we will focus on value creation.</p>
          <p>Regarding fixed broadband, let me tell you the following numbers, I think ARPU &#x2013; ARPU in terms of revenues per customers in the broadband were in my opinion, pretty stable. We have created in the first quarter of 3.9%. Again a little bit more decrease on connectivity and the rest is compensative value added services, but compared to other quarters is a small decrease. Third quarter was 3.4, the fourth quarter was 3.9, so you have got some smaller duration on ARPU but not that a significant change in this model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Taking the question on Venezuela CapEx figure, I mean first of all Venezuela is not yet a mature market, it keeps growing and it keeps growing very nicely. In fact, even at the beginning of the year, it's growing very, very significantly. So I don't think it's a mature market. And in fact, I don't think that you should stop at this 10% CapEx on sales figure because remember that we just deployed few months before during the year of 2007 and in 2006 a brand new GSM network and now we are starting to deploy there the 3G network. So first I think that Venezuela will keep growing and second I don't think that you should consider 10% as a benchmark for growing market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just on the margin, I think the Q4 mobile adds were around about 5 million or so. It does look like the rate of additions are slowing a little. The margin was very strong. Should we continue to expect margin growth in the mobile business above 40% &#x2013; 35%, 40% levels or where should we be looking on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the slow that you are referring has much more to do with less handset subsidies than other things. In fact, the exchange implies that most of the operators are reducing handset subsidies and that's having an impact on the growth but not on the traffic or on the usage. And in terms of guiding, we are providing guidance by regions or by operating unit, but I think that as the German has been stating on the slides, we keep looking for growth both in terms of top line and in terms of efficiency.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. On the wireline side in Spain, the unbundling has increased quite a bit in Q4. Can you talk a bit about who is actually driving that and whether you expect the increased rate of line losses in Q4 to continue into 2009? And then secondly, what does your guidance assume &#x2013; the 2009 guidance assume for mobile terminating rate cuts in Spain and also in Latin America? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding fixed line loss, we lost in the year 592,000 lines. We have &#x2013; we do have the information about if those lines that were lost are wholesale lines are continuing having traffic with customers, with the server operator and our current estimation's 82%, 83% again of these lines are still wholesale lines. That means that we don't count in as lines but they are still wholesale lines, also we're having some ARPU a little before and so on.</p>
          <p>So in order to understand what is going on in Spain in fixed line, there are three effects if you want. One is that this migration from other forms of wholesale connectivity to unbundling or to the nature unbundling and the something that are new &#x2013; there are some new regulatory figures in Spain and that has forced to a net migration from other forms. Who is profiting from this? Well many players like Orange, like Vodafone Telefonia and All UV just tell which is also doing a lot of full unbundling. The second factor could be competition on direct taxes, that's not that relevant, but we do lost some customers to other operators that has like cable operators. Not relevant, but it's the second factor. And the third one as you can imagine is market deceleration.</p>
          <p>So this 83% of wholesale lines that we are keeping from the retail lines, I guess it will start slowly going down because market deceleration would have more and more relevance. So it's a combination again of lines but also what ARPUs are driving this.</p>
          <p>So going forward, the trend will be tough because the regulatory figures will continue to be there and the market is not growing as a total. We will try to retain as much retail customers as possible and as much as wholesale customers as possible as usual.</p>
          <p>Regarding mobile termination rates, the glide part is finishing and the regulators have to define a new part. We are expecting some continuity in the park, north of the a decrease obviously in the mobile termination rate, but in a similar pattern as the one we saw in the last two years. So a continuous pattern, not to the second one. Taking the question on MTR's in Latin America, most of the progress are already public information, the latest one being Chile very recently, are embedded in the figures that we are contemplating for 2009. Let me add that the exposure in terms of OEDAs net of revenues and cost to (50.27) interconnection to be introduced in Latin America. The bigger one being in Brazil and remember that in Brazil for this year 2009 and part of 2010 it has been <mark type="inaudible" /> operators and therefore no changes should be expected during 2009. So I guess that for MTRs the situation has become much clearer in Latin America as of today.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Chris Alliott. A couple of quick questions on Germany if I may. Firstly you described a new commercial approach in fourth quarter, I wonder if you could add some flesh on the bones of that.</p>
          <p>And the second question related I guess, I wonder if you think that the expansion of the EBITDA (51.21) margin is sort of more sustainable going forwards, rather than you sort of holding back from the market in the fourth quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. Let me, I will just talk about what happened in Germany and what drove our profitability in the fourth quarter, just to give you a bit of a view about OIBDA margins and also illustrate the new commercial approach at the same time. So the first thing that happened was as we said, during 2008 what we have done is continue to build our foundations.</p>
          <p>We have now got our network to a place where our reliance on T-Mobile for roaming is reducing every quarter and that will continue through 2009, such that by the end of 2009 we won't be relying on them for roaming. Secondly, we have continued to develop and expand our direct retail capability and in Q4 we did a higher proportion again about connections through our direct stores which actually meant clearly that the cost was lower to the P&amp;L as there wasn't so much indirect throughput.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, the market was smaller in Germany in Q4, which we have seen across European markets. And the real push we did in Q4 was we shifted our propositions to SIM only away from handsets effectively to give the customer value in the tariff as part of the SIM and not subsidize the handset so much so our proportion reduced. So those four elements drove our profitability back to <mark type="inaudible" /> change in terms of commercial approach clearly on specific OIBDA margins. I wouldn't want to guide for Germany for 2009. But just to say that we are extremely happy with the foundations that we've built and we think we can drive on to further growth in Germany now.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Terence Sinclair from Citi. Can I ask three questions please on the CapEx reduction in forecasting 2009. First of all, am I right in thinking that the bulk of those CapEx cuts can come from Spain and <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Secondly, obviously lower CapEx feeds through to lower depreciation, which helps to reach your EPS targets. Is there any change in asset life that we should be aware of? And finally connected with the same thing, in terms of the cash flow guidance you've reiterated to 2010. Is there anything we need to know in terms of the payment timing on tax?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Terry let me &#x2013; it's Santiago &#x2013; this is Santiago. Let me take the cash flow question on that (54.12). There is nothing particularly new or exciting about taxes, as you know we have exhausted the tax shields that we had in Spain. So starting in 2008 and certainly in 2009 in a complete fashion, we are going to be paying out in cash most of our accrued taxes. We have sort of softly indicated a three quarter of the accrued taxes to be paid out in the form of cash roughly, although please, you should not take that as more than the soft indication not a hard commitment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On depreciation, we do not expect any change in the accounting policies that we have followed, our asset base continues to decline very modestly at about a 2 to 3% a year, depending on currency movements and we don't see any reason why there should be a significant change either in 2009 or 2010. So there should not really be any significant change relative to the trend that is so very apparent.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding CapEx. First of all you have to take into account that in 2008 we have a peak of investment, as we said before. So in 2009, we are going to see a decrease on CapEx in all the regions. Of course, there are some regions, some countries where we made a special investment effort during 2008, because we were finishing our change of mobile technology in some regions and because we made an especial effort in some countries. So because of that there is some bigger decrease in some regions than others, but you are going to see a significant decrease in all the regions in 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, I've two questions please. The first one is just regarding Mexico, where it looks as if you've put in a very strong performance on revenue growth. It looks as though it coincides with your average price per minute going up, but that seems to have had a kind of negative effect on your share of subscriber net adds. Is that a strategy you are happy to run with in the medium term, or do you think you might have to start cutting price again to reaccelerate subscriber growth?</p>
          <p>And then, second question I have was just regarding fiber rollout in Spain. I was just wondering if you could give us, please, an update on the various, I think legal suits that are outstanding from -- I think it's Orange and Vodafone. Do you expect to be investing therefore in fiber in 2009? And if you could give some CapEx guidance on that please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would take the question on Mexico. During the year, in fact at the beginning of the end of first half of the year, we have been eliminating some promotions that were &#x2013; to all these nations -- that were creating some tensions in terms of their connection, and therefore we have been much more selective on there &#x2013; on where we will be targeting our reductions in ARPM. And in fact, if you see the trends in the fourth quarter you will see that both ARPU and MoU have been increasing for us in Mexico. So, we have been regaining the upward trend on those specific metrics and that's very specific for us on that market.</p>
          <p>And in terms of future behavior on the market, I think that the market is going to become probably more rational on that front. Subsidies are going to be, probably less high, especially in that market. So, and I think that the 26 or 27% market share of Foneda that we've been experiencing should be continuing, even increase.</p>
          <p>So we are in a good situation. We are expanding margins, expanding MoU -- and slightly expanding MoU in the fourth quarter, slightly expanding ARPU, and with much more sound and profitable way of growing. So, I think that we will be following a sound path of growth, both in market share and in financial metrics in Mexico.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Regarding &#x2013; this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding either regulation situation &#x2013; last January -- last month, the national regulator issued a resolution for the markets in infrastructure access and wholesale broadband, which are obviously related to fiber. And the main news are that &#x2013; there is obligation for an offer for tax -- this is horizontal tax -- so third party can pass fiber to the tax and access at home, for example. We still need to finish up the practical regulation for buildings for fiber that will complement the previous one.</p>
          <p>Second, we are obliged to, have obligation to offer a wholesale, indirect access wholesale offer at the national level, up to 30 megabits, both fiber and copper. And with that we are allowed to start commercializing fiber-to-the-home solutions in Spain. So that basically took more time than expected because there were some consultations and changes, and negotiation with the European Union, and this is the framework we have right now for negotiations.</p>
          <p>So, it has been delayed. In our opinion, in other markets in Europe there have been more pro-investments in fiber. This is an average regulation. So, we are allowed from late January to start commercializing. We have established commercializing fiber solutions in some areas where we have some fiber deployed. We will continue doing some technical deployments, some product launches along there. Now we have to accommodate CapEx in general to the current environment. So we will be very prudent regarding the numbers. We are not providing, sorry, any guidance for CapEx and nor for specific items of CapEx.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. I've got a couple of very quick questions. Firstly on CapEx, just a question on the President's presentation. Did you say that more than half of the CapEx will be coming from Latin America? And secondly, I just wanted to know in the EBITDA guidance, or your OIBDA guidance, are there any non-cash elements that you are including there?</p>

          <p>James, this is Santiago. There is no particular item included -- or non-cash item. The growth, I just want to reemphasize that, as usual, it is a constant currency OIBDA guidance that we are providing. So, we want to treat is on cost and currency, but there is no particular expected number that you should deduct from it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Just a few quick questions. Firstly, on your cost of interest costs -- around 6% level -- do we see that number as being sustainable going forwards? Secondly, are you signaling in CapEx that we're actually going to have a cut that's permanent, down to a 7.5 billion level, from a number running over eight billion level?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, in the domestic business you've had a very strong margin improvement in 2008. Do we think there is any more room to squeeze margins? And finally just so that Matthew is not left out. In Germany we are still &#x2013; we are getting closer, but we're still not quite there at actually getting to operating cash flow breakeven. Is that something which is a target for 2009 to actually sort of finally get there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Santiago. Let me take the financial expense question first. Though the markets are highly volatile, we are highly confident that our cost of servicing our debt should not be higher in 2009 than it has been in 2008. And it is not unlikely that it will be about a quarter of a point lower, assuming of course that the current financial environment is not materially different from the one prevailing a couple of quarters down the road. So, remember that we still have a lot of our debt denominated in expensive LATAM currencies and -- but that our spreads have been coming in, our ratings have been upgraded, and our refinancing exercises are proceeding in a very comfortable way. So, we do expect not to exceed the level we reached last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy could you please repeat the third question regarding CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this &#x2013; I mean there was some talk on the call as if it was like a permanent step down in CapEx levels, or you've gone through the peak CapEx year, and therefore we step down to a level of 7.5 billion that you are targeting. Do we think that that is &#x2013; for the midterm, you've actually had a &#x2013; you are going to have a lower CapEx cycle than you've had in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I think it is important that you take into account that of course our CapEx depends very much on market demands and on competition. And then it will change year-on-year based on that. As far as the economic conditions change, the CapEx should be adapted in order to cover the market demands, and in order to allow us to lead our competitive position in the markets. In any case, I think it is very important that you take into account that with this cover, that we are saving today, we are going to cover our priorities which are basically based on extended mobile coverage in the countries where we see a growth penetration and to extend our broadband offer in order as well to capture market demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding the question in the room for improvement in margins in 2009, well, as I mentioned before, our focus is operating cash flow. Margin is one additional metrics but operating cash flow is the key focus, and it is a tough environment, but I do believe that there is a room for improvement yet, and let me explain why. First, to cut which as you can guess is toughest in this type of environment. There are still some buckets of demand to re-capture. If you look at mobile broadband that's floating &#x2013; it's above our expectations for our data growth &#x2013; you can see in the numbers is impressive. And just to give you a flavor, we are selling &#x2013; we have more net adds of mobile broadband but five or six fixed. So, this is a market that is exploding, and we'll continue pushing that. On the side of efficiency for this a lot of things going on, you have to remember that we have like a three level program. We have a lot of things going on in Spain basically profiting from the integration of the wire-line company and the wireless company.</p>
          <p>There are many initiatives going on, the low-hanging fruits, we captured them in previous quarters but there are a lot of initiatives that are linked to cost improvements and IT improvement that takes time to be implemented and they are coming soon. We have a very rich portfolio of initiatives that will give us satisfaction in 2009. They make up for group level synergies that we have discussed before and also up to the level we have our collaboration with our industrial partners like Telecom Italia and our collaboration with channel that controls.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of projects going on of course, quarter by quarter is hard to match maybe the growth on the top line and the savings on the fishings aside but we are &#x2013; we have a strong focus on efficiency both on the OpEx and CapEx and you can see the numbers in the last quarter that even if you take away all the non-comparable items, our growth of operating cash flow taking away things like the redundancy programs, real estate sales, the lock the sale of loan portfolio at the beginning of the year, and also the universal services one in the quarter we grew by 7.4%. So the focus is there, and we acknowledge that the environment has started to pick up a lot of initiatives going on and we are very confident.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Guy. Thanks for your question on Germany, yes you are right we are moving inexplicably closer to operating cash flow breakeven. What I can tell you is that our CapEx did peak in 2008 as Julio said for the Group it peaked but also from a German perspective it peaked, and we think that actually now we built the right foundations to drive on for further growth. One thing I would say is that we fundamentally believe we are creating value in Germany as far as the business that we are building for the long-term to compete in the market place.</p>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions; the first one is on further potential for share buyback. Would you consider them during the year, or you prefer to retain flexibility in terms of free cash flow generation. And the second is on the Spanish market. If you can give us some &#x2013; an indication in terms of how the KPIs are moving in fixed and mobile in the first months of the 2009. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the first question as Santiago was telling you before you will consider that we are a tactical operation which depends on the free cash flow generation and a little of the surplus you know the tactical decision will be taken along the year according to that framework.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well regarding the Spanish market, the KPIs well &#x2013; we have data for January and parts of February, and we have traditionally seasonally the negatives it's on holiday in January after the Christmas campaign so that's happening obviously and there is a slowdown that is comparable to the slowdown in the fourth quarter taking away the seasonality effects of the Christmas campaign. So, it's too early to tell. It's a slow market like the one we saw in the last quarter taken away again the Christmas campaign which has a special effect. There were tough things that are natural. In February we will have one less &#x2013; one fewer a day because of normal days. So, we have to see. It's a slow market, but the trends are similar to the one which we saw in the past &#x2013; taking away the Christmas campaign which is seasonality effect.</p>

          <p>Okay, sorry about that. My first question was can you tell me whether you think that &#x20AC;69.5 ARPU is sustainable in wireline in Spain. And my second is can you tell me whether or not you've reduced leakage in O2 in the U.K., and if you have to what extent has that contributed to some of the results you've seen there?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, do you think that's sustainable on a two to three year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's sustainable. You have to remember that we are present in all segments of the economy not only residential but middle market and large corporate and public administrations that we not only sell voice &#x2013; fixed voice and mobile voice, we have up data and our broadband business and an IT business and a television business. So, we can &#x2013; we are building ARPU by selling more in the categories where we have lower penetration and where we can provide value to the customer. Of course, this year, we have switched a lot of our value proposition in large corporates for example to offer things like and save them money in other items of the P&amp;L of the companies like solutions, data solutions to save them money in energy and so on. We have a very good intake in that type of IT solutions and so remember that we are not only in traditional voice and we have a data business and IT business. So in a per unit basis, we &#x2013; I think not only will sustain it but I think we will continue evolving positively,</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Revenue leakage. So, one of the things that goes on sometimes is that billing systems aren't quite completely up to the scratch, you can lose some revenue and have minutes that aren't billed. And I am wondering have you improved some of your results and have you seen some improvement by reducing leakage in the last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I can say is that we haven't had any revenue leakage as far as I am aware in terms of significant issues in the U.K. for many years. And actually what we've done is carried out a complete, what we call revenue assurance check across all of our billing systems and we found some small things but certainly nothing material that would merit reporting here. So, there's no basis, I don't think, for revenue leakage in the first place.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Two questions please. The first related to possible levels of bad debt rise in Brazil. There's a fair amount of news flow as of late because of a basically that the Brazilian economy is slowing down. I was wondering if I could get some feedback regarding well how that could possibly be changing although in the accounts for full year we haven't seen any major impacts there, whether the start of the year has worsened. And second, if you could give us some feedback on the flat rate packages and mobile launched in Spain in particular I'm referring to it by the competition has been quite aggressive. Orange has recently launched a package, and whether you foresee that this is a trend in mobile, in domestic mobile and more flat rate packages and what kind of an impact on ARPU and MoUs can we expect? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, taking the first question on Brazil. So far we have not seen any sign of weakness in the first &#x2013; in January and the reason that we have been having in February activity keeps leaving the same pattern that has been in December. So, no major signs of a economic impact so far in Brazil namely. In terms of sales, gross as of ADSL or prices of bundles, the market is very, very competitive, competition is very dynamic. So, far no major impact of the economic slowdown in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding, this is Guillermo, regarding flat rates, obviously in a market slowdown flat rates are very popular because it gives the customer control of the activity of expenditures. Regarding specifically the mobile business, and I think you mentioned the Orange plan that was launched recently, I think you are mentioning that &#x20AC;59 plan that was launched by Orange. We launched a similar product in October if you recall that this is a &#x20AC;69 in our case per month package. It has some differences with the Orange one, we don't have a setup charge when you get a new customer.</p>
          <p>We both have 500 minutes to any &#x2013; to any destination in the package. In the case of Orange I believe they have some mobile-to-fixed minutes also which are not relevant in the mobile business and the price per minute when you are away &#x2013; when you spend your 500 minutes is lower in the case of MobileStar. This is similar product with some differences. We launched it five months ago we have some &#x2013; we call it plan national that's the name in the commercial name and we carried it on T.V. Well that's enough for the time. If it is a price war or not depends how you sell this, we have a family of flat rates and well we try to use, we try obviously not to sell the same flat rate to everybody otherwise you will have some revenue cannibalization, people going down. So what we try to do, we try to call &#x2013; and this is the same case in fixed business. We call customers and we analyze before the traffic pattern and we try to offer a plan that will give the customer some control on break abilities but trying not to damage our revenue side.</p>
          <p>So, I think we will see more of this flat to semi-flat rates and depending on the decision, our future prices could be a price discount or not, and especially depends on how you sell it. You have to sell it very selectively and almost customer by customer. So we prefer to do it out on basis rather than a massive basis.</p>
