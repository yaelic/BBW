        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the call. So we just announced our full year results for the period to the end of March. And I'll just give a quick summary of the key highlights and then we can move on to Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So the overall revenue was &#xA3;45.9 billion, which was up about 3% on last year. The service revenues within that were &#xA3;42.7 billion, which was up 2.1% on an organic basis with the last quarter, actually being up 2.5% the same as the third quarter. Within that, Europe was down very slightly, 0.4% and the AMAP region was up by 9.5%. And in the vast majority of markets, particularly in the fourth quarter, we were very encouraged to see increases in our market share.</p>
          <p>EBITDA for the year at &#xA3;14.7 billion was flat compared to the previous year, just very slightly down. The margin was down 1.1 percentage points, which was very consistent with the guidance that we had given earlier. Some of that was investment in new customers, particularly to get smartphones into our customer base, offsetting that was another 4% reduction in our operating cost.</p>
          <p>In Europe, adjusted operating profit at reported exchange rate was &#xA3;11.8 billion. If one restates that on to our guidance FX rate that was &#xA3;12.2 billion, so that was right at the top end of our increased guidance range from the mid year and was actually a number we achieved after absorbing the costs of the iPhone launch by Verizon Wireless.</p>
          <p>Verizon Wireless had a good performance, good contribution, &#xA3;4.6 billion our share which was an 8.5% increase compared with the previous year. We had a couple of one-off items, so we have got some gains on disposals of the assets, China Mobile, SoftBank, etcetera, which in aggregate came to &#xA3;5.3 billion. And we have taken impairment charges in aggregate of &#xA3;6.1 billion, the majority against Spain and smaller amounts against Portugal, Ireland and Italy as well as the Greek impairment at the half year.</p>
          <p>The free cash flow was &#xA3;7.0 billion on a reported basis and so second successive year of &#xA3;7 billion, albeit with a considerable working capital contribution. On the same basis that we guided, that was actually &#xA3;7.2 billion. So again, compared with our guidance of &#xA3;6.5 billion or in excess of &#xA3;6.5 billion, we have exceeded on the free cash flow front as well.</p>
          <p>The earnings per share were 16.75p, an increase of 4% year-on-year and the proposed dividend for the year in total at 8.9p is a 7.1% increase consistent with our preexisting dividend policy.</p>
          <p>Just a couple of comments upon areas of our strategic focus, data has been very center stage for a while now, and we were very pleased to see data revenues for the year now exceeding &#xA3;5 billion, so they were &#xA3;5.1 billion, up 26% year-on-year. And indeed the increase in the data revenues more than covered for the first time the reduction in our voice revenues. Our enterprise business also performed well, now a near &#xA3;9 billion revenue stream in Europe with our global accounts team particularly performing strongly with an 8% increase.</p>
          <p>The emerging markets businesses has performed also very well with an overall increase of 12%, with particularly strong performances from Turkey, from India and from Ghana. Fixed line businesses contributed another 5% of revenues. So on all those areas, I think a good revenue performance. In terms of the portfolio, we have as you all know, been giving some attention to particularly our non-controlled assets and appreciate the patience from our shareholders as we have worked our way through those.</p>
          <p>During the course of the year, the aggregate consideration agreed from the sale of the SFR and SoftBank and China Mobile assets is &#xA3;14.2 billion, of which just under half, &#xA3;6.8 billion, we have committed to share buybacks with the rest being retained in the knowledge that we have a number of spectrum auctions, the India tax issue, etcetera, going forwards. And on top of that, we are continuing with our 7% dividend increase.</p>
          <p>In terms of the year that we have just moved into, we have issued guidance, again, on profit and on cash flow for that. The guidance for the operating profit is &#xA3;11.0 billion to &#xA3;11.8 billion. That takes into account the loss of the profit contribution from SFR and also is taking into account the tougher, macroeconomic environment continuing in Southern Europe for a period longer as well as the MTR cuts.</p>
          <p>On the cash flow side, we have guided that to &#xA3;6.0 billion to &#xA3;6.5 billion. Again, compared with last year, one has to adjust for the SFR and China Mobile dividends and also the fact that the strong working capital performance from last year will obviously not be a recurring feature forever. We have reiterated our medium-term guidance on revenue as 1% to 4% and indicated that we're likely to in the lower end of that range in the coming year due to the economic environment and the MTR cuts. And the 6% to 7% medium-term guidance on the cash flow, we have reduced by &#xA3;0.5 billion, again to reflect the loss of the dividends from China Mobile and from France.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will go over to questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We go to Stanley Martinez, to Legal and General Investment Management. Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking my call. Look, Andy, I'll come straight the point. Since KPN's guidance warning last month, I think investor's confidence in the transition to smartphone economics and feature phone economics, which is fairly central to the Vodafone investment case, has been shaken a bit. And I think you tried to illustrate some of the differences in the Dutch mobile business in particular this morning in terms of the attach rate on smartphones. But I wondered if I could just ask a few questions to try and more fully spell out some of the risks and opportunities.</p>
          <p>So first, if I look at the SMS revenue that you generate in your core European markets, which I estimate at &#xA3;3.1 billion, what portion of that can you tell me is earned out of bundle? And second, based on your experience, what level of pricing premium do you need to have in order to prevent substitution from SMS to voice, especially in prepaid or maybe in markets where you have had lesser price elasticity? Maybe I can just start with those questions, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Stanley, we don't split out the in bundle, out of bundle on text messaging. We never have done. Broadly, the data points I've given you on this is, text messaging has been around for a long while. We have had data products coming on-stream. There have always been questions about the extent to which we would see cannibalization, but I think the facts speak for themselves. That actually in Europe we are still seeing the messaging revenues grow by over 5% a year and across the group, we actually saw an increase in messaging revenues of 6.5%. So I think, if there is an element of cannibalization in that, then it is still very strong notwithstanding that.</p>
          <p>Your second question was on the relative pricing of the bundles to try to make sure that we don't get the cannibalization. I mean what we are seeking to do is to introduce integrated bundles whereby one price will cover a mixture of voice and data and text messaging, and that price point obviously depends very much on the country and on the tiering as to what volume of those three products one is getting in there. And in each of those markets we will have prices that will start at fairly low levels and basically people will work their way up.</p>
          <p>So the overall yield management is very much based upon the total revenues that are coming in. And, as I say, if we're sitting here with data revenue going up  26%, SMS revenue go up 5%, then I'm very comfortable that the balance at the moment is working strongly in our favor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should I think of any element of a back-book re-pricing trajectory on the SMS data revenues in the way that I might think about that in terms of the evolution of retail voice yields?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, you said back book re-pricing, what exactly do you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just in terms of re-pricing of legacy SMS, should I think about the SMS revenues, whether they are in bundle or out of bundle, essentially re-pricing lower at a certain rate in much the same way that I might think about retail voice yields consistently falling over time, notwithstanding termination rate effects, but just due to competition and potential substitution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would look at this over the longer term. The price of SMSs has been coming down every year for the last seven or eight years across markets. So in that sense, it's very little difference to voice. In the meantime, back to my previous point, we have seen data grow from a negligible revenue stream to &#xA3;5 billion a year. We have seen the text messaging, as I said, and even last year four or five years after voice &#x2013; after data was introduced, still growing at 5%.</p>
          <p>So we have already built the phenomena of text messaging prices going down. We have got the phenomena of data revenues going up. We have got the phenomena of total SMS revenues increasing. All of those are consistent with what has been experienced for the last four or five years. I don't see us trying to change in trajectory that's occurring now. What we do see and absolutely understand the Netherlands reference is to make sure that we do have integrated price plans, so that we can help to manage that movement between different types of usage. But overall come back to the point, trends we have seen over the last four or five years are not fundamentally different from the ones we're seeing today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And if I could just ask one further question, I promise. In terms of that evolution to more integrated price plans, should we expect Vodafone to reinvest incrementally -- I know you already have done, but incrementally more in billing systems, in call center, even in brand as you transition to more individualized devices. I know that you've done some of this heretofore, but should we expect even more so as you really execute the Supermobile strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the simple answer to that is we will be and are investing more in IT systems, more in billing systems, more in the retail space in being able to sell the slightly more sophisticated data products. What we are seeking to do is to make sure, though, that we are funding that through efficiencies elsewhere in the business, but yes, it is a true statement. If you look at our total capital spend, we have got slightly higher proportion now being invested on the IT and the customer facing side of technology than has been the case in the past, albeit within the overall same capital expenditure envelope.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Okay. As there are no further questions, I will now return the conference to you, Andy. One second, there is a question that's just jumped in from Monroe Helm of Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney &amp; Strauss. Can I pass that over to you first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wonder if could you update us on what other assets might be disposed of in the next 12 to 24 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Monroe, the only asset that we are currently contemplating sale of is our stake in Poland, so we had about a quarter of business called Polkomtel. And alongside the other shareholders there is currently a process underway to seek prices from potential buyers. And I think the next couple of the months will be clear as to whether that will flush out accessible pricing or whether it won't. Other than that, I don't think there is anything on the cards for the foreseeable future. And I think after the portfolio clean up from last year, that the focus will instead be very much on the sort of operational side of running the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. How about the Indian operation? Is there some potential IPO part of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We've said that we are considering or we are prepared to consider at a point in time whether actually some local ownership of the Indian business would be a sensible thing to do. There are, I think, a number of factors which we'd needs to get clarified and sorted before we could contemplate that, some of which has to do with the overall regulatory landscape in India which is still somewhat unclear.</p>
          <p>We've also got the big tax case in front of us this summer which we would like to get resolved. But thereafter, we are open to having a look at that. We believe it's a very, very attractive asset. It's performing very strongly in market. It's just sort of had record growth in customer net adds. It's taking -- raking in market share. So simple answer is it is something that we might have a look at in a &#x2013; at a point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for doing the call and thanks for taking the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As there seems to be no further questions, Andy, I return the conference to you to close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you, particularly Stanley and Monroe, for all of your questions. If there are no other questions, then we'll draw it to the close. I just reiterate, I think we've had a strong year of  performance. It's been encouraging to see that we are been taking our market share in a good majority of our markets recently. The portfolio tidy-up that we have done has realized a significant proceeds, a lot of those coming back to shareholders either currently or over the coming months. So I think we go into the next financial year in a good position. Thank you very much indeed for joining the call.</p>
