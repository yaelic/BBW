          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2009 Praxair Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Heather and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Heather. Good morning, and thank you all for attending our second quarter earnings call and webcast. Matt White, Vice President and Controller, and Liz Hirsch, Director of Investor Relations, are with me this morning. Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Our earnings per share this quarter was $0.96, towards the bottom end, but within our guidance range of $0.95 to $1.00. When we gave guidance at the beginning of the quarter, we assumed that the macroeconomic conditions would be about the same as the first quarter. However, the economy continued to slide further with U.S. industrial production falling 13% in June and the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler, which closed all of their assembly plants.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we were impacted by very low natural gas prices. This impacted our top-line because these prices are a pass-through in our hydrogen prices, but it also impacted our bottom-line due to the cessation of drilling activity. This caused a $20 million sales impact to our fracing business and reduced operating profit by about $10 million. This will come back when gas prices move higher.</p>
          <p>Let me also add that our operating profit was negatively impacted by $16 million in currency hedge losses, or about $0.04 of earnings per share, related to the Brazilian reais and the euro which strengthened right at the end of the quarter, requiring us to mark-to-market our hedges related to the third quarter. Our currency management strategy has been to hedge our net income exposure one quarter forward, and in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a similar gain when the reais and the euro weakened suddenly.</p>
          <p>Also included in operating profit is about $5 million in severance charges and $22 million of receivable write-offs. However, we do not treat these as special items because these are charges which will continue in the third and fourth quarters until we have finished reducing head count and our customers' financial profiles have stabilized.</p>
          <p>Now, having pointed out all the bad news in the quarter, let me say that I'm much more optimistic about the economy than I was three months ago. First, the economy has clearly stabilized albeit at a low level. Second, the auto, steel and chemical industries have announced a significant number of plant startups in the second half. Third, China and India and Brazil are already improving. And lastly, we've not seen our project backlog decline and we're currently studying a number of new very interesting large projects primarily in the energy area. Consequently, we believe that our pipeline of new business will continue to be strong for at least the next five years.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn the call over to Liz, who'll review our second quarter results in more detail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to page three for a summary of our second quarter results. Given the overall environment, Praxair had very solid results in the second quarter. Sales and earnings were higher than the first quarter, though well below the prior year. The macro environment continued to be very challenging with little change from the first quarter overall. Volumes seemed to have stabilized, and towards the end of the quarter, we began to see a few pockets of improvement, which we will discuss.</p>
          <p>You can see in our results that our cost reductions and productivity have offset a significant portion of the impact from lower volumes. Sales were 26% below last year's second quarter, but net income declined only 14%. And our operating margin reached 20.9%.</p>
          <p>Sales this quarter were 2.1 billion versus 2.9 billion in the previous-year quarter. More than half of this decrease came from currency and cost pass-through effects. Negative currency translation, primarily the euro and the Brazilian real, reduced sales by 262 million or 9%.</p>
          <p>Secondly, lower cost pass-through reduced sales by 144 million or 5%. Cost pass-through includes the cost of natural gas purchased to make hydrogen and the cost of electricity for our on-site atmosphere customers. These costs are automatically passed through by formula in our contracts to our customers with minimal impact on operating profit. The 5% negative effect on our top-line this quarter was primarily due to significantly lower natural gas prices compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Excluding these effects, underlying sales were 12% below prior year. Overall volumes were 14% lower and little changed from first quarter. Remember that all our year-over-year volume comparisons this quarter are against a very strong 2008 second quarter in which volumes rose 6%. Higher overall pricing partially offset the effect of lower volumes.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was 447 million this quarter, 18% or 96 million below prior year. The impact of lower volumes reduced OP by about $207 million. We offset more than half of this with cost reduction and productivity. We have streamlined our cost structure by reducing fixed costs, and our gross margin this quarter increased to 44% from 39% in 2008. This should demonstrate to you the significant incremental earnings we will have when volumes recover.</p>
          <p>Net income of 299 million was 14% of sales, a 190 basis point margin improvement from last year. In addition to lower costs, net income this quarter benefited from lower interest expense. The rates we are paying on U.S. commercial paper in short-term debt have continued to trend lower and, in addition, we are paying lower rates on short-term debt overseas as governments have reduced rates to stimulate their economies.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 26%. This reflects a $7 million tax benefit primarily in Italy related to tax incentives. A third of this benefit was offset in the noncontrolling interests line since part of the benefit was attributable to our minority shareholders.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share of $0.96 was 11% below last year but $0.03 higher than last quarter. Cash flow generation was strong this quarter. Cash flow from operations was $563 million primarily from net income and depreciation. This funded $370 million of capital expenditures primarily for on-site projects under construction globally. We also repurchased $64 million of stock net of issuances and paid $123 million of dividend, leaving overall debt levels relatively unchanged.</p>
          <p>Please turn to pages four and five for our results in North America.</p>
          <p>Sales in North America were 1.1 billion, 15% below prior year excluding currency effects and lower cost pass-through, primarily natural gas. Volumes were 17% lower than prior year, partially offset by 2% higher pricing. We saw lower sales in all end-markets except energy which was up 11% excluding gas prices, due to growth in refinery hydrogen and enhanced oil recovery. Overall volumes trended down slightly from the first quarter but appear to now be stabilizing.</p>
          <p>On-site sales declined 38% ex-currency. Lower natural gas prices accounted for 27% of that decrease. Underlying volumes were down 11% as higher hydrogen volumes were offset by lower volumes to steel and chemical customers. The significant inventory destocking by our customers in these markets appears to be ending, and in June our oxygen volumes began to pick up slightly.</p>
          <p>Merchant liquid sales ex-currency were 13% below prior year at 18% lower volumes, compared to a very strong second quarter last year, were partially offset by higher pricing. Merchant volumes trended lower compared to the first quarter as manufacturing in the U.S. and Canada has continued to weaken. Sales to oil well services are very low, in line with reduced drilling activity due to low gas prices. Overall pricing is above prior year and sequential trends continue to be stable.</p>
          <p>We are signing a lot of new business for frozen budget foods as consumers are eating home more due to the recession. We are also seeing new business opportunities for certain environmental applications such as emission reductions and wastewater treatment.</p>
          <p>North American packaged gas sales were 19% below prior year ex-currency due to lower volumes in the U.S., Canada and Mexico mitigated by higher price. In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business same-store sales declined 18% primarily due to a 34% decline in hardgoods. Gas and rent same-store sales were down 7%. The large decline in hardgoods reflects the sharp contraction in capital spending and production in construction and manufacturing markets.</p>
          <p>PDI's operating margin however increased 200 basis points from the prior-year due mostly to significant cost reductions, and some effect from the mix of lower margin hardgoods. PDI sales per day have been relatively flat since March; so, we believe we are seeing stabilization, but no visible upturn yet.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in North America was 264 million this quarter, up from last quarter due to our continued focus on cost reduction and productivity. Operating margin was 23.6%.</p>
          <p>Our current outlook for North America for the second half of the year is for volumes to remain well below 2008 levels, with a modest sequential recovery in the hardest hit end-markets of chemicals, metals and electronics.</p>
          <p>Energy markets are a bright spot except for oil well services, which is down significantly. We expect our hydrogen sales to continue to grow and we are looking at new projects for refining, oil recovery and sequestration. Food and healthcare markets are steady. We are very cautious about planning for higher volumes in manufacturing and industrial markets in the U.S. and Canada as we have yet to see a significant upturn.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page six for our results in Europe.</p>
          <p>Sales in Europe were $306 million, down 11% from prior year ex-currency due to 14% lower volume mitigated by 3% higher pricing. Sequentially, overall volumes were even with last quarter. This is a result of modest sequential improvement in sales to manufacturing, food and healthcare markets, offset by modestly lower sales to metals and chemicals.</p>
          <p>On-site and merchant volumes picked up in June versus May. By country, Italy is showing some improvement, while Spain is still weak due in large part to the steep downturn in construction. We are continuing to sign new liquid contracts for food and for environmental applications, specifically wastewater treatment.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was 61 million compared to 99 million in the prior year. We are stepping up our productivity programs, and expect the margin to continue to improve over the balance of the year even without a significant improvement in volumes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page seven for our results in South America.</p>
          <p>Sales in South America were 395 million. Underlying sales were 5% below the prior year and higher than last quarter. Brazil's economy is beginning to show some positive growth trends due to government's fiscal and monetary stimulus. Interest rates have been reduced five times this year to a record low of 8.75%. Industrial production and consumer confidence are both picking up from the low point in January.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, our pipeline and liquid volumes, excluding seasonal CO2, rose towards the end of the quarter as steel and chemicals picked up. Our LNG sales were also higher, as were sales to food and beverage and healthcare. We are optimistic about Brazil's earlier recovery from this recession and we expect sequential volume improvement in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $70 million. Excluding currency effects, which included an $11 million net income hedge loss, operating margin was over 20%. Higher pricing and cost reduction have offset the impact of lower volumes, and so volume increases will give us strong operating leverage. We also have a number of projects, which will start up this year, the most will be in the fourth quarter thereby contributing to sales and earnings in 2010.</p>
          <p>Page eight summarizes our Asia results. Sales of 199 million in Asia were 5% below prior year ex-currency. Sales were lower year-over-year primarily due to lower production at electronics and steel customers. Business conditions have improved in China, India and Thailand, and volumes rose 13% sequentially.</p>
          <p>China is showing solid signs of recovery. Compared to first quarter, our on-site volumes and merchant volumes in China are up 16% and 28% respectively. Sales to electronics showed a strong rebound of 27% versus first quarter ex-currency; however, specialty gas pricing continues to decline.</p>
          <p>Operating profit and operating margin were higher than last quarter due to higher volumes coupled with good cost control. We expect that growth will continue to pick up in China and India this year and in 2010. The Chinese government is stimulating economic growth with infrastructure spending to create jobs and consumer demand.</p>
          <p>India has not seen as much of a downturn, but industrial production has resumed and we expect it to continue. We have a large number of projects under construction in both countries and are looking at numerous new projects.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page nine for Surface Technologies' results. PST had sales of 118 million this quarter, down 14% versus 2008 ex-currency. Coatings for energy markets, particularly industrial gas turbines, were higher. Coatings for general manufacturing markets like automotive, steel, printing and capital equipment were very weak particularly in Europe. Jet engine coatings were below prior year, but we expect them to increase in the second half. Operating profit was 19 million, 16% of sales. On July 1, PST acquired Sermatech International, a global supplier of coatings used on industrial and aviation turbines.</p>
          <p>PST's business focus is to increase the proportion of turbine coatings, both jet engines and industrial and oilfield service coatings as these are faster growing markets and also require higher value-added technologies. It will reduce its focus on lower value-added industrial coatings for markets, which are shrinking like printing, auto, and textiles. Over 80% of Sermatech's sales are to the aerospace and energy markets. In addition, Sermatech expands PST's coatings offerings and increases our business with key OEM customers like GE, Rolls Royce, Siemens and Alstom.</p>
          <p>We will realize significant synergies as we integrate the businesses from facility rationalization and manufacturing plant optimization. The acquisition will add about $50 million of sales in the second half of this year, but integration costs will offset the operating profit contribution for the next few quarters. Our objective after integration is to drive operating margins for all of PST up to the 20% range.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn this back to Jim to discuss business conditions, our outlook and our earnings guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Liz. As I mentioned earlier, business conditions in the second quarter turned out to be more difficult than we had hoped when we did our earnings call in April. At that time, we were cautiously optimistic that destocking in chemicals and steel would end soon. But in North America and Europe, volumes continued to decline further from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 10 shows our organic sales growth by end-market both year-over-year and compared to last quarter. The sequential numbers show improvement in some markets, but a continued fall-off in sales to chemicals and metals. Electronics, chemicals, metals and manufacturing markets comparably sales are down 15 to 20%. It shows you the opportunity we have to grow sales and earnings in the future as volumes recover, because we'll not have to add any production capacity to support these sales.</p>
          <p>Let me make a few comments about each of the major end-markets.</p>
          <p>Energy has been very resilient with sales up 10% from last year. We expect steady growth in hydrogen for refining from existing customers and from new projects currently under construction. We're also expecting to capture new opportunities outside of the U.S. as refiners upgrade their facilities and move to over-the-fence supply systems. We believe enhanced oil recovery will continue to be a good opportunity globally for nitrogen and CO2 supply. We signed a new project last quarter and are evaluating several others. Current time, our fracing business is significantly below last year and last quarter due to weak drilling activity in the U.S. and Canada. When natural gas prices get back to the 5 to $6 level, this business will pick up rapidly.</p>
          <p>Electronics has shown a significant rebound from its first-quarter lows. The pickup is coming from inventory restocking to meet China's demand for small notebook computers and for the increase in production of flat panel displays. There's limited visibility on the longer-term outlook for growth in semiconductor manufacturing. Consensus views are for more moderate growth rates going forward.</p>
          <p>Solar is an area, which we expect will grow faster than semiconductor production supported by government incentives for technology development to drive costs down closer to grid parity. We've signed a number of contracts to supply gases to polysilicon producers and solar cell manufacturers. We're also developing technology and increasing our production capacity for tubular targets for this market.</p>
          <p>Demand levels of our chemical customers appear to be stabilizing and will probably grow next year.</p>
          <p>In metals, sales were down 23% from last year and were 5% below the first quarter. Significant destocking appears to be behind us. In the U.S., steel service center inventories are at historically low levels. Volumes have very recently begun to improve in North America as several customers have restarted blast furnaces. We've seen more of a pickup in volumes in South America and China and we expect those two regions to continue to see sequential improvement.</p>
          <p>Our sales to manufacturing are down 14% year-over-year and about even with the first quarter. Overall, industrial markets continue to be very weak in the U.S., Canada and Europe primarily due to weak consumer demand for autos, housing and appliances, and weak non-residential construction. At this point, it's hard to call any specific upturn in industrial production in these regions, and so we continue to align our cost structure for current demand levels. In South America and Asia, particularly China, we are beginning to see the effects in our volumes of government stimulus programs aimed at increasing economic activity.</p>
          <p>Sales to the healthcare and food and beverage markets continue to show steady moderate growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, a word on the aerospace market, which is largely related to Surface Technologies. Our volumes of coatings for jet engines have been below our expectations this year for several reasons. First, Boeing's union strike caused production delays, and therefore delays in our coating orders. Secondly, the ongoing delays for the Dreamliner have pushed out our coatings work for the next generation's more energy-efficient engines slated for the new planes. These new engines require more coatings per part and more parts to be coated in the hot section. Thirdly, the global downturn has obviously reduced air travel, and thus our coatings volumes for repair and overhaul engines are softer. But we expect that business conditions will improve going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to page 11 for our earnings guidance. For the first quarter of 2009, we expect diluted earnings per quarter (sic) [share] in the range of $0.95 to $1.00. This guidance does not assume a significant improvement in macroeconomic conditions.</p>
          <p>We expect diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2009 to be in the range of 3.85 to 4.05. We're bringing down the top-end by $0.10 due to the fact that the second quarter came in at the bottom-end of our range. We still expect that our CapEx will be about $1.4 billion for the year. We have 42 projects and a large project backlog whose supply systems are dedicated to specific customers. And so, our CapEx spend is directly correlated to future growth.</p>
          <p>During this quarter, we started up a couple of plants and we signed contracts for several new projects in South America and Mexico. The plants we're building will come on stream as early as next quarter and through 2011. In spite of a significant decline in demand for semiconductor, steel and chemicals, we're currently studying a significant number of very interesting new projects primarily in the energy industry and in emerging market economies. Our very strong positions in Mexico, Brazil, China and India should allow us to accelerate growth in these regions over the next five years, while we believe the U.S. and Europe will remain slow.</p>
          <p>Let me end with some comments on future operating leverage. The 14% decline in volumes this quarter similar to last quarter on a year-over-year basis reduced our operating profit by over $200 million or about $0.48 of EPS. We were able to reduce costs by over 100 million in the quarter, which substantially mitigated the impact of volume declines on our net income and earnings per share.</p>
          <p>We believe we've come to a new level of efficiency in this industry, and are not planning on adding much of these costs back when volumes improve. Consequently, we'll have significant operating and financial leverage to any economic improvement.</p>
          <p>While I do not believe we will see overall demand in the U.S., Canada and Europe recover to 2008 levels for a number of years, but if we do see a few percentage points of recovery, it will produce significant earnings upside. Absent any volume recovery, we still expect to deliver 5% growth each year from our new project startups and new business we're winning today. If you assume a couple of percentage points of economic growth each year, albeit coming off this year's very low base, we'll still be on track for long-term sales growth in the 10% area and double-digit EPS growth.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn this call over for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to ask you about your outlook for the second part of the year. Obviously, the recovery is tenuous and debatable, but your guidance suggests that the fourth quarter would be quite a bit better than the first quarter. So, what's your medium-term indicator suggest to you? What do you see in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, so far in July we still haven't seen much pickup, and that's &#x2013; a third of the third quarter is already over. The fourth quarter is really where we have some range in the guidance, and should we see some pickup in on-site volumes, we get a significant leverage in earnings in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of business activity for new projects, any comments on projects that you have completed that you signed up recently? How do you see prospects for that for the next fiscal year, next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's going to be a changing mix. I don't believe that there is going to be a lot of new projects going forward in the metals, mining and chemicals sectors because generally there is overcapacity in those industries right now and I don't see that overcapacity going away. So, while those companies will continue to finish the projects that are under construction, I don't see signing a whole lot of new projects in those areas.</p>
          <p>However, in the energy sector, both in the refining area and in the upstream area, we're in talks with quite a few big customers who are looking at some pretty interesting projects involving enhanced oil recovery, refinery hydrogen, CO2 sequestration and so forth. And they're pretty interesting projects. I think they're good projects for the customer on a standalone basis and they're fairly large as well. And so, I'm a little more optimistic that we're not going to see a big fall-off in new project activity as a result of the turndown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question on price mix. Your price has held up quite well as expected. So, what are your thoughts for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Let me just say a couple of things on that. And actually our price that we're showing here &#x2013; and the way you'd calculate it, the way we calculate it which is the same every time &#x2013; is up 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially. But when you peel back on that, it actually, I think, understates the improvement in price that we're continuing to get, and that's where the mix comes in.</p>
          <p>Because for example the fracing business, the price that we sell CO2 and nitrogen in the fracing business is more than twice as high as the price that we sell those products to other customers. And that's because of the substantial amount of transportation and equipment that we have to bring with that.</p>
          <p>But if you do the variance analysis, that's sort of dragging down the price. And otherwise, we're still seeing some pretty good price increases. So, I don't &#x2013; I'm pretty optimistic about pricing going forward.</p>

          <p>Jim, in terms of leverage, you sort of commented that the $200 million hit in volume in the quarter for operating income was sort of an impact of $0.48. If you get that 200 million back, let's say going forward, the earnings leverage contributes something like $0.75, $0.80. Just wanted to get a feel for what the degree of the improvement could be with all the cost savings you've generated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. On a quarterly basis, it was $200 million. And if you just divide that after &#x2013; take that after-tax, divide it by earnings per share, it works out to about $0.48 of earnings per share in each quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, if you get that back, does that $0.48 improve with all the cost savings that you've generated?</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then in terms of the automotive, chemical, steel markets, can you give us a sense what the degree of the improvement would be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not actually sure. That's the crystal ball question. But I think that while we don't have that much exposure directly to the auto industry, it's my sense that the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler took a pretty big toll in the industrial economy in the second quarter with secondary and trickle-down effects on people doing machining and car dealers getting shut down, mechanics getting laid-off, and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So, I think that those strikes took a bigger toll in the second quarter. And now, they're beginning to announce that they're going to start up some auto assembly plants, and consequently, some of the steel customers are beginning to announce that they're going to start up some blast furnaces. And you're also seeing some announcements in the chemical sector and in the fertilizer sector of companies saying that they're going to restart production.</p>
          <p>Based on what's been announced so far, it's not a huge increase, but it certainly looks like we've hit the bottom and it certainly looks like destocking is over. So, I do think we'll see a bump. I don't think we'll see a return back to the levels we saw in 2008 for probably five years. But I do think we'll see a bump as destocking comes to an end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and last question. In terms of delays of major on-site projects, have you seen less of that this time around? Are you seeing some of the delay maybe come back faster with general improvements in the economic environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen one change, which is a couple weeks &#x2013; last week actually &#x2013; which is an unexpected delay in the Chevron refinery expansion in Richmond, California, which is well under construction and we have two world-scale hydrogen plants under construction to feed that. Unfortunately, a judge ruled based on a complaint from an environmental group to halt construction at the site.</p>
          <p>And while I think that won't go &#x2013; will end &#x2013; they'll get that resolved because it's just small environmental group who contended that the city didn't evaluate the environmental impact statement correctly. There is a huge amount of effort to get that resolved and back under construction. So, that's really not related to the economy. That's just an environmental harassment issue and I think that will get resolved pretty quickly. And then, that hydrogen plant will be coming on stream probably in the second half of 2010. Otherwise, there really hasn't been any change in what we said in the first quarter had been deferred.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We actually put that up on a slide in the January earnings conference call. So, you can go back and take a look at that. But geographically, about 40% of it is in the emerging markets, which is really just South America, India and China. Then, the two biggest projects, which account for close to $500 million are the two refinery projects for Chevron and BP in Chicago. And I mentioned $500 million &#x2013; I guess I also ought to mention that the total of the backlog is about $2 billion. And then, the next two biggest projects are two coal gasification projects in China. So, energy is about half of that. The rest of it's pretty well distributed into various end-markets &#x2013; some chemicals, some semiconductors, some metals and mining and so forth.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, definitely. I mean they're processing sour crude, number one; and number two, they are processing more &#x2013; they're producing more of low-sulfur diesel fuel and less gasoline. And the low-sulfur diesel fuel requires more hydrogen per gallon of fuel produced. So, that's another area where they're increasing the demand. So, what's happening in refining is even though the volume of refined product is down probably close to 10%, the demand for hydrogen is up probably 5%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Jim. One of the themes of your commentary has been your very high incremental margins. And in the first half, your revenues were about 4.25 billion and you're forecasting about nine billion in revenues for the year, which means in the second half, your revenues or your volumes would go up by about $500 million. And so, if your incremental margins are, call it 50%, what that would do is add on an annualized basis &#x2013; or would add about $0.54 in earnings per share and push your earnings guidance way above your 3.85 to 4.05 range. So, is it that the &#x2013; so, which is correct? Are the nine billion in revenues or the earnings guidance because they seem inconsistent at first sight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The nine billion in revenues is on the high side. What we're forecasting is closer to nine than 8.5, but nine is on the high side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, just as a I guess clarification: if you exclude the hedge losses, would the operating profit in Brazil or in South America have been more like 86 million? And by geography, where were the 20 million in receivables write-downs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, I think you have the numbers right for South America &#x2013; would be 81 million in OP, and Brazil &#x2013; and Europe would be up by four, and Asia up by a couple as well because we had hedges on the Korean won. So, that's kind of where those are located, if you want to adjust those segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The receivables are all over the place. There's a fair amount of receivables &#x2013; we have some receivable policies that involve write-downs. There's no single big receivable in there. But given the economic environment, we've gone through the balance sheets of all of our subsidiaries around the world and checked to see if we have adequate reserves, and in many cases we've increased the reserves.</p>
          <p>So, that's pretty well distributed &#x2013; about eight in Brazil, about six in Europe, about eight or 10 in North America, and kind of the range of two to five in Asia. But with customers getting weaker, I think receivables are going to continue to be an issue. These aren't really receivables where we've given up trying to collect them. We just decided that at some point in time, because of the weakness of our customer base, that we're going to collect less than we would have before. So, we've increased our receivable reserves.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Jim, just wondering about price competition in the U.S. merchant market. I mean, we've got rates in the low-70s here. Are you &#x2013; how is your new business signings? How is pricing in that comparing to your existing portfolio? And is there any evidence of competitors going for price to load up their other plants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, to start out with, there hasn't been a lot of new business in the last six months because people are delaying plans to increase capacity and so on and so forth. But most of the places where there are businesses as a result of applications technology such as in the food industry, and in the oxy-fuel combustion for making cement and glass and so forth. And pretty much in those areas where there are new sales, we're bringing the technology as well. And so, pricing is not &#x2013; it's not like they're going out and bidding the price of the gas. So, we haven't seen any change really in pricing. And because of the long-term five-year merchant contracts, it would be a while before we would see any.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, could you also comment on your electricity price trends in merchant? I know you pass it through in on-site. But what's &#x2013; are you seeing a pretty good reduction in your electricity costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a big reduction in electricity costs because our production is down a lot, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean --.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But price of electricity &#x2013; it's started to come down in some areas, it's definitely lower in Canada because it's a patch to natural gas in Canada and Mexico. The U.S. is a mixed &#x2013; it's pretty much flat in the U.S., and actually in Europe I think electricity pricing is up. So, it kind of evens out that going around the world we really haven't seen much change. And it's hard to predict as well, because on the one hand with a soft economy and lower raw material prices for power, the rates have come down. On the other hand, as people start requiring utilities to do things, to reduce emissions and CO2 and all that kind of stuff, that's going to drive rates up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then finally, on the new projects front, are you looking at any opportunities to buy existing customer <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually did one in the second quarter. We had sold, I think, a 900-ton per day plant to Inco at the Sudbury nickel mine. And at that point in time &#x2013; this was three or four years ago &#x2013; they wanted to buy the plant, they did not want an over-the-fence supply. And while we're not normally in the plant-sale business, we needed the liquid output from that plant. And so, we sold them that plant at cost, and we took back liquid which comes down to our Toronto market. And so, we're looking at that one.</p>
          <p>Also, a couple of plants that Dow owns that they own &#x2013; since they were a part of Union Carbide. So, we bought back one of the Dow plants and signed a long-term take-or-pay contract. And there are going to be others, and it really has to do more with the financial condition of those customers that they need cash flow.</p>
          <p>But I consider them to be very low-risk projects because we built the plants, we know the plants, we're operating the plants for them right now. So, we know exactly what we're buying. And from a credit point of view, as you probably know, the Sudbury nickel mine is always going to be producing. And Dow is always going to be producing, or the Dow joint venture is always be producing ethylene glycol and ethylene oxide up in Prentiss [Alberta] which is where we bought the Dow plant.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then in the third quarter, you wouldn't have any sequential declines in any regions or any businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't promise that because if I would have promised that second quarter, I was wrong. But I think we're starting to see some startups in some of the industries. I think the area that's the weakest and still has potential decline is in what we &#x2013; in our packaged gas business, which we've see no signs of uptick. Because basically a lot of that goes into welding, and when you have industries operating well below their production capacity, people don't need to buy mining equipment. They don't need to buy Caterpillar equipment.</p>
          <p>And so, a lot of the pickup over the last five years in packaged gases was for welding and related to the capital cycle &#x2013; people building new capital equipment, and that's what's really slowed down. And I'm fairly pessimistic because I just don't think &#x2013; I think the economy has overcapacity in almost every corner of it. And so, I just don't see at least in North America people buying that much more capital equipment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The total business in terms of fracing and oil service is about $150 million business, okay, on an annual basis. And we lost 20 million in sales this quarter. So, on an annualized basis, it went from sort of 150 down to 80, or cut in half. But if you look at the gas futures strip, the market expects gas to be back up at 5 and $6 come January, February, March. And if that is correct, then I think the fracing will pick back up again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a much higher price and it's a strong margin. And the reason the price is much higher is because, for example, we'll have to drive 10 C02 trucks to a site in the middle of nowhere, and we bring in the pumper equipment and a lot of other equipment to actually do the frac job. So, the revenue we get per dollar of gas is a lot higher than our typical revenue. And so, that's why when you look at merchant pricing, there is a mix effect if there's just less of that in the total mix.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you mentioned being a bit more conservative with your assumptions on receivables. But it looks like you've built quite a cushion already because allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables, it's up to I think 7.9% at the end of 2008 and that's up from about 5.8% in 2007 and so on. And your bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues has gone up as well. So, are you being overly conservative or do you need to change &#x2013; do you foresee any other changes in your assumptions in terms of how you treat bad debt and doubtful receivables?</p>

          <p>Well, you never get it exactly right. But I do believe that there are going to be a lot of small businesses, which are still headed into bankruptcy, number one. And then number two, you have some occasional large companies that are in bankruptcy. And one of the things our guys in Europe are focused on is that August is when they close the plants down for summer holiday. And our guys are saying &#x2013; well, there is a possibility that some of those plants will never restart again.</p>

          <p>That's a good question. Basically we've been doing it a quarter forward with the idea that that would be dampening, and that with a plus or minus 10% move in the currency, it might have a $5 million impact. But we looked at that on a currency-by-currency basis rather than all the currencies together. So, we're going to take a look at that and see whether it makes sense to keep doing that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Merchant variable margins -- I don't think I have merchant variable margins shown out separately. And actually the reason we don't have it shown out separately is that the merchant product primarily comes from the on-site product, and it all depends on how much of your electricity cost you attribute to the merchant production versus the on-site production. But together, it's generally about a 50% variable margin.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>These are higher numbers than we normally &#x2013; we would've had a year ago, substantially higher than we would've had a year ago. But we are still looking at cost reductions. We burned through the accrual that we took a year ago for severance. We pretty much burned through that six months ago. So, now the severance that we are taking is coming right through the income statement. But it will be about five million a quarter until we start growing again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions. One, you've already addressed this just now, Jim, but I want to make sure I understand. Roughly speaking, let's say next year and in 2011 &#x2013; how much capital, how much sales are going to come on in tonnage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to get a price here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I have to sort of talk about that on an annual run-rate basis because it comes on in different parts in the quarter. But basically, we're looking at bringing on sales in the order of $400 million a year. A lot of that is very high-margin sales because it's on-site business, number one. And number two, because one of the big contracts that we have for hydrogen, we don't pay for natural gas. So, natural gas is not going to show up in the sales number, but our profit from that capital will show up at operating profit. So, consequently somewhere in the area of 100 to 150 million of operating profit contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, 150 against each of those 400s, I guess is what you're saying, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a high percentage on the 400, but that's the way the numbers work out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Secondly, Liz mentioned some statistics on that acquisition in PST and I think I missed the sales and OI contribution. And will that acquisition be accretive, and if so, by how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The acquisition will not be accretive until probably the second quarter of 2010, because we've got a lot of cleanup work to do. And the main reason this is an opportunity is it was a very poorly run business before. There is a lot of cleanup to do. We're going to close two or three of the seven plants that they operate. So, we're going to have severance costs with that, and we're going to have facility write-offs with that. And so, kind of as a general rule-of-thumb, what we're saying is that the added operating profit for the next six months will be wiped out by the restructuring costs.</p>
          <p>But then after that, I think once we get through with fixing that business and really &#x2013; the goal is to transform PST into a company that is 80% focused or 90% focused purely on turbine coatings &#x2013; jet turbine coatings and IGT coatings. That's where we have a unique technology that's not replaceable or not &#x2013; is not competitive with other people, and those markets are just going to keep growing. So, once we get to that point, I think we'll be able to operate PST at a 20% operating margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the severance and facility shutdowns you just referred to on this acquisition, are they in the numbers you referred to earlier or is that on top of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're &#x2013; when I said that the costs will offset the added operating profit. They're in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of the $27 million, remember in an earlier question you said that that will continue into the second half of this year. Does that 27 include or exclude this PST translation, which you just talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That excludes &#x2013; that was the second quarter. We didn't buy this until the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then finally, if I may Jim, we saw pricing declines in Asia. Asia has oftentimes in the past years has been a concern in terms of price competition. Should we be concerned about further price erosion in Asia or is that somewhat of a one-off thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the primary price erosion in Asia was in electronic gases and specialty gases. And since they have very high margins, especially some of the inert gases, there is price erosion there. I don't think you'll see it continue that rapidly. There is a little bit of price erosion going on in the merchant market in China, and that's largely attributable to the proportion of merchant sales which are made to distributors rather than to end-market customers where we have a long-term contract in healing the tank and so forth.</p>
          <p>And we're really in the process of &#x2013; and it's a big effort of changing the business dynamics in China where historically a lot of merchant gas been sold through distributors &#x2013; it sort of was made by the state-owned chemical plant or whatever and they had by-product &#x2013; nitrogen or oxygen &#x2013; and they sold that to distributors who sold that on to the end-customer. Our focus is that that's not really a very good business model, and so our focus really is on selling merchant liquid directly to end-use customers with the &#x2013; I guess supported by, if you want to call it that, supported by applications technology.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Amy Zhang, sitting in for Bob. Good morning. I have two questions and first one is South America. If we look at the margins on a sequential basis, the second quarter margin is around 18%, the first quarter slightly above 21%. But on your slide number seven, on the sequential basis actually the trend is either flat or slightly up. I'm just wondering what's the &#x2013; can you just provide a little bit more color, why we see this margin contraction on a sequential basis in South America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I think the question is what's happening with margins in South America and why?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the margin percentage, okay &#x2013; if you take what we're showing as a segment operating profit for South America, that includes $11 million of negative hit at operating profit. Excluding that, it would be 81 million or about a 20.6% margin. Now, we also took an extra $5 million of receivable write-off in South America as well.</p>
          <p>So, the underlying business is actually we're getting margin expansion, we're getting more efficient in our cost structure. As you can see at the bottom of page seven, we are getting a significant amount of price increases both year-over-year and sequentially.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Amy, the $11 million hit is the net income hedge we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. So, essentially on a sequential basis, we should see the South American margins to expand in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I think a similar question on North American margins. And obviously, you guys have been doing a very great job in driving the margins actually expansion on a year-over-year basis for the first quarter and second quarter. And I think the average for the two quarters, the margin is about 22, 23% that kind of range and it's above your normalized level of 20%. I'm just wondering going forward how we should think about the margin progression for North American business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we'll be able to keep the margin in that area and particularly as &#x2013; if activity picks up, the margin could go higher. But that margin also is affected by the natural gas pass-through which &#x2013; natural gas prices a year ago were about $10 in a quarter, and this year they were three to $4. So, there is a significant amount of lower natural gas pass-through. And if you want to look up that number, it's in the earnings press release tables and the footnotes to the segment page &#x2013; it shows how much the natural gas pass-through was.</p>
          <p>So, that added 1.5 percentage points or so to the margin which is really a cosmetic thing rather than real. But what we're really focused on now is that we're operating the business in a different way in North America and it's really focused on generating cash flow and applications technology.</p>

          <p>We're pretty much done with cost cutting. We're always looking at where we can find some more efficiency and so forth, and I'm not going to say that we're not going to do more cost-cutting. We've got some more on the way in the area of a couple of hundred people. But nowhere near the 2,000 people kind of number that we did a year ago.</p>

          <p>The second question on use of free cash flow. You bought back some shares in the quarter, but we also saw the Sermatech deal.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and I think I mentioned this on the last conference call, which is that we're trying to take advantage of the fact that we've still got strong earnings. Our earnings did not decline very much. We've got a very strong balance sheet, and there are companies around the world that probably we could use as acquisitions as well as assets around the world that could be bought, which we're going to be taking advantage of the weakness in the economy and strength of our balance sheet to buy them. So, I'd expect to see a continued pickup in acquisition activity as we go through the second half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, if I may, what tax rate would you anticipate for the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The tax rate is 28%. We had a one-time &#x2013; we had a change in the official tax rate in Italy last quarter. And the way you do tax accounting is if you have a change in the tax rate, you have to bring it all and book it all at once. So, that brought the tax rate down to 26% &#x2013; or a little above 26%. Now, because we operate Italy as a 50-50 joint-venture, the part of those earnings which go to our partner is shown in what used to be called "minority interest" &#x2013; I can't remember what it's called now &#x2013; but so, the tax &#x2013; the benefit in taxes, we only really got to keep half of that. So, that was just purely a second quarter thing, and we'll be back to the 28% area for the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>Jim, you had talked a little bit earlier about in terms of where you thought the new projects would be coming from and it sounds like the bulk of the energy with chemicals and metals and basically general industrial down, and looking like there is no need for capacity any time soon. Do you have any concern with the four big players kind of all focusing on the same industry, and now there being basically one big end-market just to focus on, that you may see either enhanced competition or a lapse in discipline from some of the players in the industry?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I don't really. In a lot of respects, we're focusing on different projects. And that's one of the reasons I hate to be any more specific about what we're focusing on than we are. But I don't have a concern of people taking lower returns on projects because there aren't enough to go around and that type of &#x2013; I just don't have any concern about that.</p>
