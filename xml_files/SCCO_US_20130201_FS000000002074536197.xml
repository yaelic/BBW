      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Sandra, and good morning, everyone. And welcome to Southern Copper's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. In today's conference call, we will begin with an update of our review in the metal markets, we will then talk about Southern Copper's key results related to production, sales, operating cost, financial results, expansion projects and capital spending program. After that, we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>Regarding the metal markets and prices, during the fourth quarter metal markets continued to be driven by the negative macroeconomic events that affected consumer expectations, the most important ones being Europe's debt crisis, the so-called fiscal cliff that affected the U.S. economy and the slowdown of the Chinese economy. As we have mentioned before, 2012 was also a transition year with administration changes or elections in several key countries including China and the United States.</p>
          <p>Regarding the copper market, even though we believe this metal's fundamentals are sound, demand has been repeatedly affected by the mentioned macroeconomic factors and the economic slowdown that characterized elections and administration changes. At present, we perceive a more positive environment as some of these matters have been already solved or are perceived to have a more positive outlook from now on.</p>
          <p>In China, after several monitoring easing measures were taken in the second half of 2012, different analysts expect a growth performance in Chinese copper demand of approximately 8.5% for 2013, much better than the 5% growth estimated for 2012. China represented 41% of the world demand in 2012. The expected strong growth of this country and other emerging economies should give support for an estimated copper demand of 5% in 2013.</p>
          <p>In the United States demand appears to be stronger, as consumer confidence has increased and the economy has recovered. This has been reinforced by positive news related to the car industry, the housing market and employment that seem to have offset macroeconomic concerns related to the fiscal balance. Even though  the U.S. represents today about 8% of the world demand for refined copper, the recovery of its economy is key to consumer demand, to copper demand, since the U.S. is the most important secondary copper consumer worldwide affecting copper demand in other economies.</p>
          <p>Finally, after a severe 2012 where European demand is estimated to have decreased by approximately 7%, there are signs indicating a copper demand increase of 2% for 2013. It should be mentioned that Europe is now approximately 19% of the world demand for refined copper.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, we think that several structural factors, such as labor stoppages, technical problems and other issues are still affecting copper supply, reducing the net impact of production timing from new projects and expansions. Southern Copper believes it is positioned to take advantage of this situation through our aggressive investment program for organic growth aimed to increase production from our current capacity of 640,000 tons to 1.2 million tons by 2017.</p>
          <p>Regarding our copper productions, in the fourth quarter of 2012, copper mine production increased by 1.5% to 163,799 tons compared with 161,367 tons in the strong fourth quarter of 2011. This increase was a result of a higher production at the La Caridad and Buenavista mines, partially offset by lower production at the Toquepala and Cuajone mines. These changes in productions mainly were due to changes in ore grades and recoveries in the four operations. For the year 2013, we're expecting to produce 650,000 tons of copper. Of those 640,000 will come from our mines while 7,000 from third party copper concentrates.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum production decreased by 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 due to lower production at the Peruvian mines mainly resulting from lower recoveries. This production was partially offset by record production at La Caridad that had an increasing production of 4.7% due to higher grade on recovery. For 2013 we plan to produce 19,800 tons of molybdenum, which is 8% more than our 2012 production. Of this, approximately 1,700 will come from our new molybdenum plant in Buenavista.</p>
          <p>Silver mine production increased 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012, principally as a result of higher production at our Buenavista mine that increased silver production by 10% and La Caridad that increased silver production by 10.8%. These good numbers or good performance from our Mexican operations were partially offset by lower production at the Peruvian mines that decreased their silver production. For 2013 we expect to produce and sell 16.3 million ounces of silver.</p>
          <p>Steel production; it increased by 11.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012 when compared to the same quarter of 2011. That was mainly as a result of higher grades and recoveries, as well as the gradual production recovery at the Santa Eulalia mine after the closing problems of prior years. These problems have been completely solved.</p>
          <p>In 2012, the company's zinc production increased by 7.3%. For 2013, we expect to produce 99,100 tons of zinc from our mines, a 10% increase in zinc volume when compared to 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding our financial results, for the fourth quarter of 2012, sales were $1.6 billion, slightly lower than sales of the fourth quarter of 2011. Copper sales decreased by 0.4% but were helped by higher prices that increased 5.6% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And regarding by-products, we have significantly better volume sales of zinc. Sales of zinc increased by 18.5% that allowed us to offset lower prices and lower volumes in molybdenum.</p>
          <p>Operating costs, our total operating costs and expenses increased by $71.1 million or 9.3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The main cost increments were in fuel and power costs that increased together $10.1 million. Labor cost increased by $14.9 million, other operating materials, $16.5 million, worker's participation of profit sharing, $17.3 million, exchange rate depreciation increased costs by $24.6 million. And these cost increases were partially offset by lower mining royalties, purchased copper from third parties that we obviously reduce after we have the recovery of our Buenavista operation, and inventory consumption.</p>
          <p>Regarding our EBITDA, excluding the legal fees for $316 million charged in the third quarter, EBITDA for the Year 2012 were up $3,772.6 million. That is a 56.6% margin of EBITDA to sales. And for the quarter it was $894.4 million, a 54.2% margin for the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Cash costs; operating cash costs per pound of copper before by-product credits were up $1.80 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $1.78 per pound in the third quarter of 2012. The $0.09 per pound increase in operating cash cost is the result of the already mentioned cost increments. Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credits, was $0.903 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding by-products, we had a total credit of $342 million or $0.90 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2012. These figures compare with the credit of $337 million or $0.96 per pound in the third quarter of 2012. The higher by-product credits come from zinc, molybdenum and sulfuric acid, which compensate for the lesser volume, lesser values for silver, gold and zinc. With the exception of molybdenum, all by-product prices have increased between the third and the fourth quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>Net income in the fourth quarter was $531.8 million, 32% of sales. Net income attributable to Southern Copper's shareholders in the fourth quarter was the same number with diluted earnings per share of $0.63.</p>
          <p>Focusing on our capital expansion and expenditures, capital expenditures were a record of over $1 billion; $1,051.9 million for the Year 2012. This is a 71.6% higher than what we spent in 2011. The increase reflects our strong commitment to the company expansion programs at Buenavista and other properties.</p>
          <p>In 2012, $615.6 million was invested in our Buenavista projects. In 2013, we will continue our ambitious yet achievable investment program to increase copper production capacity by approximately 84% by 2016 from 640,000 tons to 1.2 billion tons.</p>
          <p>Our Buenavista projects are continuing the development of these &#x2013; we're continuing the development of this $2.8 billion investment program at this unit, which will allow us to increase its copper production capacity by approximately 170%, that is from 180,000 tons to 488,000 tons by 2015.</p>
          <p>The new concentrator with the molybdenum circuit project includes a new concentrator with an estimated annual production capacity of 188,000 tons of copper and 1,850 tons capacity molybdenum plant. The project will also produce annually 2.3 million ounces of silver and 21,000 ounces of gold. The total capital budget of the project is $1,384 million. Current overall progress is 36%.</p>
          <p>Regarding mine equipment, through December 31, 2012 we have received 2 of 8 shovels, 37 of 56 trucks and 7 of 8 drills; and all of these units are in operation. The total capital budget of the project is $504.8 million, and overall progress is 52%.</p>
          <p>The SXEW III Project is moving forward. Plant equipment from Tia Maria has been transferred to Mexico and will allow us to increase the annual plant capacity from 88,000 tons to 120,000 tons. The total capital budget of the project is $444 million, and our overall progress on the project is 39%.</p>
          <p>The final testing of the Quebalix III project concluded in January, and the product will start operations late in February. This project consists of a crushing, conveying and spreading system that will improve SXEW copper production by increasing recovery and reducing hauling costs and the required time to extract copper from mineral. The total capital budget of the project is $75.6 million.</p>
          <p>Regarding the construction of our molybdenum plant for the current concentrator, the final testing of the plant will start by the end of the first quarter of the year. The plant is expected to produce 1,700 pounds of molybdenum in 2013 and to have an average annual production of 2,000 tons of molybdenum per year. The total capital budget of the project is $38.2 million.</p>
          <p>The Angangueo project to develop an underground polymetallic deposit in Michoacan, Mexico, is moving forward as scheduled. After a recent evaluation of Angangueo's resources, we are increasing the milling capacity of the project from 1,200 tons per day to 2,000 tons per day. Therefore, our board of directors approved a total budget increase of $43.7 million from $131 million to $174.7 million.</p>
          <p>The revised production plan indicates that Angangueo will have an average annual metal content production of 10,400 tons of copper and 7,000 tons of zinc in the first seven years of production. Over the life of the mine, average annual concentrate production will contain 2.4 million ounces of silver and 1,500 ounces of gold. This project is scheduled to begin production in the first half of 2015.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Peruvian projects and focusing on the Toquepala expansion, through December 31, 2012, we have spent $231.8 million in this project. These expenditures include initial construction work to build a new crusher and a conveyor belt system to replace current rail haulage and other operating cost, which will allow for future savings estimated at $5.5 million per year.</p>
          <p>Cuajone Projects. Through December 31, 2012, we have spent $136.6 million on two projects to increase productivity for this unit: the Variable Cut-off Ore Grade project and the High Pressure Grinding Rolls project. Current production is showing the initial benefits of the Variable Cut-off Project. We expect that both projects will be at full capacity by the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>In the case of our Tantahuatay investment, this mine, in which we hold a 44.2% interest, is located in Cajamarca in Northern Peru. In 2012, we had recognized $48.7 million in earnings for our share of net income of the mine.</p>
          <p>For 2013, we expect to spend $1.8 billion for capital expenditures at our operations. Of those, approximately $1.4 billion will be in our Mexican operations and $400 million in the Peruvian projects.</p>
          <p>Regarding the dividend, as you know, it is the company policy to review at each board meeting the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, at the close of the market on January 25, 2013, the board of directors authorized a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 26 of this year to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 13, 2013.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us and we will like to open up the forum for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the first question is from Felipe Hirai from Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks, Raul, for the presentation. My question is related to your CapEx for the next few years, and specifically, I just would like to understand what happened with the cash &#x2013; with the CapEx for the Buenavista project, if there was any change in the CapEx, mostly because now you're showing the line of mine equipment with a total budget of $500 million. So I just wanted to understand how this compares with your previous CapEx of $1.4 billion, if there is anything included in this $500 million. Also, because you saw there is some differences between the pieces of equipment that you show, for example, on the number of shovels or trucks. And my second question is related to the Tia Maria project. I can see that listed in your projects, so if you could just give us an update on what the status is, if there is any changes on scope, CapEx and timing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much for your question, Felipe. Let me address first your concern on the capital expenditures. On this quarter, what we are reporting is, we have made a re-class of several expenses that were related to our Buenavista projects. One of them was this mining equipment that was spread through different investment initiatives, and we have now consolidated under mine equipment. And we're showing the budget that this project has. This is not a new expense. This is basically a geographic reorder, to say it so, of our capital budget.</p>
          <p>In certain projects there has been some slight adjustments regarding to their budgets. The current forecast for the company for the years 2013 through 2017 are the following. For 2013, we're expecting to spend $1.8 billion in capital expenses; for 2014, $2.1 billion; for 2015, $1.4 billion; 2016 will be the year where we are completing this package of projects, we should see a reduction in our CapEx expenditures. We're estimated currently about $600 million for that year and for 2017, another $600 million. So that's our current capital expenditures budget.</p>
          <p>And your second question was about Tia Maria. Could you repeat your concern, please Felipe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just before we go to Tia Maria, Raul, I just wanted to make sure, so this $500 million that we see now in mine and equipment, where was those in your previous budget? So was that considered before in the Buenavista project or any of the other projects, or not? And actually, my question on Tia Maria is just a general update on the project? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes. The $500 million in mining equipment was part of our Buenavista project, but was not identified as such. We &#x2013; what we're doing &#x2013; what we have done, it's specifically grouped in several small investments under this mine equipment budget of $504.8 million. On Tia Maria, well, the company has finished first review of the environmental impact assessment study. We're currently working with the local community as well as preparing a final draft that will be presented to authorities during at the end of this quarter or at the beginning of the second quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you, everyone. And my first question is on Toquepala. Could you talk a little bit about it? It seems the CapEx for this year was below at least the previous guidance. Any threats of a delay on that one? And also, I would like to hear your thoughts on news flow about changes in mining taxes in Mexico. What are your views? Anything that you think happened there? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, first on Toquepala, the company is doing some progress in our talks with the local communities. And very recently, we signed an agreement with the Candarave community. By this agreement, the company will spend through the life of the project approximately $98 million for social works with this community. We think that this a good step in the right direction for the company, and that will certainly help the project. Currently, we're still in the beginning of the Toquepala expansion, by 2015. Regarding mining royalties in Mexico, we're still at the very initial stage of the talks. We understand that the government officials are considering this as an option, but we don't have at this point any official clearness on how it's going to be implemented.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Raul. You mentioned the CapEx guidance through 2017. Could you go over your copper production guidance through 2017? And has that changed at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Garrett, thank you for your question. For this year, I mentioned already that we're expecting to produce 650,000 tons of copper. For 2014, we're expecting to produce 725,000 tons; for 2015, 941,000 tons; 2016, 1.181 million tons and 2017, 1.175 million tons.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the CapEx numbers you mentioned earlier, does that include Tia Maria?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question is from Alex Hacking from Citibank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Raul. Thanks for the call. I have couple of questions. First question, regarding the copper production guidance this year, 650,000 tons, is that all from your own mines? Or is that including the third-party concentrate? If you could clarify that it would be good. And then second question, can you give us any guidance on what kind of cost inflation you would be expecting next year? I'm referring to the cash costs before by-products if it's possible? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. Regarding production, our guidance for 2013 includes 10,000 tons of third-party copper concentrates. Now, if we have more production from our own operations, we will replace that copper from third parties by our own copper that as you know is much more profitable than copper that you buy on spot or on the market. Regarding cost inflation, we're expecting an increase in costs before by-product credits of about $0.09, and that increase should be offset by our higher by-product credit contribution through the year. As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase our molybdenum production by a certain amount as well as our zinc production.</p>
          <p>In the case of molybdenum, we are having the beginning of the operation of the new molybdenum plant in Buenavista in 2013 that that will add to our molybdenum based production about 1,700 tons in 2013. In the case of zinc, we are recovering the production at our operations as well as getting better ore grade in some mines and that will increase production by about 10% in 2013.</p>
          <p>So when you value the contribution of these two like products, what you have is an offset in the increase in cash cost. So for 2013, we're expecting to maintain our cash costs at its current level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Raul. Can I ask you just to repeat the guidance for moly production next year? I missed it earlier. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We are expecting to produce 9,800 tons of molybdenum. That's 8% more than what we produced in 2012.</p>

          <p>Yes. In Peru, we have eight unions. These eight unions have about 2,900 workers that on a total labor force of about 4,500 workers, okay? So about 65% of the workforce is unionized in eight unions, I think.</p>
          <p>We already signed a new three-year labor contract with three of these eight unions. These three unions represent 13% of the unionized workforce. And we're currently in talks with the rest of the unions, <mark type="ph" /> the other side (33:10) in Peru, to close a deal, and we're expecting to have a three-year labor contract.</p>
          <p>The labor agreement with the three unions that have already signed are calling for annual salary increases of 6% in the first year, 5% the second year, and 5% for the last year of the three-year agreement.</p>
          <p>Peruvian labor cost, frankly, it's 9% of the total cost of the company. So with this you may derive the effect of this in our costs. It's going to be moderate, basically speaking.</p>

          <p>Well, we're currently having talks with them. Once we have early news on this matter, we will report to the market.</p>
          <p>But currently this is a point where we're having discussions with that are for getting an agreement. We think that these talks are progressing on a very fast, positive way. And we are expecting to have a deal in short time. But we can't report anything else at this point.</p>

          <p>Hello. How are you? I was wondering if you could provide us more guidance on Tia Maria? Perhaps your distribution of CapEx, it will be starting in 2013 or 2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your question. For 2013, we're considering to spend $46 million in Tia Maria. That's our current budget.</p>
          <p>This is continuing to get the approval of the environmental impact assessment through the year. Our CEO has indicated that we expect to have this environmental impact assessment approved in the second half of 2013. We're certainly consider that conditions for that will be having the goodwill from the local communities regarding this project.</p>
          <p>So that's what we have budget. If the project goes ahead, then we will be spending a little bit north of $250 million per year in order to build the plant, and have it finished and in operation by 2016.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello. Good morning. Thanks for the call. Just to clarify some things that you mentioned, the first one is, if I'm not wrong, you said that you are estimating 640,000 of copper production for 2013?</p>
          <p>Second point is you mentioned the CapEx from 2013 to 2017. And as I understand, all these together, it's about $6.5 billion of CapEx for this period?</p>
          <p>And the last one is regarding Tia Maria project. You previously mentioned that you are waiting to receive the approval from the environmental impact by the first quarter of this year, or the beginning of second quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your questions, <mark type="ph" /> Eugenia (37:50).</p>
          <p>First on the production, let me try to clarify the information. We're expecting to produce from our own operations about 640,000 tons of copper in 2013. On top of that, we purchase third-party's copper to fill up our smelters. We expect to produce from third parties 10,000 tons of copper in 2013. Now the addition of those two is an estimated production for the year of 650,000 tons of copper. That's for 2013.</p>
          <p>On the Tia Maria, we will be presenting the environmental impact assessment by the end of this quarter or of the second quarter of this year. That's the environmental impact assessment that the company is preparing for this project.</p>
          <p>In the second half, we should have &#x2013; we expect to have a decision on the environmental impact assessment projects. Obviously, we will certainly like it to be positive and in favor of moving forward with the project. That's what we're focusing on. We're currently working towards that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you repeat your last question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for the previous answer. And the other one is about the CapEx that you mentioned. You said that, in 2013, you will spend $1.8 billion. Then I understand $2.1 billion in 2014, $1.4 billion in 2015, and then $600 million in 2016 and 2017, which implies $6.5 billion of CapEx in mining equipment. Is it okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's in the whole package of the project. The numbers are okay. I will repeat it for the benefit of our audience, as well.</p>
          <p>So for the year 2013 is $1.8 billion. For 2014, $2.1 billion. 2015, $1.4 billion. And then for 2016, $600 million, as well as $600 million for 2017. That's our current expectation on capital expenditures. It's for the whole package of the company projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add that includes about $300 million for maintenance capital expenditures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can you repeat? $300 million of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For replacing equipment that has finished its economic life, we usually spend about $300 million per year.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And the next question is from <mark type="ph" /> Dan Richmond (41:09), private investor. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. My question relates to the number of shares of stock outstanding. Your 10-Q for the third quarter says that there were 845.55 million shares outstanding as of October 25, 2012. Your income statement has 845.6 million weighted average shares outstanding for the three months, but your balance sheet says there's 846.0 million shares outstanding as of December 31.</p>
          <p>My question is did you sell some treasury shares or otherwise issue shares? And if yes, do you plan to continue to do so to finance your CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The second answer is that, perhaps that &#x2013; we don't plan to sell shares in order to raise capital. What we are doing &#x2013; we require financial support for our projects, it's tough in the debt market. That's what we have done in 2012 as well as in 2010 very successfully. We're reporting that in our press release as well. The difference in figures that you indicated, <mark type="ph" /> Mr. Richmond (42:49), is related to our activity, our activity in the market. We go in the market and buy shares on a regular basis. We have a program that hasn't finished yet. And the fact that some of our board members are being compensated with shares, as indicated in our proxy statement. So the number of shares vary around the numbers that you mentioned, 845 million shares, 846 million shares, pending on the time and the year. In this case, you're comparing the numbers that would have as of December 31, which were the mentioned 846 million shares with the weighted average through the quarter, it was 845.6. So through the quarter, we have some activity that at the end of the process, like with the shares at the closing of the year of 846 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Raul. Sorry, just one quick follow-up. Can you remind us what your sustaining CapEx is per year? Is it $400 million? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About $300 million, Alex. I think that's a good proxy for that is our depreciation expense in our financials. It's around a little bit less than $300 million. That's what we are considering at this point.</p>
