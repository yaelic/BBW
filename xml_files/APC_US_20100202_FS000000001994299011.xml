          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Anadarko Petroleum Corporation's Earnings Conference Call. My name is Gerry and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. John Colglazier. Sir, please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Gerry. Good morning, everyone, and I'm glad you could join us today for Anadarko's fourth quarter and year-end 2009 conference call. Please note that during today's call, we will only be addressing our 2009 results. We anticipate providing our 2010 capital plan and guidance once we receive Board approval in a few weeks, and we'll provide a more in-depth overview at our March 2nd Investor Conference in New York. Joining me on the call today are Jim Hackett, our Chairman and CEO, and other executives who will be available to answer your questions later in the call. Also there is an additional information posted on our website in our Fourth Quarter Operations Report.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Jim, I'll remind you that this presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information. However, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases for the risk factors associated with our business. In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release and on our website. We encourage you to read the cautionary note to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this call.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. In 2009, Anadarko delivered some of the strongest operational results in the company's history and we believe these results demonstrate the viability of Anadarko's strategy and the capabilities of its people and portfolio.</p>
          <p>In addition, we think we've set the stage for continued success in 2010 and beyond. Specifically for the year, we delivered record sales volumes of 220 million barrels of oil equivalent, a 7% increase from 206 million barrels of oil equivalent the previous year, nearly three times the growth rate in our guidance since beginning of the year, all while spending about $1 billion less on near-term projects than we did in 2008.</p>
          <p>We significantly improved our operating costs by reducing leased operating expense per BOE by more than 20% year-over-year. We added 314 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves before the effects of price revisions and divestitures, with costs incurred of about $4.7 billion. Using the common definition of finding and development costs in the investment community, this calculates to a very competitive rate of less than $15 per barrel of oil equivalent.</p>
          <p>Our deepwater exploration program delivered extraordinary results in 2009 with nine announced discoveries and an overall success rate of 50%. These discoveries coupled with the positive results from our follow-up appraisal activity provide confidence that we can deliver future material production and reserve additions from our growing list of mega projects.</p>
          <p>For the three mega projects we've already sanctioned, we continued to make good progress moving them closer to first production both on schedule and within budget. We expect Jubilee in Ghana to start producing late this year and the three projects combined should add about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Anadarko by 2012. And currently, our progress in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Eagleford and Pearsall shale programs solidifies our view that these assets will plan an expanded role in our long dated organic growth.</p>
          <p>As I stated earlier full-year production for 2009 totaled a record 220 million barrels of oil equivalent. This was about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent higher than the midpoint of the original guidance that we provided at the beginning of 2009. And again, the 7% year-over-year growth in sales volumes was accomplished while spending about 35% less on near-term projects year-over-year, for a highly efficient capital yield.</p>
          <p>Our sales volumes benefited from 14% year-over-year growth in the Rockies, steady performance in the Southern region, and improved run times in the Gulf of Mexico. We also continued to capture additional value and enhanced margins by focusing on areas of our portfolio, that offer higher liquids yields such as the Wattenberg field. We've expanded these opportunities already this year as demonstrated by our recently announced transaction with TXCO that will add about 80,000 net acres to our existing 180,000 net acreage position in Maverick Basin.</p>
          <p>We like the results we're seeing in the Eagleford Shale with its high liquids yield and felt this was a compelling opportunity. We also gained almost a full years benefit from the cryogenic expansion at the Chipeta processing plant in Greater Natural Buttes area, which we added more liquids to our product stream.</p>
          <p>Turning back to Colorado, the Wattenberg production field contains about 40% liquids and also serves as a good segue to talk about our continued improvements in drilling efficiencies. We drilled nearly as many wells as in 2009 as we did in 2008 in this field with essentially half the rig count. Our improved cycle time and cost savings were also achieved in other operating rigs. In the Southern region about 30% of the wells drilled set cycle time records in the fourth quarter. More specifically, we set records in the Carthage, Chalk, Bone Spring and Marcellus Shale areas.</p>
          <p>Our exploration teams delivered a phenomenal result in 2009 by discovering approximately 360 million barrels of oil equivalent of net risk resources. More than 50% higher than our original estimate that we shared with you at our March Investor Conference in 2009. We announced nine deepwater discoveries in some of the hottest exploration areas in the world, including the pre-salt in Brazil, Cretaceous Fan play in West Africa, and in the subsalt Gulf of Mexico. Two of these nine discoveries were announced during the fourth quarter. They are Lucius and Anadarko operated Pliocene and Miocene discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The discovery well encountered more than 200 net feet of pay. We've since drilled an up-dip sidetrack appraisal well, which we announced last week that had almost 600 net feet of oil pay and very strong reservoir characteristics.</p>
          <p>The second major discovery in the quarter occurred at the pre-salt Itaipu prospect offshore Brazil in Block BMC-32 where we have a 33% working interest. The well encountered more than 90 feet of net pay and a high quality carbonate reservoir. And a recent successful sidetrack is estimated to have added another 60 feet to this pay count. Itaipu like our neighboring Wahoo discovery appears to cover a very wide areal extent.</p>
          <p>The remaining seven announced deepwater discoveries were Heidelberg, Shenandoah, Samurai and Vito in the Gulf of Mexico; Tweneboa and Mahogany Deep offshore Ghana; and Venus in Sierra Leone, which was the first deepwater well ever drilled in the Liberian Basin.</p>
          <p>We are currently drilling the first of four consecutive deepwater wells offshore Mozambique. The currently drilling Rovuma Basin prospect is called Windjammer. Upon completion, we plan to move the rig to drill the deepwater Collier prospect about 50 miles south, southeast of the Windjammer well. We operate both with a 43% working interest. Offshore Ghana, we'll continue to be very active and plan to spud the Dahoma exploration prospect soon. This lies to the southeast of the Jubilee unit boundary in the West Cape Three Points Block.</p>
          <p>The success we've achieved in exploration has lead to significant appraisal activity, which we then plan to transition into development projects. Offshore West Africa, our appraisal drilling activities confirmed and extended the productive area of the Jubilee field south and east of the current unit boundary. And in Brazil, the Wahoo # 2 well gives us confidence that this area has all the ingredients to become one of our next mega projects. The Wahoo # 2 well encountered more than 90 feet of net pay and high quality sands and the recently completed sidetrack to this well brought the total closer to 135 net feet of pay. The results confirm the extension of the Wahoo field five miles to the north and down-dip of the Discovery well on Block BMC-30 in the Campos Basin. We operate the block with a 30% working interest. After we're finished sidetracking Wahoo # 2, we plan to perform drillstem tests at both Wahoo and Wahoo 2 before drilling the Wahoo South exploration prospect later this year on the same block.</p>
          <p>Just in the past two weeks, we've announced two additional successful appraisal wells. The first off the Coast of Ghana was the Tweneboa 2 well, which encountered more than 105 net feet of hydrocarbon pay, include about 56 net feet of oil pay. By drilling this well four miles south and down-dip of the original Discovery well, we confirmed our pre-drill expectations of finding significant oil accumulation with a large areal extent.</p>
          <p>The second was at the Lucius sidetrack well in the Gulf of Mexico in Keathley Canyon Block 875 that I mentioned earlier. This is a major discovery where we have a 50% working interest. We plan to be in the area later this year drilling one or two additional appraisal wells and we'll be working with our partners on potential development options. As I mentioned, we also continue to advance our current mega projects on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>In Ghana, the Jubilee Phase I development is on track to achieve first oil later this year. The FPSO conversion work is almost complete and the vessel is expected to leave the yard in Singapore sometime in the second quarter. At Caesar Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico development activities continued during the fourth quarter, as we drilled the third of four planned Phase I producers. One of these wells, the Green Canyon 683 # 1 sidetrack 2 encountered about 400 net feet of pay, some 1,200 feet up-dip from the original Caesar discovery well.</p>
          <p>Construction and installation work at our host facility, the Constitution spar, is progressing well and the project remains on track to deliver first production in the first half of 2011. In Algeria at El Merk, we drilled three wells during the fourth quarter and this major project also remains on schedule with first oil expected in late 2011.</p>
          <p>We've also made good progress and achieved positive results in our shale plays. We continued to develop our fairway positions and ramp up production in the Marcellus, Haynesville, Eagleford and Pearsall shales. On a gross basis, we are currently producing more than 75 million cubic feet per day and about 1,000 barrels per today with another 50 wells awaiting completion.</p>
          <p>In addition to acquiring the Eagleford acreage I mentioned earlier, we've also enhanced our acreage in the Marcellus Shale by adding about 35,000 net acres to our prior net position of about 315,000 acres.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financials, during the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of about $0.46 per diluted share. As with previous quarters, we provided a break out in the earnings release as to certain items affecting comparability, which increased fourth quarter net income by about $0.42 per share. Discretionary cash flow totaled approximately $869 million for the quarter and more than 4.36 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong with substantial liquidity. We ended the year with more than $3.5 billion of cash on hand, reduced our net debt-to-capital ratio to approximately 31% from about 34% at year-end 2008 and maintained access to our undrawn $1.3 billion committed credit facility.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures were in line with full-year guidance when adjusting for our decision to purchase the Anadarko Corporate Headquarters building in Houston in the fourth quarter for approximately $215 million, rather than renew a less economically advantaged leased.</p>
          <p>We exceeded our 2009 G&amp;A guidance for a good reason. Our employees and portfolio delivered an outstanding year as I've already highlighted. These accomplishments contributed to the creation of an additional $13.5 billion of market capitalization for our shareholders during 2009 and $6.5 billion of incremental value relative to the average of our peer group. By delivering this relative outperformance, our non-officer employees qualified to receive a prescribed supplemental bonus plan. This plan has a very high hurdle and this is the first time that the company's total shareholder return has warranted rewards of this magnitude. I'm proud of the team's performance since passing this hurdle. This non-officer program accounted for the vast majority of our increased G&amp;A. However, our all employee annual incentive plan accrual was also increased to reflect the successful attainment of cost saving initiatives, enhanced margins, production records and reserve additions above targeted levels. Going forward, we fully expected G&amp;A to return to less than $4 per barrel of oil equivalent except for exceptional performance years.</p>
          <p>Turning to reserves, as stated in the earnings release, we added approximately 314 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves during 2009 before the effect of price revisions and divestitures equating to a production replacement ratio of approximately 140%. In line with most of our peers, we chose not to report probables and possibles and reported only proved reserves this year.</p>
          <p>Utilization of the new average price rules did have some effect reflected by the 39 million barrels of negative price revisions that we had due to the approximate 33% drop in marker gas prices period-to-period. Other than that there was a minimal impact on our reserved bookings. With the first year of implementation, we felt approaching this in a more conservative manner was the best way to go. It is interesting to note that if we were able to use year-end prices, our reserves would have increased an incremental 63 million barrels of oil equivalent from the estimated 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent of total year-end proved reserves.</p>
          <p>As of year-end 2009, about 70% of our proved reserves were developed and 30% undeveloped, the same percentage of undeveloped reserves as last year. The product mix also transitioned more towards liquids during the year. At year-end, an estimated 44% of our proved reserves were liquids compared to 40% in the prior year.</p>
          <p>2009 sets the foundation for a lot of positive events in the future and we look forward to providing you with more detail about our 2010 plan once it receives Board approval. And we'll shed more light in our outlook for this year and well into the future at our March 2 Investor Conference in New York.</p>
          <p>With that I'm joined by our executive team and we're happy to take your questions. So, Gerry, if you are ready we can open up the lines.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Ellen K. Hannan of Weeden &amp; Co. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. I had a question on your increase in your acreage position in the Marcellus, if you could talk about where that is relative to your JV with Chesapeake or your other acreage that kind of thing? And also in terms of you mentioned you were running three rigs in the area in the fourth quarter and you plan to increase that through 2010 are we talking a doubling or tripling, a rig a week and can you give a little bit of color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ellen. Excuse me, this is Bob Daniels. On the acreage position, it's intermixed in our overall acreage position that we've already established, so we didn't step out of that. Part of it is in our JV with Chesapeake and part of it was through lease sale that the state held, but that combination just picked up a nice swap of acreage that in filled to the position we already have that we like a lot. So, it took us up to about 715,000 gross acres through there.</p>
          <p>We have talked about adding rigs through the year, I think we're going to try to ramp up to about six, five to seven running through next year at this point and that would not be a rig a week, but a staged plan of bringing those rigs in to start exploring the activity out there. We like exploring the area out there; we like what we're seeing with our activity to date. We've got a couple of wells now that we've operated; we announced that we are over 7 million a day. We're drilling our first well in Lycoming County and testing it right now and we like the results of that, what we're seeing in the way of rates and pressures. So, everything seems to be working well in the Marcellus and we're real pleased to be able to pick up some additional acreage in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes to the line of Doug Leggate with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Couple of things, Jim, I guess starting off with Itaipu, is there any update you can give us on whether or not you guys will be able to or would be interested in taking over operatorship of that or any issues really surrounding the sale that's going on, how that might impact development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, I think as we've mentioned before is that we're happy with our position in Brazil, we like where our working interest is, we've got tons of running room. We don't see in the cards today participating in the divestitures related to that block. And therefore I think it's unlikely we'll get operatorship because that would require us to buy interest and we're not terribly interested in doing that even though we love the prospect. What we think will happen though is we think good value will be achieved for our partner there and I think it will give everyone more confidence about what the position is worth actually to our shareholders as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My only follow-up obviously you've got your Analyst Day coming up so, I'm guessing, we might guess some of this then, but you are talking now obviously 60,000 barrels a day from the three mega projects that you've got running right now, but obviously the queue is getting quite long in terms of potential developments. Can you give us some idea to how you're thinking about prioritizing the multiple discoveries that you've got? In terms of I mean Brazil obviously was stated in your press release as being a potential mega project, but where does &#x2013; if you can just kind of give us a run down as to what you see as the next three or four major developments as you firm up your reserve estimates in these projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think what you'll see is much more that as you mentioned in the Investor Conference, we'll actually kind of tell you &#x2013; hopefully tell you some suggested timeframes for some of these, but we want to make sure on a few of these that we have all the right appraisal activity, all the right science done before we come to you and say, "hey, we're ready to sanction this thing tomorrow." So, we don't want to start giving dates out until we're absolutely sure what that time line would be. I think you should take some confidence from the fact that when we decide to do something, we tend to get it done on time and within budget. And part of that is making sure that we do the right up front science. As you may know that's why Ghana was at a little bit slower going, because we wanted to make sure all that science was done and now we're of course on the cusp of that.</p>
          <p>The big issue for I think all of us is kind of have you got the capital and have you got the people to execute these things and the way that these discoveries are occurring gives us a lot of confidence that the phasing in of these projects for new sanctioning are going to work out really well with regard to the capital flows that we have in the existing mega projects, where those will start dropping down significantly, by the time we'll start to ramp some of these others up. And that looks good from both the production perspective for investors, but also looks good from a project management and capital spending perspective. So, as a general kind of overview we don't see ourselves at this point in a position where we have challenges that are overly daunting and of course as you can readily realize this is high cotton in terms of even thinking about this issue. So, we've got plenty to go have fun with and deliver value from.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had a question for you just following up on the Marcellus that was your operated rig count, do you have an indication as far as non-operated rig count in the Marcellus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. David, our understanding is that Chesapeake is going to be operating 10 to 12 rigs next year in that area that we're partners with them. It will go up and down depending on how they utilize the rigs because they do have additional acreage beyond the area that we're partners, but that's our understanding through 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then there has been a lot of discussion in the Rockies around horizontal Niobrara and you guys are sitting on an acreage position that looks prospective. Can you talk at all about thoughts about horizontal Niobrara drilling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, this is Chuck. We are very excited about our position primarily on the Strip. As you mentioned this play appears to be working its way into our Strip acreage and really started on our Strip acreage. We're well positioned because of the Strip and because of the activity that we've historically done in Wattenberg with the a good understanding of what it takes to drill these wells and how they produce and how to stimulate them and that type of thing and we're going to continue to watch the activity and expand our operations toward it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've permitted some wells, have you drilled anything yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've drilled some in Wattenberg proper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the 360 million barrels of resource potential and as you think about that scope and size, should we think about breaking that out at the Analyst Meeting between the prospects, are they going to stay in kind of the big number tied to the multiple discoveries, just curious how you're going to detail that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, I think we're going to try to give more ranges on the individual discoveries with what we know and then you get a pretty good handle as to how, what their contributions are into that 360 million barrels of resources found.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just, Bob, can you remind us when you're Board meeting is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sir. It is middle of February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to the Marcellus, can you give us an update on infrastructure and permitting developments and just how you expect the Marcellus to play out from a production perspective in your central PA acreage as well as in the JV with Chesapeake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brain, as you're aware it's a area that has the number of large transmission lines that transect it from East to West primarily. And what we're doing now is with our exploration program as well as the follow-on development is taking advantage of that infrastructure, drilling wells essentially along the pipeline quarter where it's both up in the Chesapeake operated AMI portion and then down where we're operating. And we'll continue to do that, that's the speediest way to first production. And we anticipate just expanding off of those areas as we go forward as well as testing inside the acreage for quality and production rates and that type of thing in the interim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And knowing what you know about kind of timing to market and rates of return, do you see better opportunities in the central PA block or in the Chesapeake JV areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both look to be very high quality, we've seen excellent results both in the Chesapeake, our portion of the Chesapeake operated AMI as well as the area that we operate in Lycoming, Centre, Clinton County. They both seem to have extraordinarily high quality rock and good deliverability. We've both seen wells that have come on line in excess of 7 million a day several of which has been facility constrained. So we're seeing very good &#x2013; very good rock as well as good economics coming out of that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. And lastly it's been a few months now since the Venus well boosted your confidence in 30 additional prospects between Venus and Jubilee, can you speak to any learnings since then and provide any more specifics on what your plans are in that area for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, Bob Daniels again. We've learned a lot, I think Tweneboa is one of the biggest learning in that when we drilled Tweneboa the results for Tweneboa 1 weren't that much different than what we saw at Venus 1 but with Tweneboa we had a real high quality of 3D data set that allowed us to tie that data into it and extrapolate away from the well bore and see that we had a very good thicker fan section lateral to us and we could go down-dip and test it and prove out the thicker sand section, better reservoir quality, and get into the oil leg. Venus is exactly the same except we don't have the quality of the seismic data right now and that's why we're reprocessing it. So, we think when we get that data in we will be immediately tie the well bore in and see are we in the best part of it or is there something lateral to us that needs to be appraised.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the CI-105 well gave us a good indication on what we need to be doing to high grade the prospects, so what we've done now is gone back into our Liberian Basin data set which is a new data set we acquired and high graded those prospects. We think that we'll be back drilling in West Africa outside of Ghana later this year and drilling two to three additional wells, probably one in Sierra Leone and one in Liberia and may be one down at CI, but we will finalize that all up and we're out discussing rig options right now.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Real quickly on Lucius, if you could talk a little bit about what you're thinking about for development options? I know, you're still in the appraisal process, but with other people who have drilled right next door is there are possibility of partnering to develop the play and then I believe you also have an interest in Fobish nearby, would that be part of consideration for ultimate development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going give you the guy that won't get in front of his ski tips on this one, Chuck Meloy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was an exciting opportunity for us. We are very excited about the type of rocks that we found down in that area &#x2013; out in the area around Lucius. It's outstanding permeability and porosity. Some of the best we've seen in quite some time in the Gulf of Mexico. This is a little bit younger rock and so it's a better quality rock. And we anticipate very high deliverability out of it. And so what we plan on doing, we have two wells now, one down-dip, one up and we anticipate doing a lateral appraisal well later this year as the rig availability allows us to do that. We will take all that data in, learn from it and we are currently evaluating the different development options that we might have for the Lucius program inclusive of the working with our neighbors at Hadrian. And they go from a range of substene development tied back to a host to stand-alone projects. We are very excited about what Lucius means for Probos on the exploration side and we hoping to be drilling that add-in later this year or some time next year and incorporate that into any development plan that we put together.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just thinking about it from a timing perspective and this is a bit of a guesstimate, but it looks like that you'd have to probably build a spar for that or will you use a spar or are you guys looking at doing that at this point, are we getting ahead of ourselves even discussing that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, those are certainly the options. Certainly in the list of options that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just shifting gears more to the domestic or offshore portion of the portfolio. In the past, you guys have been pretty good about dynamically adjusting the rig count among your portfolio basically optimizing oil and gas, can you give us any kind of direction on how you think you might be doing that going forward? Is there at least it appears a bias to liquids in the near term, am I misreading that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is Al.  Let me try to see if I can help a little bit. And we'll certainly talk more about this in March. But liquids and oil are clearly a part of the equation for us. And I think with most of what you will see us do in 2010 onshore, we have a bias towards gas that has a liquids enhancement. But that's not to say that we won't drill things that don't have that and clearly Marcellus being one of those. But as we look into our deepwater, we pretty much have an oil prospect inventory and that is one of the real advantages of our prospect inventory in deepwater, whether it's in the U.S. or outside the U.S. And I think as you think about how our production profile could change over the next five years, we certainly have a bias in terms of price discovery in and around oil and believe that that will help us quite a bit over the next five years in achieving some things today that very few of our peers can do. Now in the Greater Natural Buttes area, as you recall, we brought on a cryo plant earlier this year. The yield off of that is substantially better than the refrigeration plant we had there previously. And as we potentially increase production in the coming years from the Greater Natural Buttes, you can anticipate seeing more cryo potentially being built by us as a part of that, in order to improve the liquids yield from that gas.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Couple of questions, reserves, can you talk about just a general mix how much international, how much domestic of that 314? And second part of that question, of the 360 that you guys talked about as far as the net resource potential, can you talk about what you booked in like deepwater or Africa or Brazil that give us some color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Dave. It's Bob Gwin. Internationally, we booked very little this year. We booked a small amount of Jubilee about 20 million barrels. The majority of the bookings were onshore, majority of those were in the Rockies, Greater Natural Buttes, Powder River Basin, Wattenberg, et cetera. We did book some offshore U.S., but from an international perspective &#x2013; none in Brazil. So from an international perspective and relative to the 360 million barrels of discovered resources this year, we did not proceed with any bookings on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And David, this is Al. I might add one thing just as you are sort of thinking about Anadarko in anticipation of our March meeting. We really have not been an active company to date with the booking of our shale plays. I think in the coming years, you'll see shale increasingly be a part of our reserve bookings, but for the most recent year, it was less than 1%, which is probably is a little different than some others. And consequently as the change in the SEC bookings have allowed for more PUDs to be brought into shale bookings in particular you may see our PUD percentage increase without that necessarily sending you a negative signal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I guess that would explain the PUD flat year-over-year, Al?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That was a good color. Thank you. Vito, Jim, any timing on or Bob whoever wants to answer any timing on Vito?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, I can tell you what's going on out there right now. We brought a rig back to drill the first egg sidetrack to the original well to take a bypass core, that operation is complete. We were successful in getting the core that we wanted to get the rock property. Then, we kicked off to go up-dip and we're in the process of drilling that well right now should have results probably within a month's time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I assume those are going to be coming from Shell or is that going to be your announcement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shell is the operator of that, so they will be the one that would be talking about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then one more question, obviously don't want to front run the Analyst Conference but CapEx for 2010, can you give us a general &#x2013; just some general ranges of kind of what you're thinking versus cash flow or kind of what's already out there as far as already committed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we've said publicly and I'll restate it is that you should start with the high end of our guidance this year and therefore somewhere around that $4.5 billion level, but we &#x2013; important to note is that we're at current strip prices and hedges we're going to generate, we think somewhere around $5.2 billion for this year. And so we've got a real strong ability to fund the billion dollars in exploration and $1.2 billion of mega projects that we've got commitments on. And then it gives us a lot of flexibility to allocate to near-term growth opportunities. So, we'll be sharing with you where we go from that initial starting point relative to growth in production. That's what you should expect in March.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Question on the Marcellus, how many wells are flowing into sales at this point and could you sort of describe the gathering capacity and sort of how you plan to stay ahead of it in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We currently have around seven wells I believe flowing into sales that we operate and then Chesapeake has in the order of 20-ish that are now into sales, that are flowing into sales and most of which are currently restricted the capabilities because we're essentially running through old gathering systems by and large that have restricted capacity. And we will soon be converting those to new lines and installing new gathering systems and that type of thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a goal you have in mind this year of sort of what type of &#x2013; what capacity gathering you'd like to have in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a particular one, we hope to quicken the pace of our gathering system. We're dealing with the permitting process and right-of-ways and that type of thing. So, we continue to push that. We now understand the process to get it done and we're working closely with all the regulators in Pennsylvania to expand more quickly our gathering system and because we're going to focus primarily around that current drill sites for additional wells, they will be tied in much quicker in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a final one for me. Now that I guess you got your arms around the gas shale and Eagleford or Rockies, you got your arms around the oil shales. Is there an opportunity or is there a longer-term goal to pursue shales internationally and sort of use your international exposure to leapfrog onshore?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Subash, this is Bob Daniels. Of course we've looked at that all the time because this is one of the skill sets we have internally. We do see potential around the world in that type of play. The real difficulty right now is the fiscal terms and the cost structure in these other more remote locations, you have to have a market to sell the gas into and you have to have infrastructure because these are kind of manufacturing type activities and you to have fiscal terms from the state that are quite different than what they are used to. And so there is a lot of work that's going to have to be done on all of those fronts to find an area that really works, but it's one of those things we keep our eye on for the future, but at this point it's not something that we're actively pursuing and think that we will be drilling wells in the next year by any means.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on a great year. I guess, two questions, just one on the very short-term basis looking at the difference between Q3, Q4 production, I know Independence Hub had a significant part of that. I wonder if you could talk about the dynamics of that and without going through too much of what will be covered in the Analyst Call how we could expect that to look in '010 in terms of what potentially could be added to the production mix there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brad, this is Chuck, we gave guidance range of 53 to 54 million barrels for the quarter and came right in the middle of it. We anticipated a number &#x2013; because we gave a very narrow range, we anticipated a number of events like some maintenance on I-Hub. We did a major reconfiguration on the platform and it cost us essentially a week of production. We also had the understanding in the scheduling, the timing of our liftings, for our international activities, oil liftings in the international activities and we bake that into our numbers. And so I don't see a significant change in our production profile going forward, it's just the timing quarter-to-quarter of several of these activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then secondly, I guess, more broadly, Jim, I understand you got to sit down with the President over the last couple of days. I wonder if you could kind a give us an overview of that and it looked like he didn't take the industry's advice in terms of changes to the tax cut at least in his proposed budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think there is some practicality with regard to what he just came out with which is &#x2013; if you may recall it's a bit of a repeat of last year. And they've got to have pay-fors that appeal to their constituency. I'm pretty sure it won't come out the way it's been proposed just like it didn't last year. I think the independents are in a good place with regard to arguing on IDCs, which is the biggest issue there by far. Particularly if we can get the administration to support natural gas. The two things that were notable &#x2013; that followed that meeting for whatever reasons is the mention of offshore oil and gas leasing in the State of the Union but also his comments about we need to do more for natural gas in the GOP meeting that happened after the State of the Union, which is the first time that natural gas domestically was mentioned separately by the President. And I might mention that we have some follow up in that regard that is good from the messages that were delivered. So, I think it was nothing but productive the meeting and I have some confidence that as we play offense with natural gas, we may be playing some defense too with the independents.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a quick follow-up. If I had to think about CapEx and the comment you made about shales and then the comments that you guys didn't book a lot internationally. If I think about that 314 and back off kind of the Brazil or the Africa 20 million barrels and look at a 294 number, what would be the equivalent CapEx to get to that 294? I'm trying to figure out is it 50% of the bookings are kind of on projects, mega projects and deepwater that wasn't booked, or how can I think about that split?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Dave, this is Colglazier. I think, surely that part of that capital efficient base that we talk about and I think we've been pretty vocal on that saying that as you bifurcate our CapEx spending, knowing that we're going to spend $1 billion on exploration, we spend $1 billion on the megas, which accounts for the 20 that got booked that you mentioned. We are down to less than $2 billion that we spent on near-term projects and that's where this 290 million barrels plus, where we are very proud of less than $10 per barrel F&amp;D that affords us. I mean that's pretty outstanding when you look at it on a comparative basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think with the progress we've made too on the margin front with regard to LOE reductions is that you will see us having a better ability to try to convert our resource potential more quickly and of course that's very attractive to us, so you will have us paying a lot of attention to that.</p>

          <p>Thanks everybody for participating. We're obviously very excited about this year and the coming years. I think 2009 was &#x2013; as someone mentioned on the phone was an outstanding year for us, but I think the main thing from our standpoint is what it provides for look a forward kind of view and the ability to deliver continuing value as opposed to past value. So we're really looking forward to seeing you at the Investor Conference in March in New York and sharing more of that with you. Have a great day. Thanks.</p>
