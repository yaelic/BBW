          <p>Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Executive Vice President, Mr. Gary Ginsburg. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Pamela. Hello, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2009 earnings conference call. On today's call Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our CFO. As is our custom, we'll start with a detailed presentation of the earnings from Dave and then Rupert and Chase will offer their perspectives on the future prospects of the company. We'll then take your questions.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp.'s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp.'s form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2009 lists risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from these statements and are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used on this call are expressed in a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of operating income is included in our earnings release and the EPS of net income reconciliation is posted or our website on our Investor Relations earnings release page.</p>
          <p>And with all that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gary, and good afternoon, everybody. As you can see in today's earnings release, we closed out fiscal 2009 with full year's earnings well below last year's level, which is primarily due to the challenging economic conditions we experienced across most of our businesses during the year.</p>
          <p>Besides the impact to our core financial results, which I will cover in a moment, these economic conditions resulted in non-cash pre-tax impairment charges of 8.9 billion, and in restructuring charges of more than 300 million for the year. Of these amounts, $452 million of impairment and $228 million of restructuring charges were recorded in the fourth quarter. These charges primarily related to the actions we have previously announced at FIM. In the prior year we had $19 million of such charges.</p>
          <p>My references to adjusted operating income today reflect our operating results excluding these charges, as well as the United Kingdom land sale gain in fiscal 2008. I would comment that our restructuring activities were designed to better align our costs with revenues so that as our revenues improve, the profit margins of our businesses will improve.</p>
          <p>With that background, I'll start with some summary comments on the fiscal year and then address the fourth quarter. Let's start with our full year results. We reported a GAAP net loss of 3.4 billion for the year, or $1.29 per share. We reported adjusted operating income for the full year of $3.6 billion, which is in line with the expectations we provided to you six months ago and reiterated in May.</p>
          <p>Our Cable channel businesses were the clear standout segment for the year, with 32% profit growth, partially offsetting the declines we had across our other segments, most notably Television and Newspaper and Information Services.</p>
          <p>In addition to the impairment and restructuring charges there were a number of non-operating items that also affected the net loss for the year. This year's result includes $1.3 billion of income and other primarily resulting from the partial sale of our NDS ownership, which was completed in February. Also this year's equity earnings of affiliates includes a $422 million write-down of our carrying value of Premiere, as well as $121 million write-down at BSkyB's ITV investment. Excluding the net income effects of these items, adjusted net income was 3.04 billion this year, as compared to a similarly adjusted 3.5 billion last year. Adjusted earnings per share this year was $1.16, that's, compared to an adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 for fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>In addition as I mentioned last quarter, this year's net income includes a required onetime non-cash tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion, due to the completion of certain multi-year tax audits, which contributed $0.42 to our EPS.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll focus the remainder of my comments on the fourth quarter results. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was $948 million, a decline of 30% from last year. The year ago results have been adjusted to exclude $125 million of income, from the gain on the United Kingdom land sale. Consistent with the full year this operating income decline primarily reflects reduced contributions from the majority of our business segments that more than offset strong growth in our cable channels.</p>
          <p>We reported a GAAP net loss of 203 million for the quarter. In addition to the impairment restructuring charges, this year's fourth quarter net income also includes other net losses of approximately $82 million related to the disposition of certain investments. Excluding the net income effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.19 this quarter, as compared to a similarly adjusted $0.30 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to take a moment to provide some comments on the performance in a number of our businesses for the most recent quarter. And let's start with the Film Entertainment segment who recorded fourth quarter operating profit of $203 million, and this is about 8% lower than last year's result primarily reflecting reduced library contributions from our television production business and the pre-release cost for Ice Age 3.</p>
          <p>Momentum at our movie business continued to improve with a number of recent box office successes, including Wolverine, Night at the Museum and Ice Age 3. We expect that the home entertainment contributions for these films will help drive first half fiscal 2010 Film performance.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, adjusted operating income in the quarter was $95 million, as compared to 279 in the fourth quarter a year ago. This result reflects weaker ad markets, higher entertainment programming cost at the network and the absence of eight stations that were sold last July. And for your reference, the eight stations sold accounted for revenue and earnings of 76 million and $22 million, respectively. Revenue at our remaining stations declined 26%. This is slightly less than the overall TV station market decline of 27%. Virtually every category is down in the quarter with continued weakness from auto, financial, and retail categories.</p>
          <p>Fox Broadcast Network's operating performance was affected by higher programming costs versus a year ago. As you may recall, last year's costs were unusually low due to the writer's strike that precluded running the entirety of 24 last season, and resulted in the broadcasting of several low-priced shows. Licensees and returning shows increased this year, and we had lower prime time ad sales reflecting 11% lower ratings. And at STAR, earnings contributions were down, reflecting the general softness in local advertising markets in India.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Cable Network segment, we continue to show very strong growth with operating income up 39% in the quarter, and this is driven by an 8% revenue increases. The total segment's affiliate fees for the quarter were up 13% in aggregate, and advertising revenues were down 10. From a channel perspective, the largest year-over-year gains in the quarter were from the Fox News Channel, which achieved its highest quarterly operating profit ever, due to higher affiliate rates and increased subscribers. The June quarter's prime time to total day ratings up 31% over a year ago, and prime time was up 45% for the year. The channel was the third highest ranked channel of all basic cable in prime time. FX contributed higher profits, reflecting increased advertising and affiliate revenue in conjunction with lower programming costs.</p>
          <p>The FOX International channel also contributed substantially. This is from higher revenue growth, especially in Latin America and Continental Europe. And the Big Ten Network reported operating profits, as compared to losses a year ago, reflecting last fall's distribution agreement in the Midwest.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Direct Broadcast Satellite segment, SKY Italia reported operating income of $155 million; this is a 57% decrease from the record fourth quarter a year ago. Over 40% of this decline results from a shift in the timing of our soccer package revenue recognition, which we've described in each of our last three quarterly earnings calls. The remaining decline is mostly attributable to higher programming costs from the larger subscriber base, increased soccer cost, and the addition of 12 new channels.</p>
          <p>As against our initial plans the slowdown in the Italian economy, coupled with the unexpected doubling of the VATC to subscribers, reduced our growth in 2009. Despite these factors, SKY Italia's local currency revenue grew 2% in the quarter, driven by a 6% increase in the average subscriber base, as compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>Monthly ARPU for the year averaged &#x20AC;44, which was flat compared to the prior year. The positive effect of the September 2008 price increase on ARPU was more than offset by price promotion. As a result of the VAT increase, and the weakened operating environment, churn increased to 13.6% for the year. Gross additions in the quarter were approximately 167,000, although they were fully offset by churn, resulting in zero net additions in the quarter. This quarter by the way is normally our lowest net additions quarter of the year, principally due to the conclusion of Italian soccer, and we typically have lower marketing cost in the quarter. Net additions for the year approximately were 235,000. And year-end closing subscriber base was 4.8 million. At year-end, over 1.3 million subscribers were taking at least one premium service, such as HD, PVR or a second box, and this represents about 28% of our subscriber base.</p>
          <p>In the Newspaper and Information Service segment, adjusted operating income in this year's quarter was $96 million, this is down 167 million from last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting significantly weaker advertising trends in all markets.</p>
          <p>In the United Kingdom, local currency advertising revenues were down 18% overall, principally from volume and pricing declines at our broadsheet titles, led by reductions in classified advertising. In Australia, advertising revenues were down 18% on a local currency basis, compared to a year ago. Classified advertising revenues declined 30%, primarily from reduced employment, property, and auto advertising, while display revenues were down approximately 12%, reflecting a weak real estate category. Circulation revenues in Australia were similar to a year ago.</p>
          <p>And at Dow Jones, operating results declined largely due to a 14% decrease at The Wall Street Journal for both display and classified declines, as well as lower Information Services revenue. The reduced ad revenues were partially offset by higher circulation revenues at The Wall Street Journal's print and online versions.</p>
          <p>At our Book Publishing segment, fourth quarter adjusted operating income contributions were roughly breakeven. This is down $29 million, compared to last year, and here, this decline reflects the general weaker book market and a reduced number of strong new releases versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>And at our Other segment, we reported a fourth quarter adjusted operating loss of $136 million, $79 million unfavorable to a year ago. The decline reflects the deconsolidation of NDSs operating results from its partial sale in early February, reduced revenues at our Russian outdoor advertising business, primarily from market declines, and a weaker Fox Interactive Media results.</p>
          <p>Against revenue in the quarter of $192 million, we're down 50% compared to a year ago, primarily due to a 22% lower advertising revenue, which includes reductions of advertising revenue at MySpace. As you know, we initiated a restructuring in the FIM business this quarter, including the reduction of over 700 employees.</p>
          <p>While this restructuring resulted in a pre-tax charge of approximately $180 million for this quarter, these actions will enable our Interactive businesses to operate much more effectively going forward. Additionally, we performed a review of our intangible assets during the quarter which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $450 million, and I might add the majority of the $180 million charge was the result of a charge we took for excess facility space that we no longer need.</p>
          <p>And finally, let me address our guidance for fiscal 2010. As you measure our guidance, we're starting from the fiscal 2009 adjusted operating profit of 3.56 billion that we have just reported and excluding from this, the $121 million in operating profit contribution from NDS, which was sold in fiscal 2009 and which will no longer be included in our ongoing results.</p>
          <p>So as you look at measuring growth in fiscal 2010, we're comparing it to a base of 3.44 billion in operating profit for fiscal 2009. And as you look at fiscal 2010, we expect many of our businesses will generate year-over-year earnings growth, these include the further growth of our Cable Networks led by an affiliation deal with Fox News and further expansion of our International Channel. Further, the growth of SKY Italia from new subscriber additions, our Film division should show gains led by the Home Entertainment, and other release windows from the three most recent films, which I mentioned previously.</p>
          <p>Overall we expect that the economy we operate in will not be significantly worse in the first half of fiscal 2010 than the current environment and that we will begin to show modest improvement in the latter half of fiscal 2010, although we still have limited visibility on that point thus, far.</p>
          <p>As a result, given that the downturn in our markets in this past fiscal year didn't fully impact us until our second quarter, we will face some challenging comparisons for the first quarter and the majority of our growth will occur in the last three quarters. In addition, we are currently not forecasting further restructuring or impairment charges for fiscal 2010, therefore, our guidance does not reflect any such charges.</p>
          <p>Taking all these items into account, and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we anticipate our operating income growth rate for fiscal 2010 to be in the high single-digit range above the 3.44 billion fiscal 2009 level that I discussed earlier.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Rupert for his comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon to everyone. The last year has been one of the toughest we've faced in our history. And the results Dave just outlined for fiscal 2009 clearly reflect the sour economic environment that affected our businesses throughout the year. Advertising markets were weakened particularly with a slump in cars and finance are showing some good signs of life. But the tumultuous and unprecedented change affecting the entire media sector and particularly newspapers and free-to-air broadcasters cannot be ignored. I think that the worst may be behind us, but there are no clear signs yet of a fast economic recovery.</p>
          <p>Despite these challenges, we were well prepared to weather this cycle. Early on we restructured and are continuing to transform our businesses to operate even more efficiently. We disposed of non-core businesses and have since managed down our already lean head count by more than 5%. But the rapid changes facing the media business means that no company is going to cost cut its way to global competitiveness. Adjustments have to be made continuously and new opportunities taken that come with this fast changing scenario.</p>
          <p>We have a strong balance sheet with $6.5 billion in cash, after generating $1.1 billion of free cash flow net of capital expenditures for the year. And we intend to use this exceptional position to follow our long held strategy of better aligning our businesses at all stages of development with future growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>We have taken advantage of this prolonged downturn to strongly increase the market share of our leading franchises across the globe, including our already market leading U.S. TV stations. We are determined that our many great franchises emerge from this period stronger, bigger, and more profitable.</p>
          <p>There are a few specific things worth noting that give me great hope for next year and beyond. First is the return of Chase Carey as President and Chief Operating Officer. Chase became the highly successful Chief Executive Officer of DIRECTV when we bought the major shareholder in that company. This was after many successful years at Fox and News Corporation, and it is great to welcome him back. Chase has been a close advisor and friend for years and has proven both inside and outside the company that he knows how to build audiences, manage complex staffs and operate businesses properly.</p>
          <p>We also brought in Jon Miller, our Chief Digital Officer this past year, a new role within the company. He's already making his mark across our global digital portfolio tackling head on the restructuring at MySpace and leading a company wide effort to establish a new economic model to profitably transition our print properties to digital.</p>
          <p>The digital revolution has opened many new and inexpensive methods of distribution but it has not made content free. Accordingly we intend to charge for all our news websites. The Wall Street Journal's WSJ.com is the world's most successful paid news site and we'll be using our profitable experience there and the resulting unique skills throughout News Corporation to increase our revenues from all our content.</p>
          <p>Second, is the operational strength we continue to see across vast shares of our asset base. Most noticeably, we were encouraged by the strength of our Cable Network Programming businesses. For the full year, operating income increased by 32% to $1.7 billion. Fox News Channel's operating profit in 2009 was a full 50% higher than last year and ratings are still skyrocketing. The network has now held the number one position in cable news for 90 consecutive months. With prime time ratings up 45%, compared with last year. As more and more people rely on Fox News to be a source of unfettered news and commentary, our fees for affiliates are now beginning to reflect their strong preference.</p>
          <p>The Big Ten Network achieved its first year of profitability in only its second year of operation and gained distribution in all major pay-TV platforms in Big Ten markets. At Fox Business Network, we're well ahead of our subscriber targets. As we close our second year of operations, FBN is now seen by close to 50 million subscribers and after completing our recent deal with EchoStar, we expect those numbers to continue to grow quickly.</p>
          <p>We're seeing even more growth abroad, where we continue our long term strategy of strong brands with a solid foothold in emerging markets. Fox International Channels added 25 more channels this last year in Europe, Latin, and south America, and saw its operating income increase in all areas.</p>
          <p>We're also pleased with our pay-TV leadership in Europe where we are more focused than ever on developing direct customer relationships. In Italy for example, despite high taxes, high competition and a dismal economy, SKY Italia increased its penetration to 4.8 million subscribers. As Dave mentioned, this growth driver is facing some challenges but we are increasing our competitive edge in this underpenetrated pay-TV market with better technology and more choice to service a more stable and profitable subscriber base.</p>
          <p>In Britain, BSkyB's edge in high definition, personal recording, broadband services and telephony has also helped to increase subscriptions. BSkyB is by far the U.K.'s leading pay-TV provider and now the country's fastest growing telephony provider. With the rebranding of our affiliate Premiere as Sky Deutschland we will bring the same high service and premium products that have done so well in other European markets to perhaps the continent's richest economy.</p>
          <p>It's not just Western markets either. In the world's largest democracy, STAR India is now a true national broadcaster of Hindi entertainment. Of the country's 20 major language groups, we now address half. In our acquisitions of AsiaNet in south India will only increase our regional strength. We have recently commenced a full operational review at STAR to take advantage of the opportunities we will have in Asia in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With Filmed Entertainment, although we knew we would be down, compared to last year's record result. We did enjoy a very good second half of the year, with major releases beginning with Marley and Me and Taken. More recently we had hits with Night at the Museum 2, X-Men Origins, Wolverine and July's animated blockbuster, Ice Age 3, which is the highest grossing animated film ever outside the U.S. Together these three releases have grossed more than $1.4 billion to date and are poised to generate robust profits as they go through secondary markets in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year, box office for the entire film industry is up 7% thanks, largely to a reinvigorated approach to 3D. And we have high expectations, very high expectations that James Cameron's 3D Avatar during the holidays, as well as the Alvin and the Chipmunks sequel. We have an extremely promising slate of movies planned throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me specifically address briefly some of the challenges facing our print businesses. As I and others have said before the traditional income business model has to change rapidly to ensure that our journalistic enterprises can return to their old margin's profitability. The extended downturn has only increased the drumbeat for change but the secular challenge is clear. Classified advertising revenues will never again reach the levels that print once offered. Quality journalism is not cheap and an industry that gives away its content is simply cannibalizing its ability to produce good reporting.</p>
          <p>The increase we have seen in our Wall Street Journal subscriptions since we acquired the paper proves to me that the market is willing to pay to get quality without any special market. And we have tens of millions of readers. In Britain, The Times of London, and the digital release now reaches more than 16 million people across the globe every day. In the U.S., The Journal is the only newspaper that has actually expanded both its print and online subscriptions during this recession. Additionally, you can now also read The Journal on your Blackberry or iPhone. We intend to be platform neutral, but never free.</p>
          <p>Intense research and development has been done by many companies to produce convenient and inexpensive mobile reading devices. Right now we are working with software, hardware and other publishers within the industry to develop a model that works for consumers. Beyond the economics it is crucial we maintain a direct relationship with our customers.</p>
          <p>In closing, as Dave mentioned a few minutes ago, we expect to improve our operating income in fiscal '10 by high single-digits over the current year. In spite of a very good July, we expect a tough few months ahead. But we're confident we will achieve those numbers. We're entering fiscal 2010 with a solid portfolio of streamlined businesses, the right management team with a firm resolve to improve and expand all our products.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn it over to Chase for a few words he'd like to say before we take your questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rupert. I'm extremely excited to be here at News Corp. I enjoyed my tenure at DIRECTV and believe that business has an exciting future ahead of it, however, the unique array of content and distribution businesses that compete across the globe without fear at News Corp. really made this opportunity irresistible.</p>
          <p>These are businesses I know well, and they have great management teams almost across the board and Rupert Murdoch providing the overall organization a vision, ambition and energy that has defined News Corp. for the more than 20 years I've known him.</p>
          <p>One thing that made News Corp. uniquely appealing at this point in time was that I believe the company has a great opportunity to take our business to a whole new level in the next few years. I'm not making light of today's issues. We're in an industry that seems to be in a state of shock from the combination of the economic crisis and the digital revolution.</p>
          <p>As Rupert noted in commenting on 2009, we certainly have felt the impact of these changes. Nonetheless there are opportunities at News Corp. today to both take businesses that is are performing well to new levels and to address more troubled businesses with plans that maximize their value. Examples of businesses performing well include our Cable Networks and distribution platforms. However, these businesses are still not close to their potential. Our Cable Channels Group should continue to get stronger and expand both in the U.S. and in international markets.</p>
          <p>Likewise, our international platforms will grow as the world follows the U.S. in expanding pay television platforms. Realistically the international market as a whole represents a great growth opportunity for News Corp. I believe international growth will exceed that in the U.S. and our business and we are ideally positioned to take advantage of it.</p>
          <p>We clearly have other businesses like broadcasting and print that have struggled in the last few years. On the broadcasting side we have an ad-supported business model that doesn't work. We need to get value for our great event products like the NFL and American Idol. We need to build new distribution models in a digital world that generate real value for our product. Both our network and stations need to have cost structures that makes sense for the business looking forward.</p>
          <p>From a print perspective we fully recognize the challenges facing the newspaper world. We're better positioned than most with a unique franchise in The Wall Street Journal that serves a different type of core customer and market leading franchises in the U.K. And Australia. However, we know we're not immune to the issues facing the business. We believe customers value quality journalism. We need to get paid for our product as it shifts to the digital world.</p>
          <p>Equally we need to be disciplined in operating these businesses with our eyes, open to the risks and challenges to ensure we build lasting value and returns on our investment. We must have plans in place for every business from MySpace to Dow Jones Newswires to maximize the potential value while establishing priorities for News Corp. as a whole.</p>
          <p>I guess my overall message is that we know we have to attack our business, every business with a sense of urgency and focus. We also need to be opportunistic about building ways the businesses work together and new business models. For example, at Fox, how should the production, network and cable businesses work with each other in this rapidly changing world?</p>
          <p>All these issues are opportunities, our content has great value but our industry is going to change in every way. Rules of business and cost structures will have to change as will the companies competing. This uncertainty creates an opportunity for those who can build on the strengths, act decisively in building new profitable business models, be disciplined in allocating resources where the reward warrants the investment and the determination to do what it takes to succeed. News Corp. is ideally positioned to win in that environment.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I'll give it back to Gary.</p>

          <p>Thanks, I have a &#x2013; just a quick question for Dave on guidance. And then a question for Rupert. Dave, within the guidance, can you give us what your revenue assumption is?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mainly with respect to &#x2013; this is overall our revenue, with respect to the Newspapers and Television businesses, down roughly low double-digits, very low double-digits and overall, if you look at the company overall, our advertising should be about flat.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And then, Rupert, just to follow up on what you were discussing regarding the balance sheet, the trends of the balance sheet, when you look at growth, I'm just curious if you can flesh out what kind of opportunities are exciting to you and are you more inclined to buy or invest within &#x2013; so is it like a buy or a build strategy?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've always found that we get best returns by building rather than buying. That's not to say we wouldn't take any particularly great opportunity. But we have a lot to do and I think Chase mentioned it, and I have mentioned it, we have to face the challenges facing free-to-air television and newspaper &#x2013; and digital newspapers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I just want to follow up something Rupert said. And I have a question for he and Chase on broadcasting. You mentioned in your comment that you had a very good July. Can you talk a bit about what made July very good, then I'll get to the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's across the board. Not in newspapers but elsewhere, we saw some life in the advertising market.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if I could just turn to the two of you guys, Chase and Rupert. Clearly, what Chase said in his comments essentially getting paid for quality TV like the NFL. Does this mean you will start seeking paid-for-carriage for local stations from cable operators and if so what kind of timing has to be done given that you just renegotiated some of your cable deals for Fox News? So if you talk a bit about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess it was probably a more holistic comment that really addressed it on every level. I mean, I think from a network perspective you need to deal with, production costs and the relationship you have with production &#x2013; producers, to affiliates to certainly the digital world, windows and retransmission is certainly part of it and I guess as with all our deals that come up in various points in time. But I think we have to use all the tools we have, and we certainly have tools. I think some tools we probably haven't used well enough recently, to use all those things to really address the issues in that business. If we create great event programming, it has a great audience and even in a fragmented world it's still, by a large margin, the best and most popular programming out there. We need to work on every front we can to really get value for that property.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. First question is for Dave. In the context of your 2010 guidance, can you just help us understand how you think currency and FX will impact the guidance you put forth and how much in cost savings is in your guidance from the restructuring charges you took in '09 in your 2010 guidance? And just real quick for Rupert, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the upfront market in terms of CPM and sellout for both the broadcast network, as well as the cable channels. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Forex really doesn't have much of an &#x2013; at least with respect to our guidance it has very little effect. If you look at the rates that we're using at year-end are pretty much the rates that we're assuming. So, today there's probably a bit of a benefit, which is not in our guidance because of the weakness in the dollar. With respect to the cost cutting we've done, if you look at this broadly, we would have taken about 2% of our cost out in 2009 and another 2% of our cost will come out in 2010. Unfortunately that's being offset largely by around a 4% revenue decline over the same period of time so it's about at that level.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the upfront, we're quite happy with the progress that we are making. All would I say is that we are doing well. We think we are doing well on the pricing, but we will probably keep more open for spot later in the year. The spot market at the moment is very active. We're selling a lot of spots either at last year's upfront or better. So, there is money around. I'm not saying there's a fast recovery or anything like that. But we are in the process of reaching understandings with a lot of advertisers. I can't be more specific than that.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you. If you don't mind, I have one for Rupert, and one for Chase. Rupert the question is how much in terms of operating losses at some of your structurally challenged businesses are you willing to sustain at this point? Examples being newspapers, I'm just wondering in your mind how do you evaluate that? Is it possible that you may decide to shut down some of those businesses?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anything's possible but that's certainly not a prospect at the moment. For instance, we could do a lot of cutting, for instance, with The Times and Sunday Times in London. But we are keeping the quality, we are not touching the journalists and if anything we're improving it. We want &#x2013; with every other type of cost associated with it, we're cutting because we want to come out of this with much stronger franchises than we started, and there are already signs publically admitted of pain and possible closures of one or two of our competitors. So, our policy is to win.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A question on your Film business. Roughly 25% of your operating profit ex-NDS is going to come from Filmed Entertainment this past year and I assume even more next year is going to be one of your key growth drivers. When you look at what's going on in the home entertainment market on the DVD side, specifically with redbox and the growth of rental, there seems to be widely differing views among the Hollywood studios. I'm curious how you plan to deal with it, what you are or aren't doing with redbox, and kinds of how that evolved?</p>
          <p>And then just a quick follow-up for Dave, just if you could clarify on Dow Jones, could you give us a sense of what Dow Jones' profit either for the quarter or for the year was, how to just think about the actual business? I know you've given some detail on it in the past? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'd say on redbox, I think it's a real issue for us. I mean, I think our product rented at a dollar in the rental window is grossly undervaluing it, and I think it's a real issue. And we are actively determining how do we deal with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just add to that sentiment. The home entertainment market at the moment, not including VOD, is down about 5%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's really too early to say whether that's circular, or the recession.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But within that 5%, the selling of DVDs is down a lot more with rental picking it up, which is I think less profitable for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not sure in an overall face &#x2013; they're &#x2013; it's a pretty recent phenomena. If you look at the numbers at a whole it's probably not a big driver, I'm not diminishing the issue. I think redbox is, as I say, a dollar rental is clearly and issue for us. But and certainly, the sales business is the heart of it, and it still is the driving aspect of the DVD business.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. A question for Chase and Rupert. Just curious what your view is on TV Everywhere concept for your cable networks. Rupert, you mentioned you wanted to be paid for your online news sites, do you think online viewing of your cable network should be free or an incremental fee. And Chase, you're a fresh set of eyes, to all these business models with your return. I'd just be interested in both your comments on TV Everywhere. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I do think we have to in all these places, move our business places where we're a developing dual streams revenue. I think TV Everywhere has benefits to it that probably in some ways more defensive than offensive, so I think we need to likewise, develop offensive ways that we're creating incremental value not, I think the heart of TV Everywhere is really defending existing models &#x2013; defending the unique existing models, essentially cable networks and the like, they're taking an important step, but I think we need to develop what I guess what I'd call is more offensive ways to whether it's new windows or other vehicles for availability and other business models to create incremental value for our product.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean you pursue TV Everywhere and then try to do incremental things, or are you saying that TV Everywhere doesn't accomplish those goals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; TV Everywhere has benefits to it, but I don't think it is the &#x2013; I don't think that is the answer entirely is &#x2013; there needs to be a more, a broader brand &#x2013; a broader, larger strategy that is really geared towards growth and expansion. So, I think it's a part of it, but I think what I'd envision is certainly a wider, and a broader strategy that again has ways of generating, incremental revenues out of it, not again what I think at the heart of this is mostly defending existing businesses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I've probably got a question for Chase. I was interested in your comments saying that the international growth provides a great opportunity for News Corp. and will likely exceed the U.S. I was wondering if either yourself or Rupert had given some thought to consolidating some of the businesses internationally which may have higher growth than your core business, such a BSkyB, Premiere, FOXTEL, or Sky New Zealand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my view and I'd rather not comment on speculation on specific deals, I think those are great businesses. I do think we are uniquely positioned, not just in the strength and the breadth of our businesses but our ability to operate businesses in places like that, I think the competitive environment in those environments in many ways has benefits certainly, compared to the U.S. and clearly, is nowhere near the same level of maturity. And I think those businesses are going to in a lot of ways follow what you've seen in the U.S., so I think we do look at it as a place we're going to take advantage of.</p>
          <p>What are the specific structures and the like? Again, I wouldn't comment on specific structures other than to say that whole list is a list of places that real opportunities for us to build those, to marry content, to those distribution, obviously the Fox International Channel has become a really growth area for us, so how do we continue to build on the distribution on the channel side to really drive those together, to really continue to distinguish ourselves in the international marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the international channel, just on those obviously becoming a much more material driver of growth the for Cable Networks business. Are you able to break out where you think that business can sort to get to in a five year view at the operating income line?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The international channels. Yeah, I mean, look, I think in many ways the international market obviously is not at the same, said a couple of times, a broken record not at the same level, in development so there's a lot of room, because some places we're probably further along, Latin American business is strong, but there are lots of places there we can -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me just say that we think that on a worldwide basis in the developing markets, pay television, whether it be satellite or cable, is expanding steadily at 15% per annum. And we intend to ride that and we will see that in the results from Fox International Channel.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. I have two for Rupert and/or Chase. On the newspaper side you talked about the fact that classified revenue is going away and is not going to come back at least to the level it was before, that's a big percentage of the overall top-line. It sounds like you think you can largely replace that with digital fees, either on the advertising side or subscription fees. Can you just sort of walk us through how that takes place, and do you think that can actually occur if you're sort of news competitors, New York Times or maybe more local papers in other markets, if they don't follow that model, can you in fact, go through with that, and make that work or your assets? And then I have a follow-up on Germany.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>They seem to be all working on different models at the moment, but we're certainly satisfied that we can produce significant revenues. We're very hopeful that we can produce significant revenues from the sale of digital delivery of newspapers &#x2013; news content.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Rupert, any guidance you can give us on how much you think you'll be investing in Sky Deutschland. As you know, Germany has been a tough market for a long time for pay-TV operators to really drive a lot of ARPU gains. They don't spend as much money in Germany as they do in U.K. and the U.S. How do you change that dynamic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the capital raise that was just completed in Germany, the business should be fully funded through cash flow breakeven. So, we wouldn't anticipate putting any more money in at the moment.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Given your more, somewhat more optimistic outlook for the marketplace over the next year, what do you need to see to reenter the market for your shares under the existing repurchase plan? What's your target leverage ratio in terms of net debt to EBITDA? And then also, if you were to reenter the market what drives the decision to purchase voting shares versus non-voting shares, and are there any limitations there, is it simply an economic decision? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Well, it's certainly an economic decision, and the extent has been to handle our cash, I think the only regrets we have is that we didn't take advantage of the 4.99 price  four months ago.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you. You guys had net subscriber additions of about, I guess that 235,000 number at SKY Italia last year. With the increased competition, to what extent do you think you'll need a pick-up in promotion and marketing, and how much pressure do you think there is in ARPU and with the weak economy, what level of net additions are you looking for, for 2010? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are deliberately, depending on the state of the impending economy aiming rather lower this year in terms of net additions. In other words, we are not spending more money on marketing. And less, if anything.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, my question is just given &#x2013; are you essentially saying that you don't see material profits coming out of FIM, given the magnitude of the write-down? Is that sort of the right takeaway or that's the wrong takeaway?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that's the right takeaway. What we did is we have an obligation to look at our assets based on certain accounting rules. At the end of the year that's what we did. And as a result of that evaluation, we took a write-down. But that does not change our belief in the outlook or the profit expectations for the business.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The tax rate for '010 was about 35%. With respect to the growth rate, with respect to our guidance, it assumes the expectations of &#x2013; that our sell-through and our &#x2013; I'm not going to go through the details of it, but it reflects our expectations for the sell-through of our principal titles.</p>

You said you'll make a lot of money there, but as you also said the home entertainment market is declining and more people are renting from redbox for just a dollar per night. Do you think these movies can make as much in home entertainment as they would have if they came out a year or two ago and if not what are you doing to try and address that?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, so much. Chase, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about getting paid for TV content in the digital age. What do you think is the more likely the model, charging consumers or charging cable operators let's say for the broadband system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at this point it's a work in progress, so I've been here 30 days. I guess you need to develop, you need to look at it from every possible angle. So, that's probably not going to get out in front of it, and sort of provide a preference for one or the other. I think the general direction, I think is quite clear, and I think we need to look at it every which way. And in a multidimensional not just, I think we can use windows, we can use a lot of tools there to try to get a sell opportunity. I think you have to. I think we've got great products that if we are, don't get hung up on trying to protect the past try to bend old rules and the like and really, look at taking advantage of these things and that we can create business models that get us paid, for great products.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I know all &#x2013; you said some comment about the out front earlier on, but I hope I can go down a little bit deeper. We've talked to ad buyers, they estimate that all the five broadcast networks in the U.S. are down for prime time volume between 10 and 15%, and that sell outs are about 50 to 70% versus 80% in last year's market. Can you tell us how if Fox came in those ranges or if it did better or worse?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I was hoping to piggyback a little bit on the discussion about digital delivery and the discussions with hardware and the software firms. Is it possible that the company would build its own software products or own hardware product along the lines of a Kindle or Sony Reader?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a software product and we have a lot of unique software that we use with The Wall Street Journal. Would we have our own reader or receiver of this? No, I think that's highly unlikely.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Highly unlikely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're not in the hardware business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to clarify what you said earlier, when you said you want to charge for all the news sites. Did you mean news sites, including things like Fox News or you meant just newspapers' websites?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It certainly includes Fox news. It has a huge and loyal and profitable audience already. I'm talking about its website.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We go to Staci Kramer with paidContent.</p>

      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Staci Kramer. And Rupert, I was wondering if you could tell me where you stand with charging for The Wall Street Journal apps on Blackberry and on iTunes and also, if you've had any further conversations with Amazon about finding a way to develop customer relationships through the Kindle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We are changing the price of the Journal on the Kindle, and we will get a better share of the revenue, although I can't say that I'm satisfied that it's the final result that we want. But it will be a lot better. But it's not a big number. And we're not encouraging it at all, because we don't get the names of the subscribers, Kindle treats them as their subscribers, not as ours, and I think that will eventually cause a break between us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And doesn't the same situation exist with iTunes though on Apple?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the same would apply to them.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the &#x2013; well, Apple's not there yet. I guess I can't answer that exactly. Apple is said to be coming out with a reader before the end of the year. Certainly Sony is doing that, and we're in active discussions with them and they certainly accept that the subscribers would be our subscribers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="28" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of iTunes how does the situation &#x2013; how is it different for you there and when will you start charging?</p>

      <speaker id="29" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to ask one question. The Federal Communications Commission of the United States I think is going to do a scheduled look at the media ownership laws in 2010 to see whether it needs to change anything for what companies are allowed to own in particular, markets. Any chance that you'll be talking to your congressmen, to anybody down there in Washington, D.C. regarding changes that News Corp. would like to see so that perhaps it can change its footprint in places like New York?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think we're very happy with our footprint in New York. And I'm yet to frankly, to make a call on the new Chairman of the FCC. We were certainly very welcoming of his appointment because of his experience in the industry and knowledge.</p>
