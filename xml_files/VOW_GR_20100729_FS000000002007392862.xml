          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volkswagen's conference call on the results for the period January to June 2010 based on the interim report we published this morning. I'm joined today by Hans Dieter P&#xF6;tsch, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG responsible for Finance and Controlling, and by Christian Klingler, Member of the Board of Management, Volkswagen AG, responsible for Group Sales and Marketing.</p>
          <p>As usual you can also follow the webcast and download the chart from our website www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Questions can be sent by e-mail or called in.</p>
          <p>After the presentation, we will first respond to the questions of analysts and later under those of journalists.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand you over to Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and allow me to add my warm welcome to those of you joining this call today. In June, we released an ad hoc statement advising that we were expecting a good first half in 2010. I'm pleased to report to you today that our unit sales and operating profits have indeed considerably outperformed our initial expectations in the first six months, with unit sales of almost 3.6 million cars, trucks, and buses, that's up 500,000 units on the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>It was an operating result more than double at &#x20AC;2.8 billion. As we stated during our Q1 call, the German car market remains weak following the ending of the scrapping supports however, our exposure to the emerging growth markets, including, of course, China, coupled with good performance in the main Western European markets outside Germany and in the U.S. has been key to our positive performance.</p>
          <p>Our excellent brand mix has ensured that we are perfectly positioned for the upturn we have seen in the premium sector while we continue to benefit from excellent design and leading fuel efficiency combined with localized design in the demanding volume car business.</p>
          <p>Our exposure to heavy trucks is paying off too as the world economy shows some early signs of improvement with an excellent performance of Scania and good progress at MAN. Our solid business performance is reflected in the Automotive Division's net liquidity, which continued to improve ending the period at an excellent &#x20AC;17.5 billion, which includes the remaining &#x20AC;1.1 billion received in April from the March capital increase.</p>
          <p>This strong liquidity provides an excellent foundation for the implementation of our Strategy 2018, as well provide protection should the economy turn out to be not so favorable and note of caution, I will return to you later in the presentation. But for now, Mr. Klingler, it's over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, also warm welcome from my side. On this chart four, you can see the development of the world car market last year, through to the first half of this year and comparison to the previous year.</p>
          <p>After dramatic decline of 17% in the first half of 2009, the world market showed the first times of relief in the second half of the year. The market recorded further growth of 15% in the first half of 2010 at least bear in mind that most of the growth of the world car market was due to governmental support.</p>
          <p>And however I must add a note of caution. As the car market has started to decline from May 2008, the comparison with the previous year figures show signs of improvement in relative terms only while in absolute terms, the market has stabilizing on a very low level. To avoid the statistical distortion, the comparison to the last normal year of 2007 is appropriate. That you can see on the chart five.</p>
          <p>The second half of 2009, in many cases, the markets were mainly as a result of the positive influences of the governmental support measures in many markets. The first quarter of 2010 almost reached the same level as in the normal year 2007, driven by additional registrations of vehicles contracted in late 2009 before the ending of the scrapping incentive programs in many of the major markets.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter of 2010, we can see a normalization of the market trend as the positive effect of the incentive programs started to fade out. However, our latest estimation suggests a decline of the overall market in the second half of the year due to the ending of the support measures in major European markets. This will make the second half of 2010 a difficult period for the whole automotive industry.</p>
          <p>The car market in Europe, especially by the way in Western Europe, is expected to contract further in 2010 while North and South America, as well as Africa are said to maintain the recovery, which had already started in 2009. Despite continuous growth in Asia and robust recovery in North America this year, the world car market will fail to reach its pre-crisis level. Starting with the second quarter of 2009, our deliveries to customers have shown a positive year-on-year development.</p>
          <p>The first half of 2010, the Volkswagen Group again outperformed the overall car market. This was supported by the development in China with plus 46%, North and South America plus 19 and 4%, as well as certain Western European countries such as Spain and UK.</p>
          <p>Overall, as a result of our outperformance, we continue to gain global market share. But due to the shift in the relative importance of some major markets within the regions, we expect a challenging second half of 2010 in terms of market share performance. For example, after a year that was highly influenced by the scrappage incentives in 2010, the German market is set to lose some of its shares of the total Western European sales. This puts additional pressure on the performance of the Volkswagen Group as we have an extraordinary strong market position in Germany.</p>
          <p>Well, let's take it differently, we are increasing our market share in Germany, we're increasing our market share in Western Europe without Germany and if you add to that, the increase is much less tangible.</p>
          <p>Looking at our performance on a regional basis, here you can see the success of the Volkswagen Group in direct comparison to the markets around the world in the first half of 2010. We have outperformed the market in every region with the exception of South America as the Brazilian markets were more strongly than our deliveries with a tough competitive situation, new players in the market and the life-cycle effect of the SpaceFox, which we just have launched.</p>
          <p>In Central &amp; Eastern Europe, our deliveries to customers declined slightly in comparison to the last year by 0.5%, but even here we are still better than the market, which declined by 6%. The decline in this region was caused by several markets, but mainly because of the Hungarian market, which contracted heavily by about 50% due to the severe impact of the crisis on consumption and investment.</p>
          <p>Now looking at the performance of the individual brands of the Group. The first half of 2010, our deliveries to customers exceeded last year's level by 15.8% and all brands achieved an increase in terms of sales. Volkswagen Passenger Cars deliveries were up by an impressive 16.2% to more than 2.2 million cars, driven by strong demand in China, Western Europe, and North America.</p>
          <p>Audi recorded the highest growth in the Group delivering 19.1% more cars than last year, up to 555,000 cars. Premium brands only marginally benefited from the stimulus programs in Europe and the United States, so as the world economy begins to recover, we anticipate growth for this sector of the market.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda and SEAT recorded growth helping them to maintain their market shares in a recovering market environment. Bentley benefited mainly from growing wealth in China where deliveries more than doubled as well as from the recovery of the U.S. market. Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and Scania participated in the recovery of light and heavy trucks market, especially in Brazil. Deliveries of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in total increased despite the exclusion of the Brazilian trucks and buses, which are now part of MAN since March 2009.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the deliveries in absolute numbers by market areas compared to last year. Due to the massive decline of the German car market, about minus 29%, after the end of the scrapping program, our deliveries in Germany decreased only by 15.8% whereas our deliveries in Western Europe more than compensated this as a whole increased by 5.4%. In the Asian Pacific region, our deliveries were up over 1 million, which means an increase of 45%.</p>
          <p>Now a few highlights on some of our new models, which will provide a strong base to our sales performance in the coming months. The Volkswagen Jetta is a German-engineered, affordable and sporty compact sedan. It combines agile and efficient trimmed dynamics, sporty German design with a functional detailed oriented interior. The Jetta will hit the road in the U.S. in August this year.</p>
          <p>The Audi A8 L is a prestigious, chauffeur-driven sedan. The comfort and rear seat entertainment makes it perfect for traveling. Its new panoramic glass roof offers more light and sense of space. In combination with the V12 engine, it becomes the most luxury Audi ever. The Audi A8 L will have its market introduction in China in October this year.</p>
          <p>The new Volkswagen Polo sedan will be introduced on the Russian and Indian market in August this year. Its composition of German-engineering, elegant, high quality, perfect convenience and road dynamics make it the new status symbol within its class.</p>
          <p>The SEAT Ibiza ST is the first <mark type="inaudible" />, which adds functionality to an outstanding sporty design. It improves and enriches the positioning of the Ibiza beauty and technology. Ibiza ST was recently shown at the Geneva Auto Show, and it has been introduced on the markets in May.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Klingler. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, can you now please explain how our strong deliveries have been inflated into our financial performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, with pleasure. With significantly higher sales than in the first half of last year, unsurprisingly, the largest impact on revenue is indeed volume of just over &#x20AC;6 billion. Price and mix contributed further &#x20AC;1.8 billion with currency and here the Brazilian real has the most significant impact of plus of &#x20AC;1.6 billion. As we sold our truck facilities in Brazil during the early part of last year, we do not have the benefit of the sale of those trucks this year leaving us with a small negative impact when comparing to last year.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, Scania is recovering nicely and recorded a step-up of &#x20AC;0.8 billion in revenue, and finally our Financial Services division grew sales by &#x20AC;0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning to operating profit, the positive volume effect was again the major influence in an improvement from 1.2 billion to &#x20AC;2.8 billion versus the first six month of 2009. Combining volume with the price and mix effect leads to a total positive of &#x20AC;1.9 billion.</p>
          <p>As we commented in the ad hoc release, we are enjoying a positive impact from foreign currencies to the tune of a further &#x20AC;0.4 billion. Our strategy of purchasing on a global basis with a long-term view on our supplier relationships has contributed alongside our own ongoing efforts to improve our product cost and engineering and production to saving of &#x20AC;0.6 billion in the first six months despite warning signs of potentially higher raw material costs in 2011 and beyond. Our target to save 1 billion for 2010 remains, and I'm confident that we will comfortably exceed this.</p>
          <p>Scania continues to lead the truck sector in terms of efficiency and profitability contributing an improvement of just over &#x20AC;0.5 billion. Fixed costs and depreciation were a 1.2 billion drag on our overall performance due in part to the ramp-up cost as the additions to our production network got fully underway, and we also continued to incur higher engineering costs as we invest in our future.</p>
          <p>Personnel costs were negative in line with our 2010 wage agreement and finally our increased volume also contributed to the higher overall cost. The other negative versus last year refers to the one-off gain booked in 2009 from the sale of our activities in Resende. In summary, our operating result was &#x20AC;2.8 billion, up 1.6 billion on the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to cash flow in the Automotive Division. Operating cash flow improved 13.3% to &#x20AC;7.3 billion, a good performance from Q1 has been maintained &#x2013; as we continue disciplined management of our inventory level.</p>
          <p>Moving to cash flows from investing activities, a couple of influences needs to be stripped out to get to the underlying performance, including the sale of our Brazil truck interest in 2009 and our investment in Suzuki this year.</p>
          <p>On a like-for-like basis, the underlying cash flow in investing activities fell from &#x20AC;3.4 billion to 2.6 billion demonstrating our effective investment management. Our CapEx ratio while remaining at 3.5% from Q1 will rise as the year progresses, and we expect to come in closer to our long-standing guidance of around 6% of Automotive revenues for the full year. To sum up, despite the investment in Suzuki, in total, the net cash flow for the Automotive Division came to a positive &#x20AC;2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let me now turn to Automotive net liquidity. In the second quarter, we were able to add a further &#x20AC;3.3 billion to the 14.2 we held at the end of the first quarter. The excellent balance of &#x20AC;17.5 billion gives us the foundation to progress with the implementation of our Strategy 2018 and our planned merger with Porsche during the course of 2011, free from any short-term external impact from the global economy or capital markets.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the financial performance of our brands. The Volkswagen Passenger Car brand, the earnings for the first half exceeded &#x20AC;1 billion, that's up significantly on the prior-year period. With the new Sharan deliveries starting after the summer and the new Passat towards the end of the year, the Volkswagen car brand is in a good position to build on this solid earnings development.</p>
          <p>Audi's Q2 margin of over 9% reflects the excellent model lineup now extended to the ground breaking Audi A1 and to the PLS all new A8 heading for a record breaking year in deliveries, Audi's profit were up over 60% in the first half.</p>
          <p>&#x160;koda, a good progress in earnings, almost doubling the results versus the first half of last year while SEAT and Bentley continue to work on improving performance. Our light truck brand earned a solid result with a strong performance in Brazil, the UK, France, and Spain.</p>
          <p>Scania reported another excellent result this time of &#x20AC;577 million, led by strong demand in South America. The other results include the elimination of inter-company sales and also the adjustments required under IFRS of purchase price accounting with regards to our consolidation of Scania.</p>
          <p>Financial Services reported an improved result of &#x20AC;362 million. Combining the Automotive and Financial Services divisions gets a total operating profit of, as I mentioned, just over &#x20AC;2.8 billion. The financial results improved to a negative &#x20AC;217 million and is made up of three main sources.</p>
          <p>First of all, the earnings from the equity consolidation of participations; secondly, the interest income and expense on cash; and thirdly valuations on options and other financial instruments, which can be very volatile with large swings in valuation from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
          <p>Chinese joint ventures were the main driver of the improvement in the overall financial results reporting a proportional operating profit of &#x20AC;804 million, almost three times the level of the first half 2009, reflecting our very good sales performance.</p>
          <p>Our 49.9% holding in Porsche AG is also included at equity, following our investment in December 2009. While the operating business of Porsche was positive in the first half, the earnings included in our results are also subject to a PPA charge, which resulted in a small net loss for the period in our books as the PPA charge by principal is front loaded.</p>
          <p>This leads me to our 2010 outlook, which you can read in detail in the interim report. Our presence in all the key regions around the world, the multi-brand strategy, our technological expertise, and the most up-to-date environmentally friendly and broader vehicle range that has resulted from that expertise are key advantages for our company.</p>
          <p>In the second half of 2010, Volkswagen Group's nine brands will again unveil a large number of new models thus systematically expanding our position in the global markets. Based on our performance in the first half and our expectations for the second, we anticipate that our deliveries to customers will be significantly higher than in 2009.</p>
          <p>However, the dynamic growth in our sales revenue and earnings in the first half of 2010 will not continue and diminished in the remainder of the year. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding economic developments could have a negative effect on demand across Europe, and in particular in Germany, we expect demand to be weak in the remainder of the year in comparison to the second half of 2009. Intense competition and a difficult operating environment will combine to create a challenging 2010.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we believe that for the full year, our sales revenue and the Group's operating profit in 2010 will be significantly higher than last year aided by exchange rate effects and our focus on disciplined cost and investment management.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, thank you very much. We will now begin with the question-and-answer part of today's conference call, starting first with the questions of analysts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Jochen Gehrke from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three questions if I may. First of all, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, you alluded that ForEx had about 300 million positive impact in the quarter. With regards to your U.S. activities, could you just quantify, is the U.S. already in profit in Q2? I think previously you said you need Chattanooga to break even, so this was a more 2012 and beyond plan. Has this move in currency brought that a lot further forward? And if so, which you see, we should be expecting that.</p>
          <p>And then secondly more technical on the CapEx side, I think you said you're going to be closer to 6%. I think we are hearing that now since many years and since many years you are running below that rate, if that, should we really expect a very sharp ramp-up or should we revise down expectations significantly for H2 on that?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly really to your Chinese profitability, your operating profit per car in China has significantly expanded in the first half. Was there any special booking in this? And what's your outlook for the second half knowing that prices seem to be more under pressure in the market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jochen. So the first question is with regard to the currency impact and you would like to know a little bit more about our U.S. activities if our &#x2013; if we had positive earnings or profit in the U.S. in Q2. And the second question is with regard to our CapEx and our guidance of approximately 6%, is that valid for 2010, if you will achieve this 6%. And the first question is about our Chinese profitability, if we have done any special booking or is there any special items and if we can give an outlook for the second half and for the &#x2013; especially for the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen, to get started with the question on the supportive effect of exchange rate fluctuations, first of all, let me say that we indicated in our outlook that we think that exchange rates and their impact on the bottom line will be a positive contributor to the P&amp;L compared with last year in 2010. Now, the dollar obviously &#x2013; the U.S. dollar is also a contributing factor nevertheless, if you're also well aware, we're specifically short term talking heavily hedged for obvious reason and the same holds true also in a significant way for the next two years.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless also it's clear that as part of the business in the U.S. will still be based on the import of cars and more favorable exchange rates rather than what we have seen a number of months ago where the dollar was higher than 1.40 is of course a tailwind effect for becoming profitable in the U.S., but let me state very clearly, we are not building our business model on the basis of any scenarios dealing with exchange rates.</p>
          <p>The key contributing factor is &#x2013; as you are well aware, our strategy with regards to the U.S., which is built on introducing cars, which are specifically reflecting the market conditions in the U.S. and you're well aware that we, very shortly, will introduce the new Jetta model. And with the second key model for the U.S. then, which is internally called the new mid-size sedan that's an issue for the second half of 2011. We will have the basis built to become profitable in the U.S., but we still have to look at a situation, which means it's going to take some 2.5 years down the road until we, realistically and on a sustainable basis, will be profitable in the U.S.</p>
          <p>And the other comments just to make sure that there is no misunderstanding might reflect the situation of our companies in the U.S., which independently from the Group situation of course can operate on a profitable level, but if we look at the situation from the Group point of view, it still is going to take sometime until we are there.</p>
          <p>The second question on CapEx, we still stick to our target, and it's not totally unusual that we only have a portion of investment seen in the first half, which is decently below the average spend per month, that's the normal cycle of investment throughout the year. We might be a bit low in the first half 2010, but from today's point of view, I only would say it's creating a certain evidence that will be around 6% for the full year, which I think is looking at the very sizable investments we have embarked on with building new plants in India and Russia, in the U.S. and in other places adding capacity with all the portfolio &#x2013; the product portfolio is quite an achievement and stands for a tight belt policy.</p>
          <p>On China, yes, the profit development is quite convincing. Unfortunately, as I can say that there is no special bookings as you called it or any one-offs, which would support this profit picture. We are operating on a positive level of profitability and there is no systematic reason that this would disappear for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Thierry Huon from Exane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, good afternoon. I have two question if I may. One about the starting cost you mentioned for the plant under construction. Could you share with us the magnitude of this starting cost such as to and, when we should see them fading away?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about the PPA, you mentioned as well for Porsche, could you give us the number of this PPA during the first half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thierry, I guess you have two questions for us. Maybe I'm wrong, I didn't understand your first one correctly, then maybe please correct me. So I understood that you want to know a little bit more about the ramp-up costs for the new plants which are under construction, if this still continues or if that will stop this year. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just want to have the magnitude of this starting cost during the first half, and when we could expect them to disappear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The start-up cost, okay. And secondly you would like to know the PPA for the first half with regard to Porsche?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, to the first question, and I think you might have recognized this in our swing factor analysis for the operating profit comparing the situation of the first half 2010 with the first half 2009. In the negative swing on the fixed costs, there is a portion of close to 400 million, which are seen to be ramp-up costs, so costs related to factories or new structures being in the ramp-up phase. Now clearly this is going to continue for a while because the ramp-up until there is a certain balance between the capacity installed and utilization of that capacity could take as much as 12 months. So we need to take into consideration that for the next three or four quarters, we will see again this kind of charges for the simple reason that once we are through the process in Russia, we still are in the process in India, and if this is approaching the end of the process, we are possibly in the middle of the process in the U.S. in our plant in Chattanooga. So this is related to our strategy, something which is going to accompany us for quite a while in the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>On the PPA side, this is first of all just to repeat that of course now we are talking pre-tax profit not operating result. The full-year 2010 will have to carry PPA loads of around 700 million and Porsche is roughly speaking at least 200 million plus piece, which is part of that 700 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Horst Schneider from HSBC. Three questions if I may. The first one relates to China as we have seen in STT here, you are planning to increase extent of localization in China. So does that mean that you intend to produce also more Audi models in China in the future for examples the A7 and other SUVs or is that just refers to the purchase of parts?</p>
          <p>And the second question that I have is with regard to volumes and pricing. Maybe you could shed some light on the potential sequential quarterly development that we see now here in the second half. So would you agree that eventually here in Q3, the volumes will go down by somewhat 15 to 20% and then we see a fourth quarter that is slightly above Q3 for you as a Group?</p>
          <p>And with regard to pricing, I would be interested whether you expect the pricing rather to deteriorate in H2 or whether you expect a stable pricing trend? What I get from your competitors is that they expect some deterioration of the pricing. So what is your view of that situation?</p>
          <p>And then the last question that I have is again here on the merger plans with Porsche. We have heard in the last few weeks many news here on these legal cases that are going on in Germany and the U.S. And I would like to know if you can speak to the timetable that you aim for a merger with Porsche in 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Horst. So the first question relates to &#x2013; refers to China and you are mentioning the article in the STT today that we will increase the localization rate in China and specifically you are interested to know if we plan to produce Audi cars &#x2013; more Audi cars in China?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is with regard to volume and pricing, you would like to have some more details, what will happen in the third quarter and the fourth quarter in terms of pricing or volume wise?</p>
          <p>And your last question refers to the Porsche merger of our plan to merge with Porsche, if we stick to our timetable to merge in the course of 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first of all, on China again. And first of all, I think we need to say that we're currently operating right at the edge in terms of capacity utilization. From that point looking at the situation, it goes without saying that we have to add quick as possible additional capacities to maintain our position in China, and this is, as you are well aware, absolutely on track.</p>
          <p>Now creating capacity is one thing of course as China is developing unbelievably fast to a market, which has a lot of rules, which are not so much different from developed markets, it goes also without saying that we need to add more cars, more derivatives to this market, and this is of course something we have to look at on the Volkswagen side, on the Audi side, and also for &#x160;koda. So all the brands, which are present out of the Volkswagen Group as locally-built cars in China. At that point, it was mentioned that we of course will have to build also on our position, which currently is a very competitive position because we obviously is the company very much in the lead of localization in China with a very good performing supplier network available. So just to sum up on that, yes, there will be additional cars be brought to China to serve the market as best we can. Are there SUVs included? Yes. Are there Audi's? Yes, of course. And on the other hand, consistently with the buildup of capacities for complete cars, that's a matter for our joint venture companies in China, we need to also build the supplier network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For volume and pricing, I would like to pass on to Mr. Klingler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, concerning volumes, the first thing is what we need to say is that the second half of the year, as we've shown before, will have a total market effect due to the stop essentially in Europe, but not only in Europe, of several subsidy programs of the governments in general, so the market the second half of the year will not be as bullish as the first half of the year, but, anyhow, we believe that our performance will continue to be better than the total market performance.</p>
          <p>We have no sign of a negative outlook, but we are staying prudent for the things, which will come. Concerning pricing we see a good situation in pricing in most of the regions. This is due to the enormous success of the new models by all of our brands. So, we have a pretty comfortable pricing situation today. It is possible that due to the further increase of competition, that in several regions this pricing situation could have a small impact, but we don't see in two important development. We believe as well that we can keep to continue our policy, which is, in terms of incentives being current and not too aggressive and being in a pretty good level in terms of price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, when I can ask you another question. So the volumes overall, Q4 will be above Q3? Shall we see the biggest decline now in Q3? Would you agree to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We shall see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm going to continue on with the question on the post merger and this is first of all to say that by also the position Porsche has taken, the Porsche SE more than ever holds that any claims are without any merit, and on that basis, there is no reason to think about anything else, but the transactional scheme, you are well aware about and this is to say that consequently build within the year 2010, there will be a shareholder meeting organized before the Porsche SE to take a decision on the capital increase, which then needs to be executed 2011 and consequently, after that, we are preparing everything for the merger. So, this is fully in line with the timetable and there are quite sizable teams established in Porsche and also Volkswagen to do all the necessary preparations.</p>
          <p>So, it is not a question of any legal claim, but just let me make sure that there is no misunderstanding. You're well aware that there is let me call it a full back structure in the agreement with Porsche, which is a put-call scheme, which leave the Porsche SE as a holding company. Now key reason for that alternative structure clearly is that we need the support of all the shareholders in all the two companies separately in the two share classes and of course nobody could guarantee that we will be able to get this support. On this point, I think it's also important to clearly view that whatever structure we are ending up with it's going to be a very robust structure financially speaking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; so even if the claims are still there, you would be allowed to merge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, there has to be substance in any claim and then it's a question, which is of course ultimately up to the shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Adam Hull, WestLB. Three questions. Firstly, just on the Chinese revenues. It seems to me, it's still a small number, but it's certainly an increasing number. I don't know if you could give us what the revenues into China were in Q1 and maybe just give us a bit of a feel for how that might grow because obviously now with the Q5 being locally produced, I presume the parts segment from Audi is actually increasing, and maybe you could even tell us what the license fees are?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you've talked about a slowdown in H1, I think &#x2013; sorry, in H2. I think that is widely known in Europe, but just to give us some indication, do you think VW brand can stay in profit in H2 and could &#x160;koda stay in profit in H2?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the commercial vehicles vans division, you had an impressive margin of 6.8% in Q2. I presume that's being helped by the van improvement in the market and possibly the Panamera shells you make there, but just give us some indication whether that is kind of a little bit of a one-off or is that now that division going to be sustainably into the profit area? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Adam. Well, thank you. You have three questions for us. The first question relates to China again, if you can give some more details about the Chinese revenues and about our license fees. Then the second question was about the second half of this year, about a probably slowdown and you would like to know if the Volkswagen brand and &#x160;koda will stay in profit. And then you are interested in some more details about the situation at commercial vehicles because they showed a significant profit. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the follow-up questions on China, first of all, I've got to say that these questions were, at least so far, and I don't think we should change this position, we did not publish anything on that. But, purely systematically talking, it's clear that just if you take the average number per vehicle, and if you take the volume, which we recorded in the first half, if anything, 13, 14 billion, but this is just by my head rough calculation. On the license, I do not want to comment for obvious and also competitive reasons.</p>
          <p>On the possible slowdown in the second half, I think, just avoid misunderstanding here, we should make one thing very clear. We think &#x2013; just responsibly dealing, it is important to point towards the framework conditions or underlying factors, which simply tell us that if there is not any supporting new factor which could change the picture, we will see a soft cooling down in the second half in quite a number of developed markets.</p>
          <p>And I think there is also some chance that in China, we will see a smart and soft cooling down. This doesn't mean at all that this would turn any brand of the Volkswagen Group in a difficult position. So, don't be worried about profitability in the second half. This is just to say that we need to refer to the economical framework conditions, which tell us that it would be wrong just to put all the balls into the volume head.</p>
          <p>I just hear that there was another question on commercial vehicles. And first of all, it's very clear that commercial vehicles turned up with an impressive performance in the first half because in comparing first half 2009 and 2010, of course we have to, first of all, do an apples-to-apples comparison, which means we have to take out the profit recorded by the sale of the Resende entity, so there is a significant improvement which is supported by an excellent product portfolio. There was specifically our T5 Multivan car newly introduced in the market that's highly demanded. And in a number of markets, commercial vehicles really turned up with a good performance. Costs are under control. We keep the investment belt pretty tight, so that should be a sustainable development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now move to Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks a lot. Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. Well, firstly on cash &#x2013; I think that's also a bit of an important issue, looking at companies here. I mean you guys have really impressed the market over the last couple of years with your cash generation and again in the second quarter. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, can you just explain a bit more strategically what's going on in Volkswagen and how sustainable such level of cash generation really is, taking us through your working capital management and also through the level of provisioning, which has been just amazing over the last three quarters alone. I think you put aside additional 2.5 billion in provision. So, how sustainable really is this? Is Volkswagen a company that is generating something like 3 or 4 billion of cash in a year?</p>
          <p>And, obviously, as a follow-on to that, what are you going to do with this cash? And there's a lot of speculations and I would also say expectation, given your statements in the press, that we will see some sort of consolidation in trucks. So what is your intention with MAN really? Could you imagine increasing your stake in MAN? And then also on the Porsche merger, could you just confirm what you have stated before, that when we are getting the Porsche rights issue that that this one will be the same in size and price for ordinary and preference shareholders and that, with the rights issue you will also give us a clear indication of the merger ratio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the first question is with regard to our cash generation, you would like to know how sustainable is that cash generation. Also with regard to working capital provisioning, number one. And the next question is, what will you do &#x2013; what will we do with all that cash and if we &#x2013; what is our intention with MAN? And then the last question refers to Porsche and the Porsche rights issue, if we can give an update or if you can confirm that the volume of the travel increase will be the same for &#x2013; same volume for press and odd and if we will clarify or disclose the merger ratio at this stage. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly, on the cash side of the business, and this is, first of all, only to say that I think, for a number of years, we were introducing some very key elements, which management at Volkswagen had only &#x2013; in the Volkswagen brand, but in all the brands of the Group is focusing on, just to make sure that we get the right financial substance for our Strategy 2018. And I think it's very clear that we are talking about a very ambitious strategy, there is no reason to deny that, which only can work if we are able to create the right financial foundations. And I think we are still not there, where we want to be, but we should also not forget that we have had a little crisis in the last two years, which interrupted the process which was running quite well in the years already six, seven, eight.</p>
          <p>And what we see now is just that we've built the bridge to that period, and we, of course, we see the returns of a lot of commitments and, of course, a lot of hard working. And the key elements are modularization to avoid complexity, to build cars, which perfectly fit customer needs not only in Germany, but also in India and Russia and China and the U.S. And I think just what we see is a confirmation of that policy and strategy, and that's why, of course, what we are about to achieve in 2010 is a huge motivation for the management of Volkswagen to continue on with that policy.</p>
          <p>Back to your question in terms of number, it goes without saying that we need to produce a positive net cash flow. And I only had to take the apology that in 2010, in a year, which is far away from being a normal year, in a negative sense, I say, we bought a stake in Suzuki for close to 1.8 billion. Except that, we will turn up with a decent net &#x2013; positive net cash flow number, and we are very positive that we can build up on this.</p>
          <p>So that's why there is no reason that we would not be able to consistently produce positive net cash flows. So the next question on hand is, what the hell do we do with the cash on hand out there? I think you are also aware that we have committed to a number of issues, which partially are pretty much evident and partially, certainly, are not so easy to be put in a certain size. But it's very clear we are committed, as I said already, to an ambitious strategy in the regions with a number of new plants coming along, with a huge product portfolio.</p>
          <p>And it's very clear that we have to deal with the risks related to this. That's why I said, I wouldn't feel comfortable if this company wouldn't sit on at least in the Automotive Division piece of cash in the size of 5 billion. We are committed to a transaction scheme with regard to Porsche, which in the favored way needs also a good foundation cash wise, once we do execute the merger. And in the meantime, let's not forget about this, we take it as given that we will buy the Porsche Holding in Salzburg, that's leading European car distributor from the families. So a number of issues, and I do not want to comment on anything else. But obviously, there are some more thoughts.</p>
          <p>So it's clear that without saying that there is any necessity to use up all of that cash pile, that we are well advised not to lean back, but to continue working to produce the necessary cash streams. So the other question on Porsche, what I said is that we need approval by the shareholders, both ords and prefs, in the shareholder meetings at Porsche and also Volkswagen to build the basis for the merger.</p>
          <p>We didn't take any decision on when there is the right timing to introduce a merger ratio. Now, systematically, purely systematically talking, it would certainly be supported if we were able to introduce a merger ratio once we start marketing the capital increase at Porsche.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, you did confirm at our last meeting in November at Porsche that our rights issue on the prefs and the ords would go through in similar size, so 2.5 billion each side, and also at the same price. Do you want to confirm this now or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always said &#x2013; we always said 5 billion, which is 2.5 ords, 2.5 prefs. That's what we said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you are commenting on the price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not commenting on the price for a simple reason because this is also part of the merger evaluation where a special auditor has to first of all define on whether there is a premium for any share class or not. And I think you will certainly understand that this has to be consistent.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Charles Winston from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Charles Winston, Redburn Partners. Just two accountant's questions, if you don't mind. Firstly, could you give us some sort of breakdown of the financial charges in the quarter? I think they went from about 350 to 630 million in the industrial's division. I guess there's a whole load of derivatives mark to market going on there. I'm just wondering if you could give us some details of that breakdown. Also, second question, the non-cash provision charges, a large part of the improvement in the second quarter, I guess, came from the fact that they fell from about 1.3 billion in the first quarter to about 400 million in the second. Could you give us any thoughts or guidance as to the rate at which you would expect to take non-cash provision charges for the rest of the year in the third and fourth quarter? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Charles, you have two questions for us. The first is if we can give a breakdown of financial charges, the effect of the derivatives, the marked to market, if we can give you some details. And the second one is about non-cash provisioning, if we can give an outlook or a rate guidance for the second half or for the rest &#x2013; for the full year 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, unfortunately, I've got to say, in principle terms, we did not release any specifics other than what is reported in our official report, maybe a little hint on the financial charges because there is the special item which is, obviously speaking, not easy to explain, but it needs to be mentioned. Let me put it that way. It has an effect of a negative roughly 100 million, and it deals with the evaluation of the options in place, both at lease plan or with lease plan, and in that sense, of course, with the other party owning a piece of lease plan and with regard to Porsche, and we need to, of course, look at this situation and take a charge for the reasons that between the point in time when we enter into an option agreement and the point in time when it potentially could be executed, we need to charge a certain interest on that basis.</p>
          <p>So that's a quite sizable number, which hit the second quarter specifically, which will not build up. Just to the opposite; it's going to diminish, most probably on a certain assumption, within the next two years, mainly. So this is a hint I can give at this point. Then, on the non-cash charges, referring to any provisions, I mean, let me have a few words on the principle, if I got your question right, of course, whenever we are closing the books, as we did at 30th of June, we make an assessment on the situation, and whether it's the sort of impairment testing or whether it's a straightforward evaluation of any warranty, risk, it's always related to a very specific case, a business case which needs to be taken into consideration and which is carrying a certain degree of probability. I would like to avoid the impression that this is something which, just purely voluntarily or just for a reason could be charged. This is clearly &#x2013; or would be a violation of IFRS ruling, and that's why this is not appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then, let's have the next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>We will take our next question from Max Warburton from Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, everybody. Just two questions please. The first is coming back to the subject of this very, very large cash pile. Is there any pressure from the labor unions or from lower Saxony to think about funding the pension in a more conventional way, like Daimler has done and BMW is in the process of doing or is that just not a debate in the company, and you are free to use that cash for the other purposes discussed today? And then the second question &#x2013; the positive currency boost in Q2, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, I think last year you talked about difficult-to-hedge currencies having a negative effect, I think the non-dollar and non-sterling currencies. Is this boost in Q2 the difficult-to-hedge currencies, and we've still yet to see the benefit of the improving dollar or is some of it that U.S. exposure coming through already? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Max. So the first one refers to our cash pile. Is there any pressure to fund our provisions &#x2013; our pensions, sorry? And the second question is regard to our currency pools, if we can explain that a little bit, which currencies are behind that boost and to which currency is that related? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the first question, pension funding, you might be well aware that that's not a real bright new point. A number of years ago, we had some consideration on that. I mean the possibility doesn't really disappear, so it's here. And it would be reasonably easy to take any decision. On the other hand, as I tried to elaborate a little bit on it, we have embarked on a strategy and the strategy also leaves a good basis in terms of cash. And in that sense, I think it would be premature to take a decision on this. And there is no pressure from anybody on that point. Currency boost, I can give you a short answer. Yes, you are absolutely right. Consistently speaking, as we are heavily hedged in the main currencies, let me put it that way, we suffered quite substantially last year by what I would put the difficult-to-hedge currencies or as you put it. And with the devaluation of the euro, of course, part of the problem disappeared, and that's why these currencies contributed also to the positive support by the currency in the first half of 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask a follow-up question on that? Just at the current exchange rate, when will we see a significant dollar boost &#x2013; will we see a significant dollar boost? Is it safe for us, analysts, to assume that's still, at this rate, a positive to come in 2011 or '12? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will see a little bit more, only a little bit more, in the second half of 2010, and then it's going to increase '11 and '12.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We will take our next question from Jose Asumendi of RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Hi. Jose Asumendi, RBS. I was just wondering if you could just provide a little bit more flavor on the second half in China in terms of demand both for the volume and the premium segment, the visibility you have in both segments and the pricing pressure you face in both. Are you seeing the same pricing pressure in the volume segment as in the premium? And yeah, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jose. So again a question about China, I guess it is a question for Mr. Klingler. What do we expect, which development do we expect in the second half in China, especially the demand in volume and in the volume and premium sector, and if we see here a certain pricing pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China has a pretty impressive story over the last two years. So we have very strong growth last year. We continue to have a strong growth in the first half of the year. This is a very positive momentum. We believe; however, that the second part of the year will not have the same growth rate as the first part of the year. We also mentioned already in the beginning of the year, in January, that we believed the Chinese market would have a growth compared to 2009 will be more than 10%. So it's maybe 12, 14, we shall see. This is also due to a little bit the tax changes which have arrived last year in 2009. So the effect of these tax changes have come to reality more in the second half of last year, so it's more a question of a base effect from last year to this year than something else, and a cooling down of the situation. In China, we still have very strong economic environments, and as you have seen as well, from the announcement of the government, the growth in PIB has been cooled down to 10%, which is, I would guess, for most of our other countries, not a cooling down, but heating it up. So, the economical base is still strong, and the demand is still strong.</p>
          <p>On the other side, what we shall see is that we have, as the Volkswagen Group, actually no problem in selling the cars we get out of the plants. So we take every car, and we sell it to our customers. So we are more in a situation that because of production will give us more comfort in increasing our sales in China. This is a very positive tendency, and this is as well a positive sign for our prices. We see as well that other competitors have had unfortunately already the need to reduce their production due to overstock. This is not the situation with us.</p>
          <p>And as we mentioned before, we have a very strong demand of the cars and especially for the new cars we have given to the market like, for example, the Golf, which is a dramatic success or like for example, the Tiguan, which is a very, very good success. If you now come to the second part of the question, of the premium brands, we see in general that the premium market is going up. This is a tendency, which seems to be pretty logic due to the existence and to the strong existence of upper class, which is taking profit out of economical situation. So we believe that this positive momentum will continue, and of course we will do our best, as we have done, to keep our performance in line with these cars.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just &#x2013; if you can, on China, just say whether you think that the second half volume will actually be down in absolute numbers or up I mean given the first half performance and your expectation it could be just double digit. But that was just a clarification from the previous statements, but on Audi, obviously a very strong second quarter margin. You have, of course, taken a benefit from the currency. Did the margin improve in the second quarter versus the first quarter and the second quarter last year, if you take away the currency benefit, perhaps you can just quantify that? And also, with the new Audi A1, is there &#x2013; should we expect some margin dilution in the coming quarters from the introduction of that model and the increasing volume? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John, you have more or less two questions, again. The first question refers to China, which we answered already. But Mr. Klingler is happy to add a sentence to that. And then you are interested in Audi, if we can disclose any currency benefits in the Audi profits or other impact on the margins, and if we expect any dilution with regard to the margins, due to the introduction of the A1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning your question, our saying is that the percentage growth from the first quarter 2009 to the 2010, so the first half of the year will not be the same to the second half of the year, which I mentioned before due to the market. So on absolute terms, let's say we're staying pretty optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it won't be a negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are staying pretty optimistic there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on Audi, the margin of the second quarter was clearly better than the first quarter, and also better than last year, and we are expecting Audi to continue on with that margin level. You should not expect that the A1 would create a dilution on Audi profit. This is also to say that, while we move the A1 to the market, there are a couple of other models, which will turn up with impressive margins. So don't be worried about profitability at Audi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, I guess this is now the last question from an analyst. Then we switch to the journalists. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now take our next question from Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I have a follow-up question regarding what you said about the merger and potential merger ratio. If I understood correctly, you said that there's also the calculation of a potential premium difference between ord and pref shares, is that correct? And I thought, if we go through the merger, we will have basically a conversion of prefs and ords into prefs and ords of the new entity. Is that a correct assumption or will we end up just with a new entity that only has ords?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Christian. You asked a question with regard to the &#x2013; if there is a premium or a difference between the prefs and the ords, and how is the new entity if there are just ords, if we can give you any more details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I can repeat again that the question on whether there is a premium or not obviously is very much with the special auditors, which have to be mandated to do the merger evaluation, first of all. Then, Breitsprecher, you are very much aware about the transaction scheme, which is specifically mentioning a downstream merger, which is to say that in the merger case that the shareholders of Porsche SE will receive Volkswagen shares, and Volkswagen shares within the respective share classes. So there is no new entity, and I think this answers the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, now let's hear what the journalist would like to know. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there. First one, this is always asking the last bit, saying the last word. But the most questions are already answered, but I have some. I have one, perhaps, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, you could say a little bit more on your plans with MAN, and as Arndt Ellinghorst asked about, if you could imagine a high stake in MAN, you didn't especially answer this point. Is this a no comment on this point? And the second question is how long &#x2013; or what are your expectations on the economy in general, in the regions Europe, Asia and U.S. for the next months? The last, can you imagine that VW has earned more in especially one quarter than this second quarter in the history? Thanks. That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. There are two questions. The first one is with regard our plans with regard to MAN. And the second one is, how are our expectations on the economy, on the development of the economy in Europe, Asia and the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. May I just add, I asked for three questions. Sorry. May I just add and repeat the second question &#x2013; the third question, because I would like to know if there was a quarter in the history of VW that was stronger than this second quarter in terms of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we got it. You would like to know if this is a <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me get started with the first question on the trucks or MAN, and I was trying to save a bit of time because there was some news flow the last couple of days in the press, which is pretty much elaborating on what is, in fact, taking place. And I think if you reflected the last couple of conference calls for the quarterly results, I manifold times received the questions on what's going on, and I quite often said, well, we are moving closer towards a number of projects where a decent degree of cooperation is taken into consideration. And this is exactly what happened the last number of months, and as the single projects did receive a higher degree of being concrete, it was then moved into the press by both the truck companies, mainly, and just to paint a little bit of picture here, we &#x2013; just to support these synergetic projects, we created a new position in the management board of Volkswagen for trucks, and one of our most experienced managers, Dr. Heitzman, took this position, and he will be supporting these projects between the companies Scania and MAN.</p>
          <p>And I think it's quite significant issues, which are talked about. The possibilities there include, for example, the cooperation on vehicle components, like axles and gearboxes, just to give you examples, and in order to share some R&amp;D efforts between all the companies, also, then, including Volkswagen, there is some consideration taken also on the hybrid drive concepts. So, we believe that this is a very logical and systematic step forward. And again, let me say as I've said manifold times in the past also, we do not feel in any hurry there. You wanted, secondly, to have a few comments on how we see the economy developing in the three regions. Maybe I should add a fourth region then, and let me just start it with Europe. Still, as we all are aware, some challenges need to be digested, and that's why we think we will most probably see some cooling down of the economy in the next number of months to come. This is not to say that the European economy in total would not be on a positive path.</p>
          <p>We believe this is the case, but it's going to take quite a bit of time until we are back to former activity levels. The Asian economies are continuing to be in a more booming type of an economy. Nevertheless also there the governments have taken already measures also in China to avoid this growth that's getting out of hands and creating bubbles here and there. That's why also there, it is necessary to keep expectations on a reasonable level, but we would view the economy positively, positive &#x2013; in a positive shape in most of the Asian markets.</p>
          <p>The U.S. is recovering, as we saw, but just in the last number of months, there was a slight disappointment about the growth rates, which showed some signs of weakness. We believe this should not be overestimated because still the investment cycle is quite positive in the U.S. But, as also in America, it's necessary in a number of areas to embark on the process of deleveraging. Also there, it will take quite a while, then the economy is back to former levels, and then we've got other positive example to finalize, that's South America. I think we've seen a pretty positive development there, for a number of reasons. We also think growth rates will probably be a bit stagnant, but still will remain in positive. And to your last question, no, this is not the record second quarter. The record quarter so far was in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay now we take the last question and then we close the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll take our last question from Mark Schneider from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, Regarding your comfortable cash position, do you still intend to use further instruments gaining financial liquidity; for example, the convertible bond parts by the last AGM or even another capital increase after a certain period of time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Mark, for that question. So you would like to know if we are intending to do another capital increase or if we would like to use other financial instruments as a convertible or so, which we've got a group for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think, I mean, you already gave the answer by yourself. We are reasonably comfortable with our liquidity situation. We are able to support our strategic plans, and that's why there are no concrete plans. If and when something could be utilized that's not necessary, we are absolutely in a position to support our Strategy 2018.</p>
