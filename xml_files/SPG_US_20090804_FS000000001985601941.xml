        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'll take a few minutes to review financial and operational highlights for the quarter and then we'll open it up for Q&amp;A. SPG sound business fundamentals as well as our stability of our high-quality regional mall and premium outlet platforms continued to drive results in the second quarter. We reported diluted FFO per share before an impairment charge of $1.38 for the quarter ended, in line with expectations. FFO per share including the impact of the impairment charge was $0.96.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, the company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $140.5 million or $0.42 per share, representing a decline in the value of the company's investment in Liberty International. As of June 30, 2009, we owned 35.4 million shares of Liberty at a weighted average price of 574 pence. Liberty's quoted market price was 397 pence at quarter-end June 30, although now it has traded up, closing yesterday at 436 pence. If reported today, the impairment charge would be 30 million less given the improvement in the stock price and the current exchange rate. Till this quarter, we marked Liberty Investment to market through our comprehensive income on the balance sheet. We concluded this quarter that the decline in value is no longer temporary and therefore recognized a loss in our income statement. We continue to have confidence in the longer-term value of our investment in Liberty.</p>
          <p>FFO for the quarter also reflected dilution of $0.14 per share as a result of our 17.25 million shares of common stock that was issued in March and an additional 23 million shares in May. The issuance of the 40.25 million common shares in March and May offering, as well as the 8 million shares issued through our common stock dividends, served to strengthen our industry's leading balance sheet. We also recorded 13 million or $0.04 per share less in straight-line rent and fair market value of lease income in the second quarter of 2009, that's compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Now I'll comment on some operating performance measures. Occupancy across all platforms continues to be affected by the weak retail environment as compared to last year, and that's been impacted by store closings as retailers filed bankruptcy in 2008 and 2009. Across all of our platforms we've lost over 2 million square feet year-to-date from bankruptcy-related store closings.</p>
          <p>Regional malls, occupancy was 90.9 at quarter-end, which was a decrease of 90 basis points for the second quarter of 2008, primarily as a result of the aforementioned bankruptcies.</p>
          <p>Premium outlets was, occupancy at quarter-end was 97%, a decrease of 130 basis points from the second quarter of 2008, again primarily due to negotiated store closings where we wanted to recapture the space, and again more bankruptcy-related closings.</p>
          <p>Comparable retail sales continue to decline due to the overall economic environment. Our mall comparable sales were $442 per square foot at June 30, impacted by the performance of higher-end retailers that have been more significantly impacted in today's economic environment. Those retailers had higher productivity to begin with, and decreases in the sales had a greater impact on portfolio. Comp-store sales, we've also been impacted, given our company's important position in Florida, California and the Las Vegas markets.</p>
          <p>As of June 30, premium outlet comparable sales were $493 per square foot. The sales decrease year-over-year was less significant in this past &#x2013; platform, as the consumer continues to seek value in these economic times. Our mall releasing spread was 17% as of June 30, in line with historical levels. Our premium outlet releasing spread continue to maintain its strong position at 34.6%. Regional mall comp NOI for the quarter was flat &#x2013; it was slightly up, actually, and for the six months year-to-date was up 1%. Premium outlet comp NOI was 6.1% for the quarter and 7.1% for the first six months.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed the transition of the Chelsea back office operations to Indy, Indianapolis, a move that will generate annualized cost savings of approximately $10 million. And we continue to be laser focused on all aspects of our operation. Our operating margin actually increased by 100 basis points in the mall portfolio to 68% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to capital markets. We returned to the capital markets in May, raising an additional $1.75 billion through two offerings. On May 12, the company completed the sale of 23 million shares of common stock at $50 for total proceeds of 1.15 billion. On May 15, the company issued $600 million of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2014.</p>
          <p>The second quarter capital activities included the following. We redeemed $85 million of our operating partnership's 8% cumulative redeemable preferred units at par. Two secured debt closings were completed during the quarter, aggregating $230 million. In addition, on July 30, just a few days ago, we closed an additional $400 million of new mortgage financing. These transactions that I just described generated an additional net cash to the company of $350 million. In 2009, we also exercised or completed extensions of more than $1.1 billion of mortgages.</p>
          <p>Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 6.36 times. And SPG's prudent balance sheet management, strong franchise value was again acknowledged in May when the company's ratings were reaffirmed by three major rating agencies, including S&amp;P reaffirmed at A minus corporate credit and unsecured senior debt ratings with a stable outlook. On May 11, Moody's Investor Service affirmed the A3 unsecured debt rating with a stable outlook. On May 29, Fitch ratings affirmed the A minus unsecured senior debt rating with a stable outlook.</p>
          <p>All three rating agencies cited the company's high-quality portfolio, including the magnitude of its unencumbered funds from operation, diversified asset base, stable income stream, conservative capital structure, strong access to a variety of funding sources and accomplished management team is the primary reasons for these affirmations.</p>
          <p>Now, as of June 30, our balance sheet includes, including our share of joint venture cash, $2.9 billion of cash and our availability on our corporate credit facility of over $3 billion for a total current liquidity position, including the recent mortgages I talked about of $6.3 billion. And I think most important thing I can tell you about that, that includes $9.5 a share in cash.</p>
          <p>Now development, redevelopment on April 23, we opened the Promenade at Camarillo. This 220,000 square foot expansion expected to generate a 13% first-year return. On April 17, a new Nordstrom opened at the recently developed and expanded Northshore Mall in Peabody, Mass. And actually Thursday we'll be opening Cincinnati Premium Outlet and we expect that to be a very exciting development. That will add to the country's best collection of outlets, generating the highest sales per square foot, strongest comp property NOI, and the highest development returns.</p>
          <p>Construction continues on two other projects in the US, second phase of Domain in Austin, Texas; redevelopment expansion of the South Shore Plaza in Braintree, Mass. And both are scheduled on time and on budget to open in early 2010. We have no other significant projects scheduled to begin.</p>
          <p>International on July 7, we opened Ami Premium Outlets, the eighth premium outlet center in Japan. The 225,000 square foot first phase opened fully leased to over 100 merchants. We own 40% of this project. Construction continues on five other fully funded projects, two in Italy, which will open in 2010 and three in China, scheduled to open in the fall of 2009.</p>
          <p>Today, we also reaffirmed the guidance provided on May 1, 2009, after giving effect to the impact of the May 12 equity offering, the May 15 senior notes offering and the second quarter non-cash impairment charge associated with our investment in Liberty's common stock. The current FFO guidance range is $5.35 to $5.50 per share. Our outlook on core operations is unchanged.</p>
          <p>And let me just conclude and we will be ready for Q&amp;A. While the economic and retail environments remain difficult, we believe we have maintained our leadership, industry leadership position due to our high quality and diverse portfolio and our willingness and ability to access various forms of capital.</p>
          <p>With that said, we'll turn it over to Q&amp;A. Operator?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I just wondered, is there any increased activity regarding store closing of the mall anchors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not, not dramatically from over the last couple of years. I think there might be a couple that we're at risk for, but I would tell you nothing that hasn't been consistent over the last few years. Rick, you can add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add is to give you a sense of where we are today. We've got 766 department stores in the mall portfolio. Of those only 19 are vacant. Of the 19, 12 are owned by others. And of the 19, we're actively discussing replacements in 12 of the boxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean, you're actually doing better on the anchor front than the inline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is more stable. Their occupancy costs are obviously much lower or they own their stores to begin with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No I understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Craig, I don't think it would surprise us if we had some department store closings over the next year or two depending on the economic retail environment. But it's really nothing that is out of the ordinary that we haven't seen over the last couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then what's the current occupancy or leasing on the Cincinnati Premium Outlet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be about 85% by year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. 85% at year-end. And obviously you left the Mills project. What was the fatal flaw was that? Was it its location or just the layout of the center?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The location got better, but the layout was an old &#x2013; was actually an old original regional mall that was built. So it had two levels. Just didn't fit the Mills' one level value-oriented proposition. And we were very happy to sell it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. I'm here with Johan as well. David just in your comments with the environment, I know you mentioned it's still challenging, but as we're starting to see signs of improvement and obviously to date, you have to be somewhat pleasantly surprised just given that your occupancy is holding up well and leasing spreads have held firmly and same-store NOI is positive year-to-date. Can give us some sense for maybe leasing toward the back half of the year or even 2010, what you're seeing at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I think the holiday season is going to be important in terms of the psyche of the retailer for 2010. And I think retail, even though the economy and a lot seems to be shifting in the right direction, I think it's safe to say that retail is somewhat lagging in that. So we haven't seen that pick up. But it is moving in the right direction. I do think that the next- the second half of the year is going to be important. It'll have some important implications for 2010. But we're still doing business. We're still opening stores. There are still retailers that are growing. I don't think 2010 will have a, one way or another be overly dramatic when it comes to NOI, but Jay it is, it's &#x2013; we're battling it out. I mean it's not easy, but we're figuring a way to get it done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess maybe better asked, I mean do you expect to see another leg down in rents because the beauty of your business is you've got a predictable lease roll over schedule in rents that are ten years old. But if you've got &#x2013; are you anticipating sort of another step down in rents over the next six months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's too early to tell. We still feel very comfortable that we've got leases under market. But it's important ultimately for sales to stabilize. And I think that's why &#x2013; see, looking at the second half of the year will be important, especially as we get to October, November because as you know the dramatic downturn in retail really occurred in that period of time. So if we can see some stabilization in that, and the comps aren't as down as what we've seen in the first nine months since September, then I think we'll be &#x2013; our leases will continue to show those rent spreads. And that's what we're anticipating, but we've got to see the retail performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my second question is would you look to co-invest with any REITs seeking to sell portions of assets or seeking to sell assets and any sense at this point of updated pricing of where you would look to deploy capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm not sure I understand. Can you just restate the first part because I didn't pick that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you seek to co-invest with any REITs at this point, whether seeking to sell portions of assets or would you really like to just buy assets altogether from those seeking to sell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't think we'd co-invest with another REIT. We may buy another REIT, but I don't think we co-invest in another REIT or with another REIT. The answer is we're feeling better about deploying capital opportunistically, but beyond that there's not a lot I can add there. I mean, there is nothing imminent in what we're planning to do. But I don't think we'd partner with another REIT to buy assets. I think we would certainly buy assets or if we felt it was appropriate opportunity to deploy capital and get the appropriate return that we want to see from that, we would certainly consider that. I mean, the one thing I said, and I hope it's important, we do have $9.50 of cash on the balance sheet. So there's very few real estate companies that have it. That's almost 20% of our market cap. So, I mean that's not an insignificant asset in today's world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what would be the pricing level that would push you toward deploying that capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to give it away because it may hurt my negotiations. So I think we would &#x2013; look, we understand our cost to capital very well, even though it's volatile. And the cost of equity has been volatile. We have a better handle of our cost of debt. And so I think anything we would do, we would be &#x2013; we would feel comfortable that it would have an accretive and be above our weighted average cost of capital. So it's a function of the going-in yield, what we could do with it, and the potential growth in that asset.</p>
          <p>So, we'll see. Beyond that it's hard for me to comment. I will say to you from our standpoint, I mean, we've had a lot of capital approach us to joint venture our existing assets and/or joint venture new opportunities. Given our capital position, we have felt &#x2013; we have positioned that capital to look at &#x2013; and this is institutional capital, Jay &#x2013; we would look for that capital to position for new opportunities. And we are really reluctant to sell our best assets even at what we thought we would be able to get those at, say a seven cap rate, even today, even in today's uncertain environment, we've kind of said look, selling our best assets, holding onto best assets at a seven cap rate, given the long-term growth of those, is probably not in the best interest of our shareholders.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone.</p>

          <p>Good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't welcome you back because you've probably been welcomed back a ton of times, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take it though. David or Rick, if you break down the portfolio either geographically or if I segment the malls into sort of sales stratas, what are you seeing in terms of trends, both on rent and occupancy? Is it weakness on the high end and low end and the middle of the portfolio is sort of the sweet spot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll let Rick add. I'll just say sales clearly have been most impacted by the better the property, okay, which gives me a lot of confidence that as the better consumer gains their economic footing, that that will rebound quicker and faster. And the sales at the kind of the middle-market malls have been relatively stable and kind of benign in terms of this downturn.</p>
          <p>Now the occupancy, it's interesting, the occupancy is really not that affected by the higher quality properties. And our occupancy downturn, that's only 90 bips from last year, is more impacted by the properties that don't have the higher sales productivity. So &#x2013; which is not uncommon and that's been going on for years and years. That would be, if I articulated that right, that would be the easiest way to see that. And in sales regionally, I mean it's look, Las Vegas, California, Florida are markets that continue to be under more duress than say even the New York metropolitan area or the Midwest.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I think about your occupancy line, am I remembering correctly that you're not including tenants with lease terms under one year in that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what percentage of your mall square footage right now is occupied by those short-term leases, and how has that changed over last year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would say that it's &#x2013; probably &#x2013; if you walk our mall, you would see a lot less vacancy than 91%, which we're at. If you weighted average that in and out, you would probably add another 200 to 300 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of these are temporary tenants that come in for six months, go out. But if you walk the mall you would see that, if you did add kind of a weighted average, Ross, I'd add at least 250 to 300 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the cart and kiosk business, how should we be thinking about that? Obviously there's not a lot of disclosure on that business across the entire mall industry. Do you look at it from a standpoint of, your effective occupancy rate is x versus the number of spots you can put these things in? And what's happened to the rents on that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That business is under pressure, but it's not dramatic. And we are still shooting for the cart business to be relatively flat from last year, and we look at rent and occupancy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Holding up better than I would have thought, given the credit...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean it's muddling along is the best way to describe it. It's not killing our numbers, it's not making our numbers. It is what it is, and it's kind of muddling along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last question, I was a little surprised to see the dividend announcement today with primarily or a majority of it being stock, given your strong cash and liquidity position. What was the thinking behind the Board's decision there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we signaled to you last quarter that that's what we were going to do for the balance of this year. So you may have not been working then. So you missed the signal, which is okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I got the signal. I guess I'm asking, market conditions have strengthened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our view and our goal is to return to a cash dividend in 2010, cash. And that's our goal, and that's essentially what we've signaled to the market. And we just felt like we might as well be extra conservative and prudent for the balance of the year. And a lot of discussions with a lot of shareholders that supported that view. And so I think we're just going to ride our decision the balance of this year, and then hopefully as we've signaled to the market for 2010, obviously subject to Board involvement and Board guidance, to be shooting for taxable income at, as a dividend and doing that in cash.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Just continuing on with that, David, I mean, if you guys can &#x2013; when you look at the debt maturities that you have coming up and the amount of cash that you have, I mean, is your intent to keep your leverage level at the current levels, or could you use some of that cash to pay off some of those maturities as they arise?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will definitely use &#x2013; not really so much for the balance of this year, but our plans next year is to take a couple of our better secured &#x2013; properties that are currently secured and unencumber those with our cash.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>It was 8%.</p>

          <p>8%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of lease termination income, I noticed that that fell considerably in the quarter. What's your expectations into the second half of the year, in terms of lease term income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There might be some, I mean, we've had some discussions with some retailers. It's very, very lumpy. I think our total budget for the year will be met and probably not exceeded, but somewhere in that range and I don't remember that number of the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's about 15 million for the year.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be in line with that. Again that's a tough number to both budget and to see where it ultimately comes up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Lastly, just related to leasing spreads, I noticed that the mall portfolio leasing spreads came down a bit to 17 from 25. I'm just wondering into the second half of the year, do you expect to hold at that 17% long-term rate, or do you think that will come under more pressure as we head into the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it should &#x2013; we should finish the year pretty consistent with that. I mean it's still about six bucks, maybe under a little pressure. I mean getting the historical rent spreads that we've had over the last three or four years is obviously harder to do today than it was in the first half of '08 and '07, et cetera. But we still feel confident that we've got leases under market. And our goal is to get that five, six bucks. We've actually outperformed over the last three or four years. Our goal is to perform kind of where we thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I mean, Mark, this is Steve again. I'd say, if you would go back and look at our history over the last seven or eight years. We kind of always said 15 to 25%, David's right over the last couple of years, we've been at the higher end of that range. But given the economic climate that's out there for us to be at the lower level of that historical range is not surprising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with the outlet centers, I mean, do you expect it to stay at that elevated level, or because of reduced tourism or other pressures, do you expect that to compress as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I think the number was really outstanding for the quarter. So it would, we'll probably have some reduction on that. But that &#x2013; we still feel very &#x2013; as we said at the beginning of the year, we felt like we could deliver the mall business flat to up to 1%, we're at the 1%. We'll see how the &#x2013; and we still have some things out of our control including percentage rents and what the sales are, bad debt expense associated with bankruptcy tenants and the like. We still feel like hey, we are going to be able to deliver within that range.</p>
          <p>We're confident about delivering very healthy robust comp NOI increase in the outlet business. And obviously a big, given the occupancy, a big driver of that is the rent spreads. And that we feel like we can still deliver that. Now the comp NOI as we look at '10, we'll probably won't be in the six, 7% range, but we think that business ought to be three, 4% at least, we hope. Again a lot of this is going to depend on the consumer and the stabilization that we hope that the economy seems to be getting to will ultimately get to the consumer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. David is it fair to say that the discussions with the retailers about asking for rent relief have stopped at this point or is that still continuing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's still continuing. It's, in a lot of cases, in our view, it's a short discussion, but it's &#x2013; look I think a lot of retailers jumped on that bandwagon very early and some of them jumped off but not everyone has jumped off. So it's still there. Our approach to it has not changed meaning that if we think they are financially stable and they have an existing lease, we are not really entertaining it. Now obviously lease expirations, that's free game for everybody involved. If they are financially difficult, in 11 or about to go in 11, our approach changes to some extent. But I think, Steve, I think it's too early to say it's passed us. Rick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I agree. We're still having people trying us out. And as David said, our philosophy is if you are stable, you have an obligation, we expect you to meet your contractual obligation. At the end of that contractual obligation, we will have a discussion based on each of our views of what the market rents are for that property, that space and that use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me ask a question about leasing. I think maybe Jay had asked this, but just to try and follow up. As you sit here today, it's probably fair to say that most of the '09 leasing is done at this point. But can you tell us what percentage of the '10 leasing might be completed and how would that compare to a year ago when we were sitting in '08 looking at the '09 leasing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far through June 30, we're about 30% through '10. That's either fully executed or deals cut and in process. And this time in '08 for '09 we were about 37%. And I think that's a combination of two factors. One, and I think we mentioned this in our last call, we are not aggressively looking at renewals in the back half of '10 because as David has indicated that's over a year away and we are waiting to see hopefully some stabilization in sales trends and more optimistic and constructive outlook for more retailers. So we're not really pressing now for those back half renewals. And that's one of the reasons why it's slightly lower at this point as compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to add, I mean our rent relief that we've granted year-to-date has basically been de minimis, if anything is less than $0.015 a share, so it's not a big driver of our numbers at this point year-to-date.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good thanks. The outlet rents. Am I look at it incorrectly or is there some change? It says that they're 22.8% higher than a year ago for the premium outlets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Paul. You're looking at it correctly. David mentioned earlier that we pulled all of the back office to Indianapolis and in the quarter when we did that, one of the things we did is we loaded all of the rents and all of the Chelsea lease data into our existing Simon operating systems. And in doing that, we tweeked the classification of how we calculate the rent for Chelsea. And all that did is move the overall average base rent up a little bit. It's just conforming to the exact definition that we have for the rest of the platforms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Does that have an effect on the way your lease spreads appear or anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it did not. Lease spreads have always still been &#x2013; or always been ending cash rent, old lease, beginning cash rent, new lease.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. At what percent of your renewals have you been doing on a short-term basis, kind of less, two years or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Rick. Through June 30 less than 20% of our leases are for terms less than two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's typically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's in line historically where we've been. I know there's a lot of focus on duration but you also need to remember there is a lot of good reasons to keep terms short. We are trying to put space together with tenants. We want maturities to be at the same time at the adjoining space. We want to be able to give these tenants an opportunity to work through this cycle where they've told us they're optimistic about where they are in the mall and the market. And so we are not willing to tie up space long-term when we and the tenants believes it will be more productive, we can get more rent down the road. So we are keeping terms shorter but even with that said they are historically where they have been in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I mean, it's interesting that given the times of your portfolio, you are at 20% when some of the other portfolios are saying they're at 50%. Are you seeing a different need to do short term for different quality levels in your portfolio? Or I mean there must be something going on with it, or is it your negotiating leverage that keeps you doing longer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to think we are doing a good job for our shareholders in how we are approaching our lease renewals. There is no particular pattern as to better or worse properties in lease term, we have the motivations to maximize our rent, and we do what we think is the best approach to maximize that rent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just would, I mean look, there are strategic reasons to go short-term as Rick said. So if that trend's up, it's little bit because we don't &#x2013; we may not like the rent we're getting and we may want to just keep the tenant in the space for a period of time. So it's as Rick said or you may want to put the space together, you're waiting for the right tenant. And so that number may trend up, but it does give us options too. So it's not the end of the world if that trends up. And just keep that in mind as you assess it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the investment opportunities given your cash position, you talked about potentially buying portfolios or REITs et cetera. I mean, how focused would you be when you're looking at opportunities on just highly productive assets, or would you look at sort of more exposure to the B-quality centers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our philosophy on what we would want to acquire has not changed given this world or any other, given this economic environment. I still think we're looking to &#x2013; if we do something, it would still be quality retail real estate that we think we can add value to. And we would not want to do a transaction where we chased yield if we thought the quality was suspect. So I don't think our philosophy has changed there at all.</p>

          <p>Okay.

          <p>And it's great to be, and that was the important point. I mean, we locked rate when the world was still very, very squishy and, but we were doing it when no one else was doing mortgages. And so I don't &#x2013; I think you have to assess it from that standpoint. Steve is right. We locked it in when the world was very uncertain. CMBS market is, it's obviously the spreads have rallied significantly. They're starting to be trading. They're starting to be a lot of talk. We'll assess the impact that TALF will have on it. We are able to see extensions in that market with good assets and good borrowers. So I think that market is getting better. I don't think it's going to be anywhere near where it was, but it does seem to &#x2013; we do seem to think that there will be a securitized market here shortly and down the road.</p>

          <p>It has. And just to amplify on that, obviously the other side of our debt portfolio is the unsecured market and obviously our spreads have come in quite a bit.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. I have a couple of questions if I may. David, in back in early May when you had your second equity raise, I asked you in a public format, if you were comfortable with the notion that you would be able to record meaningful acquisitions by year-end '09. Would you still say yes to that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think I hedged my bets in that response a little bit. But there is opportunity for us to add the appropriate quality at the right price in '09. But I think more importantly, David, we don't want to rush to do a deal just to do a deal. And our view is we've made a lot of steps to maintain our leadership position. I feel very proud of what we've accomplished even though a number of these decisions were very, very difficult to make. And we do think that there will be significant opportunities, there are opportunities today. But most importantly we don't want to jeopardize all of the hard work and effort that we've gone through to position us for the long run. And I still feel confident that we will, over a reasonable period of time be able to add to our franchise through acquisition opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question's related to the UK. The data I look at, whether I'm looking at currency, housing, interest rates would suggest the UK. is poised for some kind of a recovery. How vigorous that will be is I guess open for debate. But could you just us an update as to what you're thinking about your Liberty International investment particularly in the light of obviously what was a substantial impairment charge?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not happy about the impairment charge. And as you know it is non-cash. And we do think over time that our investment has the opportunity for us to get our basis back if not better. It's got great real estate. It's going through a temporary we think downturn, but we haven't lost faith in our ability to recoup if not add value to our investment. And the interesting thing there is that the shopping centers there cater more to the &#x2013; they don't cater to the high, high end customer like they might. Most of the high end retail there is on the High Street, as you know David.</p>
          <p>So there has been a &#x2013; there seems to be a leveling off in terms of the consumer almost like what we've seen from kind of the moderate malls here. And the higher end, I haven't seen the dramatic decrease in sales because the high end tenants probably are feeling the brunt of that as well as in the UK. as they are here. So we believe in it. We're going to monitor it. There is not &#x2013; I don't think there is an immediate change to what we are thinking. Obviously we did step up in when they did their offering. And I think we feel over time that we will be able to recoup our investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're not concerned the prices might firm up? I mean after all there's been a more dramatic fall off in property prices in the UK. than we have seen here to date. And it seems like we are running maybe six months ahead in terms of property value, so things are starting to get active again around equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, I expect it to firm up. And I think ultimately whether we participate in that or even just maintain our stock holding we'll be the beneficiary of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a question for Steve related to this as well is, is that position hedged in any way, shape or form?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, most questions have been answered. But David a few minutes ago you mentioned a comment about the outlet center portfolio. I think you said you'd thought in 2010 you could see some growth there maybe three or 4%. Just wondering what your early feelings are about the mall portfolio as you look out to 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's early. I mean I think there may be a little bit of pressure there, but it's going to be de minimis. And I think our goal, now we go through our budget process, but I think our goal for 2010 will be to deliver it flat. I think that could be a challenge. I think a lot will depend on kind of sales. But if it's not flat it's, I mean we are seeing all these comparable NOIs down what I would call dramatically three, four, 5%. We don't see that with our portfolio now. I think it's up to you to figure out why. I'm trying to figure out why from our standpoint. But if it is under pressure, it's going to be at what, maybe at 100 basis points. So in other words last year or this year we said zero to one, maybe next year it's negative one to zero. But I still think we're still early in the process to do it. We do not see the kind of the dramatic comparable NOI down like we're seeing with other retail portfolios and with other mall portfolios, with apartments, with hotels et cetera. We don't see that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. It's Michael Bilerman in here with Quentin. Dave, I just want to come back to I guess the full notion of potentially buying a REIT, which I guess in your view could be a UK. REIT like Liberty or maybe a bankrupt REIT like General Growth in the US or maybe a strip center REIT to add to your strip center portfolio. I guess there's a lot of different opportunities given your size about where you can sort of place your bets.</p>
          <p>I guess maybe we start on Liberty. I think you talked a little bit about potentially recouping your investment. You're obviously about a 6.5% shareholder today. Are you looking at that relative to just seeing the market price firm up relative to your cost basis or potentially given your sheet today in owning, being the largest shareholder out of Donny, being a more activist type or maybe not activist but trying to work with them to either Simonize or do something else to improve the operation in some way to get your investment up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a very good question. And I wish I could answer it, but it is a very good question and I guess I wish I could answer it. We think it's a good company. We're not pleased we're underwater, we're not giving up hope. But Michael, I wish I could add to that, but beyond that we're going to just have to see how that evolves. It's a very good question. It's an interesting &#x2013; we're in an interesting strategic position there. We do have optionality with our material stake. And we do see opportunities in the US. We do want the strongest balance sheet in this industry. So all of these are &#x2013; we're suffering through a thunderstorm here so we do see all of these as strategic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope God is not giving you the signal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. I don't know which part he didn't like. We'll talk to him later. All of these are very strategic decisions that we've got to evaluate appropriately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm just curious of how you &#x2013; you've obviously, I mean look you've put $350 million into Liberty right, I mean the size of a regional mall in the US. So it's not like just play money. I'm just wondering how active you are in trying to make money on the investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we want to make money, that's for sure. Michael, I can't really say anything other than what I said, I apologize for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing you mentioned was there are opportunities today. Can you just characterize a little bit about at least the type of opportunities that are on the market that you're referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there are domestic US. retail opportunities today. And there is no question about it. There are opportunities that we can create today. Sometimes it's not just showing up in your lap, sometimes you got to go create them. And I think where we're focused obviously is &#x2013; we've got the UK situation, we talked to you before and we do think that beyond that, I mean, our focus will be in addition to assessing the strategic opportunities there is primarily focused on the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now is that, obviously, you talked a little about your own CMBS issues and being able to cover that with mortgage debt, unsecured financings and being able to go out and tap other forms of capital whether it be TALF. But I guess, are you thinking about trying to be on the offensive on other people's CMBS problems and how far down the road you may be in trying to maybe get loose some of those assets that may not have the same successes you're having in terms of other financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there will be opportunities. I absolutely think there will be opportunities along those lines, though the stuff that we have seen thus far doesn't meet our quality spectrum. I mean, there is some &#x2013; there's been some amazing retail. A lot of that is in new development. I mean, there's been amazing amount of damage done in terms of the retail development, the NOI generated, the amount of leverage. So I do think there will be &#x2013; I don't think it's huge mass of opportunities, but there is going to be some opportunities on kind of a one-off basis to pick up some of those broken developments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Quentin here. Just in terms of your 6.3 bill of liquidity and looking at opportunities, is there sort of some amount that you've got set aside for potential opportunities versus some amount that you got set aside to ensure your CMBS refinancings and so forth get done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it all goes into the blender to produce the appropriate result. The last thing we're going to want to do is jeopardize the foundation we've built so long for, right. So sure, I mean, it would be hard to pluck all of that capital toward an external opportunity without having addressing the refinancings that we need and we'll continue to do. But as, Quentin, as you know, I mean there's lots of capital that is circling opportunities that we would think we could be able to tap into if we find the right opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the joint venture side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us some kind of indication of what the volume of that capital might be? Is it two or $4 billion for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be in the billions range, yes, if the opportunity was there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one on Mills, just looking at the portfolio, and just wondering if there is an increased desire of your joint venture partners to potentially exit the joint venture and whether or not that could present some kind of an opportunity for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They've been a great &#x2013; Farallon has been a great partner, as well as Can Am  at the property level, Farallon obviously at the corporate level. There has been no, absolutely no indication, I think they view this as kind of a medium to long-term investment and there has been no indication at all that they are looking to exit the portfolio in totality. I mean I think our joint venture will sell assets as situations arise, but beyond that it's business as usual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a question on the sponsorship income. You talked a little bit about temporary leasing, the carts and the kiosks. What's sort of happening on sponsorship and other sort of other income you are generating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually above our numbers year-to-date and which is above, a little bit above last year. And so far they feel like they're going to bring in '09 slightly above budget. So again it's a tough business. A lot of it's local driven, but the mood is a little bit better there than it, certainly it was at the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have much visibility as you head into 2010 in terms of those contracts? I mean the sort of, it does make up some of the $100 million of EBITDA at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think a couple of the bigger relationships are being renewed and solidified. So we do have color on that. And then a lot of that is just driven locally, which is &#x2013; you got to fill your book essentially every year. And that visibility is not there for 2010 yet. But the big important relationships, in terms of corporate relationships, really hasn't changed and are being fortified.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much of that 100 million is those big contracts versus the local?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; I'm going to say, I don't have that at the top of my head, but I would say that the regional and local probably produced over half of it, as a general indication of kind of where that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just our last question, just as you think about the US acquisitions, and you talk about the opportunities. You got malls, the shopping centers, and the outlets. Is there opportunities in each of them or you more inclined one versus the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are going to be opportunities in all of them. And I think it's safe to say that you see that indication of where we have leadership position. And I think our view is, we kind of talk about the strategic buckets that we're trying to sort through that we would want to solidify and enhance, I should really say enhance, our leadership position in those buckets as opposed to other buckets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean you can see where the predominance of our NOI comes back &#x2013; comes from. And I think those are the areas we're primarily focused on.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I have some questions on leasing, but I think we've beaten that to death. So just, last question I had was in terms of the opportunities, more and more we're seeing people dip into securities or extending their reach into other areas. I'm just wondering if you guys would be looking at purchasing the securities of &#x2013; not just the equity securities but possibly debt or anything like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I think our preference would be to own the asset directly because that's where we could add the most value. So that's certainly our preference. That's where we've had our best success, and when you can control the asset, and I think primarily will continue to be our focus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So not even in an opportunity where you might purchase the debt in light of, at some point in the future, getting your hands on the asset itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we absolutely wouldn't rule that out at all. But I think again, just in terms of our preference, it would be to own the asset because that's where you can &#x2013; as a mortgage holder, as a mezz holder, you don't have all that much influence in the operations. As an equity holder in a public company you don't have that much influence unless you really rattle the cage. So our focus will be, continue to be primarily &#x2013; and again I wouldn't rule it out &#x2013; but primarily in the ownership. Now we could make, buy some securities and in theory loan-to-own, but the biggest focus continue will be to own actually the bricks and mortar.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just some very quick questions here. Just going back to your earlier comment at the front of the call, on the tenants and what they are experiencing at the moment. Are you seeing them change their ordering habits for the holiday season, or are they still looking at scaling it back materially from last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Rick. Our conversations with the tenants are indicating they are taking a very conservative position on inventory. They are really looking at inventory as the best way to increase their cash position by decreasing their inventory. And so you're going to see them, I believe, positioned to have tighter inventories, which we believe is going to still put some pressure on sales in the fourth quarter, but is going to hopefully substantially increase their cash flows and their margins. Because if there is any uptick at all, I think there is going to be considerably less goods available to be purchased by the consumers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So even with the equity markets up and some of the positive economic indicators, they haven't changed, they haven't increased their ordering for the back, for the holidays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question is, just going back to your earlier comments about sales decline and the relationship of that and tenants' ability to pay. Do you have a sense for how much sales decline, like if sales declined in the second half another 7%, would that put pressure on tenants' ability to maintain their current rent structure? Or what's your view on where the break-point is for how much sales can decline before tenants start to have issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, that's an individual, tenant-by-tenant review. And clearly there are some tenants that have had dramatic sales decline that are under pressure already, including like the jewelry business and, as just one example of that where they have had dramatic sales declines. So it's a category-by-category approach, and I will just tell you that the important thing is that the decrease that we've seen thus far has been kind of at the higher-end tenants with the higher margins. So they probably have a little more room to go than certain others.</p>
          <p>But to answer your question, you really need to do it specifically by tenant, and within &#x2013; by category, and certainly within that category by tenant. Even in a category like the teen retailers, you got a number of tenants that are performing very well and some that aren't. And so it's very hard to answer that generally, other than I do think the fact that we're seeing it at the kind of the better tenants with the higher margins gives us some comfort that they can continue to withstand a sales decrease.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi, good morning guys or good afternoon. Steve, on the five financings, the two you did in second quarter and the three you did post the end of the second quarter. Were those on existing loans or were those unencumbered at the time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rich, the two we did in the second quarter were on existing loans. The $400 million financing that David mentioned that closed last week was unencumbered assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so what roughly would you say is the unencumbered NOI pool, you think in total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still about 56, 57% of our total NOI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so it's &#x2013; okay, that's fine, great, thanks. And then Rick, do you have thoughts on which tenants are, in particular are opening stores at this point? You usually have a pretty good laundry list of tenants who are opening stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you that in '09, we have entered into leases in '09 for stores to open in '09 or '10 with H&amp;M, Forever 21, Zara, Bare Essentials, dELiA's, Crazy 8, which is the new concept from Gymboree. We're having a great deal of focus on the franchisors. So we are doing business with Five Guys and Noodles. We are very pleased, Microsoft has just gone into the retail business and they've announced their first two stores and we have one of them in Mission Viejo Mall. So there is still a number of tenants that are doing business. And as David said, there is a lot of activity going on in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Thank you guys. And then David, on TALF, are you actively working on anything with TALF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is no, we really were more focused on it a couple of months ago. Obviously with all the success we've had in capital markets, we are really waiting and assessing kind of where it ultimately shakes out. That's not to say we won't use it and be a participant in it, but at this point we are not active.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then &#x2013; thank you. Then same sort of thing on General Growth. Are you still mostly monitoring that would you say, or is there anything new to report on what you do in General Growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last thing from me guys is Domain. Could you give us an update on the progress there with regard to the various pieces you expect to come on line over the next six or eight months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. In October of this year and the expansion, Dick's is opening then in February of '10, Dillard's, Village Road Show opens. We have an apartment complex in a joint venture with Columbus Realty and GE Pension Fund, that's opening in the fourth quarter of this year. And then in February along with the anchors, we anticipate opening about 85% leased and we'll have those tenants open over the next month or two months in the first and second quarter of next year. And then in March of '10, we are opening our Westin Hotel at Domain in a venture with White Development. So it's coming together. We've got a nice line-up of tenants, primarily focused on the juniors category and food because we pretty much did not put a lot of juniors in the initial section of Domain, so they were anxious to show up in this section, so it's coming together.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. David, I respect your reluctance to talk about some of the opportunities as it relates to Liberty and what you might do or might not do. But I was hoping you could talk about relative value as you think about deploying some of your large cash pile in the US versus perhaps other parts of the world including the UK. When I look at Liberty, I see a company trading at an implied cap rate after making all the adjustments you need to make to compare UK with US, an implied cap rates that starts with a five. And then I look at Simon and I see a stock that trades at an implied cap rates starting with an eight. We saw a recent deal announced that suggests that cap rates for some of the best malls in United States are probably in a cap rate range in the sevens.</p>
          <p>As I think about you protecting and positioning Liberty, considering perhaps expanding that position, how should I think about relative value? I get it that there's scarcity value to the Liberty portfolio. But it's a company that certainly has challenges ahead with 10% of its tenants in bankruptcy, a bunch of high-loan to value maturities about to mature over the next couple of years and then finally same property NOI dropping at a faster than expected pace. Why should I be excited about that kind of company at an implied cap rate in the fives versus what you might be able to do with your cash in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look I think, Jim, you articulated right on why we have, where we are where we are as opposed to doing more than what we've done. And there is no question in our mind that as we look at external opportunities, we do like the long-term prospects potentially of the UK market. But our primary focus will be in the US and it won't be in Asia and it won't be in Europe, it will be here. We do think we can add most value here with our platform. We do think the opportunities are &#x2013; there are more opportunities that exist there and I think there are &#x2013; our view would be that that's the primary focus.</p>
          <p>Now Liberty, we think we will recoup our investment and beyond that there is not a lot I can say. We do think there are elements of what we can do that might add to what they do there, but that's &#x2013; that is what it is and we'll see how that shakes out. But our intentions, if we do look to deploy external capital, we do think there are great opportunities in the US and certainly on a risk-adjusted basis, what we could add value to, it's hard to argue that point. So nothing that you've said isn't what we've grappled with. And we're not pleased, and we're currently underwater but the worst thing we could do is try to recoup that in a not so intelligent way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then Steve, a follow-up on the current mortgage environment. You mentioned that current rates are in the low seven to 8 and what we've seen over the last many months is that capital was available for malls but only the highest quality, only for the best sponsors underwritten at fairly low loan-to-values and very conservative underwriting with respect to NOI. Is that still the case as you look at the deals that you're looking at today? Could you get financing, mortgage financing on a say B plus mall or lower if you didn't provide corporate recourse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say this, Jim. I would say the sponsor matters a lot. So for us I would say yes. And in fact, we're in the market now with what I would describe as a couple of middle-market malls. And there is money out there available, yes. Now in terms of the leverage and the underwriting, I think it's still relatively conservative. You're seeing debt yields in kind of the mid-teens. It's going to translate into about 50% LTV. But I think, as the especially the insurance companies that are doing on-balance sheet lending, I think the quality of the sponsor is very, very important these days. And as a result of that, we're seeing very good interest even in assets other than our top tier assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify that, the sponsorship is important because these insurance companies are asking you for recourse, or they're are non-recourse deals where they want to know that you're behind it versus somebody else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The latter. Non-recourse deals where they want to know that a quality operator with a stable balance sheet and a long track record is behind it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning or I guess afternoon now. Rick, retailers and retail developers arguably got into trouble expanding into markets where I guess all the opportunity was predicted on household growth which obviously isn't happening today. What's your sense? And I guess what are you hearing from retailers about their longer-term plans, beyond the 2009 or 2010 as they think about unit counts a few years down the road? Do you think they retreat from those types of markets over time and it's just a blip or do you think there's maybe an overreaction where they actually look to, I'll call it concentrate in the more infill markets in the next up cycle if you will for retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on the conversations that David and I have been having with these retailers, they are viewing their new store, new development program very guardedly. They are going to be very cautious deploying capital and where they are going to deploy that capital, they are going to do where there is a high degree of certainty as to results and the highest degree of certainty as to results is deploying that capital to open new stores in proven assets and proven markets. And we are seeing that, that there is still demand for our proven assets and proven markets. And I think that the retailer's attitude is reflected by the fact that when you look at the new development pipeline, it's non-existent. It's the lowest it's been in 20 years. And I believe that is a silver lining to our current situation. As retailers do get more comfortable with allocating capital for new stores, that is going to benefit the existing supply because there are going to be virtually no new supply available to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And David, I know you've got to take the acquisition opportunities that sort of come to you because the mall industry is not exceptionally large, I guess the number of opportunities available. But given what Rick was just saying, do you have a unique view I guess about the markets you'd like to see your marginal dollar go into here in the US? I mean or put differently if some malls come to market in metros that are out there, I guess does your appetite change to the better or worse than may be two years ago because your view on those metros has changed markedly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. There are certainly markets that are &#x2013; you would have to factor in and underwrite their current situation because though they may be good long-term markets, they are going to be dislocated for a reasonable period of time. And I think a lot of those were the kind of typical markets where you had a lot of new retail development that has not stuck. And I absolutely think you got to factor that in because those are markets that are a little bit dislocated and again they are great long-term markets I think eventually. But you are going to have to be really smart in terms of how you would underwrite those. And how you underwrite any deal, I mean today underwriting potential NOI is going to be a challenge for anybody that wants to make an external investment. I mean thankfully we're equipped to do that. But I do think that the markets themselves are very important ultimately in where you want to deploy capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are examples maybe of some of the larger metro markets, where you think it just could take longer for them to recover?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Again I'll defer, but I mean, I'm sure you have a sense of where. A lot of them are where there is a lot of new retail development plopped into the market or in fact there are new development going on right now that's got to be leased up. I'll let you draw the appropriate conclusions.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Unless you have a boat. What are capital partners telling you about their geographic preferences? And I guess are there holes out there that have emerged or deepened given where they want capital to flow? And I guess related to that, have you heard any private equity funds trying to assemble funds to pursue mall assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is definitely an interest to deploy capital in good retail. I don't think they &#x2013; I think they look at just like we would, I think they are looking at the individual asset and its position in the marketplace. They have not red-lined any particular market as far as we know. It's more asset, it's more asset-by-asset review.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well some of them have lot of capital. The good news is the mall business has always been operational intensive. So it's been harder for them to justify a lot of significant bets. They've always wanted to partner with an operator. I don't see that, certainly in today's environment where retail relationships is critical, I don't see that changing at all.</p>
