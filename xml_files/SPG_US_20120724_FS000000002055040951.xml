      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our strong results for the quarter and I'll just go through some highlights. First of all, funds from operation (sic) [operations] (1:54) was $1.89 per share, up 14.5% from the second quarter of 2011. Our FFO exceeded the First Call consensus by $0.08 per share.</p>
          <p>For the malls and the premium outlets, our comparable property NOI grew 5.1%. Comp NOI growth from the second quarter of 2011 was 3.5%, so a very healthy trend. Tenant sales were up 9.9% to $554 per foot. Occupancy was up 60 basis points to 94.2%. Average rent per square foot increased by 3.7% and the releasing spread was a positive 10% or $4.77 per square foot.</p>
          <p>On the capital market side, on June 1, as you know, we completed a new $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that supplements our existing $4 billion revolver resulting in $6 billion of total capacity. The facility matures 2016 with a one-year extension option at the same rate as our other facility, which is LIBOR plus 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>In the secured market, we've been very active year-to-date. We have closed or locked rate on 17 new mortgages, totaling approximately $1.9 billion, of which our share of that debt is $1.3 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the loans is 4.3% and the term is seven and a half years on the average term. And last Friday, we redeemed 2 million units of our operating partnership owned by an affiliate of J.C. Penney at $124 per unit or share. On the acquisition side, June 4, we acquired a 50% interest in Silver Sands Factory Stores, a large and highly productive upscale outlet center in Destin, Florida. The 450,000 square foot center generates sales of approximately $500 per square foot. We've assumed leasing and management duties and in the coming months, it will be rebranded as a premium outlet center.</p>
          <p>Development activity is very strong. First of all, we grand opened Merrimack Premium Outlets, a large outlet center in Merrimack, New Hampshire on June 14, strong opening, we're 99% leased, great-looking center. Construction continues on five additional premium outlet centers, all scheduled to open this fall or in 2013. They're located in the U.S., Canada, Japan and Korea, clearly demonstrating the global nature of our company and our premium outlet platform. First of all, two in the U.S. are in Texas City, suburb of Houston, which opens this fall; and then Chandler, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, which will open next year. We're continuing construction in Toronto which opens next year, another outlet center in Japan, which will be our ninth near the airport, outside of Tokyo; and Busan, our third premium outlet center in Korea.</p>
          <p>We started construction on July 11 at St. Louis Premium Outlet Centers. We announced a strong lineup of tenants and our opening is planned for the fall of 2013.</p>
          <p>Progress is being made under our agreement to develop premium outlet centers in Brazil would be our malls and importantly, construction is under way on 25 redevelopment expansion projects at the mall, premium outlet and Mills platforms in the U.S. and two premium outlets in Japan, all with 2012/2013 completion dates. We continue to expect our share of the development/redevelopment spend to approximate $1 billion this year, next year, and 2014.</p>
          <p>Let me just turn to Kl&#xE9;pierre give you a quick update. As you know, we bought 54.4 million shares or 29% of the French public company in March. They are the largest &#x2013; second largest owner of retail assets in Continental Europe, with assets valued at &#x20AC;16.2 billion. They will be announcing their earnings later today.</p>
          <p>Their business has been remarkably stable considering the turmoil in Europe. They have made excellent progress in refinancing debt, selling assets, and creating additional liquidity. And I have been very involved in the development of their future strategic direction as they accomplish their goals. There is no doubt in my mind that they will be poised to take advantage of future growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Turning to dividends. As you now know, we have announced the fourth consecutive increase in our quarterly dividend from $1.00 per share to $1.05 per share. Our dividend is now 31% higher than it was a year ago and well above our previous all-time high before the onslaught of the great recession. I'm happy to announce that we've increased our 2012 FFO guidance again. Initially as you'll recall, we were at $7.20 to $7.30 per share. Our new guidance now is $7.60 to $7.70 per share. The primary factors contributing to this are strong operational performance and the impact of our recent investment activity.</p>
          <p>Now just to highlight another important factor in what's happening with the company, we continue to add to our very talented management group. As you know, in 2011, we added [David] Contis to our mall platform, [Steven] Fivel to help us in our legal and deal business. And obviously, I'm very pleased to announce the most recent addition, many of you know, Matt Lentz. Matt is our Chief Investment Officer, which is a new position in our organization. He brings a great and extensive broad real estate background, both from a bricks-and-mortar point of view, but also from a securities point of view, also very &#x2013; been involved in reviewing many international opportunities in his previous roles.</p>
          <p>He'll focus &#x2013; his job will be primarily assist myself and others of the management group in pursuing strategic growth opportunities for the company, and Matt's first day on the job was, in fact, yesterday. And as far as I know, he's still here. But actually, his wife is about to give birth. So I hope he's not at the office.</p>
          <p>Concluding, let me just say last second quarter, I addressed the unfair advantage that the Internet retailers have in not being required to collect sales and use tax on remote sales. I believe our efforts and others have made significant progress at the state level, but our tenants need Congress to act to level the playing field on a national level. In the past year, the Marketplace Equity Act was introduced by a bipartisan group of senators and similar legislation has been introduced in the House to address the inequality in today's marketplace and level the playing field between bricks and mortars and online retail business. We support these proposals. We'll continue to be very focused on making this happen and we appreciate all &#x2013; everybody's support in showing their strong support of this very important legislation.</p>
          <p>So with that said, we can turn it over to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Mr. Alexander Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Doing well. Doing well, once again, it's hot in New York. David, just go to the J.C. Penney for a second, $1.24 &#x2013; $1.24 is certainly below where you guys are trading. Just want to get a little more color on one, who approached who first, and two, just want to try and understand why someone would take $1.24 versus where your stock is trading in the open market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, let's just say we have a strong relationship with Penney. They're a very important retail partner of ours. I know, Rick and I know, Mr. Johnson and we also know very well members of the board. So I'm not going to get into the particulars but just so you understand. I mean, the unit holders have the ability to convert their units on a one-for-one basis for common shares and we view it essentially as common stock equivalents because obviously they can convert it on a one-for-one basis.</p>
          <p>When they do that, then they &#x2013; we have the option to give them fully-diluted stock or cash and it was through that discussion that we negotiated the deal and I'm very convinced it's a great opportunity for the company and I think it met Penney's strategic goals in terms of their focus on what they're trying to do with their business. So we're pleased with the transaction and beyond that there's not much to add to it, Alexander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on Brazil, Equity International filled their stake in BR Malls. Just curious if you guys took a look at buying their stake or if there's any discussion around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know, we've looked at a lot of things with BR Malls. We've looked at a lot of things in Brazil. The good news is we're very close to approving our first outlet there which will start construction here potentially within the next 30 to 60 days. And open just outside of the S&#xE3;o Paulo and open late next year. That's not in this list that I describe to you but it is moving a pace and I expect that to happen and I think we'll get our first outlet center built and opened next year so we're pleased we're making very good progress on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a final question, just with the recent economic data, has there been any change in the conversations with tenants. Are they still full steam ahead in terms of leasing space in their program this year, next year and further out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Alex, this is Rick. There really has not been any change. They are still coming in and aggressively looking for new opportunities across all the platforms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mr. Ross Nussbaum from UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you guys talk about the dynamics that you're seeing in the department store sector as you look ahead to next year. Obviously you've got one big transformation going on at J.C. Penney and then you've got another different type of situation over at Sears.</p>
          <p>At what point do you guys &#x2013; or do you believe, there's still needs to be some rationalization in terms of the number of boxes that are out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I put Penney &#x2013; and Rick could add &#x2013; I put Penney in a completely different category than Sears. I mean Penney is very focused on delivering value to their customer. They have a very talented management team. We expect, obviously they are going through a transformation, but we expect Penney to be a viable mall anchor in a fashion they have been historically.</p>
          <p>Sears is a little bit different. I mean, the fact of the matter is Sears needs less space. I think we touched on this last time. Sears needs less space than what they currently have and I think there'll be ongoing discussions with us and Sears and the other mall people that will rationalize that space creating opportunities for both the landlord and Sears.</p>
          <p>I really, really would not lump them in together. They're two different companies on two different paths. And at the end of the day, look, it's going to be Sears will be a lot of work but we feel confident as they probably reduce some of their space that will ultimately benefit us in the long run. Rick, anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just add if you look at today's landscape in the department store universe, their equity, their balance sheets, their credit profiles are all dramatically better than they were just a few short years ago. You have Lord &amp; Taylor that's been recreated into a very viable and aggressive growth vehicle, Dillard is very well situated, Macy's is well-situated. Carson's has a new leadership and great financial upward trajectory. So candidly, we're in a better position now than we have been and with no new development, these stores are maintaining their existing stores because they want to really enhance their top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question is &#x2013; and I've got this question over the past couple of days from some of your investors. Does the hiring of Matt reflect in any way a signal that you intend to accelerate your international expansion or is it more of a reflection that you just needed another body or two in the door given everything you've got going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really a function of what we've got going on. I mean, we &#x2013; believe it or not, this is big company. And just like I am never satisfied with the portfolio and the &#x2013; where we've taken the company, I'm always going to try and add talent to the organization. I've known Matt a long time. We talked and on and off. We wanted to fill this position lost probably in late 2008 and then the world ended, so we put it on a back burner because we said, well, we're going to hunker down. I just think there's so many opportunities for this company. It's very important to continue to add talent, another pair of hands, another deep thinker, he fits in great with the team. So to me, it was a no-brainer and we'll take it wherever it goes, wherever we think we should invest.</p>
          <p>Who would have thought we would have bought our stock at $124 three months ago, but we saw opportunity. Who would have thought we would have invested internationally four months ago, get paid, I'm getting paid &#x2013; most people pay for options. I'm getting paid as I think about that company as optionality. What do I mean by that? If you look at the cash flow that we'll get from their dividend against the cost that it took, both in equity and debt, we're going to get paid $55 plus or minus million a year to decide what we want to do with that stake.</p>
          <p>That's a good spot to be in. There's not many malls you can build that can generate $55 million of cash flow. So having another guy to think these things with our team, I think, is exciting. I also think that with David and Steve, we hired Larry Krema to run our H.R. group. I think it also demonstrates that this company is a neat place to work and be part of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Appreciate it. Thanks, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. The pace of outlet developments, they may actually seems as high as it's ever been. I'm wondering if that's sustainable going forward into 2014 and 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the new development or the redevelopment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The new development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I still think the full price new development still is not &#x2013; it's still a ways away even though there are a couple of announced ones here and there. The outlet business still has some pockets but again, I think we discussed it last time. I mean I don't &#x2013; I know there's all these ones that are being bandied about, but I think it's going to be harder to do. So I think pure new development is still going to be a little bit &#x2013; still be less than everybody thinks.</p>
          <p>The redevelopment though has the potential to really pick up and that's where thankfully between Rick and Contis &#x2013; that's where a big, big focus is. That has, Craig, a little bit of potential to do more than what we're doing. But Rick, you can add to that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just on the outlet side, right now, it's being driven by explosive demand among a number of tenants that are not in the business that want to get in the business and I don't want to lose sight of the fact that this demand's going to help our existing portfolio dramatically and that you're seeing that in our results. There's got to be finite end to the arc of new development. There's a limited number of new opportunities.</p>
          <p>On the redevelopment side, when David articulated, I believe it was last year or the year before, our redevelopment program, we identified some for you, literally three-quarters of them are under construction right now and we're in the process of reloading that pipeline with the next wave of opportunities. So there's a lot going on and if you look in the 8-K, we're producing low double-digit yields on those which on a risk-adjusted basis are even better than they are on just a return basis which are terrific in and of themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess when I look at your portfolio, you have between Woodbury, Orlando and San Marcos, centers that are 700,000 square feet and larger. Is there the capacity in your portfolio to take some as large as that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that in the outlet side, that's still going to be few and far between. I mean we're making Orlando bigger, we're making Vegas bigger, we're making the Desert Hills bigger. But these are, I hate using this word, but iconic outlets. Those will all be bigger. Those are all &#x2013; Seattle's getting bigger, Chicago will get bigger. So these are all &#x2013; that is probably an underappreciated opportunity for this company, just like Craig, I mean, how people talk, they're going to do this, they're going to that. People are focused on a company having this particular lease here and there. We've got five outlets under construction. We just opened one. So people talk about well, we're about to, we're hoping to lease this space, hello, we got 5 under construction. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And you just mentioned expansions of many of the best outlet centers in the United States. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that coupled. So there is a lot to what we're doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you. Just going back on outlet in regards to Silver Sands, you got a loan there from the bank at a rate under 4%. Can you give me a sense of the appetite for mortgage financing in the outlet space at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, do you want...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Cedrik, most of our portfolio in the Outlet business. Because it's wholly owned, is unencumbered. But where we have shown the product to the mortgage market, whether it's the banks or the life companies, I think they recognize the quality and the stability of the cash flow so I think about Philadelphia Premium Outlets we had a mortgage on we just got some financing on the &#x2013; we got a construction/mini-perm on Toronto with very attractive pricing.</p>
          <p>So it's a very attractive, very viable product to that market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And I would just say Cedrik to throw that in for the Mills projects, too. I mean, We're &#x2013; some of these are locked out. But the ones that are open and the ones that we bought out of the TMLP are extremely financeable and that financing rivals any A mall  that's out there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just going back a little bit, looking at the big picture. Where do you see the most fertile ground for investments today? Is it primarily in publicly traded companies? Or is it in malls or outlets that are owned privately?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a tough one, Cedrik, to be honest with you. At this point, I would probably say that outside the opportunity that we saw at Kl&#xE9;pierre, it's probably the private deals that we see as the most &#x2013; the biggest opportunity, primarily because the private owners are going to have a much more difficult time to get financing &#x2013; or the private individuals that may want to monetize their business for whatever reason &#x2013; or their assets for whatever reason. I would say that's probably the biggest opportunity that we see, though it doesn't rule out that eventually there may be some more public opportunities, but I would say to you, as we think about what we're looking at, they tend to be more private oriented and it's either financing issues or estate issues or whatever that's driving the need to do it.</p>
          <p>Now, philosophically, we will not &#x2013; we don't rarely and I shouldn't &#x2013; I don't blackline everything, but we don't participate in bidding when &#x2013; if there's a banker or a broker and it says bids are due at 2 o'clock PM, please send in your letter. We don't do that, I mean I can't remember the last deal that we did, where we all participate in an auction. I mean, we just don't do it. We don't need to do it. We have no interest in doing it. So these are people that want to do business with us and then we &#x2013; it doesn't mean they're not represented by bankers or whatever, but those bankers know that if there's an auction, they can send it to the next mall guy, we're not going to play.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then turning to Kl&#xE9;pierre, if I'm doing my numbers right, it's something like &#x2013; you were down about $200 million on your investment here, about half of the stock depreciation and half is FX. You did put in $1 billion against your $2 billion gross investment by way of a hedge, by way of your, I think it was a credit line facility. Have you expanded that or have you hedged our positions against the currency any more since then? I mean, it looks like all the risks are to the down side, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well you know, David, that's, look we don't &#x2013; I don't think about the &#x2013; the good news about &#x2013; for the investors, is I actually think about the real estate long term, not quarter to quarter. So, yeah, the euro is down a little bit. The stock, we did buy it at a premium to where it was trading. That gap has been closed; in fact, it's been up since where we bought it. We kind of look at where we bought it versus the net asset value and we still think the net asset value is higher than what we bought it. I don't &#x2013; I'm not going to panic about the euro. It's a good portfolio. It's stable. You'll see the results later today. So to me, this isn't &#x2013; look, it's not a quarter-to-quarter gain. So that's of no concern to me, no consequence to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we did...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did increase our hedge and we're about 50%-some hedged. We did that before even the latest euro depreciation. But I think the other point is that &#x2013; and if I could put it in real estate context and look, the real question is what happens in the principal. But this is not &#x2013; we didn't do this based upon short-term trading patterns.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the dividend and our cost of financing, just a simple go back, you know real estate right? Cash on cash...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...cash on cash returns. We're going to get roughly &#x2013; and this is even with the lower currency. We're going to get $55 million added cash flow while we decide whether we love this company, we want to maintain our investment, whether &#x2013; who knows what we do with this investment. But the fact of the matter is we're getting paid while we help make it a better company, which we're doing today. And I think about what it takes to build $55 million of additional cash flow and I think it's a good trade, but  look, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. On the sales growth trends that are &#x2013; have been continuing to impress. I mean, maybe you can answer a little bit of the composition of it. I mean, clearly they're above what a lot of retailers are reporting on a portfolio-wide basis. So I mean, how much of the increase is on the same tenant basis versus sort of shifts in the mix within the mall and then maybe on a trend basis kind of, how is the tourist spending side of your portfolio going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me unpack that a little bit. One, the tourist aspects of the portfolios are still very strong. We're still seeing a lot of activity from a number of the tourism groups, about the only one that's softened at all is Japan. So that is still a major contributor and we are outweighted in tourist markets.</p>
          <p>Secondly, when you think about the contributions of any one tenant, our sales base is over 60 million square feet. So when you get a number out of us it's a broad based trend, it's not going to be materially influenced by the outperformance of any one or any collection of tenants.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, I believe this reflects the fact that we're doing a good job making our properties better and hopefully taking market share from other properties operating in our markets and that comes from adding better tenants, adding additional anchors, adding renovations, and making our physical plants better. And all of those things are feeding into what you're seeing as our bottom line sales growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Paul, this is Steve. I'll just add one more comment that if you componentize that growth a bit, the rate of sales pace growth that we're seeing in the outlets and the malls is pretty much on top of each other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, I mean, would you say that kind of the non-same tenant number is maybe &#x2013; if you're 10% comps year-over-year, is it half of that is due to change in mix or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say this, our comp numbers and our rolling 12 are right on top of each other.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Yeah, okay. Thanks. And then just on terms of new concepts, I mean, there's been good growth from a lot of the public chains have sort of gotten back into growth mode. I haven't seen as many new concepts. So at least relative to the kind of 2004 to 2006 period and maybe that's sort of what spurred a lot of development that you're not seeing now? But maybe, Rick, are you seeing signs that we're about to see an acceleration of new concepts?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, David. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about some of the synergies and maybe best practices that both Kl&#xE9;pierre and Simon are sharing with each other and I realize it's still in early days but are there any sort of success stories or things that you could sort of talk about that  show how things are transforming across both companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look the fact is we've been very focused on the balance sheet as you know they've raise a lot of money in the bond market at much lower spreads than where they were before hand. So that's a very tangible, very important credible and important thing that we brought to the table. I'm not sure that absent our investment that they would have been able to do. We've also reduced the reliance on their funding from BNP and I mean those are real tangible in the balance of the organization making happen.</p>
          <p>And operationally, I mean, we're helping them think about all of the promotional other income opportunities. I mean that's going to take time, but we are now talking to certain sponsors on a global basis. We've helped them with a few tenants in a few areas on a global basis. Their head of leasing was at our shopping center convention, the ICSC. We have a number of global meetings with him and our people with the global brands including H&amp;M, Apple, just to name a few, Hollister. So it's happening. That stuff is going to take time but the bond business is tangible, it's there, it happened and that's only been in four months.</p>
          <p>Now, strategically, you will see changes with this company over a period of time and the management team there has been very good, very cooperative, very interested in replicating what we have and listening to what we have to say. So it's working. It's a lot of work. We spent &#x2013; I spent last week there touring assets with them, going through strategy, going through numbers, going through developments actually, a scary thing, helping design some of the extensions it's scary because I was helping them and that's &#x2013; but there's certain things I've learned over the years, too.</p>
          <p>So it's happening, it's going to take time. There's a lot that we're providing, there's more that we'll provide over a period of time. We're also respectful, we've been there four months and we try not to be Attila the Hun, we want to learn as much as we can but the cooperation, the synergies are available, they're there. The chemistry between their managers and ours have been great.</p>
          <p>Look, the only negative is that every morning I have to hear about Europe every day. <mark type="ph" /> Harris (44:28) reminded me of some of the ups and downs that go with the territory in trying to create value. We're big boys we know nothing's easy but I look at it I'm getting paid to make this company better. And I've got a board and a management team that wants to get better and we've got people here that can help make them better. And it's happening and you can see it in the bond yields right away.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. I guess second question, last quarter we talked a little about the St. Louis project and kind of where are you and the other project from Taubman were. Now that you guys have kind of started construction and had your groundbreaking, I'm just wondering kind of maybe being first out of the ground, has the leasing dynamic changed at all and can you kind of provide us with maybe an update on where you are leasing on that project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we announced a whole host of tenants on July 11. We've added a few more to that mix. I mean, look, Taubman's a formidable competitor. I'm sure they'll announce certain tenants as well. We anticipate that they're going to build their project. We're going to build ours. Our numbers are &#x2013; we're comfortable with our investment. This is not driven by ego by any stretch of the imagination. We expect to get our lease. We expect to have double-digits returns.</p>
          <p>Taubman's a very formidable competitor. I'm sure they'll feel the same way about what they're doing and it's most likely that we're going to have two outlet centers there. But I think as I said, we're comfortable. We've got a lot of experience in the outlet business. I've been at it since 1998. People scratched their head when we did our first joint venture with Chelsea. People scratched their head when we bought it in 2004. I got confidence in our team. We expect to build a very high yielding outlet center and we're moving forward with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just a last question on the international outlets I see, I think if I did my math right, the Japan sales were up kind of 5% to 6% and I'm just wondering how do you look at Japan in terms of potentially new outlets and maybe talk a little bit about just how Korea's performing and also the new project in Malaysia and any update on the China project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Generally, all Asia is very strong, I mean there's supply and &#x2013; even with all the, it gets down to kind of almost Europe to some extent and even with all the macro headlines in Japan, I mean they're still doing roughly $1,000 a foot. And there's just not that many and there's just not going to be that many. We've got our ninth that'll open next spring. It's in a great location and we have a terrific partner in Mitsubishi Estate.</p>
          <p>So I don't think that nine is going to go to 18 though it might be a one or two or three more to do in the next few years. We're also, as you know there, we phase a lot of stuff in so we'll do three, four, five phases there. Japan, so even with all the headwinds and everything else, we've got a wonderful niche there and we'll continue to exploit it and increase the cash flow there.</p>
          <p>Korea is the same thing. There's one or two formidable competitors, but our outlets there are probably what, Steve, $700 a foot or $800.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$800, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$800 a foot. The brands that we deliver are great. We have a very good partner there as well, so it's fine. In Malaysia, it's exactly what we thought it would be. It's really trying to get access to the Singaporean market. We have a great partner there. They're doing stuff worldwide, which we're talking to them about some other opportunities and it's meeting our expectations there, so, so far so good.</p>
          <p>China is a little bit not as far along as we would like it. It's still a very complex place to do business. We're still hopeful that we'll get one started there, but it is more complex and we're being more cautious given the &#x2013; if you think there's a robust pipeline in the outlet business here, we happen to think that pipeline has been around for years and years and not much will get &#x2013; not much of it will get built. The pipeline there is &#x2013; expands daily. So, we're trying to really underwrite it smartly and make sure this is something that we want to do. We do have a good partner in Shanghai, but we're going to be very, very judicious in how we ultimately build something there.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan from Cowen &amp; Company. Please proceed.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. David, I appreciate all the commentary on Kl&#xE9;pierre. I have one other question. As I recall, their 2011 asset sales were completed at about a 5% premium to appraise to NAV and I believe at the beginning of this year, they talked about planning &#x20AC;1 billion of additional sales for this year and next. I wonder if you can tell us number one if that disposition plan is still in place and what the pricing expectations are relative to NAV.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look they're going to announce probably shortly here. But generally, I'll say this, and I want to be very careful, everything &#x2013; they're ahead of schedule and NAV by and large has not been an issue in terms of being able to tell the assets at or above their NAV, but you'll see the results. I don't want to &#x2013; I just want to be very careful here because they do report &#x2013; or they may have already reported. I think they go out at 6 o'clock Central European time. But so far so good, and it's still on plan, perhaps ahead of schedule and it's moving right along.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, second question on Woodbury, which you mentioned earlier and you mentioned also in the last call in terms of the expansion potential there, can you indicate whether the plan is to add square footage on land you already own or on land you otherwise control?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's land that we own. So it's really reconfiguring a number of spaces, decking some of the parking  and creating additional space on the land that we own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. It's about a 60,000 square feet addition primarily reconfiguring the additional &#x2013; the existing formats and just substantially upgrading the whole physical plant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separately on Amazon, David, you touched on this, again, in your prepared comments but as they prepare to pay sales taxes in several large states this quarter and open more infill DCs, have they had any discussions with you about opening outlet or full-priced stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then final question, just a line item in other income, maybe for Steve, the interest and dividend income was down materially on a consecutive quarter basis, I wonder if you could tell us what's going on with that line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things, Jim. Number one, the dividend from our UK investments CSC was a second quarter event last year, third quarter this year, just the timing of their payment of that dividend. And then we had some investments in some loans that were, in fact, paid off earlier this year. So interest income is down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We were bummed out about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on a full-year basis, so the loans that were paid off, it sounds like the variable on a year-over-year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on a year-over-year basis, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the other point is we did have the mezz loan with Mills and obviously that got paid off and retired as part of that whole transaction, so you're seeing that as well, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just another Kl&#xE9;pierre question, David, your involvement in forming the strategic direction for the company, does that involve acquisitions at this stage or is Kl&#xE9;pierre somewhat held back by leveraging cost of capital at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that they are. I don't know that it should be their number one focus and we actually did discuss at the recent meetings a couple of opportunities that are out there. But I don't think it should be their number one focus. But I don't think it's too far off in the future that it could be up there and we do think there's going to be a number of opportunistic deals. And again, it doesn't mean, Kl&#xE9;pierre could be Simon, it could be all sorts of things. But there are going to be a handful of those things to do and I think it should be on their agenda, but probably not at the top of the list.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just in terms of Brazil, could you give us an update on discussions with retailers regarding the Brazil outlet industry? And in particular, I'm interested in kind of what the domestic Brazilian retailers thoughts are on the outlet industry and the outlet channel given I guess the infancy of that industry down there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a almost, I want to say, 30 days ago kind of a presentation to a number of Brazilian plus international retailers about our outlet pipeline with BR Malls. It was very, very well attended. The international retailers are growing there daily and certainly the high-end guys that we think are important to bring into the outlet properties are gaining entrance into Brazil on a weekly basis, so to speak, like Tory Burch just opened a store, the new high-end mall in S&#xE3;o Paulo, so very, very well attended. The Brazilian retailers are very excited about the pipeline and we expect them to populate these outlets aggressively, so it's very, very encouraging kind of what's going on down there.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Wes Golladay. A quick question on the outlets. We've heard the number, 100 outlets in 10 years. Do you think there's actually more capacity than that for development in the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, and I wouldn't put much credence &#x2013;  in our opinion, look we could be wrong. But certainly, we don't think there's 10 outlets or 100 outlets in 10 years, not a chance. We don't see it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I guess maybe how would you view it? The total opportunity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think there'll be a handful, but I don't see 100 outlets in 10 years, not a chance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And turning to the malls, what do you guys see in terms of traffic trends for the last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Christy McElroy from UBS. Please proceed ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Sorry for all the outlet questions, just have a follow-up. Given the pipeline in the U.S. with competing projects and quite a few private developers in the fray, I'm wondering how influential the core group of outlet retailers are in a center actually getting built, and while demand for space is obviously very strong today, how are the deciding factors for retailers signing a lease in a new project different compared to what they were five to seven years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I &#x2013; we're living this every day. I would say to you, it is still quite a challenge to convince outlet retailers, whether they're manufacturers or full-priced retailers &#x2013; at least this is our experience, and we have a pretty good portfolio, a pretty big one. I think it's still quite a challenge to convince them to go to new centers that's why all of this talk about this unbelievable demand and all of this, these hundred centers and this, that and the other, I got to tell you, we work our tails off to convince retailers that this is worthy of an outlet center. So I don't think it's by any stretch of imagination simple and easy to do. When we do it, we have confidence we'll do it. But it is not like you can plop these anywhere by anybody and it will be successful, it's just not going to happen. And I think the retailers that have a high understanding of this business, whether they're manufacturers or full-priced retailers understand that and will also govern their open to buy very seriously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add is I, think we would hope that the retailers have a high regard for the consistency of what we've produced. David and I were just up in New Hampshire and visited Merrimack. That is an incredibly well executed, well-leased, well-marketed project and hopefully we have that going for us when we approach retailers about our new project. They have confidence that we will &#x2013; they know what we will deliver and know that it will produce.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on your property operating expenses, they seem to run a little bit lower than normal again this quarter. I know in Q1 there were some favorable comps given weather and such. I'm wondering if there was anything specific in Q2 that you could point to, any trends that favorably impacted OpEx this quarter? And is there a way for you to break out your same-store and NOI growth between revenue growth and expense growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a way to do it but we don't. I assume &#x2013; we know what drives our business. Look, where size and scale, when we talked about this company 15 years ago or 17 years ago or 18 years ago, we thought size and scale mattered for a couple of different points, retail relationships, ability to run efficiently, ability to cover our overhead at the executive level over a huge asset base more efficiently than our peer groups. That's what it takes to generate comp NOI growth and that's what we do. Nothing jumps out as where we're reviewing it right now that is worthy of mention, but we are very focused on our operating margins and our size and scale and quality of assets allow us to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, guys.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just a quick question in regards to any early indications about what Back to School may look like this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really too early to say at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. And then David, any other market &#x2013; I mean, you guys have your fingers in many key markets, but any other markets internationally that you might be interested in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, not &#x2013; I mean, look, we have a big investment in Kl&#xE9;pierre and I think internationally that's the big focus. We got to make sure that that turns out to be a profitable investment. We're &#x2013; that's the number one priority. The outlet business in Asia continues to progress. I explained that in detail to you, but that's really the focus. I mean, Brazil, Latin America, I mean, I do think will present more and more opportunities, not just Brazil but all of South America for the company and so I think you'll see us hopefully do some smart things down there over time.</p>
          <p>And Steve's whispering to me, but you can certainly jump in there but we do have, we are building in Canada, Toronto, I mean Toronto, there was a lot of talk about it, there was not a lot of talk about it now. We are under construction. We're going to have a great outlet there. We got a great partner, we're looking at a another deal in Canada, but hopefully that will be a market that will possess &#x2013; present a few more opportunities for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then just the last question in regards to the supplemental line of credit, the additional $2 billion. Should we be reading something into that in regards to you guys are seeing something out there that you need that additional source of capital for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just say it's consistent with our philosophy to be as prudent and opportunistic as we possibly can be. I mean you're always trying to balance prudence against opportunity they tend to kind of conflict each other. When you should be prudent, there's a lot of opportunities and we tried. So you try to get that right balance and the world &#x2013; let's face it, the world is going to continue to be uncertain for I think a few years to come. If not, that's just the world we live in so there's no reason not to be &#x2013; not to have the ability to be both prudent and opportunistic. And then based on how we read the tea leaves, figure out where the primary &#x2013; who wins, prudence or opportunity?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. I had a question on the Main Street Fairness Act. Do you view this initiative as ultimately a revenue booster for your centers or is this more of a defense mechanism?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think it helps &#x2013; I think it's going to help our merchants. Anything that helps our merchants ultimately helps us. And look, Congress should not &#x2013; look, this is a states right issue. I think most people in this country believe in state rights, so that's one aspect of it. But also, the government &#x2013; Congress should not be picking, creating winners and losers and this certainly has helped fuel the online against the bricks-and-mortar. It's certainly, we're not &#x2013; oh, this is going to mean X million of revenues. But if it helps our merchants, it's bound to trickle down to us in some way, shape or form.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the states that have already begun collecting tax from Internet companies, you haven't really seen a noticeable difference in sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's so early in that effort that I would &#x2013; certainly, we haven't seen anything but it is just beginning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On Kl&#xE9;pierre, I don't see the second quarter numbers out yet, but in the first quarter, retail sales in Spain were down 6%, Italy was down 2%. What's the bull case for the company to potentially turn these markets around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I think the bull case is that its supply and demand will be in their favor once demand picks up because you cannot expand. It's very hard to get a right to build there. And the other point is they've got a great portfolio in Northern Europe, which is somewhat insulated from what's going on in kind of &#x2013; the Scandinavian area is somewhat insulated from what's going on in Continental Europe. I think operationally, there are things that we can do to help the company increase its cash flow. An operational focus from the company, we think, will increase the cash flow. I think that's a bull case.</p>
          <p>The negative is, look, they're going to have to weather a tough environment. The one country there that continues to be difficult for them is Spain. And again, it's not all of Spain. It's certain assets in Spain. And we'll weather that storm and I think as things stabilize, we'll get back to being able to generate cash flow growth from those assets.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and maybe just a follow-up to David Harris's question, if the euro continues to decline, how would that impact your decision to potentially acquire the remaining part of the company?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just going back to the same-store growth, I assume a good portion of that is coming from the 3.7% average base rent growth. Can you give us some detail on where the 3.7% growth is coming from, especially given your spreads are right around 10%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're basically in a position of one, increasing occupancy; two, we're adding a considerable number of anchors that are generating revenue. But it's just re-leasing our space at higher rents. And when you look at our expiring rents and look at what our average rent is we've got a nice spread in there and as our product gets better we're able to take advantage of that and generate the higher rental revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. The 3.7% is in your small shop, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 10% spreads like I assume about are across maybe 10% to 13%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think. Nate, this is Steve. I think and we've had this discussion before on calls. But one of the things, we calculate our spread in the most conservative way possible, which is what is the ending cash rent that a tenant was paying compared to the beginning cash rent that the new tenant or the same tenant on the new lease is paying. And that is a much more conservative approach than the GAAP method of which you are preparing financials, which would include the straightlining of both the old lease and the new lease so that's going to have some impact on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I understand that, even on a cash basis, the delta between, let's say, 1.3% to 1.5% let's say from your spreads to 3.7% across a very large portfolio is still pretty wide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you got overage &#x2013; I mean, you got a lots of things that you're taking overage rent and you're capturing it in the new base rent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you've got a lot of things going on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one final question, a follow-up on St. Louis. Can you give us some insight on how the tenants are viewing the two projects. Are there any tenants that you're aware of that have said no to you because they were going next door?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Yeah, there are handful of tenants that said no to us, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are there any tenants that have signed in both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are some that have expressed that they're prepared to do both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it safe to say you're not putting in normal radius restrictions? Or you're not having any success putting them in...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a tenant-by-tenant discussion, so I don't think there's any &#x2013; it's a tenant by tenant. We're going to tend to get that for the people that commit just to us like we do for every other outlet center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just then, the only other thing to say is we have announced, as David said, we're now 62% leased and committed. So that is certainly consistent with the kind of leasing progress we have had on all of our new projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Just a couple of quick follow- ups. First on leasing, could you comment on &#x2013; I figured releasing spreads that you quote are on a cash basis. What would that look like on a straight-line basis? So that 10% number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ki Bin, we don't calculate it on a straight-line basis. As David has said, I think gazillions of times on these calls, the laser focus is cash flow and so that's the way we look at the spread.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be higher, though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah that's all I was trying to get at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still getting steps in all of our leases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if it's possible, could you comment on what is the average vintage of the leases that have been expiring this year? Are they like seven years old and the second part of that question is if you could calculate, what would the &#x2013; on a like-for-like basis, the sales per square foot be, back then versus today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why, I want to caution you on two things. One, and Steve touched on it earlier, when we roll over, we've done a very good job over the years getting much more focused on our breakpoints and our overage rent . So when you look at the relationship between the spreads and our comp NOI  growth, there's a comp NOI being generated from sources other than just our spread and David just said, we also build in all of our bumps over the course of the leases, so the ending rent has already been impacted by our ability to raise the base rent over the existing term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But if you look at 2004, 2005 sales per square foot, they were in the 400's.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're rolling leases over. I mean our expiration, I don't have it in front of me, but it's in the mid to high 30s. I mean that's &#x2013; so now, we're at 550 and we're getting &#x2013; yeah, and now we're getting in the 50s. So I mean that gives you a sense of what's happened on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that's what you asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. So to clarify that, so you're saying roughly on a like-for-like basis...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in other words, we were &#x2013; if you look at the leases we did six, seven years ago are rolling off today, these are rough, rough numbers but they were $38 &#x2013; $37, $38. That probably was just under 9% &#x2013; probably under 10%, probably 9% of sales. And if you look at where we are today, we're 550, and that relationship is probably still pretty the same. But therein lies the spread differential, if that's what you're thinking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Thank you. And just last quick question. In respect to your comps at 1.5%, 1.4% Treasury rates, and maybe risk premiums offsetting some of that decline, how has that impacted B mall pricing and have you seen any additional activity on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, and I think the supply, which is great, I mean this is what PIMCO, this is what Bill Gross said. I mean the fact of the matter is unless the real estate is going out of business, okay, the fact is people are going to need cash flow growth, right? And that's the world that we live in.</p>
          <p>In a slow growth environment, rates are going to stay low. Cash flow is going to be stable. I mean, if we proved anything to you over the years, it's that this real estate is relative. It doesn't mean that certain things don't turn against us, and they have. Okay, we've had centers that we've lost for whatever reason, but these things are sticky. Cash flow is stable and yield is there and you're seeing it by opportunistic investors. You're seeing it &#x2013; I mean, in Europe, you're seeing it. The stuff that Kl&#xE9;pierre is selling is to yield-hungry investors, why would they want to buy the German Bund when they can get a six-yield or five and a half or six-yield on a stable asset. I think that's great for us to be in, not just us, but all real estate companies. And that's a very attractive feature, one of the reasons why we're increasing our dividend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. It's Michael Bilerman. David, I just want to come back to the unit purchase on J.C. Penney and I think most would agree with your comment that units think of them as one-for-one common stock equivalents. So being able to buy something back and create $60 million of shareholder value is impressive, given the fact that there's still another 61 million units outstanding. And so, was there something particular about this OP agreement with J.C. Penney that where there was restrictions or something that would have caused the value of that stake to be 20% less than what the market is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There's only one operating partnership and all the unit holders are treated the same. There's a preferred unit, but we're getting rid of that soon. But all of the unit holders, there's no separate different agreements. They're all the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so then, going back to the question of getting a 20% discount. Was there a time lapse effectively if they came to you and said I want to exercise, I'm going to put my notice in to redeem my units and now you have the option of delivering them stock or cash was that, was there a time that they saved on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The time actually was very quick, but put that aside. We actually didn't get notice technically but there was a discussion about the, relatively simple, if they give us, they did not give us notice, they give us notice, they get their stock and they can market it. We actually, Shelly correct me but we actually have to register the stock, I think, right? So, it's freely tradable, we register it, boom, done. It was in the discussion that obviously, it turned to cash. We part, believe it or not, we part with our cash. We're very tough whenever we write a check out of this building. We are very focused on parting with our cash, we like cash and that's what happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if they were to take stock, how quickly could they have monetized that stock to see...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, 2 million shares, I assume it's pretty quick.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so why would someone leave $55 million on the table? I mean it's not like small potatoes, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to get into that. Let's move on, Michael.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is there other opportunities that you have which &#x2013; you still have 61 million units. I recognize a lot of them are family. There's a bunch of family units in there, but is there other opportunities where you can buy back stock at such an accretive discount?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'm just curious what the board's course of action has been since the proxy and the shareholder vote?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well look, I mean, it is &#x2013; the board obviously has taken the vote to heart. They are very focused in talking to shareholders about it. The good news &#x2013; I mean, the fact to the matter is we're putting this &#x2013; we are focused, our number one focus, and that's me, Rick, Steve, the other members of our team, is on the business, okay? And obviously, our performance over this year, last year the &#x2013; for as long as we've all been together, it's pretty good and it speaks for itself.</p>
          <p>And we have all the confidence in the world that we'll continue to deliver very good performance to our shareholders. There's no guarantee but that's the focus. The vote, given our performance, was extremely disappointing and we didn't understand the vote and there's enough precedence out there to suggest it was &#x2013; we just didn't understand the vote.</p>
          <p>But we'll be talking to our shareholders about it, trying to understand the way they voted it and I will say that we've had some discussions, there's not a clear consensus as to why we voted, they voted against it. We've had a number of shareholders that were supportive of it. But the board will take its job very seriously. We welcome any shareholder comments. They will &#x2013; we've had discussions with shareholders, we expect to have more and we'll take it from there.</p>
          <p>But the number one focus obviously even though we're disappointed because we've been such stewards of capital and performance continues to be how do we make this company better and we do it every day. But we've had discussions and we'll continue to have more discussions with shareholders.</p>

          <p>Again, and just lastly hope this is okay from J.C. Penney, but should we expect any other announcements between you and J.C. Penney in regards to maybe buying anchor boxes or other sort of ventures with them in the future.</p>

          <p>Well not, no. This thing was just really focused on the transaction that we did. We'll talk to them like we talk to all of our retail partners but that's &#x2013; I wouldn't expect anything out of the normal course of business.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller fro JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Most have been answered but just one question. David, in the past, you cut up the U.S. portfolio based on sales just to show how concentrated it was and x percent of our NOI comes from over $800, over $500 a foot in sales. When you look at the Kl&#xE9;pierre portfolio, how concentrated is it on that basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really not up for me to do that, but I'm sure they'll welcome the question. They, I will say this, they do a very sophisticated analysis of their portfolio, buys, holds, redevelopment, but it's really not up for me to do it. But I do think the quality is there. The opportunities for enhancing the operations were there, but it's really not up for me to do that. I will tell you though, they are very sophisticated in how they slice and dice the portfolio and what they want to do with the assets.</p>
