      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to SABMiller's First Half Results Presentation for our six months ended September the 30th, 2009. With me today as usual is Malcolm Wyman, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First the formalities. Our presentation will contain forward-looking statements and these statements reflect the current best judgment of the management, but include risks and uncertainties and the company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines. So, now let's get started.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that we have delivered a strong performance for the first half of F10 against a background of continuing economic weakness. We've maintained broadly stable volumes in a face of very weak consumer demand and we've raised our underlying EBITA by 11% despite commodity and currency headwinds related to input costs that persisted in the first half.</p>
          <p>This slide that you can see at the moment is deliberately similar to the one that I used at our last full year because our strategic approach unchanged. We've continue to benefit from the unique operational strengths of the businesses at the local level which we've built over many years, delivering our underlying profit result through a combination of strong revenues and solid cost management.</p>
          <p>We're capitalizing on our strengths, local consumer insights, a leading portfolio of local power brands as well as effective and efficient in-market execution. Our consistent strategies continue to drive value and in these difficult economic times the resilience and flexibility of our business model is being proven. And we're continuing to invest in building our capabilities and leveraging our scale for the future. All in all, we believe that our medium-term growth prospects remain promising.</p>
          <p>Turning to the period at hand, we've had a busy first half. In Latin American we saw a continuing rise in share of alcohol in Columbia and higher beer market share in Peru with further mix improvement. We continue to extend and improve the management of our routes to market with direct pre-selling and more control over third-party distributors, more outlet coverage and better outlet information.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. our MillerCoors synergies are on track and in a weak economy affecting beer volumes and segment mix, we've done well with growth in Blue Moon, Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller High Life and Keystone Light and higher share in the premium light segment which is feeling the economic pressure at a recent pricing round took effect in most markets last month.</p>
          <p>Central Eastern Europe continues to be strongly affected by the economic crisis, though some countries are proving more resilient than others. Russia looks particularly challenged as time goes on with the recent excise and regulatory proposals that are very negative for the industry there. Generally, the health of our brands continues to be a driver of market share gains with strong pricing also delivered through the period.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we're very pleased with the renewed growth in Chinese volume and market share, now above 20% led by Snow brand. Unit profitability has also risen significantly, driven by, amongst other things, synergies from previous acquisitions in the central region across distribution operations and brand portfolio rationalization.</p>
          <p>Africa remained in growth while we continue to expand our footprint, for example, in Ethiopia, the acquisition of the country's largest bottled water company and in non-alcoholic beverages with the acquisition of Maheu in Zambia. We've have continued to expand our beer portfolios in both the local premium and the more affordable price segments.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, cost savings targets were exceeded during the period enabling significant brand and market investment plans, which are being activated, including consumer promotions for Castle across the country in 2010 in association with the World Cup. We also announced a broad-based black economic empowerment transaction, which has been praised as a role model for future deals.</p>
          <p>Turning now to progress on the Group's four strategic priorities, which we pursued consistently over recent years to deliver value for shareholders. The first of these is creating a balanced and attractive spread of global businesses. Each of our regional positions affords us attractive volume and value growth opportunities, and it's a well spread and diversified footprint, a footprint that provides the most attractive exposure to diversified global economic growth within the brewing peer group, as you can see here.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2011 through 2015, the weighted average GDP growth expected in our countries of operation range between five and 6% per annum. In contrast, our leading two brewing peers are predicted to experience weighted average economic growth of three to 5% per annum, with a steeper hill to climb out of the recession of this year.</p>
          <p>GDP and population growth are two drivers of what we call the embedded growth of a market. This chart illustrates the proportions of SABMiller's and the peer's markets which are expected to offer low, medium and high-embedded growth prospects. It's clear that SABMiller is well positioned with the highest proportion of volume in high growth markets, indeed double the exposure of the second peer and considerably less presence in the low growth areas.</p>
          <p>While a rising tide is helpful, it's not sufficient on its own. We'll continue to excel and differentiate ourselves by creating and driving the growth of the beer category with our skills and commercial capabilities. And we've not built our volumes or market shares at the expense of unit profitability. As this chart shows we have contributed to the enhancement of the industry profitability in recent years as we've implemented our growth strategies. This is due to our unique focus and success in building the strongest and most valuable local brand equities and secondly our leading local sales execution and operational efficiency. Both of these serve to build category value in both revenue and profitability. This is true in markets that are highly competitive, such as Poland, and in markets where we have clear leadership, such as Ecuador, and it underpins our belief that we've created not just a balanced but also an attractive spread of global businesses.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our second strategic priority, developing strong, relevant brand portfolios that win in the local market. In Europe we continue to leverage our strong brand equities in all our key markets and we grew our total share across our European markets by around 0.25 of a point. In Poland the Lech brand has grown its share of the premium segment by over a point to 32%, driven by successful national promotions despite the tepid economy. Nationally our share is up nearly three points, to 45%.</p>
          <p>In the Czech Republic we continue to target value share growth based on our strong brands and market position, but volume share was slightly down. In Russia, our premium portfolio has suffered from economic weakness and down trading partly offset by the strength of the Kozel brand. In Romania, the Timisoreana brand which is market leader with a share of 16%, continues to grow; quite an achievement in a market which is down 16%. Timi is now 37% of the mainstream segment, a gain of nearly five points, driven by strong retail execution and impactful sponsorships. Our overall share was up by nearly 1.5 points to 31%.</p>
          <p>In Hungary, a recessionary market with current down trading in beer, we've leveraged the traditional heritage of the K&#x151;b&#xE1;nyai brand, which has grown 5% in a market down 5%. Overall share was up nearly half a point.</p>
          <p>In Africa you heard us refer to the strengthening of our brand portfolios, both our national champion mainstream brands and the development of more affordable offerings to attract subsistence alcohol consumers. This year we're also pursuing a deliberate 'premium beer from here' strategy across the continent, creating local premium brands with common positioning across different countries.</p>
          <p>In Mozambique the local premium offering is Laurentina Preta, which has grown by over 60% this year to form 22% of our local volumes. The other four brands shown here all fall into this local premium category with many common positioning elements allowing for marketing economies of scale across the continent.</p>
          <p>We are at the early stages in Africa of creating the type of very profitable local premium segment that we've built in Europe and more recently in Latin America, benefiting from both price premier and volume scale.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to improve the way we bring our brands to market, leading the way in customer and channel development and enabling better revenue management. Across Latin America we've been increasing our outlet penetration and restructuring sales, upgrading from traditional van selling to value-added pre-selling and telesales.</p>
          <p>In the last six months, in Ecuador for example, our outlet reach has expanded by over 6%. Our channel developers are now better able to optimize our brand and package assortment by outlet, gaining access to better outlet information and shopper insights and drive better unit revenue performance. And we're achieving better worthmore brand penetration as well.</p>
          <p>In Africa similar growth opportunities exist. Our sales force in Africa has been significantly increased during the year to enable new initiatives. Where possible we optimize the use of each distribution platform by expanding the product offering across all beverage types.</p>
          <p>And in the U.S. MillerCoors has increased focused and investment in major on and off-premise chain retailers that are the growth drivers of the industry. We're seeing signs of success in MillerCoors' national chain programs on a larger scale than in the past, in 7-Eleven, Safeway and Kroger for example. MillerCoors is gaining share in targeted chains in the critical premium light segment, and in particular are gaining share in convenience stores which are the largest U.S. channel.</p>
          <p>Our third strategic priority is constantly to raise the profitability of local business sustainably. In adverse economies we've grown underlying EBITA by tight management of revenues and costs.</p>
          <p>In Latin America we're benefiting from the firm pricing we've implemented through F09 and from the improved sales mix I referred to earlier. We've implemented broad-based cost reductions in Colombia and distribution cost improvements in Columbia and Peru, using more efficient load handling and less third-party transportation for example. Marketing efficiency has also improved. Underlying EBITA is up 33% and cash flow is up strongly.</p>
          <p>In Europe our restructuring activity is in check and the Netherlands and Poland are starting to bear fruit. These are expected to drive an upper single-digit real reduction in total fixed costs for the financial year and a head count reduction of 5% in those countries.</p>
          <p>We have capitalized on the superior equity of our local brands through firm pricing and market share performance has been good. However, headwinds do persist from reduced operating leverage and higher depreciation, particularly in Romania and Russia. Increases in excise have also affected volumes this year and potential further increases remain a threat to market volumes in Europe, and most notably in Russia, but in other countries as well.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the U.S. Rising profitability is also a key feature of our MillerCoors JV. Our JV synergy program is on track to deliver $500 million in savings. We're phasing slightly ahead of our schedule, as shown here. As we've said, this is driven 60% by brewery network optimization, in other words, reduced distribution costs, and 40% from other savings. We've seen a large financial benefit with synergies falling to the bottom line as promised, generating pro forma MillerCoors  EBITA growth of 28% over the last 12 months and a MillerCoors margin uplift from 9.4% to 11.7%.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the remainder of the synergy program comprises just over three percentage points of MillerCoors' current annual revenue, which should go to improving its EBITA margin. And a fortnight ago we quantified MillerCoors' continuous improvement savings at $200 million over the next three years, which would be equivalent to approximately two further points to MillerCoors' margins. So all in all, our profit and returns picture in the U.S. is strong as expected.</p>
          <p>In China, our profit improvement has accelerated. Snow continues to grow volumes and market share across a broadening geographic footprint. With over 18% share as a brand out of CR Snow's overall 20% share, Snow is now larger than the market's number two and number three brands combined.</p>
          <p>Over the last 18 months further progress has been made in building the consumer equity of the brand complementing the street level execution skills of the business. CR Snow has started to focus its marketing on four distinct Snow variants which will increase its presence in the upper mainstream and local premium segments shown on the slide.</p>
          <p>These are being sold nationally, each with a different price point, formulation and positioning, from modern and stylish to traditional and iconic. CR Snow has reaped considerable cost synergies from previous acquisitions, particularly in the Central region around Anhui and Zhejiang. These synergies are derived from manufacturing, distribution and brand portfolio rationalization.</p>
          <p>Raw material prices have reduced in China earlier than in our other regions. And CR Snow is increasingly able to leverage its considerable scale economies in China across procurement, operations and route to market, although clearly there is much more ahead.</p>
          <p>Our fourth and final strategic priority is to leverage our skills and global scale. The Group's scale has increased substantially over the past five years with compound growth volume, revenue and EBITA of 11%, 15% and 17% respectively. The diversity of the Group has increased with strong growth across many smaller markets and new market entries on several continents. Beer markets are becoming more sophisticated, with consumer tastes and occasions, brand/pack portfolios, routes to market and retailing all modernizing.</p>
          <p>Our supply chain has globalized considerably as has our competition. In this context we're now investing to create a step change in our global IT systems, processes and information to leverage better our regional and global scale. These investments are designed to sustain our top-line growth and competitive position, enhance our supply chain efficiency and effectiveness and further reduce costs across procurement, commercial operations, finance, human resources and IT. We expect material benefits from these investments, streamlined, simplified business management with more consistent and deeper market insights. Country management teams able to focus more on commercial functions, globally integrated procurement and back office systems to centralize and outsource routine transactions enabling lower costs and coordinated oversight of diverse businesses. Common front office and supply chain management platforms to leverage regional scale, lower costs and reduce the impediments from national boundaries. Faster, easier sharing of information, knowledge and best practices across the Group and easier assimilation and synergy capture from acquisitions.</p>
          <p>There are a few early milestones that I can highlight as examples. In South Africa one of our first stage initiatives has been the outsourcing of our shared service center to a leading business process outsourcing firm. There are many associated benefits, including current cost reductions, the avoidance of future spend, for example, on future IT applications, and intangible benefits such as improved quality and consistency of data. And in Latin America, we've made progress with the development of an IT platform that is integrating our supply chain, sales and operations planning. The benefits shown in the pilot include both working capital improvements and improved customer service levels. We expect our customer service and revenue management to improve more in the future as a result of new platforms and capabilities we'll be putting in place over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Another development is the creation of a new global procurement company which will over time manage the majority of the Group's purchases. Based in Switzerland, this company will capitalize on the procurement scale of the Group. The past system was based on global coordination and knowledge sharing. This will move now to centralized purchasing for the whole SABMiller Group. All key suppliers will be included, barley, malt processing, hops, aluminium, glass and other items in marketing and capital equipment for example.</p>
          <p>We expect to be able to raise considerably the standard and professionalism of all our buying. This will result in system efficiency and make use of our scale in attracting and developing talent. It will deliver a significant proportion of the long-term cost savings from the overall suite of capability investments that Malcolm will describe in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>So all in all, it's been a strong performance for the half across the business. Good progress on our strategies and continuing investment for growth.</p>
          <p>Now I'll hand over to Malcolm to look at the results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone. As in the past, my presentation will focus on results on an organic constant currency basis as this better reflects our underlying performance and profitability.</p>
          <p>Now, the Group has delivered good U.S. dollar earnings per share at growth in the first six months despite having a small but significant adverse currency impact on both the transactional and a translational basis resulting from the weakness of our major operating currencies against a relatively strong U.S. dollar in this period when compared with the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars was up 6%, while strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 28% was achieved in pound sterling. The interim dividend is US$0.17 a share, which represents an increase of 6%, in line with our growth in U.S. dollar earnings per share.</p>
          <p>Total volumes for the first six months of 139.6 million hectoliters were down slightly on an organic basis assisted by marginal growth in soft drink beverages. Lager organic volumes were down almost 1% for the half year, which we consider to be, nevertheless, a resilient performance given the economic pressures felt across our markets. Strong lager organic volume growth in China and Africa largely offsets the volume declines in other markets.</p>
          <p>Organic constant currency Group revenue grew 3.1% supported by price increases taken across some markets in the latter part of the previous financial year. This is a strong result given the 10% organic constant currency Group revenue growth achieved in the same period last year. Whilst down trading has become more prevalent, the premiumization trend is still evident in many of our markets.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITA grew strongly, up 10.7% on an organic constant currency basis, reflecting the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Organic EBITA at reported exchange rates was down by just over 1%, affected by the relative weakness of our major operating currencies against the U.S. dollar in the first half.</p>
          <p>The Group's EBITA margin increased 110 basis points versus the prior year on an organic constant currency basis, reflecting a return to our objective of continuing to increase our operating margin. Whilst Group revenue was up 3.1% on an organic constant currency basis underpinned principally by firm pricing across all of our regions in the prior year, you can see the major adverse impact of almost 10% of Group revenue that the weakness of our major operating currencies against the U.S. dollar has had. However, these currencies have strengthened during the first half, with both the South Africa rand and Columbian peso approximately 30% stronger.</p>
          <p>Revenue per a hectoliter grew across all regions. In Latin America revenue per a hectoliter growth of 7% was achieved as most countries had priced strongly over the last two quarters of the prior financial year. Revenue growth was assisted by marginal mix benefits through growth in premium brands.</p>
          <p>Revenue per a hectoliter in Europe grew by 6% despite a shift from on-premise to off-premise consumption. The region has also seen consumers trading down into more affordable brands given the difficult economic conditions.</p>
          <p>In North America MillerCoors' revenue per a hectoliter grew by 3% driven by ongoing price increases across all beer segments.</p>
          <p>In Africa revenue per a hectoliter grew by some 11% in our subsidiary businesses as price increases were taken basically in line with inflation.</p>
          <p>Strong revenue management in China drove revenue per a hectoliter up by 5% in Asia.</p>
          <p>And in South Africa the two price increases taken in both the beer and soft drink businesses during the prior year generated revenue per a hectoliter growth of 9%.</p>
          <p>Our underlying performance in the first half of the year was strong, delivering EBITA growth of 10.7% on an organic constant currency basis. This double-digit EBITA growth reflects the revenue benefits I referred to earlier, lower distribution costs, optimized marketing spend and a reduction in real fixed overheads, all of which offset the increase in raw material input costs.</p>
          <p>On a reported currency basis organic EBITA declined 1.3%, reflecting the impact of adverse currency moves of some $266 million in that period as a result of our significantly weaker operating currencies against the U.S. dollar compared to the same period in the prior year. All of our key operating currencies were weak against the dollar with Central and Eastern Europe and Latin American countries most affected in that period.</p>
          <p>In Latin America we delivered very strong organic EBITA growth of 33% in constant currency terms despite a decline in volumes. Margin increased 410 basis points to 20.9% as price increases taken in the prior year grew revenue by 7%. The benefits of restructuring initiatives undertaken in the prior year on the cost base continued to be felt in the first half.</p>
          <p>Marketing costs were also lower in the first six months of this year as we cycled high prior-year comparatives which included new product launches and brand and pack renovations of existing brands. Lager volumes declined 1% as depressed consumer spending together with political and social unrest in Peru and Honduras contracted those beer markets.</p>
          <p>However, we continue to grow our share of total alcohol in Columbia, and in Peru we increased our beer market share. In addition, our premium portfolios across the region showed strong growth and were up 15% on the prior year supported by robust growth in our Club Colombia and Coste&#xF1;a brands. Soft drink volumes grew 2% led by a good performance in Central America.</p>
          <p>Our Europe business continued to be impacted by very difficult economic conditions in many markets, as depressed consumer spending contracted beer markets resulted in down trading and a move from on to off-premise consumption. Our lager volumes declined 6% on an organic basis. We achieved market share gains in Poland, Romania and the U.K. with strong momentum behind our key brands. Solid pricing across most markets, primarily in the prior year, combined with lower marketing costs as a result of high prior-year marketing spends due to the Euro 2008 Football Championships and the Beijing Olympics delivered EBITA growth of 5% on an organic constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Now, the results of our North American segment for the six months to 30 September 2009 comprise our 58% share of the results from the MillerCoors joint venture together with 100% of Miller Brewing International. The comparative results for the prior year comprise of the results from Miller Brewing Company as a standalone subsidiary for the first quarter. And then our 58% share of the MillerCoors joint venture and 100% of the Miller Brewing International for the second quarter. On this basis, North America delivered good EBITA growth of 7%.</p>
          <p>The MillerCoors joint venture lager sales, excluding contract brewing for the first half, decreased by 1% on a pro forma basis, while sales to retailers were also down 1% on the same basis, driven by continued softness in the above premium and premium brands.</p>
          <p>Strong revenue growth and a lower cost base were achieved through planned synergy savings, which helped drive a 22% increase in MillerCoors EBITA for the six months on a pro forma basis.</p>
          <p>During the period MillerCoors delivered synergy benefits totaling 133 million, largely reflecting logistics and marketing synergies and fixed cost savings as we continued to eliminate cost duplication within the combined MillerCoors business.</p>
          <p>A total of $211 million in synergy savings has now being realized since the start of operations on the 1st of July, 2008. As previously communicated, MillerCoors now expects to deliver incremental cost savings of another $200 million above its original commitment of $500 million in synergies by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>For the first time we are reporting separately on the Africa and Asia segments of our business to reflect the underlying performance of those regions. In Africa organic lager volumes grew 3% during the period as our diverse geographic footprint helped to shelter us from challenges in some key markets.</p>
          <p>A strong performance from our businesses in Uganda, Zambia and Mozambique as well as our associate Castel offset reduced volumes in Tanzania and Botswana. In Tanzania the effects of a soft economy compounded by extreme drought in the northern and central regions whilst our beer business in Botswana continued to be impacted by the 30% social levy imposed on all alcoholic beverages in November 2008.</p>
          <p>Capacity expansion projects in Uganda, Ghana and southern Sudan have recently been completed and new plants in Tanzania, Mozambique and Angola will be commissioned soon to support growth across these markets.</p>
          <p>Soft drink volumes grew 5% on an organic basis with good growth across the region while other alcoholic beverages declined 5% following a period of very strong growth last year.</p>
          <p>EBITA grew 15% on an organic constant currency basis and EBITA margin improved 190 basis points driven by robust pricing and a good performance from our associate Castel which benefited from volume growth in Angola following the commissioning of new capacity.</p>
          <p>In Asia lager volumes grew 9% and organic constant currency EBITA grew 29%, reflecting a strong performance from CR Snow, our associate in China, where reported volumes grew 15% in a market that only grew 6%. CR Snow's national brand Snow continued to exploit its national positioning achieving significant share gains in the key provinces of Anhui and Zhejiang.</p>
          <p>Our business in India experienced a difficult first half with volume declining 21% as a result of regulatory issues in the key states of Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and excise increases in Karnataka and Rajasthan.</p>
          <p>In Australia our joint venture business delivered strong growth in a flat market supported by good sales of Peroni Nastro Azzurro, Miller Genuine Draft and Bluetongue.</p>
          <p>In South Africa lager volumes declined 3% as the economy weakened and consumer spending reduced. As expected, our year-on-year market share has declined. Our mainstream volumes performed better than our premium volumes supported by strong growth in Castle Lager and Hansa Pilsener.</p>
          <p>Despite lower volumes, revenue grew 6% and EBITA grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis as we continued to benefit from price increases taken in the prior year which more than offset higher input costs resulting from higher underlying commodity prices and adverse foreign exchange moves.</p>
          <p>In addition, sales and marketing expenditure increased substantially behind our key brands and we also intensified investments in consumer-facing group to market capability, correct distribution and improved service levels to customers. Fixed cost savings funded the majority of this additional investment.</p>
          <p>EBITA margin declined by 30 basis points in the first half as pricing benefits were weighed down by higher raw material input costs driven largely by higher commodity prices and the unfavorable foreign currency rates that I referred to earlier.</p>
          <p>Now, raw material input costs, which rose some 16% on a constant currency dollar per hectoliter basis last year, continued to rise in the first six months of the year, although at a slower rate as we began to benefit from some commodity price reductions.</p>
          <p>Total costs of goods sold were up mid-single digits in the first half, following an increase of 12% in the prior year. We have benefited from lower spot aluminium prices in some of our markets over the last six months and distribution costs specifically have fallen on the back of lower international oil prices.</p>
          <p>However, high sugar prices which were recently at a 28 year high and increased glass costs have offset these savings. Our medium-term supplier contracts and foreign currency hedge positions, whilst mitigating volatility in commodity prices, have restricted our ability to take full advantage of lower spot commodity prices in the short term.</p>
          <p>Turning now to exceptional items. Our total exceptional charges of $239 million have been taken against profit before tax in the first half of the year. Business capability program costs of some $187 million make up the bulk of these of items and I will provide further detail on these costs and the program's benefits as we go forward into the next few slides.</p>
          <p>Integration and restructuring costs incurred in Europe, $41 million, relate largely to the closure of the Kilchy (38.12) brewery in Poland. This brewery closure forms part of the wider restructuring initiatives undertaken by our Europe business last year which together with restructuring in Latin America are on track to deliver annualized pre-tax benefits of 37 million in the current financial year, as announced in our financial 2009 year-end presentation.</p>
          <p>Integration costs relating to the MillerCoors joint venture of $7 million are substantially lower than the $61 million incurred last year and relate mainly to staff relocation costs. The additional 4 million of other exceptional charges relate to the unwinding of fair value adjustments on MillerCoors' inventory.</p>
          <p>Our business capability program, the reasons behind it and that it comprises a number of individual but interrelated programs which will be implemented at various times over a four year period, has been explained earlier. All regions will be involved, although the impact on each will vary depending upon their circumstances. This overall capability program involves significant changes which are information management and systems, processes and procedures and also the use of global outsourcing providers which will benefit our customer-facing commercial activities, our supply chain, our procurement and also our finance, human resource and IT functions.</p>
          <p>Strong project management has been set up. Accountability for delivery of each of the individual elements of the program is clear with overall oversight provided by the SABMiller executive committee. There are robust project governance structures and program assurance is provided by independent experts. There are important aspects to this program, notably procurement, finance and aspects of HR which involve a global design, while customer facing and supply chain elements are being designed region by region. Our program management approach takes this into account with strong regional coordination providing the backbone to implement and integrate these projects. As there will be important changes to our organization design and our ways of working as a result of this program, there has also been a strong focus on changed management from the outset to ensure successful execution and delivery.</p>
          <p>The business capability program cost is incurred principally in process design, systems builds and implementation and reorganization costs. The majority of the additional cost over our normal IT CapEx will be in our financial 2010 and 2011 years, declining significantly in financial 2012 and 2013. Our 2010 exceptional charge of approximately $370 million will be the largest in one year, with our financial '11 charge some 40% less and then in financial '12 and financial '13 these will be lower by similar percentage reductions.</p>
          <p>The program represents a step change in our business capability and we will treat the costs which cover design implementation and reorganization as exceptional items. Systems build and hardware costs which largely replace planned ongoing IT capital expenditure will be capitalized as normal.</p>
          <p>The business case is attractive with steady state income statement benefits exceeding $300 million per annum. Income statement benefits will accelerate from our financial 2012 and will be fully achieved in financial 2014.</p>
          <p>The benefits are derived mainly from procurement and outsourcing savings as well as a reduction in overheads, but there will be added benefits from quicker decision making and efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>We intend to accelerate and increase benefits by introducing process changes and other learnings. There will be cash flow benefits of over US$350 million from working capital which will largely be delivered over the financial 2010 to 2012 years. As new ways of working are captured, some of this benefit has already been recognized in our half-year cash flow results.</p>
          <p>Looking further forward and not included in the benefits described above, we will see intangible gains from having better information for decision making, simplification and market focus for in-country operations. We will also have a stronger platform to support integration and capture synergies from any future major acquisitions.</p>
          <p>I'll now move onto our Group financial considerations. Normalized EBITDA, which includes six months of dividends from the MillerCoors joint venture, is down 6% on last year as the strong organic constant currency performance over the first half of the year was more than offset by adverse currency impacts driven by U.S. dollar strength in that first half. However, normalized EBITDA margin improved by 30% basis points.</p>
          <p>Net working capital generated an inflow of $300 million in the first half of the year following a Group-wide focus on working capital management. Despite our heightened focus on the timing of inventory purchases, higher underlying commodity prices and adverse exchange rates drove inventories up year on year.</p>
          <p>Receivables were well-managed over the period, but debtor balances did increase in some markets following the extension of credit terms to key distributors, particularly Central and Eastern Europe, given the difficult economic conditions.</p>
          <p>In certain markets customer credit terms were increased to provide a more competitive customer offering. However, positive working capital cash flows were generated by a disciplined approach and selectively extending payment terms in many of our major markets. The Group will maintain its focus on identifying working capital improvements and locking in the benefits when realized.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure of $739 million was $529 million lower than last year, evidencing the normalizing of the Group's capital expenditure after a period of major capacity and capability-related expansions. Some 300 million of the 739 million spent on capital expenditure in the last six months relates to prior-year capacity projects, which are being completed in the current year.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, being net cash generated after investment activities and dividends paid to minorities, improved by over US$1.1 billion versus last-year period, evidencing a significant improvement in the Group's cash generation. The Group's effective tax rate for the first half of 29.4% is 80 basis points lower than last year's full-year rate, reflecting our ongoing focus on managing down the Group's tax charge.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position at 30 September has increased from the financial 2009 year end largely due to the recent appreciation of currencies against the U.S. dollar offset to some extent by lower CapEx spend and improved working capital management. However, net debt at 30 September is similar to the level at 30 September 2008. Our financial structure remains strong with gearing at 47%.</p>
          <p>We undertook a major refinancing in July 2009 when we completed a successful debut of 1 billion bond issue with a maturity of five and a half years and a coupon of 4.5%. This refinancing exercise has established our capability in accessing a new investor base and further strengthened our diversification of sources of funding in debt capital markets.</p>
          <p>Committed headroom available to the Group has been increased to in excess of US$3 billion as at the 30th September this year. The reductions in floating interest rates have reduced our overall cost of debt and our average interest rate at 30 September has fallen to 6% from 7% at 31 March, 2009. 70% of our debt is held at floating rates, and that includes inflation-linked debt, to take advantage of the lower interest rates that we had expected.</p>
          <p>Now, the pie chart on the slide shows our net debt profile by currency after the impact of derivatives. As you can see, we have a well-balanced net debt currency profile given the spread of our businesses. As we report in U.S. dollars, we also maintain a reasonable portion of our debt in that currency. The maturity profile shows that the majority of our debt matures after two years. We currently have substantial headroom available to refinance debt falling due in the next two years in terms of existing undrawn committed facilities and cash resources as well as significant in-country banking facilities.</p>
          <p>Now, the good underlying revenue growth that we achieved in the first half is expected to moderate over the remainder of the year as the business cycle's price increases across key markets in the latter part of last year. Price increases will generally be lower than those taken in the prior year as commodity cost pressures ease and inflation drops across most of our markets. Reported results are expected to benefit from favorable currency moves in the second half of the year given that our major operating currencies weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar over the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Reduced capital expenditure and a continued focus on working capital management are expected to support the Group's cash generation over the rest of the year. Capital expenditure for the full year is expected to amount to approximately US$1.4 billion, down by US$747 million on last year. Over the next three years we expect a further phased reduction in capital expenditure to an annual rate approximating some $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Input costs are expected to be higher than last year's, but lower brewing raw material costs and fuel prices will assist in slowing the rate of increase in these costs. Finance costs for the full year will be lower than last year as a result of lower interest rates. In the second half finance costs are expected to approximate lows in the first half.</p>
          <p>Finally, our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be in line with the first half of the year rate of 29.4% compared to the prior-year rate of 30.2%.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll hand the call back to conclude.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Malcolm. So in conclusion, from our advantage point, we see the economic headwinds continuing, although perhaps moderating on average. Consumer indicators such as unemployment and retail spending which are relevant to the beer category are lagging the reported possible stabilization of GDP performances. Of course, this varies around the world with some regions still in growth and others less buoyant.</p>
          <p>But almost across the board, our local brand portfolios are performing well. The equities that we've built over time result in both market share and pricing gains. Our cost management has been and will continue to be rigorous, with more cost fixing achieved than we'd anticipated. And we're passed the peak in our contractually fixed commodity costs, with more favorable currency movements expected to benefit our results looking ahead.</p>
          <p>So, all in all, the Group's medium-term outlook remains strong and we continue to build on our strengths.</p>
          <p>Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Simon Hales from Evolution Securities. Please go ahead with our question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, it's Simon Hales. Two questions if I can, please. Firstly, just on the margin in Latin America, obviously a very strong performance again in the first half. Two things on that, I'm just wondering where you feel you are against the original targets you set out at the time of the Bavaria acquisition in terms of the efficiencies you've achieved in that business. And specifically, perhaps how we should look at the margin developing in the second half of this year and beyond. Obviously a lot of the investment on the brand refresh programs has been done and already benefited you in the second half of this year and the first half this year as that's rolled of, should we be expecting organic margins to trend towards your medium-term guidance from here?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, Malcolm, on input cost tailwinds as we look forward. Obviously, it sounds like more of a benefit for F11 than perhaps the second half of this year, but what level of real raw material deflation should we be thinking about for F11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Simon. Let me just talk about the LatAm situation briefly and I'll ask Malcolm to handle the second part. Yes, I mean, I think it's true to say that the LatAm business is pretty much on track, in fact, we're about covering cost of capital right now going through the EVA &#x2013; going into positive EVA. So we're pretty much on track both in time elapsed and rate of improvement overall.</p>
          <p>Margins, we do expect continuing margins. I mean, there's a still a lot of moving parts obviously and we're a bit cautious about the margin progression for the second half in LatAm, but elsewhere as well, because we did apply very substantial price increases to recover commodity costs last year, and the intention is for price increases is much more moderate going forward both because of consumer inflation has come down and also because commodity costs pressure have eased.</p>
          <p>So we certainly do anticipate in the future further margin improvement, but not perhaps as strongly based on price recovery. We did say, we have said over last while that we expect to be able to resume EBITA margin progression once the economic turmoil has died down, and we certainly, as Malcolm said explicitly, we're certainly still expecting that to happen overall. It's just that in the second half the very strong pricing is not going to be followed with further price increases, so the trend of margin improvement has been faster in the first half than we would expect it to be thereafter.</p>
          <p>Perhaps Malcolm, you can talk about the currency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and just to add to that, Graham, certainly we've met our targets with Latin America; you'll recall, we did that deal in F06 and we said we'd be EVA positive within five or six years, we're actually four years out and we've met our targets. So I think that's been a very gratifying position in Latin America.</p>
          <p>As far as our input costs are concerned, yes, we have said that we don't expect too much in the second half. The guidance we gave in May still stands although we are running at slightly lower levels, as you've seen, from high single digits down to mid single digits. But the benefits that we would expect from some of our hedging contracts starting to run out come in the latter part of the second half. So going into financial '11 we will see a picture where brewing raw materials we would expect to see deflation in brewing raw materials but on the other hand packaging raw materials, particularly glass and perhaps not so much in aluminium, will still be exerting pressure, and then again we will get some benefit from our distribution cost where the price of fuel is obviously down. So commodities are slightly different across the board, but what it means is that they will definitely be an easing of input pressure in F11.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. It appears that your South Africa business after a few years here of some margin pressure and top-line pressure due to currencies seems to have stabilized. Can you give us an update on what's going on there and what new management is doing? And can you give us a sense of what kind of impact BEE may have over the next coming quarters and years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll ask Malcolm to talk about the financial effects of the BEE deal. Yes, overall, as you say, the drift has stabilized. In terms of total market share, that's been more or less steady for the last nine or 10 months at roughly the 90% sort of level. On the positive side, obviously, the harder economic times has at least slowed down the premium drift. So our mainstream brands are a bit more back in vogue. And also, from a management point of view, we are certainly increasing the support, the marketing activation behind all of our mainstream brands in particular. So we are seeing and we would expect better performance out of those.</p>
          <p>There has been pretty rigorous cost management. The efficiencies have been achieved and those are being reinvested back in the market. We are increasing marketing spend actually pretty dramatically. And we're also increasing both effort and spend on retail execution across all classes of trade. You probably know that the competitor is due to open their brewery &#x2013; well, I think it was due to be around this peak. We don't think that it will be a feature really until after Christmas. But we think that we've done a lot to the business and we're continuing to do a lot more and we're ready for whatever further competitive situation may arise.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, any sense of a possibility of margin recovery back to where it was historically or is this still a long process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a long process. I think there will &#x2013; there should be some margin recovery because, I mean, the margin has been affected by input cost pressures on the &#x2013; particularly with the rand declining as it did. And the roll-off of commodity costs that Malcolm has been describing applies to South Africa as much as anywhere else, and in fact perhaps more so because of the rand's ups and down. So we do expect margin recovery, but that will be a long process, and to get back to historical margins in South Africa I think will take quite few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards the BEE question, I'd just make a few points about that. It was announced in July and it was very well received by all parties and particularly the South African government at the time and also by all constituents. So I think we're going to get some benefits in a tangible sense as well as tangible. So that is something which very difficult to quantify.</p>
          <p>As far as the actual costs are concerned, I think, we have said that we would expect to take a non-cash cost, which is an IFRS 2 cost in our income statement of around about $200 million over the first year or two. And that is a non-cash item, which is just based on a share-based IFRS 2 calculation.</p>
          <p>So essentially we now have 10% of our &#x2013; and that comes in next year, it doesn't come in F10, it comes into our 2011 year. In this year we will have probably the costs of the deal which will be about $10 million coming in the second half and we'll treat that as an extraordinary item, in fact, both items will be treated as extraordinary.</p>
          <p>But going forward we will have some 10% of that business in black economic empowerment hands, and, as I said, it's been very well accepted by all constituents and we think that that benefit will rub off onto the company in South Africa.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Graham, Malcolm. Two questions, please. Graham, you referenced the lag between reported GDP and the impact on the consumer in economy and unemployment. Is there any reason to believe that lag is any more than usual? Do you think that it could be a year before it comes back or is it something that you expect to come back in the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second thing, specifically on South Africa, as well as the new brewery, Brandhouse will be introducing a returnable packaging format. Is that likely to give them another one-off share gain as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, on your first question, what I'm really trying to say is that we're not so sure about these reported GDP numbers to be perfectly honest, because if you look at &#x2013; beer volume growth are not normally a lagging indicator, they're about a concurrent indicator. Now, sure, they're a concurrent indicator of consumer performance, not necessarily total GDP performance. There have been a lot of moving parts around the world. I mean, this has been an extraordinary shock to the world economy. So I suppose for reasons that I can't think of there may be some unusual leads or lags involved. But as I say, I can't think of any reason why they would be.</p>
          <p>What I'm really doing is just sounding a note of caution based on the fact that the underlying consumer data that we see, principally unemployment, but also other consumer goods sales are running behind a lot of the rhetoric and commentary that you read in the newspapers. So to be perfectly honest, I'm not so sure that we're not being talked up a bit out of recession than previously. So that's about the best that I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any particular...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I'm not an economist, and actually beer is not a lagging indicator normally, it's about a concurrent indicator. So but we just don't see indications of what would give rise to sort of surges of optimism. I think things are better, but they're mildly better and it looks like a long, slow haul.</p>
          <p>Then on the South Africa situation, yes, I mean, strictly speaking there's no real reason why the start of the brewery should herald any particularly new regime as far as the consumer sees it in South Africa. Physically, what will happen is that some of their multi-serve presentations, the 650, 700, 750 milliliter bottles, instead of being produced and sold as one-ways, non-returnables will now be returnable. And that I think will probably make some difference to their economics and it might make the system a bit more convenient for them and perhaps to the retailer. But as far as the consumer effect is concerned, we don't see any reason why the start up of the brewery should affect the dynamics particularly. I mean, on its own &#x2013; I have not idea what else they have planned, but that's certainly would be true of the brewery itself.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Jason DeRise from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. I wanted to touch on three things. Pricing, obviously you're saying that it's going to be a smaller impact going forward. When are you expecting to take your next round of price increases in Latin America, Europe &#x2013; I mean, obviously these are going to be broad general statements, we don't need to go into every single market, but &#x2013; and South Africa. And specifically in Europe, I'm just wondering if because the input cost pressures have been so harsh and we've seen it in Western Europe where pricing from the industry has continued even though input costs have started to fade, is that a pattern that maybe we should look at in Europe or are the consumers just too weak there?</p>
          <p>The second thing, touching on the input costs, in Latin America, correct me if I'm wrong, but are your hedges a bit shorter in profile and that maybe we do see a bit more of the benefit this year in Latin American relative to some of the other regions?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, on the cost savings targets and working capital, are those worked into management remuneration, and maybe you can specifically talk about what you're compensated on both at top level and also lower levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me, Jason, take these in turn and perhaps ask Malcolm to help. On the pricing, it's very difficult to get a consolidated picture across the globe on pricing because we don't manage it and we don't look at it globally. So if I just talk about a couple of things. In Central and Eastern Europe, I think there are further price rises to come, but a lot of those are actually based on excise tax increases that are either in effect or planned to come into effect. So those have a depressing effect on the industry without &#x2013; because we don't get the margin from them.</p>
          <p>There's nothing extraordinary planned for Europe, but nor is there where &#x2013; in fact, and let me just say it's about the whole world, there's no intention to freeze prices around the world. But nor on the other hand is there the requirement to pass on huge commodity cost pressures because that's by and large now in the base.</p>
          <p>The next point though is that all of the regions of &#x2013; all of our regions are affected, not only by commodity costs per se, but also by the currency rates on a transaction basis because the major raw material commodities are all priced in euros or dollars. And when that gets translated into the local currency of operation, that's obviously done so &#x2013; that is obviously done at the prevailing foreign exchange rates. Now, in Europe those currencies have not recovered to the extent on average that they have in the rest of the world. And so the commodity cost pressures in Europe are for that reason alone &#x2013; in fact, that is probably the only reason &#x2013; would persist for longer than they would for instance in Latin America where by and large the currencies have recovered.</p>
          <p>In South Africa the currency has recovered also, but South Africa happens to be affected by hedges taken out against the rand &#x2013; against the rand dollar leg and those do persist into &#x2013; or some of them persist certainly into next year. So the situation across the world doesn't really differ in respect of the commodity costs per se, it differs depending on what the local currencies are doing against the euro or the dollar, depending on which commodity we're talking about and where it's been bought. And I think that that covers your question about Latin America as well.</p>
          <p>Europe, you asked about the weak state of the consumer &#x2013; the consumer pocket or the consumer economy in Europe, and of course that is a concern. I mean, those economies have been more affected than most in our line up and we are concerned about further placing further pressure on consumer. So it's a judicious balancing I suppose you could call it.</p>
          <p>As far as the cost savings are concerned from the capability programs, yes, of course, those will be &#x2013; there's no specific intention to focus incentives across the broad company on those targets, but those targets will be baked into the business expectations of the individual businesses, and those business expectations, i.e. budgets, are the things on which management bonuses are based to a very large extent, certainly as far as the one-year &#x2013; the short-term incentive schemes are concerned. So you can be assured, if that's your question, that those targets will find their way 100% into the operating budgets across the countries. And of course for those directly involved in the projects, I mean, their incentives and remuneration will be tied very closely to the delivery of the projects themselves.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions then a couple of just clarifications, please. On one of the early slides you put up your balance of volume by different sort of growth rate markets. Using that, it seems to imply you expect a range of between two and 4% volume growth at the Group level. Given what you've have said in terms of CapEx phasing down to 1.1 billion, could you just give us a feel for how many years of growth you've got at that sort of rate before you have to step back up in terms of CapEx? Is 1.1 billion basically maintenance CapEx?</p>
          <p>Then a quick question on the U.S. pricing strategy. Obviously volumes remain weak in the U.S., just re-assurance if those price increases are sticking and that you guys are going to stick to your guns in terms of value creation.</p>
          <p>And then finally, on a clarification &#x2013; apologies if I've missed this, but the business capability program of 300 million, does that include your share of MillerCoors? And can I just confirm that you said the working capital inflow of 350, that already includes the 300 million inflow we saw in the first half? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Hi, Chris. I'll ask Malcolm to again take the questions on the capability program. Yeah, on your volumes versus CapEx &#x2013; I mean, Malcolm must also comment, but to view that across the world is actually just not helpful because the growth rates differ so much around the world. So what we've said is that the &#x2013; we thought the CapEx should come down to about 1.1 to perhaps 1.5 billion as a range; that would include both maintenance CapEx and CapEx which is applied for other reasons. I mean, there is a level of expansion CapEx that goes in all the time and there would be a mix of that.</p>
          <p>So off the top of my head I would say that somewhere around three quarters of a billion, perhaps 800 million, perhaps a bit more would be usually maintenance CapEx normally on a steady state basis and the balance would be capacity and expansion. Now, those are not very useful numbers because what we've done, for instance, is to scale back our capacity program very dramatically in Europe and Europe is not showing too many signs of life as far as future growth is concerned, so that you can assume would remain switched off for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>In LatAm there are things that we need to do in a CapEx sense and so I think there will be more of a sort of steady state going forward situation. We're expanding in Africa and we're expanding in China. China is via the joint venture, which is largely self-funding and also we have partners there.</p>
          <p>So, yeah, I'm not sure that I can be much more specific than that. I think we're coming back down pretty much towards our normal long-run CapEx rate right now, and that CapEx rate would certainly cope with a two to 4% volume growth across the Group, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if we were to see an improvement and out of recent Europe, mindful that consumption rates have matured there quite rapidly to be fair that that's where the delta would be upwards on terms of CapEx, but as I say -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've put a lot of CapEx into Eastern Europe now. I mean, we've got a lot of things happening there &#x2013; that have happened there rather, over the last little while. And we're also looking at the European supply situation more and more progressively as a grid and less and less on a sort of country self-sufficiency basis. So we think that there are some capital efficiencies that we can bring to bear over time in Europe, so certainly we're focusing on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be able to share what your capacity is in Europe now, to give us a sense of what sort of headroom you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, I don't have a number like that in my mind. We don't normally release utilization numbers on that basis nor do I think it's all that meaningful actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, just to add to that, Chris. It's not meaningful. If you take, for example, in Russia we've just opened and have ready and available a brand new brewery with three million hectoliters which we can use, so we've got plenty of capacity in Russia. In other areas, we've actually closed a brewery in Poland and closed a small one in Romania. So we've got capacity there and we've taken some of the capacity out.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, in Africa we're actually putting CapEx down because of the strong growth in Africa. So what I was trying to indicate there is that given normal volume growth that should be a sustainable level. However, if one of our areas happened to start growing very quickly, then obviously we would want to put CapEx down in that and it may have a blip. But the other areas would still be sitting with spare capacity. So you could have some countries or in some regions with spare capacity and other regions or countries running out of capacity. And that is actually happening in LatAm in one or two of our areas.</p>
          <p>So what we've done is tried to take a good look and a hard look at where we think volumes will go over the next year or two given the economic outlook. And it's subject to volume growth. If for some reason we find that the economy bounces in 12 to 18 months time, country-by-country we will have to have a look at our assumptions, but we're pretty comfortable with what we've said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Take care.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question on prices increases in the U.S, yeah, I mean, that's pretty much business as usual, because, I mean, I'm not aware of any particular difficulties in getting those price increases to stick. So I think &#x2013; yeah, I don't think there's anything really to report there. The pricing environment is fine. I mean, it's really down trading that is a feature in the U.S. and also volume softness.</p>
          <p>I have mentioned that of all the places where we see perhaps a firmer tone in trading, the U.S. is not one of them. In fact, unemployment, as you probably know, is still rising in the U.S. and the general tone in the industry is probably still a bit softer.</p>
          <p>On capability, that working capital target is not in &#x2013; is not already in the current numbers. No to that. And the other question, you want to talk about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Two things there, the 300 million is actually all SABMiller's; that's the figure that we're looking at as the benefit in &#x2013; as a steady-state benefit going forward. And just to support what Graham has said, we are looking at &#x2013; this working capital level that we've achieved now is mainly from the discipline that we've been applying starting when the crisis hit and we said that we're going to focus very hard on working capital.</p>
          <p>However, we have started and have been running with our business capability programs, we have already outsourced some of our South African operations, and therefore there's a small part of that 350 million will be in what we've done already. And we'll give a firmer estimate of that towards the end of the year. But essentially what we're looking at is as we put this capability program in more and more, those benefits will come through in a more major way in the 2011 and 2012 financial years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question is from Jonathan Fell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I wanted to ask two things, please. First of all, can you give us an idea of what your marketing spend as a proportion of sales did in the first half and where it might go in the second? I know you referred to I think sort of overall Group levels of marketing spend being down a bit but South Africa actually being up. So can you sort of comment regionally on what went on a bit there as well?</p>
          <p>And secondly, your comments on Europe, you referred, Graham, to some concerns about excise increases and not just Russia. Are there any particular markets there where things are signaled to happen or is that just the general fear that governments are still short of cash and need to raise money?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's more the latter than anything else. The excise tax environment is pretty unfriendly at the moment in many jurisdictions, not least the U.K. And so we are a bit nervous in general about excise increases. The Russian one is the most eye-catching because of the percentage increase. Perhaps just to put that into perspective there, I mean, after the tripling of excise duties in Russia that is proposed for the end of this year, the beginning of next year, the duties in Russia will still be somewhat below those in Poland. So it is a relatively low tax regime at the moment. There are other excise increases going in or threatened. I mean, Ukraine is one of those as well and there are others around the piece, but the Russian one is the one that certainly is getting the attention.</p>
          <p>As far as marketing spend is concerned, yes, again, it's not a number, which is particularly meaningful on a global basis. If I just run round the houses &#x2013; sorry, in Latin America, there has been a reasonably significant downtrend in marketing expenditure, but that's got to be seen in context in fact, and the context is that the increase in marketing expenditure LatAm, planned and executed over the last probably two years before this was very, very high indeed and was pursuant to all the re-positioning, re-packaging, brand renovation et cetera programs that we put into place there as part of the business turnaround following our acquisition of those businesses.</p>
          <p>So as a percentage of net producer revenue, which is not something that we actually encourage, but, I mean, just seeing it's in my mind, that went from about 4% across the region up to about 11%  planned and is coming back down now to about seven or eight. And that's all exactly as planned in terms of the turnaround programs. So what we are seeing now is the decline at the end of that, and where we've got to in LatAm is more or less a desirable steady-state number we think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sure. And just on LatAm, am I right in thinking that that program toned down a bit in the second half last year in fact, so the year-on-year comparisons...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It started to &#x2013; I mean, a lot of that stuff was already in the base by the end of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Europe, we have dropped marketing somewhat, again, judiciously, and we're watching that very closely and in fact intending to resume, put that back on an upward trend. We think that what we've done is fine. Our brands are certainly still taking share and our overall positions are still taking share, as we've disclosed. So there has been some cutting back of marketing in Europe, which is a fairly high-spend area as far as marketing is concerned.</p>
          <p>In South Africa the trend is up. We are increasing marketing spend quite significantly, some of it funded by fixed cost savings &#x2013; or and productivity savings in general, as disclosed. It's trending up in Africa, it's also trending up in China from a very small base &#x2013; it's a small base in Africa as well but the trends are firmly up. In the U.S. they see some efficiency saving in marketing, but there's nothing of a policy nature, if you like. So that's kind of that I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. But just in relation to the capability program, I know you talk about income statement benefits from that, but how should we think about that in terms of savings dropping through to the bottom line and you taking decisions to invest selectively in certain parts of your business around the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really think that it affects our decisions to invest in different parts of the world. Quite a significant proportion of those savings will come from procurement, which is enabled by the other platforms as well as the actual pure procurement company setup. And obviously the gains will be spread around the world because we'll be procuring for the whole world effect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gains elsewhere are general efficiency improvements from business process outsourcing, business system rationalization and so on. And although those are meaningful savings, when you spread them out over the whole cost base, I don't think there's anything particularly startling in any one area. As I said earlier, I mean, those targets obviously will be baked into budgets and plans, which are going on. But it's not a huge step change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question is from Gerard Rijk from ING. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I also have the clarification on the business capability program. The 300 million that you mentioned, that is already &#x2013; is it only process improvements in decision making or is that already including the probably cheaper and global purchasing spending?</p>
          <p>Second question is on net debt. Net debt increased a bit more than I anticipated and I saw that from cash flow only 300 million came, while for the &#x2013; you're mentioning around 1 billion free cash flow. That gap, where does that gap come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just perhaps to tackle the net debt figure first, about 700 to $800 million of the increase in the net debt is a foreign exchange adjustment because of at that particular point in time of the balance sheet, the key operating currencies had appreciated significantly against the dollar. So as a result of that, our underlying debt in foreign currencies when translated into U.S. dollar terms went up by some $700 million odd and I think that's probably the adjustment you were referring to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I saw that adjustment. But then still, from cash flow it was around 300 million &#x2013; it's in one of the pages mentioned &#x2013; and that is below the free cash flow number of above 1 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I say, I'm not sure what that is you're referring to, because it looks as though it's foreign exchange that is the balancing figure. The 300 million that you're mentioning, is that the net working capital you're talking about? But we had an inflow of 300 net working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there's the exceptionals that we spent this year which would have been in the 200 million range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, maybe we come back offline on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the 300 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 300 million that is referring to about the savings in 2014, it's across all of the particular points that Graham mentioned, but specifically we would expect to get that from the procurement side but also the business process outsourcing that will be more efficient. And if you take cost for cost of what we're doing, it will be a lower cost. And then there's a lot of efficiency cost that we've actually costed in as well and there are some head count reductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but there are no top-line savings or synergies or whatever. I mean, we think that systems will add to business effectiveness, but there's nothing in to reflect that. These are pure efficiency savings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But does it include lower &#x2013; for instance, this lower bottle costs or lower IT costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes procurement and IT savings. Yeah.</p>
