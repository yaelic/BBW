        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The presentation of L'Or&#xE9;al's first half 2009 results will begin with a brief recap of the first half sales figures which you received on July 30 and then we will take a look at the profit and loss account, cash flow and the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>First half sales amounted to &#x20AC;8.70 million, representing growth of 0.4% at constant exchange rates, structure effects had a positive impact of 3.6%. It consisted primarily of the acquisitions of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; and 50% of Club des Cr&#xE9;ateurs de Beaut&#xE9;. To assist you in your projections, we can tell you that the structure effect over the full year for 2009 excluding any new acquisitions could be in the tune of plus 1.8%.</p>
          <p>As for foreign exchange, its impact was slightly positive at plus 1%, by extrapolating from current rates for the rest of 2009, particularly on the basis of &#x20AC;1 at $1.43 the effect on sales could be slightly negative to the tune of minus 0.8%. Now a few examples of consolidation exchange rate. In this table, we have given you the weight of the non-euro currencies in which our sales are made in descending order of importance. We can clearly see the predominant impact of the dollar and the positive exchange rate effect in the first half of 2009 plus 14.8% for currency which represented 22.8% of our invoicing. Note also the positive effect of the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen and conversely the negative effects for the pound sterling, the Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso. The euro, by the way, accounted for 35.5% of our consolidated sales in the first half of 2009 compared with 37.2% in the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>We will now move on to the consolidated profit and loss account. I should, first of all, talk about the changes made to the method used. From this year onwards, we have decided to split the exchange gains and losses item between the various lines of the profit and loss account concerned. And this brings us into line with what is now quite a standard practice and indeed most of you have asked us to adopt this new method. Therefore, we've reclassified exchange gains in the first half of 2008, which amounted to &#x20AC;28 million as you know. We have &#x20AC;29 million in gross profit, a charge of &#x20AC;3 million in research and development expenses, &#x20AC;3 million in advertising and promotion expenses, and &#x20AC;3 million in selling, general and administrative expenses.</p>
          <p>Let me give you the figures. For the first half of 2009, the total figure for exchange gains and losses came out as a gain of &#x20AC;33 million. Now that this point has been made we can move on to the commentary concerning operating matters. At &#x20AC;8.769 billion, sales grew by 1.4% based on reported figures. Gross profit amounted to &#x20AC;6.159 billion or 70.2% of sales. Gross profit is virtually stable compared with the whole of 2008, but has decreased by 120 basis points compared to the first half of 2008. The main factors which had an impact on the gross profit trend in the first half of 2009 are mainly as follows, a slowdown in product volumes, a negative exchange rate effect, the impact of promotional activity, and the increase in provisions for slow moving items in our inventories. Conversely, we should also note the positive factors related to the productivity of staff and equipment. So much for the gross margin.</p>
          <p>Research and development expenses amounted to &#x20AC;287 million, representing 3.3% of sales and this percentage has increased slightly compared with the first half of 2008. The same applies to advertising and promotion expenses at &#x20AC;2.634 billion, representing 30% of overall sales, an increase of 30 basis points compared with the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now despite the fact that this growth may look rather modest in ratio terms, in volume terms, it is considerable. Bearing in mind that significant cost savings have been achieved, firstly, in media buying, mainly in Western Europe and in the United States, in Northern America, and secondly in point of sale advertising. We are, therefore, in a position to confirm the implementation of the policy of strong advertising and promotional support, which had been announced as of the autumn of 2008.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A is amounted to &#x20AC;1.864 billion, the growth in these expenses based on reported figures does not yet reflect the scale of the efforts being implemented to keep costs under control; merging of teams, freezes on hiring in developed countries, freeze on head count in developing countries, reduced travel, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Now based on reported figures, the increase results mainly from the consolidation of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;. And to illustrate this point &#x2013; and based on constant exchange rates and constant consolidations curve, this item has declined by slightly over 3%.</p>
          <p>Overall, the operating profit at &#x20AC;1.274 billion comes out at 15.7% of sales, which is 8.3% lower than in the first half of 2008 which may I remind you constituted the highest historic level ever achieved so far.</p>
          <p>Last year, we placed great emphasis on how we base our results on constant exchange rate, you remember that and this was indeed necessary due to the scale of exchange rate fluctuations we had to face. But this year this is not really the case. We will therefore place less emphasis on this concept and to illustrate this point I would indicate that operating profit at minus 8.3% based on reported figures would have come out at minus 8.6% at constant exchange rate; in other words the figure is almost the same.</p>
          <p>The track record of variability in half year results. This timeline of our half year operating profit is simply intended to remind you of their significant variability and how it is impossible to extrapolate from the half year figure. You will also note that profitability in the second half year has for several years now regularly been lower than profitability in the first half.</p>
          <p>Let's now talk about the profitability figures for the branches and divisions. Once again, I would remind you that it is not possible to extrapolate for the full year using the divisions' half year profitability. The profitability of the Professional Products Division came out at 19.1% compared with 21.1% in the first half of 2008. Consumer Products Division reached 20.7%, a level which is very close to that of the first half of 2008.</p>
          <p>The profitability of the Luxury Products Division at 11.9% was significantly lower than in the first half of 2008. This division of course was adversely affected by a particularly difficult level of activity especially in the first quarter of 2009 and this is mainly due to contracting markets and to massive inventory reductions by its distributor customers. It is also important to point out that Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; was not consolidated in the first half of 2008. You all know that the specific profitability of the Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; Group was significantly lower than that of L'Or&#xE9;al's Luxury Products Division.</p>
          <p>You should also note that over the first half year the trend of the Yves Saint Laurent brand was inline with that of the Luxury Products Division. Finally, the Active Cosmetics Division has achieved a quite exceptionally high level of profitability at 28% of overall sales. This figure is the result of the phasing of launches and thus of the division's advertising and promotion activity you will have realized that it is not possible to extrapolate from this figure in any way for the full year. The total operating profitability of cosmetics comes out at 19% of its sales, non-allocated expenses decreased to 2.7% of sales compared with 2.9% in the first half of 2008 and 3.1% for the full year of 2008.</p>
          <p>The Body Shop has practically remained stable with a slightly positive figure, ever so slightly positive figure. You are familiar with the strong seasonality of the sales and more so even of the profitability of this business which makes all of its profits, almost all of its profit in the second half of each year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the profitability of the dermatology branch, Galderma increased in the first half of 2009. Each year, profitability tends to rise significantly during the second half year because of the pronounced seasonality of this business and especially the acne franchise. Second part now of the consolidated profit and loss account, we will talk about the net profit before non-recurrent items which is the basis for earnings per share calculation, finance costs were down substantially by minus 25% to &#x20AC;49.7 million. This is the result of lower interest rates and effective control of our cash flow.</p>
          <p>For the whole year, for this item we can anticipate finance costs in the region of &#x20AC;100 million, a figure which is very substantially lower than in 2008. The Sanofi-Aventis dividends amounted to &#x20AC;260 million. Profit before tax &#x20AC;1.581 billion, it has declined by 5.4%. Income tax amounted to &#x20AC;368 million. Taxation rate has decreased from 24.8% in the first half of 2008 to 23.3% in the first half of 2009. As you know, the taxation rate for the first half is never representative of the annual rate, particularly because it includes a mix effect due to the dividends paid out by Sanofi, all of which are received during the first half.</p>
          <p>To assist you in your projections, I can tell you that for the whole of 2009, we can expect the taxation rate of slightly over 27%. Overall, after minority interests, net income before non-recurring items amounted to &#x20AC;1.211 billion. And if we include the positive effect of share buybacks in 2008 amounting to plus 2.1%, the earnings per share amounts to &#x20AC;2.08 down by 1.5% over 2009 as a whole, the accretive effect of share buybacks should be small as we have suspended our program, we did this in November 2008, so it could be in the region of 1% plus 1% this accretive effect.</p>
          <p>Last part of the consolidated profit and loss account. That leads us to the net profit excluding non-recurrent items, we get to the net profit figure non-recurring items amounted before tax effects &#x20AC;169 million in the first half of 2009. And this is before tax effects. The items consisted firstly of intangible assets impairment for Yue-Sai, Sanoflore and Softsheen-Carson for total of &#x20AC;42 million. And secondly, our restructuring costs amounting to &#x20AC;127 million.</p>
          <p>The restructuring costs reflect industrial reorganization in Europe with the closure of the Albesa plant in Spain and the announcement of the plant to bring forward the closure of the Luxury Products plants in France. Number two, the merging of the organizational structures of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; and the Luxury Products Division in the various countries concerned. Number three, the continuing reorganization of the L'Or&#xE9;al USA subsidiary, the subsidiary that L'Or&#xE9;al has in the United States and the announcement of the reorganization of the activity of The Body Shop. After allowing for all of these items, the net profit attributable to the group amounted to &#x20AC;1.83 billion on to the cash flow statement.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, gross cash flow reached &#x20AC;1.553 billion which is a slight increase compared to the first half of 2008. The strong growth in the depreciation, amortization, and provisions line is the result of the restructuring cost provisions we've just referred to. The change in working capital when considered each year at the end of June is very much greater than it will be over the whole year. However, this year its growth is well below what it was at the end of June 2008.</p>
          <p>Now this is the result in particular of the reduction in inventories and trade accounts receivables from one half year to the next as you can see on this table reflecting the management efforts made and the vigilance of our organizational structures.</p>
          <p>Investments now; a bit lower down in the table. Investments both tangible and intangible at &#x20AC;303 million come out at 3.5% of our sales lower than the first half of 2008 where the figure was 3.9% of overall sales. Here again, a significant management effort has been made. For the whole year, investments may be expected to amount to between 3.8% and 4% of sales. After the payment of dividends, the remaining cash flow is positive at &#x20AC;41 million.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet now, the balance sheet structure is robust. Equity represents 52% of total assets. You can see that this is a fairly stable figure compared to the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Just one thing, we have made changes to our accounting methods as a result of the adoption of new standards and the consequence of that on our financial statements are setout in detail in the full statements which you will receive, Jean-R&#xE9;gis I believe at the end of this presentation, at the end of this session. For the purposes of this presentation, the main points are twofold; number one, the immediate booking of sample, catalog, and POS, advertising expenses which were previously booked as charges when the corresponding items were supplied to customers, this change has had the effect of reducing equity at December 31, 2008, by &#x20AC;89 million, most of which corresponds to a change in the prepaid expenses item in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Number two, the immediate booking as equity of unrecognized gains and losses relating to social commitments which is replacing the corridor method. This change has resulted in a reduction in equity at December 31, 2008, of &#x20AC;169 million and an increase in the provision for employee retirement obligation of &#x20AC;269 million and a certain number of adjustments in deferred taxes. Implementation of these two changes in accounting methods had no impact on profit.</p>
          <p>Now on to the last document; the gearing. Lastly, net debt amounted to &#x20AC;3.658 billion at June 30, 2009, compared to &#x20AC;4.520 billion at June 30, 2008. Gearing, in other words, the debt equity ratio comes out at 32%. I would remind you that our financial debt is well secured. It consists of some &#x20AC;2.5 billion of medium term bank credit, most of which matures between 2011 and 2012, with the rest consisting of commercials papers, which are well secured by standby lines. At December 31, 2008, net debt could be in the region of &#x20AC;2.5 billion. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. As you have seen despite a particularly difficult market context and a record historic base in the first half of 2008, our financial results over the six month period are robust and I think it is fair to say, of quite good quality. The operating profit is down by only 8.3%, with investments in research, advertising, and promotion rising in relative value. Our cost-cutting efforts are beginning to pay off with a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses of more than 3% at constant exchange rates and a constant structure basis. Net profit is down by only 3.6% and net earnings per share has declined by only 1.5% compared with 2008.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow has grown strongly by 67% and debt has been reduced by 19%. These results confirm the resilience of the L'Or&#xE9;al business model and reflect the first positive effects of the anti-crisis strategy adopted.</p>
          <p>To give you a fuller picture, I would now like to make some comments about the key aspects of our operations. That is, the market &#x2013; the cosmetics market over the first half, our sales momentum and the implementation of the anti-crisis strategy.</p>
          <p>As I had suggested previously, the worldwide cosmetics market overall has proved fairly resilient to the crisis, with according to our estimates a sell-out trend of between zero and plus 1% in the first half year. We really have to distinguish between sell-out and sell-in this year and a sell-in trend is between minus 1% and minus 2% with the difference being mainly the result of inventory reductions by distributors.</p>
          <p>In developed countries, the market trend was negative in sell-in by between minus 3% and minus 4% in the euro zone and in North America and more negative in Japan; between minus 6% and minus 7%. As forecast, the trend remained positive overall in the rest of the world with growth of around plus 5% and pronounced differences between one set of markets; Russia, Eastern Europe, Dubai, which is a flat or negative trend and the emerging markets; China, Asia, India, Brazil or Latin America which were clearly positive. It is hard to make forecast in the current uncertain climate but in our view market trends should be nearly identical in the second half year in sell-out terms. With sell-in, however, moving closer to sell-out as most of the inventory reductions are probably behind us now.</p>
          <p>As for our sales momentum, it is essential to analyze the situation division-by-division. As you've seen there are extremely contrasting sales trends between the various distribution channels. The market trend in Professional Products for hairdressing salons was very substantially negative in the first half year. The division's invoicing declined by 5% in this market, but all the indications show that we are substantially strengthening our positions across all continents. Our brand portfolio which you know &#x2013; which is the richest, most powerful and most comprehensive in the profession is enabling us to win over new salons everywhere and to strengthen our market share. 2009 will probably be the year during which we will have conquered the greatest number of salons. Our innovation momentum is stronger than ever before and our launches this year such as Texture Expert and Force Vector by L'Or&#xE9;al Professionnel, K&#xE9;rastase Ol&#xE9;o Slim and Matrix Opti-Straight are proving highly successful.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we are extremely confident. We believe that when the crisis is over, the hairdressing profession will regain all the dynamism it has enjoyed in the past and our positions will considerably be strengthened.</p>
          <p>As for the Consumer Products market, its trend has remained positive as we have predicted. With like-for-like growth in the region of plus 1.8% excluding the SAP effect in the United States, our division is doing well compared with its competitors. Market share is stable in Europe, increasing slightly in North America and Japan and growing strongly everywhere else with spectacular growth rates in strategic new markets such as China, India, or Brazil.</p>
          <p>Our innovation momentum is also very strong, particularly in the field of accessible innovation, with launches for which initial success is highly promising such as Visible Lift foundation, Elvive Re-Nutrition, and Lumi&#xE8;re shampoos and Telescopic Explosion mascara from L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, Lash Stiletto and Dream Liquid foundation from Maybelline, and Garnier Orchidea Vital Restore skin care, Fructis Volume Restructure shampoo, Bamboo hair lacquer and Herbal Brilliance colourant. Note, the very clear acceleration achieved by the Garnier brand whose brand values; green, natural and accessible are ideally suited to current trends. And the brand is moving rapidly into new categories and new countries and will certainly be a powerful growth driver for the division over the coming years.</p>
          <p>Luxury Products has of course been the division which has suffered the most impact from the crisis. In addition to the slowdown in consumer spending, which after all remains relatively moderate worldwide, at probably around minus 5 to minus 60%, sales in this channel at minus 13% have been hit by large and sudden inventory reduction measures taken by distributors, particularly in the first quarter and also by the many difficulties experienced in Luxury Products distribution across the globe.</p>
          <p>The closure of perfumery chains in Russia, major difficulties experienced by department stores in the USA and Japan, the collapse in Dubai and the sharp decline in airport store sales with the decline in air travel et cetera, the situation could be described as a perfect storm. In this extremely difficult environment our division has maintained its course and is continuing to build its future. A renewal is well underway at Lanc&#xF4;me with the spectacular success of G&#xE9;nifique and the very positive starts made by Hypn&#xF4;se Drama and Hypn&#xF4;se Senses which are being launched.</p>
          <p>Armani is continuing its rollout with the launch of a major women's fragrance Idole. Yves Saint Laurent has been fully integrated into the division, has succeeded with its first launch La Nuit de l'Homme, and is currently launching Parisienne, a very daring project. Our accessible luxury brands are now waging a defensive; Diesel with Only The Brave, Cacharel with Scarlett, Biotherm with a great new skin care Skin Vivo and Kiehl's which is the brand which is growing the most, with new boutiques that are proving a big hit, particularly in China and Japan. The division is now winning market shares again on all continents and it, too should be able to strengthen its positions by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Active Cosmetics had a slightly more difficult half year than forecast at minus 3.3% because of the negative trend in the worldwide dermocosmetics market which was slightly negative, a certain amount of inventory reductions by pharmacies and its disappointing slimming product campaign. But here too the division is fully operational and its brands are on the offensive. Vichy is winning back market share in skin care, La Roche-Posay is strengthening its position, Inn&#xE9;ov and SkinCeuticals are continuing their rollout and Sanoflore is being transformed.</p>
          <p>Powerful product launches are underway, such as NeOvadiol GF skin care by Vichy and Effaclar Duo and Derm AOX from La Roche-Posay to which substantial business driver resources have been allocated. This should lead to acceleration in growth in the second half. The division is also actively preparing for its appointed task of globalizing the Roger&amp;Gallet brand in 2010 which will enable the creation in pharmacies in all countries of a new category of perfumed toiletries of a type which for now only exists in France.</p>
          <p>Finally, The Body Shop proved resilient in the first half at plus 0.7%. This business is currently being reorganized to make it more innovative, dynamic, and efficient. It also has a very well stocked pipeline of product launches scheduled for the second half and for the end of the year particularly with the Nutriganics organic range. In short, as you can see, the situations of our divisions contrast sharply depending on the consumer spending momentum in their channel and the very differentiated inventory reduction effects they have had to face. Yet they all have one thing in common; they are all fully operational and on the offensive. The strategy of each division is clear. Their brand portfolios have been optimized and their product launch and business driver programs are very substantial, with the same objective in mind to win market share and strengthen their positions across the world.</p>
          <p>In geographic terms, the picture is relatively simple. On the one hand developed markets; Western Europe, North America, and Japan, the consumption trend in these markets was slightly negative in the first half and inventory reduction has been relatively severe in some channels. Our objective is to consolidate our market share in these countries so as to be in a position of strength when the markets pickup again.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, new markets; Asia, India, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, in total consumption trends have remained positive there overall and could well accelerate again in the second half. Our objective here is clearly to win strong positions as quickly as possible in all these new markets which represent the future of the group and to take advantage of their growth momentum to the greatest possible extent and as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>We have made a very good start. Our growth has remained strong in China and the other Asian countries. It is reaccelerating in Asia in a fairly spectacular way, in fact Brazil, Mexico, and the whole of Latin America. It is said to pickup again in Russia. Our sales are just starting up in many new countries such as Egypt, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan. Globalization is going to accelerate and boost our growth. I'd like to remind you the rest of the world represented 15% of the sales on the group in 1995. Today, 32% and our target is still that it should represent 50% in the near future.</p>
          <p>In strategic terms, finally, I would like to remind you of the five major strategic approaches we have adopted at the start of this year which will enable us to successfully weather the crisis. And I'm convinced to emerge from it clearly stronger, which will probably drive the group's growth momentum over the coming years. The first point is accessible innovation. This is a powerful and original idea which cannot be adequately summed up in the simple phrase "launching cheaper products", as I have sometimes read.</p>
          <p>Primarily, it consist of drawing attention to the essential and vital nature of innovation, the indispensable driver of a supply market such as cosmetics, and making sure that innovations can be directed at the largest possible number of consumers, so as to turn the innovations into commercial hits achieving substantial volumes across the world. Each division is committed to this approach, but this particularly applies to the Consumer Products Division with recently launched competitively priced innovations, which have proven highly successful once you know well such as Eye Roll-On and Herbashine by Garnier.</p>
          <p>Together with the launches, we are currently carrying out, which are promising Color Sensational lipstick by Maybelline, great initiative which will enable Maybelline to re-conquer a large market share in lipsticks and the Pulse Perfection Vibrating Power Mascara which is a first on the global mass market and at L'Or&#xE9;al Paris, the roller foundation, it's a simple but brilliant idea to get a perfectly unified foundation, the double extension reactivating mascara which stimulates the growth of the eyelashes. And Total Repair 5, a shampoo launched in Latin America and which is a great success, so many initiatives.</p>
          <p>The idea is also to extend our ranges and adding entry level products to our brand range thus enabling us to attract new consumers to the brand such as the Basic Care at Garnier or the Ultra Doux &#x2013; with the Essentials brand from Garnier and Ultra Doux which were extending to new countries in particular Eastern Europe. We are also launching the Triple Active Jour range at L'Or&#xE9;al which gives you a L'Or&#xE9;al care product between three and &#x20AC;6. We have also launched the Franck Provost range in large formats with a great price quality ratio and together with the Vichy Essentials range at Active Cosmetics and the new luxury entry level format for G&#xE9;nifique and there is a 30 ml Parisian fragrance from Saint Laurent which gives you the quality at a more affordable price.</p>
          <p>The second strategic approach, extension into new categories also involves extending and increasing our consumer base. We are implementing this in particularly in Consumer Products with large numbers of initiatives which seem to be proven successful in new categories such as styling, body care, deodorant, and men's products. We've just launched deodorants in Eastern Europe with great success in Eastern Europe and Latin America and we are launching the men's range in an original way. The first country launching will be &#x2013; is India, with a great success at the launch.</p>
          <p>And there is also Active Cosmetics with the launch of La Roche-Posay Homme and the globalization of Roger&amp;Gallet and even in hairdressing, in the fields of styling and texture.</p>
          <p>The third strategic approach which is also designed to broaden our consumer base, but this time from a geographic viewpoint is the acceleration of globalization. I have already talked to you about this in the past. The big picture is that we estimate that today we are only reaching about one person in five on the planet and we would like to double this figure as quickly as possible. We are determined to accelerate our globalization drive by opening new subsidiaries, by winning market share in emerging countries and with adequate investments in business drivers, human resources, and research and production capabilities.</p>
          <p>The fourth strategic approach is the strengthening of our business drivers. As you have seen in the first half year, we are steering this strategy with determination, but also with common sense. We have increased our advertising and promotional resources both in absolute and relative value, but we have also taken advantage of the exceptional conditions in the fields of media buying and point of sales promotional material to considerably increase our firepower without ruining our margins.</p>
          <p>Our shares of voice have clearly increased in all regions of the world as you see on the screen. But we have also optimized our spending by concentrating on the brands products and countries and media in which we obtain the best productivity for the money invested. You see for instance that our share of voice in progression in China is spectacular. We're close to being the number one investor in China. So this is enabling us to strengthen the support provided for our brands in developed countries and to make essential investments in our innovations, new markets, and new categories.</p>
          <p>We are relatively committed to a policy of cost reduction, which is beginning to payoff as our selling, general and administrative expenses are as you've seen for the first time in the history of L'Or&#xE9;al I understand falling in absolute value at constant exchange rates on a constant structure basis with a little over 3%. Bearing in mind that the impact of all the measures we have adopted is not yet visible.</p>
          <p>This marks a real turning point, which is the result of all the decisions we have taken, closure of industrial sites, major reorganizations, freeze on head count, and reductions in daily and travel expenses. We are all determined to continue in this direction and the economic results should be even more significant in the second half. All in all, as you see this five-point strategy which is effectively implemented, demonstrates L'Or&#xE9;al's remarkable ability to adapt to a new context and reflects the grade responsiveness and commitment shown by L'Or&#xE9;al teams across the world in a different context.</p>
          <p>To sum up, we are emerging from this first half with a satisfaction of saying that the L'Or&#xE9;al ship is weathering the storm well. The economic results confirm the resilience of our business model. The company knows how to transform itself and is taking the necessary steps to adapt to a new environment. The strategy we have adopted is working and is paying off, that we celebrated the centenary of L'Or&#xE9;al in June. And it was a moment of great joy and intense pride for all our employees and we are all tapping this new century in our existence with renewed energy and ambition. And we are moving into the second half with confidence in our ability to continue to weather the storm successfully and to emerge stronger than before. Thank you.</p>
          <p>And we're sure, of course, that you have a few questions. I wouldn't be surprised if Celine were the first as usual, no, not this time you don't have the microphone. You, sir, perhaps.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. First of all, congratulations for these excellent results, I come from Jefferies, by the way. I have one or two questions for you. Number one, could you give us an indication regarding the trend in terms of margin, just the trend for the margin in Professional Products as well as in Luxury Products in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the difference between the first quarter and the second quarter, we try to see whether the figures are stable or whether there is an improvement is already beginning &#x2013; of an improvement as you can see at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, says Mr. Agon, we are going to share the answers to your question between myself and Mr. Agon, quite frankly we are not going to tell you about the difference in the margin in North America, division by division, brand by brand. It's a bit too accurate, too precise, I can tell you about the major business trends, however. What you can see today is that, generally speaking, first of all as regards the Professional Products division for the time being we are not feeling any kind of reduction in the footprint in hair salons whether we are talking about Europe, North America or Japan.</p>
          <p>So for the time being this is business as usual one might say. It remains fairly stable, flat. It's still negative but it's not a cause for concern because quite frankly the hair salon business is the oldest trade in the world as I said the last time, or almost, and it is highly sensitive to the actual mood of consumers. As soon as there is swing in the people's moods, people change their behavior. It is not a question of available money, but when people get worried or concerned consumers will have a tendency to reduce their traffic and as soon as their mood improves then they come back to the hair salon. So I think that hair salon's traffic will be the first feeler if you like, it's a sign of a recovery because it will mean that that moods are improving and it will be better, then, for the other categories and the same would apply to the United States.</p>
          <p>And in Luxury Products as well, there is no major reduction over the last few months, as I've said the shrinkage in the Luxury Products market is highly relative. We're not talking about a total collapse of this segment. I think that the shrinking in Luxury Products in Cosmetics and Luxury divisions is less significant and is 5%. I mean in the major economic recession since 1930, this is hardly spectacular, what was spectacular, however, was the &#x2013; were the very strong and drastic reduction in the inventories of our distributor customers. They were faced with cash flow problems and this of course had a negative impact across the whole group and on us in particular. And we can see no major difference in Western Europe or North America. We think that inventory reduction is mainly behind us. Based on that, you can probably already know what it means for the margins, I can't tell you more than that for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question would be for Christian Mulliez, you had an accretive effect due to inventory reduction and to the level of inventories during the first half of 2009, so we had an accretive effect on the working capital and on the cash flow by way of consequence. Have you taken into account sort of standardization of the cash flow and working capital requirement in the second half, bearing in mind the expectations that you have for your net debt by year-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's never easy, of course, to give you specific details on working capital requirements in the upcoming six months. You know that the environment is rather volatile, but we may consider that throughout the whole year, working capital requirement will be slightly up maybe by 100 million compared to 300 million, so 300 plus 100 million by end of June, plus 100 million at the end of June was to be compared with the plus 600 million. And you know that a lot of work has been done by industrial teams, supply chain, commercial teams across all countries and we review this on a monthly basis in the &#x2013; by the executive committee, we look at the inventory levels and the customers and we can see the indicators are still going in the right direction.</p>
          <p>You shouldn't underestimate the fact that a lot of work and efforts have been made regarding the control of inventories and the customer base. It's not easy because your forecasts are going down, the customers are not willing to pay you and it's not necessarily very easy to keep everything under control given the situation and I think that the divisions have worked very well with good results and this is also the outcome of the implementation of our new supply chain organization. I had told you about this a year and a half year ago. We are implementing it progressively. It's a major change in L'Or&#xE9;al's organization, but we are beginning to feel the positive impact of this on the level of our inventories and I believe that this will continue to deliver good results for both inventories as well as cost of logistics, or cost of the supply chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Celine has a question now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take them one by one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes please do. First question is on the outlook for the whole year. You said yourself that you thought that the to sell-out figures, sorry, I'm talking about the end demand. I can redo it, if you didn't get my message. You said 0.1% and you said the figure would be the exact same figure for the second half, so there is no major change compared to what you had said. Now could you give us an outlook regarding your profits, your profit levels, since you engage in cost savings and you are going to engage in more cost savings in the second half from what you are telling us? So you are skipping straight from the sell-out to the profit figures. It's a rather bold move and the link is pretty bold. Well, no, but if you think that the market is, do you think that the market has stabilized at this level or do you think that if you have some visibility, could you tell us what your outlook would be on the profit levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to go back to the first part of your question. You saw indeed that the market is pretty much as we had described it. I said at the beginning of the year that the cosmetics market would probably be slightly positive. There have been lot of doubts, right, left and center, but in fact this has been confirmed despite the recession, despite the difficulties we are now seeing that the markets for cosmetic products is rather resilient. It's not as flamboyant &#x2013; or buoyant as it was during the year, the years of worldwide booming, but the figures are fairly encouraging. It shows that the market is resisting fairly well. Today, we cannot gaze in a crystal ball, but we have advanced indicators that allow us to think that there shouldn't be any major change in the trends, when it comes to the sell-out markets, when it comes to the end demand as you call it.</p>
          <p>Now as regards the profit levels, even though as I said it's a bold move to move from selling to the profits directly. We have no intention of giving you any guidance this year. All you can do, all we can say today and that's going to be, this is going to be confirmed by Christian, we are going to see something that is fairly new at L'Or&#xE9;al. We can tell you the expectations of the markets which we think we felt here and there seemed to be fairly reasonable. But anyway it's way too premature to make any kind of commitment because there are great uncertainties still hovering over our heads for the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question may be for Christian Mulliez. Could you give us a breakdown of the exceptional costs? You gave us some indications for the end of 2008. You have 36 million for the integration, consolidation of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; nearly to 20 million for the United States and what else have you taken out of this for the first half and the restructuring costs are they associated to new business for example in the United States why were there more restructuring costs for the United States?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course I'm going to give you these indications but you will find them in fact in the documents that will be given to you as you leave this room with the booklet of all the details. I can give you the accurate figures, the precise figures. I have them here.</p>
          <p>First quarter of 2009, we have the industrial organization in Europe is the closedown of the Albesa plant in Spain, you remember that it had not been announced or there was no provision for this at the end of 2008 and we are going to cease activities in the luxury plants in France for a total of roughly &#x20AC;55 million. Then the merger, or consolidation of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; into the Luxury Products Division to the tune of a bit more than &#x20AC;30 million, then the continuation of the restructuring of the U.S. subsidiary for a total of &#x20AC;30 million. So this is in addition to what had already been announced at the end of 2008 so we are speeding this up and then, last one, reorganization of the activity of The Body Shop for an amount of a bit more than &#x20AC;10 million.</p>
          <p>In the United States, you had already taken 20 million that's a provision, so what has been done in addition to what we have done in the first half? Not much, I mean we went a bit further, when it comes to merging teams, reorganizing teams, locally and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I've already given the figures to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did you have to reduce staff headcounts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Celine, we never cut off people's heads basically but headcounts, yes. What exactly are you talking about, what we try to merge some sites, bring them closer together and we have had to reduce head count. You know that we'll not communicate on our headcounts at the end of June. We only give you the yearly figures at year end, but the figures at the end of June are down when it comes to head count reductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question on SG&amp;A, you said they were down by 3%. Now in these costs, do you have the recurrent elements and others that are less recurrent, that are exceptional, for example, the travel expenses, could you tell us some more about this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're right. There are recurrent items and non-recurrent items, travel costs for example, that's an interesting point. They've come down by roughly 50% during the first half, which is fairly incredible to be quite honest with you. Business went as usual with 50% less travel expenses and you learn from that, don't you? You learn that for example, you usually travel too much, our staff travels too much. By working differently, by being better organized and by planning things better ahead of time, by organizing videoconferencing and so on, by working &#x2013; using different methods, we can also work more efficiently and &#x2013; for less money.</p>
          <p>Of course, we're not going to be able to do minus 50% every year otherwise it's going to be very difficult to continue doing our business, but there are non-recurrent items. But we also have items that will go up, for example, a great many measures have been taken in the course of the first half of the year and they've only started delivering some results in March, April, May, so it takes time. And to be quite honest with you, we were expecting a second half where there will be more changes.</p>
          <p>It's also a cultural difference, I mean, now in our culture there is a difference. We learn from our mistakes. We are going through a recession. The environment is tough and challenging. So we all have to get up in arms to pull up our socks and work in a more profitable manner and it's possible and it doesn't generate any sacrifices that we are unbearable. We are just working in a different way, that's all. And we have full confidence in our ability to continue working in this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you Celine, further questions? Over there, Xavier's closer. You will give the microphone to, Eva, later, but please do ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions, the first one is on the advertising and promotional investments, they've decreased compared to the overall sales and in an interview this morning, I mean you said, that in volume they've gone up and you have given us a figure of between 10 and 20%. Is this figure the figure for France, the French market, and if so, is it representative for the Entire Group for the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take this question first, says Mr. Agon. Well, first of all, let me tell you that, indeed this is a rather interesting question you are asking. You are talking here about the sales figure. We said that we would increase our business drivers and we've done that. And I think that there aren't many others who have done this. We've done it in absolute value and we have done this in relative value and quite frankly we did it the year of all years where we had the most incredible conditions when it comes to discounts in media buying, in media space buying in general, in point of sales, buying et cetera.</p>
          <p>So what I said in my interview to the newspaper, it is that, I mean this is obviously not an assessment which is of a scientific value. I'm not going to give you the exact figures. But as a gross estimate to say that probably, depending on the regions, depending on the countries, depending on the divisions maybe even, in total for the Group, the increase which seems to be fairly humble, fairly modest should in fact correspond to an increase in our fire power to the tune to 10 to 20% increase and it's very variable, as we said.</p>
          <p>There are some countries in which we can have a discount on the buying of media space to the tune of 20%, in others it's much less. For the press you get enormous discounts, in other countries you usually have less by way of discounts, so it's very difficult to be very precise. But we are at the time of recession and it means that there is a significant increase in our business drivers, so sales view, I don't know if you are looking at the French press, but we have -- are highly visible right now in the French press and this is a clear sign of our investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question on raw materials, I know that the main raw material is gray matter, the brain of your headcounts. But what about other raw materials in the P&amp;L for example, packaging and the raw materials that you have shown us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Has this helped you? What we've given you? I'm not sure. Well, there have been a few increases in price of raw materials. There have been a few increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You haven't even mentioned it in the comments regarding raw materials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but that's because it was &#x2013; had a lesser impact than the four factors that I have mentioned in the restructuring costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian always is measured and the reason why the gross margin didn't change very much is as follows. We are in a year where volumes have gone down quite a lot and we could have expected a more negative impact on our gross margin. And we have to be very clear and frank on this. One of the factors that helped us not to have a lower gross margin is that we've had gains on the purchasing of &#x2013; procurement of raw materials and this has had a positive impact. There have been productivity gains as well which were achieved including in a period where the volumes were down. So it's always easy to get your productivity when your volumes are going up, but it's a lot more difficult to divide more productivity from your business when the volumes are down. So the industrial performance is satisfactory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't want to be complacent, on the contrary, in my third question. Can you tell us, for example, by category of your sales and are you sensitive, are you &#x2013; have you been able to gain market shares across the different categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we should have &#x2013; we should display a slide of getting the sales, cosmetics sales by business segment. It's the croquet slide as we call it. You can see that for the first half, you can look at the different categories and the sales corresponding to these categories and you could see that we had fairly negative figure, on the whole minus one for skin care, minus three for hair care, and minus five for makeup products, zero coloring, minus 20 for fragrances, plus five for toiletries et cetera. This is a rather atypical situation when it comes to the inventory reductions in Luxury Products, and so on and so atypical that it is difficult to draw lessons from this.</p>
          <p>The two or three major lessons that we can draw from this is, number one: The difficulty of the fragrance business, it's the fragrance business where there were the most inventory reductions, that's where inventory reductions happened. The fragrance market is also the most cluttered market. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of launches every year, distributors, inventories are very high, they can't sell them, and unfortunately they had a cross-cutting discount policy across all of their inventories, so minus 20%. They've really reduced &#x2013; are trying to reduce their inventories. Regarding the categories above, there is not much to be said, on the contrary, I think that the makeup market is in a good situation when it comes to sell-throughs. And what we see at the bottom, it's still fairly modest, but it shows that we've started on a few initiatives in new categories.</p>

          <p>A question was asked but off mic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is for all the divisions, for all the brands, I think the answer to your question would be, yes, I mean that's what we find difficult this year. This year we really have to be careful when we compare things. You have to compare with the sell-ins and it depends on your weight on a certain market and how much you've reduced your inventories, and so it's very difficult to interpret anything on very short periods, when the cycles are too short. This can give you completely false interpretations and extrapolations. Eva?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You've told us about significance of globalization and we've seen that you've made a decision to launch shampoos in China, which we find interesting. Now, can you tell us why? What have changed? Can you tell us how you're going to go about this in practice? And a few words, maybe regarding innovation &#x2013; the great wave of innovations in Professional Products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I didn't touch upon these two subjects on purpose, I wanted to be discreet, I didn't want to unveil anything because of our competitors. I didn't want to say too much on this. Now regarding the first topic which is the launching of L'Or&#xE9;al shampoos, we're not really talking about shampoos; we're talking about the hair care line, the L'Or&#xE9;al Paris hair care product line in China. We are not talking about launching Fructis in America in 2003; it's not at all the same thing. It's not a hit on sort of offensive that we are going to carry out with media &#x2013; strong media back up and our intention is not to conquer 10% of the market and make an investments which is very risky.</p>
          <p>Now here what we are trying to do is expand the L'Or&#xE9;al Paris offering in China which in our point of view doesn't exist the hair products. L'Or&#xE9;al Paris is doing very well in China, as you know, China, if I remember correctly is now the second L'Or&#xE9;al Paris country worldwide which is in incredible achievement that it was launched 10 years ago and the L'Or&#xE9;al Paris brand is now ranking &#x2013; China is ranking second when it comes to this L'Or&#xE9;al Paris brand worldwide which is spectacular &#x2013; a spectacular achievement.</p>
          <p>Now you can see that our market share, this is the market share I think, the market share of L'Or&#xE9;al in China, you can see that it is a positive trend. Anyway it's going up.</p>
          <p>So we launched L'Or&#xE9;al Paris for skin care, we launched it for make-up products, we also established our footprint in coloring sector but it is a small market in China. So we then decided to offer to the Chinese consumers and there dozens of &#x2013; millions who like the L'Or&#xE9;al Paris products in China. We decided to also make the hair care products available, it's a brand which is a premium brand, that's its positioning, and it's a hair care product range, the brand itself is L'Or&#xE9;al, it's called, expert care for damaged hair. So the idea is to provide high level hair care for damaged hair, we seen our laboratories in China and seen that the Chinese hair was the most damaged hair worldwide and really needed specific hair care and this is something that is going to be not available on the market; none of our competitors are offering these products. So much for that.</p>
          <p>And number two, we also have a highly strategic launch called Inn&#xE9;ov coloring products, hair coloring products. It's called Inn&#xE9;ov and we considered that it could be, but of course there still remains to be concern that is the launch of a new current technologies are always very iffy, and you always have to check that against delivery and see whether it happens in time. It could be the most significant innovation since the invention of the harmless coloring substance for hair by Mr. Eugene Schueller in 1909. So it could be a great innovation but I'll be talking to you about this at the end of the year. But if it turns out to be what we think it might be, it could be very &#x2013; quite a turnaround in Professional Products, a major revolution. Fran&#xE7;oise.</p>

          <p>Good morning, I'll begin with a small question to Christian. On the rate of tax I believe that there were one off factors last year which had reduced taxes, this year we find ourselves with an even lower tax rate. So I wanted to know whether there was anything special or something more durable behind this tax rate or if there have been an accumulation of one-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It had gone to 26% last year, from 29 to 26%, I had indicated that half was due to a resolved mix effect or decrease in tax rates in major European countries and part was corresponding to what we call the d&#xE9;bouclage and it took us down to a tax rate of 26.5 due to &#x2013; after a series of tax audits. So this year the effect due to the Sanofi shares is reduced. For the whole of the year, given what we know and what we see and given the tax audits, which are underway, which should never be neglected, we believe that a rate of 27% would be more appropriate and that is what I've indicated. And for 2010, we will see a few months from now.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a second question on the Professional Products in the United States. Given the difficulty in the market, the inventory reductions etcetera, could you try and tell us about the situation regarding the recovery for distributors and competition on the markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very pleased with the acquisition of the distributors. The more time goes by, the more it appears as a very timely acquisition. The hair market in the U.S. is very scattered so to speak. There is a tremendous number of hair salons and there is the phenomenon of what they called the booth renters. These are coiffeurs who rent a booth. So in a salon you may have 12 different coiffeurs. And in Europe, we have direct sales force that go visit the salons and that is not suited to the American market. This is the reason why historically we had these distributors who developed and we worked with them. But in the hair sector, which is a b-to-b sector, it's important to have a contact all the way down to the hairdresser himself. And so this acquisition of the American distributor enabled us to create the missing link between ourselves and the American hairdressers. And it's very positive from a hair salon conquering point of view, it's very satisfactory from the point of view of educational service etcetera, and I'm convinced that it's the way for the future.</p>
          <p>The difficulty in the American market makes it a little difficult but this does not take anything from the validity of the model for the future. And this choice will enable us to consolidate our conquest of the leadership on the American market. So we are very pleased and the performance is rather not bad because on the American market, also given this specificity, hairdressers either see the representatives in their salons or the stores, and it's important to have stores. So having these distributors in the United States is very important, it's very useful if you want to be the absolute leader on the market. You know that the Professional Products Division has 50% of the market in France, over 50% in a lot of countries in the world and our ambition is also to have more than 50% of the market, on the US market.</p>
          <p>We already have 35% which is not far from the 50, and you have the strength on the American market we need to direct link with the hairdressers. So we are very pleased.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you been able to win over more hairdressers or more hair salons in the US compared to what you have seen in other countries on this move?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this is Mr. Agon. It's very difficult to compare, the markets are so different that it's difficult to compare it to anything else. What I can't say is that given the fact that we have this intermediary which is now part of the group when we conquer a hairdresser we know it's ours in the past when it was conquered by a distributor &#x2013; the distributor &#x2013; if the distributor changed, the hairdresser would go away with the distributor. So this gives us today solidity to the conquest which is essential in a market such as that one.</p>
          <p>It's not something which can be extrapolated. It was a given solution on a given market with its specific characteristics &#x2013; this would not make sense elsewhere but for the American market this was the good solution. I have a good question which is an extension of Celine's question on the cost of restructuring that you engaged in the &#x2013; at the beginning of the year since you take a number of measures on a run of the mill basis, can we expect more measures during the course of the year.</p>

          <p>Christian Schubert, Frankfurter Allgemeine. One question on Luxury, you have suffered a great deal from inventory reductions in distribution, and you see more and more luxury brands which open their own stores, perhaps not for the time being, but for the longer term, is that also your ambition to be more independent from retail, external retailers? And also regarding the restructuring of luxury plants, the production plants in France, can you tell us a bit more about that, what type of plants, what they produce et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine, I'll begin with the second question. I think we had explained fairly well our vision when we made the announcement regarding the closing down of Albesa and the reorganization of Saint Laurent. The idea is simple, the idea is to concentrate all the production of the Luxury Products which used to be scattered between four plants, five with the Saint Laurent plant. So to regroup it in three plants which are within a five, a fifty kilometer radius of each other in the North of France and they will each focus on a category. The Sic&#xF4;s plant in Caudry specializes in skin care and it will be in charge of some of the makeup products, but mostly skin care. The Saint Laurent plant will specialize in makeup. It will continue to have a bit of fragrances, but it will specialize in makeup and the Sapago plant in south Pontard located in Singcontard will be specializing in fragrances. So this enables us to create an industrial pole of an optimum nature which these three industrial entities and also to find cost synergies between these three entities. So this seems to us a very good solution and we have closed the Monaco plant which had no future. It was downtown and we could not continue in this way and the Albesa plant was too small and did not have a critical mass to be part of an industrial process. That was the second question.</p>
          <p>So for the first question, having your own stores has benefits and disadvantages, you don't do inventory reductions in your own stores but when the sales drop, the leverage effect on profitability is felt very quickly when you have your own store and sales drop since the cost don't drop, the profitability of the store becomes more much difficult. So today, since inventory reductions are behind us, we don't really plan to accelerate the opening of stores a great deal. We do it for certain brands for which the model corresponds to that, to having its own store. Kiehl's for instance, Kiehl's is the brand for the whole group which has progressed the most over the six months period plus 18%, although it's a luxury brand, but it's an accessible brand, accessible luxury brand. So it's a good illustration of our strategy and we're opening new stores on difficult markets such as Japan and they are off to a very good start and we're going to continue that, but we don't necessarily plan to open brands, stores for brands whose distribution channel is department stores such as Lanc&#xF4;me, for instance. Emmanuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question is on Yves Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9;. When do you think you will have harmonized that the cost structure of Saint Laurent Beaut&#xE9; in the division compared with the division before Saint Laurent, have you already carried out synergies at this stage at the end of the first half of 2009. There is a proverb that says grasp all, lose all. Now I may be mistaken but I do &#x2013; we do have a feeling that there are a lot of small brands in that division. So we've seen that you can reposition some of them such as Jose Gare another divisions, are there not other brands and I won't give names to not make them uncomfortable but are there are not brands which don't really have their place in that division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well this is Mr. Agon. You are right. We had sort of thought about this to be frank. Now grasp all, lose all. Yes, but at one point a critical mass is important. Also size does matter, so you have to find the appropriate equilibrium between the two. The acquisition of Saint Laurent enabled us to become the number one operator in Luxury Products around the world, and this strength is very important in the relationship to distributors, the industrial critical mass synergies with the sales force in the different countries, on the condition of course and this brings me to your first question that everything being regrouped together. So the integration plan for Saint Laurent was a very &#x2013; how shall I put, it a very strong plan.</p>
          <p>The regrouping, the synergies which are expected or twice what we had expected in our business plan and in all the countries today the Saint Laurent teams have been integrated into the Luxury Products teams, very often the sales teams share Saint Laurent with the other brands. The teams are fully integrated under the same management. All the management, auditing, all of that is pooled and so there is total integration without comprise, which produces great synergies. You have seen about the industrial integration, we've done it in reverse so to speak because we kept the Saint Laurent plant and eliminated some of the others but in the end it's an industrial restructuring exercise, the same thing will happen for the supply chain. So in the end, we will have an integration of Saint Laurent which will have given the maximum synergies.</p>
          <p>Now in the brand portfolio you must understand that luxury is not like the mass market, luxury is not big brands and the less you have the better you fare. In luxury you have to be in different niches and position yourself. You shouldn't have too many of course but today we have a clear vision of our portfolio, we have three major brands which are general purpose brands, general brands and our objective is to put them in the top five. These are Lanc&#xF4;me, the world number one, Yves Saint Laurent and Giorgio Armani. These are three general brands in make-up, fragrance care and they can become the three worldwide leaders, why not.</p>
          <p>And then we have another category of brands which are totally justified today and we will continue to be justified. Those are the affordable luxury brands or accessible luxury brands which are complementary to the others. These are Kiehl's of which I've just said that it's a brand which has been progressing the most this year, then Biotherm which is a brand which provides access to perfumery and Diesel which is a young accessible brand and Cacharel is more limited regarding its geographical ambitions.</p>
          <p>And then we have more international brands such as Ralph Lauren which is sort of in between. So that is our core portfolio. The other brands have the objective to occupy a niche but there can be variations in the geography, so &#x2013; of these brands. So we may have a very variable policy in terms of ambition, in terms of cost, in terms of deployment depending on our brand portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we will see &#x2013; there is no reason why we couldn't achieve that &#x2013; Yves Saint Laurent is just as Armani or Lanc&#xF4;me once it's produced in the same plants. And once the formula has come from the L'Or&#xE9;al laboratory sold by the same sales teams in the different countries there is no reason why the exploitation of the brand should be any different, you have everything so that eventually the profitability of the brand should be the same. The only difference is the critical mass and that is the reason why we plan to grow quickly on Saint Laurent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, a little longer than that, when you take over a brand which is practically making nothing to bring it up to the level of profitability of our luxury brands which are amongst the top ones in the profession. If that were to be done in two to three years, we would be really very strong, very great, but this gives us possibilities to improve the profitability of the brand and the division during the years to come.</p>

I'm not going to give you a presentation, because you're going to be disappointed, because you will be saying that I should have given you a number of figures and indicating the number of centers that are being closed down, but we are moving ahead. Well, it's like the industrial restructuring. We don't talk about it much, but we are working on it. We're doing the motions. We are optimizing the flows. We're optimizing these centers for the four divisions. We are constantly reorganizing and this year we are seeing results. I think we've done about a third of the way. I know that other companies are accustomed to communicating plans and make a lot of noise around it, but we are in a process of optimizing our supply chain, we took a major decision to carry out this major reorganization, since L'Or&#xE9;al who was created the supply chain, reported half to industry and half to administration and finance that's what we did for 50 years. I don't think it really helped in carrying out major optimization efforts and we decided with Christian to clarify things and ensure that activity is perfectly integrated in the industrial process and it's a major cultural revolution. It doesn't look like much, but we are carrying it out. It will be done and it will give significant results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That has nothing to do with that. The inventory reduction is when customers don't want to pass orders. It has nothing to do with the supply chain. Inventory, or no, it's not related to the supply chain and in certain cases for fragrance launches for instance, you have to say the truth in the area of fragrances there is launches that are successes, and others that aren't. When you launch a, when you have launched a fragrance and it's ordered by the customers and it's not sold, you have large inventories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last more general question. According to you what has this crisis changed in the consumer consumption pattern, in terms of brand perception, in other industries we've seen that it has things &#x2013; that it has changed things in luxury in the perception that consumers had of the brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is one thing that seems important to me that I would like to say and as I said in an interview you shouldn't try to extrapolate to the next ten years what happened in the past ten days or the past ten weeks. Of course we are going through a crisis, we are in the middle of it. People and companies adapt to the crisis. Now drawing the conclusion that as of now people's behavior will be the next &#x2013; the same for the next 10 to 20 years would be a big, big mistake and that is not what I believe.</p>
          <p>I think that people &#x2013; consumers are intelligent people. They adapt their behavior in times of crisis. It is true that today the future may seem uncertain. So the mood is a little less good, so they go to the hairdressers a little less, they buy a little less perfume. They are a little more careful about this and that which seems intelligent. I believe that as soon as we are out of the crisis there is no fundamental reason why after the crisis they should keep a crisis behavior. To my mind this reasoning is untrue and this was confirmed by &#x2013; it was confirmed that it was false following all of the other crises, '29, '74 et cetera. We see that people return to a behavior which is consistent with the economic mood of the moment. So I don't think that the prices will durably change the behavior of consumers vis-&#xE0;-vis beauty products. I may be mistaken, future will prove me right or wrong, but I don't believe in this. I believe that the behavior of men and women vis-&#xE0;-vis beauty products is something that we've seen over a number of years and the L'Or&#xE9;al Foundation is in the process of publishing a book, 100,000 years of beauty which shows the behavior of women and men vis-&#xE0;-vis beauty over 100,000 years. So maybe we can draw lessons from that. But I believe that there is no change and beauty is a market, it's a supply market, it depends on what you can invent, create, imagine for the consumers.</p>
          <p>It's a market of desire, of seduction, aspirations, expectations, and it's also linked to technology, your ability to put science into the product. And I think that consumers more than ever tomorrow will be interested in all this progress. I have a good example for you; even in times of crisis consumers are not necessarily attracted by cheap products. I believe that they are more attracted than ever by a good value for money ratio, but value for money doesn't mean less money. The greatest success in perfumery today &#x2013; in care and perfumery and for Lanc&#xF4;me is Genefique. Genefique costs &#x20AC;78 per jar. It is not at all a cheap product, but since it is a revolutionary care product in terms of technology and results, buying a revolutionary product for &#x20AC;78 is good value for money. So I think that when the crisis ends consumers will be more discerning &#x2013; more discerning or discriminating or careful about quality and price. And this is good for us because we have always chosen to be the number ones in quality and this is not a handicap for the future at all.</p>

          <p>Shamina Bhaidjy from Natixis. I would like to say a few words about the financial situation which has improved significantly recently, could you reconsider share buy back programs or is it a bit premature because you have no visibility on how markets will fare in the near future. And I have another related question if I may. Are there opportunities of acquisitions that have appeared because of the crisis? Are there possibilities for acquisitions on the market? And would the Group be in a more comfortable situation because of the improved financial results to look and review these potential acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very happy to see that you've indeed provided the answer to your question. It is indeed a bit premature to put into question our decision to put an end in November of last year to our share buyback plan, and quite frankly today it's a bit premature to reconsider our position. So we are not reconsidering our position today. It doesn't mean that it will be the same for next year, however, but I'm not betraying any secret if I say that before the end of the year it is not our intention to reconsider our position regarding the share buyback scheme.</p>
          <p>Now as regards our availability for acquisitions, of course, we are willing and we are available completely. We haven't said that we wanted to close our eyes that we didn't want to consider any kind of acquisitions that it would serve no purpose to come and see us. We always have potential acquisitions that we consider and look into. Without betraying a secret, I should say that for the last six or eight months nothing terribly exciting has happened in the market, but we are &#x2013; keep our eyes peeled and we are absolutely ready to consider any acquisition. In fact you have seen that our financial situation is very good. Our gearing, the level is very low. We have our portfolio of Sanofi shares for a reasonable amount. So we are indeed in a position and we are ready and willing to make a strategic acquisition if one should emerge on the market.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> from the La Tribune Newspaper. You were talking about the swift acceleration of the Garnier brand. You said that it would be very strong engine for growth. Why and how?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very straightforward question. Yes, indeed I want to be accurate in my answer, but the Garnier brand at the end of June had registered a growth of plus 4%. Without betraying a secret, I can tell you that it's also gathering momentum and the growth rate for year-end should probably be much higher than 4%. Why? For two reasons, there is a brand-related reason and a product-related &#x2013; product and brand-related reasons first of all. I believe personally that the Garnier brand is one of the brands &#x2013; again I wouldn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, it's one of the brands that has the most potential for the 10 years to come because quite frankly it fits perfectly with all the expectations of the consumers the world over. It is a green brand, an organic brand. It is the only green brand, by the way, in cosmetic products, in most market &#x2013; most market cosmetic products the world over. Nivea is blue. There are other brands that are red, Garnier is a green brand. And as you've seen during the last European elections, green is a good color. From a cultural standpoint, it makes a positive impact. I think that we have a green brand that really enshrines green values. I think it really holds a lot of potential, a green brand which is using more and more natural ingredients. It is the worldwide champion of accessible innovation.</p>
          <p>Garnier is really the champion of that. Garnier invents new products and improve the daily lives of consumers everyday when it comes to hair care, hair coloring, body care, deodorant. We have very high performance at extremely accessible and affordable prices. So quite frankly, your Garnier is a green brand, it's an organic natural brand with great performance. You have everything to please and everything to succeed on the market. That's the first thing.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have a very strong plan when it comes to our innovation programs since the beginning of the year. We've launched a new current product Herbal Brilliance. We have launched the bamboo based styling product. We are launching the new Fructis shampoos. We are launching &#x2013; making very strong innovations. So when it comes to skin care, we are launching deodorants, very good performance there.  We have formulas developed by our laboratories which are top notch, developed by our laboratories and are considered by our consumers as of better quality than that of our competitors. So we have that extremely advanced innovation plan.</p>
          <p>And the last reason that I was forgetting is that we have in Garnier an incredible weapon for strategic development. Let me give you an example. I went to India in January and I asked them to show me what we call the brand, the cosmetic brand image study. And in India that all of the cosmetic brands whether we're talking of the mass market, the Luxury segment, all of the channels, the most beautiful image was Garnier, the brand image. And of course it is the only country in the world because generally speaking you find Lanc&#xF4;me, Est&#xE9;e Lauder and others, but in India it was the top most brand. And it's amazing to see how an emerging country &#x2013; it's true in India but I'm sure it's also true &#x2013; could be true of China where we're selling very well or in Brazil where we're developing the brand or in Mexico or in the Middle East in the future or in African countries in the future. The Garnier brand really holds a lot of potential. It really meets with the expectations of consumers in emerging countries. It's a perfect fit with expectations. So I have enormous amount of confidence in the potential future development of this brand. So much for your question. Any further questions, over there to the left?</p>

          <p>Let me say quite frankly that I had not seen the date for 2030. Well, we are very cautious, we are known for being very cautious in this Group. The person who designed the chart probably wanted to make sure that we would be saying the truth. We didn't want somebody in 2020 to say look you had said in 2009 that you would reach this figure by 2020 and you haven't. Personally, I think that it will go much faster than 2030.</p>
          <p>I believe that we are indeed gaining momentum and speeding up very quickly. You quoted one of my competitors &#x2013; our competitors. I think we should say a few words about them. P&amp;G, they are already there whereas we are getting there and we are going to go there. And when it comes to growth prospects, of course, their strategy is very different. For us, I believe the great opportunities for the 10 years to come and then we will see where we stand in 10 years. I don't know if we will have reached 2.5 or 1.9 or 2 billion but the great &#x2013; the potential for us in the 10 years to come is precisely to try to go out and get the 2.5 billion consumers. It's my main priority.</p>
          <p>I consider that in the different phases of transformation of this Group, the job &#x2013; the big job that we have for the next 10 years is to reach out to the extra consumers. This will completely change the face of the Group, change the volume of our business, it will give us considerable critical mass, and I think that we are in a position to do this because of our laboratories which we now have in Latin America and China and in all of the significant countries, thanks to the industrial facilities that are ready and thanks to our teams. We have everything we need to get this extra billion of additional consumers. And as soon as we reach this figure, I will announce it and it will be before 2030. I would like to explain myself 2030 seems to be a bit remote for me personally.</p>

          <p>Now, could you also make an analytical comment on the sales prices and the evolution of the sales prices?</p>

          <p>Yes, sales prices what we call the value effect in fact which also incorporates the mix part. That for us it's an important element or factor. The value effect was positive in the first half, a bit more than 2% flat from one half to the next which is an interesting figure. The volumes were negative and the volumes have changed from quarter-to-quarter especially in the Luxury Division.</p>
          <p>And second comment on the value, this effect was positive in each of the divisions; bit more also for Active Cosmetics and a bit less so for Consumer Products, but it was indeed a positive figure across all four divisions. I don't have the table here but it was positive indeed in also all of the geographical areas, but maybe that's not exactly the answer to your question. But what is implied here is that there is no deflation when it comes to our sales prices &#x2013; selling prices.</p>
          <p>The cosmetic industry in general has not experienced any kind of deflation where we can see any different companies and in the different categories of channels, distribution channels. I mean, this is certainly not a drop in prices or deflation or net prices or invoiced prices or consumer prices have not gone down. There is an intensification of the promotional policy but there is no reduction of the sales price to speak of, that could be a source of concern for the future of our margin as far as we are concerned. Even in this tough challenging period, the value effect is still acceptable, reasonable. We had a favorable value effect over the last few years. I know that other companies have experienced different things, and I think that in some categories they have reached the levels which might have been unsustainable, but as far as we are concerned, we were not in that situation. We had a value effect which was regular and permanent but reasonable and acceptable, and this allows us today to consider that we can continue in the same direction.</p>
