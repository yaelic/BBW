          <p>Thanks, Good morning everyone. This is Matt Ginter, head of Investor Relations for 3M. I'd like to extend a sincere welcome to all investors and analysts to our second quarter 2008 business review. You will find this morning's presentation on our Investor Relations website at 3m.com, and these slides will remain on the site along with an audio replay of today's call for an extended period of time.</p>
          <p>Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements on slide number two. During today's conference call, we will make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views and estimates about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Also allow me to put in a brief plug for our upcoming investor meeting in St. Paul on September 9. You should have received an email last week with a link to our registration site. If you've received the invite please take a moment to reply as to whether or not you are plan to attend and if for some reason you did not receive an invitation either drop us a note or give us a phone call and we will get one out to you ASAP. Registration will close on August 29.</p>
          <p>As per usual today is a busy day and that many companies are reporting earnings. We will do our best to keep the call to one hour. Again you could help during the Q&amp;A, by limiting yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that all questions can be fully answered. George Buckley our CEO and Pat Campbell our CFO, will both make some formal comments today and then we will get to your questions.</p>
          <p>So, now please go to slide number three and I'd like to turn the program over to George.</p>

          <p>Thanks Matt and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. Today I'll make some brief opening comments and Pat will then take you through the detail of the quarter and then I'll return to address some of the key issues including the state of our optical film business and our outlook going forward. After that we are happy to address your questions and comments.</p>
          <p>So, to get started, our second quarter is perhaps best characterized as a repeat of the first quarter, a good quarter especially when you look at the core of the company. Where there was any negative color, it was mostly provided by the secular change taking place in optical films. But on balance it was a quarter which we fought our way to good overall results.</p>
          <p>Over the past two and half years we spent most of our time investing in and strengthening the core businesses of 3M driving international growth and fixing our supply chains. 3M has owned and operated these core businesses for many years. In fact, one of them abrasives, we've owned for over a 100 years. It' primarily this recent strategy of reinvestment in our core and in international that has made the current results possible. Despite all the headwinds at Optical, commodities and the U.S. economy threw at us. The fact is that we still met our numbers and delivered the beacon. I'm also pleased to report that at the operational level 3M is performing superbly, with our largest three businesses posting double-digit increases of sales in the last quarter.</p>
          <p>So after that brief introduction let me turn it over to Pat for an in-depth discussion of our strong second quarter. Patrick.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks George and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide number four. Indeed this was a very good quarter for 3M and the positives far outweighed our challenges. We posted record sales for the sixth consecutive quarter and five of our six businesses achieved strong growth in sales and profits, including double-digit profit growth in three of our largest businesses. We were pleased that margins were 20% or better across the board.</p>
          <p>We converted nearly a 100% of net income to free cash flow in the quarter which enabled us to return nearly $1 billion to our shareholders via combination of dividends and share repurchases. On the other side, the challenges we faced will not surprise you. The U.S. economy remained difficult, particularly in those areas that touched the consumer. George will update you on Optical Systems later. And finally commodity input prices continue to rise, which pressured our raw material somewhat but we have a good pricing story here which I will address here in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number five. All information that I will present today will exclude special items. So, allow me to summarize the special items quickly to get them out of the way. Last year's second quarter results included a net gain of $0.02 per share from special items. The second quarter of 2008 reported earnings per share of $1.33 included a net charge of $0.06 per share related to a loss on the divestiture of HighJump Software along with charges for exit activities at an industrial and transportation manufacturing facility in the U.K. Excluding these special items Q2 2008 earnings per share were $1.39 as compared to a $1.23 per share in last year's second quarter. Please refer to the attachment in today's press release for more in depth discussion on special items.</p>
          <p>Second quarter sales grew almost 10% to $6.7 billion, which represents the sixth consecutive quarter of record sales. In our three largest global businesses, namely Industrial and Transportation, Healthcare, and Safety, Security and Protection Services; revenues expanded at a double-digit clip. On a local currency basis sales were up 4.6% versus last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the business geographically sales growth was once again strongest in our international operations. Sales grew at a double-digit pace in Latin America, Europe and in Canada and at 1% in Asia Pacific. Importantly if you adjust Asia Pacific results for Optical Systems sales growth was nearly 17% during the quarter. Operating income was up 8.5% to $1.5 billion as four of our six business segments delivered double-digit operating income percent increases. Operating margins topped 22% for the quarter with all six of our business segments achieving 20% plus operating margins.</p>
          <p>For several years in succession, we have continued to maintain best of breed margins regardless of the business environment. The strength of our broad business portfolio overcame a tough U.S. economic environment, all time high raw material prices for many key materials and a secular transition in our optical film business. I applaud the efforts of 3Mers everywhere for pulling off what many deemed impossible, that is maintaining superior operating margins while simultaneously investing in growth programs for the future. Earnings per share in the second quarter was $1.39, up 13% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide six for an in-depth review of the second quarter performance versus the same quarter last year. We've again isolated the impact of optical films in order to help you better understand our results. The strength of our global portfolio was again evident in the second quarter, as sales increased almost 10% or 14% ex-Optical. This 14% growth was a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and of course positive currency impacts. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of record sales. Gross margins were down slightly from last year's comparable quarter.</p>
          <p>It was no surprise to us that raw materials rose year-on-year in the range of 3 to 4%. Excluding the Optical business we were able to offset this inflation with selling price increases along with relentless process improvements in cost reductions of our own. So once again we are effectively managing through a challenging commodity price environment. Operating profit grew by 8.5% or 18% ex-Optical and our premium margins continued at 22.1%. And finally our tax rate improved by almost 2 points to just under 31%, consistent with our tax reduction strategy. Earnings per share rose 13% to a $1.39 per share. Excluding optical films, earnings per share would have improved by nearly 24% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Let's now shift our focus to bring it down to our second quarter sales growth performance. Please turn to slide number seven.</p>
          <p>Worldwide sales growth in U.S. dollars increased 9.7% led by our international operations with sales growth of 11.9%. U.S sales growth was up 6% in the quarter. Second quarter local currency growth was 4.6% with organic growth up 40 basis points, price up 10 basis points and acquisitions primarily Aearo Technologies adding 4.1%. Excluding the impact of the Optical business, local currency sales increased 8.1% as organic volumes increased 2.5%, selling prices increased 1.1% and acquired volume was up 4.5%. International sales on a local currency basis increased 3.4% in the second quarter. Organic volumes increased 1.8% with five of six businesses posting positive organic volume growth. Selling prices declined 1.1% including a 12% price decline in optical films. Acquisitions added 2.7% to international local currency growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Ex-Optical international local currency sales growth was 9.1%, including 5.5% from organic growth, 3.1% from acquisitions and 0.5% from selling prices. On a regional basis, international local currency sales growth was led Latin America at 21%, followed by Canada at 7% and Europe with local currency sales growth of 6%. Local currency sales declined 4% in Asia Pacific due to a 37% local currency decline in Optical. Excluding Optical, Asia Pacific sales in the local currency has increased 10% over the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Economic conditions in the U.S. continued to remain challenging, especially in the retail, housing and automotive OEM markets. Second quarter local currency sales increased 6.6%, driven by a 6.5% impact from acquisitions. Selling prices increased 2% in the quarter, with all businesses delivering price increases as we try to offset the continuing high price of commodities while organic volumes were down 1.9%. Four of our six business segments delivered sales growth in the U.S. during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide eight, where we'll briefly comment on our year-to-date progress. At the end of the second quarter, year-to-date sales were up 9.3% with operating income up 6% and earnings per share were up 10.8%. Excluding Optical, year-to-date sales were up 12.4%, while profits increased to 15.2%. And finally, free cash flow was up 4.7% year-to-date versus the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide nine for a review of the balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the second quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was 909 million versus 866 million last year. Free cash flow conversion for the quarter was nearly 100%. Working capital turns were 4.9 turns, down slightly year-on-year and in line sequentially. Foreign currency translation increased accounts receivable and inventories by 243 million and 167 million, year-on-year, while reducing them sequentially by 36 and 13, respectively. Second quarter capital expenditures were 334 million down 14 million versus the same quarter last year and up sequentially by 36 million. Through six months we have spent 632 million on our capital expenditures and expect full year CapEx to be in the range of 1.3 to 1.4 billion. Dividends for our shareholders were 351 million during the quarter consistent with past quarters. Share repurchases totaled 572 million in the second quarter which is up slightly from initial quarters. Weighted average shares outstanding were 712 million down nearly 3% year-on-year and 1% sequentially, and lastly our debt-to-cap ratio was 32% at the end of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now let's delve into our performance for each of our segments for the second quarter. Please turn to slide 10 for a summary of our results for our largest segment, Industrial and Transportation, a business where innovative solutions helped manufacturers improve their businesses. With broad-based revenue growth across the portfolio, Industrial and Transportation delivered an outstanding quarter with sales of $2.1 billion, up 15.5% and operating income up 18%. Sales growth in the business was led by our industrial adhesives and tape business followed by our automotive aftermarket, abrasives and closure systems for personal hygiene products. Local currency sales increased 8.7%, including 4.2% from acquisitions. Year-to-date sales were up 16.3% with operating income also up 16.3% as operating margins held steady at 21.5%.</p>
          <p>All geographic regions saw growth in the quarter, including the United States. Strong market penetration continued in emerging economies, especially the BRICP countries where the business drove strong double-digit organic local currency growth. Elsewhere around the globe, we saw a double-digit growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Some of the products driving growth in the second quarter were abrasives used in auto body shops, laminating adhesives providing attachment solutions in industrial applications, diaper closure systems, and packaging, masking and specialty tapes.</p>
          <p>Continued investment in new technology has brought some very innovative new products such as new glass bubble filler that can reduce the weight of automobiles and clean sanding disc that can significantly reduce dust throughout various finishing processes in industrial market and automotive refinishing applications. Industrial and Transportation business continues to bring 3M technologies and solutions to high-growth market spaces such as oil and gas, renewable energy and the aerospace market.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to slide 11 for a look at the second quarter highlights for our Healthcare business, where we provide the healthcare community with innovative solutions based on 3M technology platforms to improve patient lives and the productivity of healthcare providers. Healthcare continued its exceptional performance for 2008 with broad-based sales growth of 13.1%. Profits rose nearly 12% to $310 million. Local currency growth was 7.7%, nearly all organic. Year-to-date, sales have increased 12.5% with profits up 15.5% and margins increasing 80 basis points from 2007 levels to 28.8%.</p>
          <p>Three divisions drove strong double-digit growth in the quarter, namely orthodontics, dental, and medical, with orthodontics and dental or our oral care business showing outstanding strength in leading the way. The U.S. market had mid single-digit growth while international sales growth was outstanding as all regions drove both double-digit growth for sales and profits. Some of the products that drove sales included advanced room care and surgical tapes, dental restorative materials and equipment for crown and bridge procedures and self-ligating brackets for orthodontics.</p>
          <p>In our medical business, we closed the Solumed acquisition further solidifying our position as a provider of leading edge medical products designed to prevent infections. Also, we were awarded top honors by the International Association of Food Protection for our contributions to food safety technology. 3M's Dental business where we saw double-digit sales growth and profits closed in July, a deal for IMTEC, a manufacturer of dental implants and scanning equipment, primarily known for the mini dental implants, which importantly patients can be treated by the regular dentists versus seeing a specialist.</p>
          <p>We also marketed the first sale of our Chairside Oral Scanner, a digital impression system that enables the motion capture of accurate and precise dental impressions. In orthodontics, we continue to deliver strong double-digit results, and we announced a deal to acquire the German sister company of U.S.-based Lingualcare, expanding our offering for digital orthodontic products into Europe and Asia and helping to meet the surging demand for this invisible orthodontic solution.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 12 for a recap of our second quarter performance by Safety, Security, and Protection services, where our products increase the safety, security and productivity of workers facilities and systems around the world. Led by acquisitions primarily Aearo, along with organic growth in personal protection, window films, cleaning solutions for commercial buildings and corrosion protection, Safety, Security and Protection services delivered sales of $1 billion for the first time ever, up 30.2% from last year.</p>
          <p>Growth in local currency was 25.6%, including 19.8% from acquisitions. Acquired growth was primarily from Aearo Technologies, an Indianapolis based, but global manufacturer of personal protection and energy absorbing products that adds hearing protection and fall protection lines to 3M's existing full-line respiratory products.</p>
          <p>Operating income for the quarter rose 30% while margins remained steady at 21.2% as compared with last year. Year-to-date, sales have increased 22% with profits up 21% and margins holding steady at or above 22%. Included in this operating income results are approximately 20 million of one-time Aearo acquisition-related cost, negatively impacting Q2 and year-to-date margins by about 2% for the quarter and 1% year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Driven by the Aearo acquisition, sales were strong across the globe, led by double-digit increases in Europe, United States, and Latin America. In personal protection, we continue to see strong demand for our maintenance-free &#x2013; and in Latin America &#x2013; respirators, as well as reflective materials. And with the Aearo acquisition, we now offer a more complete personal protection solution that spans the industrial, military and construction markets. Our Speedglas auto-darkening filters and helmet product development team has been awarded Business Week's Gold IDEA Award for design excellence.</p>
          <p>In Building and Commercial Services, we saw a strong demand for our floor maintenance products due to an increase in commercial construction in many parts of the world. Also, we have continued to see steady growth in our Corrosion Protection Products, where we provide pipe-coating solutions that extend the life of both the underground and aboveground pipelines. In our Track and Trace business, we refined our strategic direction for the tracking of high-value assets, asset utilization, and safety and security applications. In connection with these strategic refinements, we sold off the HighJump Software business.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to slide 13 for details about our Consumer and Office business, home to some of our best known brands and enduring franchises. Our Consumer and Office business improved from Q1, as sales increased 7.8% to 899 million in the second quarter. Local currency sales were up 3.5%, including 0.7% from acquisitions. Profits were up 9.1%, with operating income margins of 20%. Year-to-date sales were up 5.2% and operating profits are up 1%, which we feel is an outstanding result in the current business climate.</p>
          <p>We saw a positive growth in all divisions with do-it-yourself and home care leading the way. Overall sales growth was tempered by weakness in the office mass retail channel in the United States. Geographically, 3M's international subsidiaries continued to drive growth again this quarter with double-digit sales growth in all regions, led by Europe and Asia Pacific. Through expanded distribution, grand prizes and merchandising programs, our Consumer and Office business drove outstanding growth of our Filtrete air filtration products for residential HVAC systems.</p>
          <p>Working with key accounts such as Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot and Lowe's, the Filtrete team delivered sales growth of 75% in the second quarter versus last year. In our home care division, we recently launched the Scotch-Brite Ultra Nailsaver, as well as Fur Fighter pet hair remover that has taken off with customers and which has recently been endorsed by Martha Stewart as well as gaining the Good Housekeeping Magazine's Seal of Approval.</p>
          <p>In addition, Consumer Reports just listed our Ultrathon Insect Repellent as an everyday best buy for 2008. We also launched our Nexcare Cold Sore Treatment product, leveraging our experience in manufacturing products focused on skin wellness to provide consumers with lasting permanent relief from cold sores. Other products driving growth in the second quarter were Scotch-Brite scouring products along with the Scotch-Blue masking tapes and Command mounting and fastening products.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 14, where I'll provide an overview of results for the Electro &amp; Communications business where we are also a leading supplier to the electrical, electronics, and telecommunications industries. Sales for the quarter increased nearly 8% versus the same quarter last year. Profits rose 11.4%, driven by outstanding cost discipline producing margins of 20.1%. Sales in local currency increased 2.2%, mostly from organic growth. Year-to-date, sales have increased 8.5% with profits up 12.5% and margins growing by 70 basis points to 20.1%.</p>
          <p>Overall, Electro &amp; Communications saw a double-digit growth in three of its businesses, electrical markets, electronic materials markets, and communications markets. International sales growth was the strongest led by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. Some of the products driving growth in the second quarter were outside plant and central office equipment used in the telecommunications industry, insulating and protecting products used in the electrical applications and electrical and power grid solutions used in the energy and electrical power industry. We continue to see our volumes for inkjet printer circuits decline which adversely affected sales by 1% and operating income by nearly 3%.</p>
          <p>Today, our Aluminum Conductor Composite Reinforced or ACCR product, which allows energy suppliers to transmit more than two times of capacity without the risk and delays of major construction projects has had 25 installations with the most recent installs being announced in Shanghai, British Columbia, Brazil and Silicon Valley.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 15, for a review of our second quarter results for Display &amp; Graphics segment where we make the films that brightens the displays on electronic products such as flat panel computer monitors, cell phones, PDAs and LCD televisions along with reflective sheeting for transportation, safety, Commercial Graphics systems and projectors and projection systems. During the second quarter, we saw a positive double-digit growth in Commercial Graphics and single-digit growth in our Traffic Safety Systems, where we're recognized by the American Road &amp; Transportation Builders Association with the first plate award for environmental protection and mitigation. And if you watch closely during the upcoming Beijing Olympics, you will see our commercial graphics specialty films that work all around the sports venues.</p>
          <p>Overall, second quarter sales for Display &amp; Graphics were down nearly 16% with profits down 36%, driven by the sales and profit declines of 36 and 54% respectively in our optical film business. Operating margins held constant at 21.7%. Excluding the optical film business and divestitures, Display &amp; Graphics sales increased 5.3% and profits were flat. Display &amp; Graphics saw the effects of the slowdown in the U.S. driven markets for Traffic Safety Solutions and Commercial Graphics. Highway construction and commercial graphics for the trucking industry have both slowed as a result of sequential U.S. macroeconomic softness during the course of the second quarter. Despite the headwinds in the U.S., geographically, we saw a good performance in these businesses, led by Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific.</p>
          <p>3M's mobile projection technology, an ultra-compact, LED-based projection engine for personal devices is now in production. We're continuing to see interest in this new technology across a range of personal electronics options, including cell phones, laptops, and PDAs. This concludes my formal comments, so I know I will turn the program back over to George to give you color on the optical film business, as well as our thoughts for the rest of the year. George?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Pat. I'd like first to give you another update on the transition of our optical films business. There are still many investors who don't know the background to challenges of this business. So let me give you a quick pr&#xE9;cis. First, of the four optical film segments that we serve three of them, plus the Polarizer films, are relatively stable and strong for us. The issue is of course in the supply of films to LCD TVs.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally the rapid rise of Visio as a club brand was the catalyst for this secular change. Beginning about two years ago they rose from eighth place to first place in the U.S. market in less than nine months. They were able to do what they did by reducing brightness in off angle viewing standards, vigorously driving out all the costs to keep price points and getting a great distribution channel. As new and lower price points were hit the consequent explosion of the volume in the market at the bottom of the pyramid surprised us all. As the market commoditized it rattled the large branded set manufacturers.</p>
          <p>They responded by following Visio's decontenting example and worked to compete better. The net result was that by lowering specifications, TV manufacturers were able to design out a lot of the high performance films and 3M did not have the product at the bottom of the market for sale. We had needed that low cost film product three or even four years ago. So, for 3M, the impact was that we suffered loss of volume from decontenting as well as huge pricing pressure leading ultimately to the results in financial transition that we're experiencing today.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that on our April call, we said that we expected the balance of 2008 to follow the same pattern for Optical that we saw in the first quarter and also that it would be the toughest year of transition for that business. So the pattern that played out in the second quarter was pretty much as we expected. Optical margins for the quarter actually came in a little better than our expectations, though sales were a little bit low where we thought. To give you an idea of the scale of the change year-on-year sales of optical films for LCD TV applications have declined by over two-thirds, while profits have dropped by 80%. So after dealing with a tough transition here I think we can see the bottom even if we haven't quite reached it yet. I don't expect this sub segment to completely disappear since there is always a small percentage of consumers who want high performance from TVs and some films will be retained for that purpose.</p>
          <p>So what are we doing to manage through this transition period? First, the new management team has been in place in Asia for a few months now and I am impressed by their quick understanding of current realities; the realities of both market dynamics and the valued proposition that we bring to our customers. Their quick uptake is helped by the knowledge of consumer electronics that was in their background. To strengthen our competitive position, we are taking additional actions to get our cost structure in lined with these new market realities. Today we announced the elimination of 300 jobs in Optical Systems all across the business, mostly in the U.S. but some overseas too these were SG&amp;A, manufacturing, R&amp;D and other areas. This represents a 20% staff reduction in that business. We are also improving manufacturing efficiency by consolidating several film converting sites in the Asia region. Collectively these two actions will save around $30 million annually.</p>
          <p>Additionally our former film converting plant in Poland has been taken out of the optical films division as we have transformed into a multi-use, multi-division facility for other 3M businesses. We also have intense manufacturing cost reduction activities underway everywhere and they're beginning to make an impact. As we said margins in Optical Systems improved by a point sequentially as soon as the cost reductions began to take hold. At the same time we are actively addressing the market situation by simplifying our product portfolio and making it more relevant to our customers.</p>
          <p>Our optical products will continue to add value to our customers through technology even in TVs, especially so as energy reduction is now becoming more important to set, monitor and notebook manufactures and to consumers as well. Our technologies also contribute to the trend toward thinner TVs. I have said this before, the 3M optical films allow a reduction of 50% to 70% in energy over typical configurations and consumers can have that reduction today. You can imagine that we are working this issue very hard and it provides one of the upside opportunities in LCD TVs as does continued unit growth.</p>
          <p>So to summarize on Optical, the bottom appears to be in sight, if not quite here yet. And we have a new team in place close to our customers and we're aggressively taking cost out. And we are working hard to maintain margins and protect the bottom line. We're expecting this transition to be complete in 2008, with the possibility of some bleed over into early '09. But if so, its impact here should be small. Of course, we are also working hard to maintain margin and protect the bottom line all across the company as we continue to drive our growth agenda and also even as we fight our way through these not too favorable U.S. economic conditions.</p>
          <p>As Pat described, it's tough out there, particularly in retail, housing and automotive OEM markets, no surprises there for anybody. And we will continue to see blitz in some of our short cycle businesses where the impact of volume is realized quickly and fortunately where that impact stabilizes quickly also. I'll state as well that are approach to growth investments is a very practical one. It's not ideological. Like all public companies, we must always keep one eye on the long-term and one eye on the short-term. We're most certainly determined to drive growth over the long-term, but we will do so prudently and with the intention to maintaining optimal flexibility in the timing of those investments. And as always you will see constant attention to operational discipline as it accompanies and enhances our drive toward growth.</p>
          <p>So let me quickly update you on our guidance for 2008. Please turn to slide16. For reasons that Pat and I have outlined today, we remain committed to deliver a 10% plus earnings per share growth for 2008. With year-to-date operating income margins of 22.7% we continue to expect full year operating margins to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Our tax expectations for the year are also in the band 31.5% to 32%. And finally our 2008 full year capital expenditures range between 1.3 billion and 1.4 billion and this remains unchanged from previous guidance.</p>
          <p>So that concludes our formal comments here and so now we're happy to take any questions that you might have. Thank you very much everybody.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if you gave this data point but it will be helpful on the optical film businesses. What was the impact on price and volume in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well price was down 12% and I think total volume &#x2013; was 36, so I think volume was 24.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and that down 12% is still within the band of what has been the recent trend, so it wasn't like that worsened is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just if we could recalibrate where does LCD TVs now fit in terms of the optical film sales? It used to be in that 30% range. Where does it stand today? Where do you think on a run rate basis that will contribute?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As George mentioned, Deane, it is kind of a declining piece of the business. It's probably more in the &#x2013; probably 20 &#x2013; about 25% of the business, on a current basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just a quick last question if I could. How much should pension contribute in the quarter? Is that what we're seeing in the unallocated portion there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Deane, that number will stay the same throughout the year and it's about $100 million for the year, so it's 25 to 30 for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Morgan Stanley. Sir, please continue with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was positively surprised on the margins, given some of the raw material prices that we've seen, just most notably out of Dow Chemical. I guess my question really is, it looks like you're mostly FIFO accounting. Is the impact of the big May/June price increases not quite flowing through to your margins yet? Or are there big price increases out there that are going to offset this? And just a little bit color on that, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Scott, you are correct. We're primarily a FIFO-based company but don't be worried about a huge increase coming through the system here. What we saw in the second quarter was a 3 to 4%. We don't see a significant change on &#x2013; for the Q3. So don't anticipate a drop off here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean there's price increases in the hopper or does it mean that the materials are a little bit less of the cost of goods sold than what I had in my models?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yeah. Raw materials will probably go up sequentially a little bit but we also have further price increases going in effect in the third quarter as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. Last question really relates to inventories at the customer level and consumer office came in stronger than we expected and doesn't totally match up, I guess with results that we've seen from other companies like Avery Dennison, for example. Do you have a sense for inventories at your customer levels? Are there customers buying ahead of some of these price increases or anything that could be deemed as unusual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, if I was to kind of characterize the consumer business, just kind of overall, we started to see a kind of a slowing tail end of last year and definitely in the first quarter. We think second quarter reflects a little more of a, I'll call it a business as usual approach. We're keeping a close eye on inventories at both the big retailers, Staples, Office Depot, the like. But of course we also have the back to school season here in September as well.</p>
          <p>But we do keep a very close eye on that. And as one of the things you have to be just a little careful on any given month, any given quarter within the consumer business because we do fall a little bit out of sync with especially the retailers. Yet I'd also say that, I think, versus a lot of the other suppliers into the consumer business, our team has continued to do a marvelous job of new products and penetration programs across the board. So we continue to gain business every quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You were here, Scott, you heard Pat mention earlier that in the Filtrete business sales were up 75% and what a lot of our customers have been doing is expanding their presence of 3M products, dispersing in some cases other products. So we've been very successful at getting share here.</p>
          <p>And it's really been the innovation, taking our best technologies and innovating into new products &#x2013; let's pull that kind of thing off. And this has been pretty consistent across the vast majority of our retail customers. So we have done well simply &#x2013; better, should I say, simply because we've been penetrating with new products and it's the innovation, the differentiation that, again, is getting that kind of edge over the competition and the power of 3M's brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thanks, guys.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, hi. Comment on what you're seeing in Europe &#x2013; any signs of slowing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, Pat here. Good question. I would say that our &#x2013; the large Western European markets have performed similarly for both the first quarter and second quarter &#x2013; no noticeable change. Definitely worse in the Spain, Italy part of Western Europe and probably the U.K. The continent has remained low single digits for us, so that piece of it remains solid for us. Central, East Europe remains very, very strong for us. We haven't seen any impact there at all or the Mideast. There's no noticeable difference between Q1 and Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just on Healthcare margins in Q2, they were down versus Q1. What drove that decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I wouldn't worry about it. If I look at the year-on-year results strong double-digit growth both top and bottom line. That business will operate in the 28 to 29% margin range, Dave, in any given quarter. We happened to invest a little more in marketing activities in the second quarter versus the first quarter, which is kind of a normal pattern for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's nothing for you to be worried about, Dave, there. It's a great business, seems to be growing well, continuing innovation, especially in dental. Very, very strong in dental and the orthodontics sort of subcomponent of that, just doing extraordinarily well. So nothing for you to be worried about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, the other thing, I guess, and for everybody, just to remind you that in the second quarter we have a larger impact of stock option expensing sequentially Q1 to Q2, because our grant date is in the second quarter so our retirement eligible, what we have to book for retiree eligible people is &#x2013; kind of peaks in the second quarter. So all our businesses, sequentially Q1 to Q2, have a little bit of a hit. I think on a company basis, it's worth about a half a point of margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Citi Investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jeff.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick follow up on the corporate before I get to my questions. Pat, I thought the swing from negative 15 million last year in Q1 to a slight positive in corporate in Q1 this year was pension, but we've taken another step up to a bigger positive in corporate. Is there something else going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes the pension. It also reflects some of the cost efforts we have for some of the staff activities here. As, of course, we anticipated where the economy was going, we have started to streamline even more of our overhead cost here in the centre and part of that flows through that corporate and unallocated piece as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that be falling through as a negative not a positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it was a positive &#x2013; it's a positive; we take cost out okay it obviously is a positive from the income standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh so it's the reflection of actions you've already taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a new action?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we fixed, we sort of fixed the amount we charge to the businesses and if there is an over absorbable we put it in corporate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and George just a little strategically actually around HighJump, I don't remember if that was your deal or not but it wasn't that long ago that it was bought but whether you were at the helm for that one or not. I kind of thought conceptually and strategically you had been thinking of about kind of a software and electronics type overlay where you could across the businesses. Is that still the case and if so what was it about this particular asset that just didn't fit the mould?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff let me try to handle the historical piece of this okay and I'll let George kind of deal with, kind of the future. George was not here when we bought HighJump, I was; it was a 2004 acquisition that we made in our industrial business. And was really trying to get out a space where a lot of our customers had some significant, you know, warehouse management type issues. We thought we could incorporate it into our &#x2013; many of our industrial offerings and that we basically dealt with almost all industrial customers.</p>
          <p>And actually it started off reasonably well but as we got into it, it became very obvious that there were some, a lot bigger players in that space that we just could not compete; we didn't have the scale to compete head-on-head with the likes of SAP, Oracle and the like as they decided to enter that space as well. It was a &#x2013; we thought it was worth a shot.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; eventually it didn't pan out in the industrial business, we moved it over to the safety security business as part of our track and trace effort to see if it could get some traction there and realistically it didn't fit kind of our long-term strategy there. There is enough interest in the market that we're able to find a buyer for it albeit at a loss. So, I'll let George handle the futures piece of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the strategy Jeff, it's true we have aspirations to move towards some more electronic content in many of our products, where it's appropriate. But I think it's a sort of secondary strategy. We clearly have those upfront in central, invest in the core, invest in internationals the big lead dogs, in our strategy. So all that &#x2013; well as we invest in our electronic things, it'll only be at the margin. So you shouldn't see this as any great strategic piece Jeff and certainly as Pat has outlined and explained, I had nothing to do with HighJump.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then can you give us an update on what you are kind of expecting for restructuring over the balance of the year kind of in the context of the $0.02 that you caught out here in the quarter and I guess as part of that it's becoming quite normal for companies just to kind of absorb that in the pay-as-you-go and continue to march. Just what's your philosophy on that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will continue to asses the business, the business needs. We talked specifically about the optical one. We will continue to assess really in a couple of different areas as we look at our supply chain strategies over time. We may have some needs to do some restructuring, but don't a massive restructuring, again, it's more of a kind of one-off situation.</p>
          <p>But we will continue to assess our resource levels. We're currently doing that here, in the U.S. to see if we'd have a need to do something. So we will continue to look at this on kind of a quarter-by-quarter basis looking at our long-terms needs as well as kind of what the short-term opportunities are but don't expect anything large scale. We will take a charge here in the third quarter for the optical correction and that will both be people as well as around a few facilities that we have. We will more than likely have some offsetting asset transactions going the other direction. So in the third quarter we will have a few things probably going both directions. Probably some asset disposals as well as some further restructuring charges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the policy we have followed Jeff. We've tried for the menu you can't always synchronize these things as wherever we've done these restructurings to the extent that we can and to the extent it makes sense we've tried to synchronize them so you had an offsetting gain to cover the loss. And it's just in all companies, it is just they are not going tweaking assessment of efficiency and productivity, assessment of market conditions and taking appropriate action as you go forward. But generally speaking, if you &#x2013; you'll, for the most part, see compensating offsets in the round.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Lehman Bro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So on operating margins, can you talk through some of the businesses in the second half? What do you expect to get better, sort of second half versus year-over-year. I mean you've had margin declines 1Q, 2Q. There's been a mix in that to get to flat to up 100 basis points where you have to start showing improvement in the second half. What businesses do you expect to drive that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shannon, I wouldn't read too much into &#x2013; we're running what, 22.8 year-to-date, we've kind of said 22.5 to 23.5. I don't see that as being kind of a significant change. So second quarter, as I mentioned, we had a little bit &#x2013; we have kind of an unusual about a half point move because of the recognition of our retiree stock option obligation. But, other than that, I don't really see a significant change. Q3 has a tendency to maybe be a little bit better and then Q4 has a tendency to be a little bit down okay, in some of our industrial related businesses, but I don't see any path that's going to be unusual this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Pat, you mentioned that 28 to 29 for Healthcare. I mean, first quarter it was kind of I guess an outlier. I'm not sure what drove an unusually high-end result there, but is that kind of the right range to think about Healthcare?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say in that &#x2013; the 28 to 29 range I think is a legitimate range. In any given quarter, it may be a point higher or lower depending upon what we do. As I mentioned, the second quarter happens to be that we have a larger portion of some of our discretionary marketing programs going on and sales may or may not exactly fall in that quarter. So it's probably a normal range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on Display, I mean you mentioned the Optical sequential margin improvement. You guys feel more confident that since you had a little bit up sequentially here in D&amp;G that even though maybe the market dynamics haven't bottomed, your margins have?</p>

          <p>I would not go as far to say that the margins have necessarily bottomed in D&amp;G. We feel good, we're fighting this battle that we had kind of a stable margin quarter-on-quarter. But I'm not ready to say that it is going to stay there, okay, for the rest of the year. That happens to be one of the businesses that possibly could see a kind of a margin drop here of another point or two at the end of year.</p>

          <p>Okay, and just last one from me is, given the movement in this corporate line, I mean, can we get a guidance number for that line. It's been a little tough to model where that's supposed to come out this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can take &#x2013; my simple model would be maybe take Q1, Q2, average them and then use that for Q3, Q4.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How dilutive was Aearo in the quarter? Was there some dilution there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, we are very pleasantly pleased with the start up here of Aearo. Originally, we had said it'd probably be about $0.02 dilutive, on an all-in basis. It was probably closer to a penny dilutive. We said we had 20 million of one-time charges in the second quarter. But actually, we had superb operating results both top and bottom line for the whole quarter.</p>
          <p>So, really nothing of significance at the corporate level. I mentioned that the sector or the segment level, it probably impacted their operating margins by about two points in the quarter. But when you kind of roll that into the company, it kind of gets obviously muted at that point in time. So I wouldn't say it was a big impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then as far as the plants that you are starting up around the world, are those going according to plan and are they still operating at losses? Are you loading them? I mean, just give us an update on the various plants around the world and how that's going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, they're mostly finished now. We're right at the back end of that construction. The vast majority of them went absolutely perfectly. There were a few that got permitting delays in locations where it was little more challenging, in China and Russia, for example but nothing of a material nature.</p>
          <p>And they are progressively getting loaded. The ones that we completed earlier, like the one in Korea, doing extraordinarily well and we're probably at the point where we'll see a sort of a tipping point soon in terms of contribution in the next quarter or two. So it seems to have gone, I won't say without a hitch because that's always baiting, tempting providence.</p>
          <p>But it's an operational execution piece of 3M's that is just flipping superb, frankly speaking, to watch. So, no cause for concern, everything is running to plan and in a little time those things will load up and begin to make a bigger contribution to 3M both on sales growth and operating income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then there are no problems with regards to external factors like demand where you're having trouble filling these things up and getting them started to appropriate volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in fact in some cases, Steve, on the ones on Tegaderm, on the ones on the respirators, we would have been in a real pickle had we not had that capacity. It's a counter. I mean the only one way you could point some criticism at is the optical factories, obviously as a consequence of the transition that we saw, they have not been loaded as heavily as we want. But all in all, it seems to have worked out to be a pretty good strategy.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from John Roberts from Buckingham Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you discuss the sequential performance in Optical, I know TVs have a seasonality to them but it would seem that seasonality's kind of a secondary factor right now. So, have you seen the bottom in profitability, even though you haven't hit the bottom in revenues and would you expect some sequential performance as we go through the rest of the year <mark type="inaudible" /> improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, if you look at it sequentially, John, most of the top-line reduction Q1 to Q2 was in the TV &#x2013; is in the TV segment. The other businesses seem to perform about at the same level from the top line. Bottom line, I think you could probably &#x2013; you've seen the kind of a further reduction in Optical profitability, Q1 to Q2. That still may fall off a little bit here further in Q3-Q4. But we're a lot closer to the bottom of it right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You heard me, John, say earlier that sales have fallen by about &#x2013; in that segment &#x2013; in that LCD TV segment &#x2013; have fallen by about 66% of what they were a year ago and profits have fallen by about 80. So you can sense that, even if we lost all of the TV segment, which I think is unlikely, that we are relatively close to the bottom here, I think, it's an educated guess in some senses, but I think that there'll always be a portion, this is what we see, there will always be a portion of that market, where we won high-performance televisions. That will give you something of the order, 5% to 7%, maybe 5% to 9% attachment rates.</p>
          <p>So, I think the bottom is within sight. I'm not making any predictions here, but there is gathering momentum in the interest in energy, and of course one of the way that you can use our films is to take a TV or monitor or even for that matter a notebook and take out lamps and use the films to brighten them. So you end up using less energy, and that factor is now gaining a lot more interest from the set manufacturers than it once did.</p>
          <p>So, all I'd say is there's a bit more to go would be my estimate, a bit more to go, but we're getting close to the end, and I'm hoping that by the end of '08, we're going to be past all or most all of this, and if there is any bleed-over into '09, I think the bleed-over should be relatively small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That isn't my follow-up question, but can you point to any low end TV products in the U.S. that advertise as lower energy consumption? Is there some place you can point at to show that the TV customers &#x2013; that your TV customers would think that this is an important consumer marketing factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time I don't &#x2013; I can't think of one, John there are in the notebook space okay, but not in the TV market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, battery turns to plug in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it is an emerging issue John. It may not be there today but I do think this will get more visibility as time goes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, just it won't keep you on the phone call long here. But there is technology that we have today that will cut the energy usage in a television by 50 in a big set even by as much as 70%. It's here today, you can have it today, at some point the market is going to get interested in that and at relatively little or no premium, I think the forces are aligned over the coming months for that to get some momentum, we'll have to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are there any government movement to put energy ratings on TVs like you have on refrigerators and air conditioners?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the EPA has this energy star rate when they put on TVs, whether the EPA or anybody else in the State of California or perhaps the European Union will take any action remains yet to be seen. But, of course if they were to choose, if they chose to get involved, that would be a real catalyst for some growth in films. And actually, in the end, due to more environment friendly televisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, just as surprising we've actually seen it in the places like China, okay. China is taking an initiative to, especially within the government procurement offices of mandating buying energy efficient electronics and the like so. There is a momentum there.</p>
