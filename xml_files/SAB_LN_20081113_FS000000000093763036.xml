          <p>Welcome to the SABMiller 2009 First Half Results Conference Call. I will now turn the conference over to SABMiller. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to SABMiller's conference call and webcast presentation for our first half F'09 results. Thank you for joining us. I am Graham Mackay, Chief Executive of SABMiller, and with me today is Malcolm Wyman, our CFO. We're going to start with a short presentation, after which we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Our presentation will contain forward-looking statements. These reflect the current best judgment of the management, but include risks and uncertainties. And the company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside our normal reporting routines.</p>
          <p>Okay, before we get into the numbers, a reminder of the four strategic priorities that are our focus for driving value. First, creating a business with a broad geographical spread means that in difficult times we're not dependant on the economic conditions of any one country. Secondly, we have strong market positions with leading local brand portfolios that offer consumers choice at all price points.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we are relentlessly focused on operational execution with excellent in-market operations critical for current circumstances. And finally we are striving to take advantage of our scale, which can undoubtedly bring value for us both in cost efficiency and in operational effectiveness. These four strategic priorities remain as relevant today as ever, and will enable us to deliver further value for shareholders over the medium term.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Malcolm to cover the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day, everyone. I'm now going to take you through some financial and operating headlines. As usual, my primary focus will be on results on an organic constant currency basis, as this reflects our underlying performance.</p>
          <p>The Group has delivered a solid set of results with adjusted earnings per share up 8.6% in US dollars, benefiting from favorable rates of exchange when compared with the prior period. In the light of the uncertain outlook, we have decided to maintain the interim dividend at US $0.16 per share.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the key drivers of our results, organic volumes were up 1.5%, with lager organic volumes up 0.4% on a prior period, which reflected exceptional growth. Group revenue is up 10% on an organic constant currency basis with a strong contribution from firm pricing across the Group. We have led pricing in many of our markets, and continue to look at opportunities to enhance our revenue growth through pack and brand mix initiatives.</p>
          <p>EBITA is up 1.8% on an organic constant currency basis, with a particularly strong contribution from our North America segment. Higher raw material input costs and overall cost inflation combined with investment across the Group in sales capacity and reach have however impacted our EBITA margin, which is down 120 basis points versus the prior year on an organic constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>Now on that same organic constant currency basis, Group revenue was up 10% in aggregate. Of this, price/mix benefits are a very strong 8.3% and all of our regions are seeing price and mix improvements. Total revenue growth has benefited from some net currency strength against the US dollar during the first half, particularly the European and Latin American countries, and a number of acquisitions, principally in Europe.</p>
          <p>Moving to a similar analysis for EBITA, our underlying organic constant currency growth is 1.8%. The reported result is boosted by the positive currency moves I previously mentioned, plus the benefit from acquisitions made in the last 12 months. We have not made any organic adjustments as a result of the MillerCoors joint venture, as we do consider that our 58% share of the income stream of MillerCoors is equivalent to our 100% share of the earnings of the Miller Brewing Company in the prior year.</p>
          <p>I will now focus on our regions, dealing with specific issues impacting organic constant currency performance. Starting with Latin America, lager volumes grew by 3%, despite a decline in volumes in Colombia. Price/mix benefits resulted in revenue growth of 7%, notwithstanding the negative mix impact of the significant growth in the economy segment in Peru in which we now have a high share. Organic constant currency EBITA growth was flat, and EBITA margin declined by 120 basis points.</p>
          <p>The growth of and competition within the economy segment in Peru and significant increases in both product input and fuel costs and higher depreciation across the region impacted margins in Latin America. We continue to build differentiated portfolios in each country, and have introduced a range of innovations in the period, including smaller packs in Colombia and the introduction of Club Premium in Ecuador. At the same time, increased attention is now being focused on execution at the point of sale and revenue enhancement. As a result, lager continues to take share of the alcohol market across the region.</p>
          <p>Following many years of strong growth, Europe experienced a difficult half year with very high comparables, higher commodity costs, and slowing consumer demand in a number of its markets. Volume growth was a creditable 2% given the difficult trading conditions, and we have taken organic market share in some key markets, notably Poland and Romania. We achieved an 8% increase in revenue on an organic constant currency basis, but increased commodity costs together with high wage inflation and pressure on other fixed costs eroded these revenue benefits.</p>
          <p>EBITA on an organic constant currency basis was down 6%, with Russia profitability down in part as a result of the distributor destocking that took place towards the end of the period. Organic EBITA margin declined 270 basis points as input cost pressures, general cost inflation, increased investment and depreciation all impacted margin. We have continued to invest in Poland, Russia and Romania in capacity, capability and sales infrastructure. These are markets where we continue to see good growth opportunities through market growth or geographical expansion.</p>
          <p>As a result of the MillerCoors transaction, our North America segment results consist of the results from Miller Brewing Company as a standalone 100% subsidiary for the three months to the 30th of June, and principally our 58% share of the results from the MillerCoors joint venture for the three months from 1 July to 30 September. Whilst MillerCoors is the major element of the North America segment, it also includes a smaller element which is Miller Brewing International, which handles exports from North America.</p>
          <p>First half of the year in our North America segment saw a strong close to the trading in the Miller Brewing Company in the first quarter, and good initial results from MillerCoors in the second quarter. The segment also benefited from the realization of profits of some 32 million on the sale of surplus hops at high market rates.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITA for the first half is up some 25%, but this benefits from a number of one-off factors: the prior year adjustment for the F'07 related benefits of the settlement with our can supplier Ball, the hop sales, and the cycling of the Miller Chill launch with its associated marketing cost. MillerCoors continues to work towards its stated cost synergy target of $500 million per annum in year three, and we expect to see some first year benefits in the second half of our financial year.</p>
          <p>Our businesses in Africa and Asia delivered good EBITA growth. Pricing was firm in both Africa and Asia, but margins were impacted by rising investment and higher input costs. Our Africa businesses continue to experience good economic and trading conditions despite the global uncertainty, and we continue to invest in capacity and marketing in support of this growth.</p>
          <p>In China, our associates CR Snow experienced a slow start to the year, with flat organic volumes following high price increases and the effects of an earthquake in Sichuan, which is one of our key markets. However, the second quarter showed recovery in volume growth and market share gains. The focus on revenue has yielded strong results with EBITA up 21% in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>Our South Africa business delivered satisfactory volume performance in both the beer and soft drinks operations. But mix was adversely affected by increased competition in the premium segment and a trend to mainstream. Lager volumes for the six months were 1% down on the prior year. Lower premium sales were partially offset by growth in mainstream beer sales, as consumers traded down in light of the tough economic environment. Lower Hansa Marzen Gold and Castle Lite sales accounted for the bulk of the decline in premium, with the return to wide availability of a premium competitive brand a partial contributor.</p>
          <p>EBITA declined over the first six months with margins reduced as the business bore a range of pressures: higher commodity and diesel costs, a weakening currency, high incremental costs associated with the direct store delivery strategy and higher container depreciation costs, a result of the replacement of the 750 milliliter returnable bottle population.</p>
          <p>Now moving to Group financial considerations, Group EBITDA was up 5.6% and margin increased by 40 basis points. Reported margin benefited from the exclusion of the lower margin MillerCoors income stream. There was a net working capital outflow of $338 million across the Group. In Europe, debt has increased reflecting increased volume through key accounts across the region, but most notably in Italy, and strong trading in Romania and the UK. The outflow was further impacted by the payment of retention bonuses in North America and an increase in inventory held in Africa. Net cash flow from operating activities was 16% below the prior year, but a greater working capital outflow that I've just mentioned and higher interest paid.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure at US $1.26 billion was 43% ahead of the prior year, as we continue to invest in capacity across the businesses to support future growth. We have been expanding capacity in Poland and Romania, continue to make progress at our Ulyanovsk Brewery in Russia, and we have upped our investment across Africa to alleviate widespread capacity constraints.</p>
          <p>The Group effective tax rate was 31%, significantly below that in the comparable prior period, and 150 basis points lower than that achieved in the financial 2008 year. Principally due to some tax rate reductions, as well as initiatives to manage our effective tax rate. We believe that our tax rate is sustainable at this level, although we do continually seek to manage our tax rate down further.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position has increased slightly from the previous financial year, but our financial structure remains strong with gearing at 53.6%. We undertook a major refinancing in July when we completed a successful US $1.25 billion bond issue in two tranches: firstly, $550 million of 5.5-year notes with a coupon of 5.7%; and $700 million of 10-year notes with a coupon of 6.5%.</p>
          <p>We have also established a euro medium term note program to allow us to diversify further our sources of funding in the future, although no notes are being issued under the program at this particular point in time. The recent financial market volatility resulted in a general increase in the cost of debt, and our average interest rate at the end of the period increased to 8.1%. In excess of 70% of our debt is held at floating rates in anticipation of a decrease in interest rates going forward.</p>
          <p>Given the current volatility in the debt and foreign exchange rate markets, I will briefly cover the currency and maturity profiles of our debt. Left hand side of the slide shows two pie charts: one of our debt profile as at 30th of September, 2008, and one of our EBITA profile over the six months. As you can see, our net debt has a relatively well-balanced currency profile when considered against our income profile, although it's, we must note that as we report in US dollars, we do still retain a significant proportion of debt in our reporting currency.</p>
          <p>The right-hand side of the slide shows our debt maturity profile. The bulk of our debt matures in three years and beyond, whilst we intend to refinance the balance of our debt, which falls due in the next two years, through new borrowing arrangements in the normal course of business. We currently have headroom available of a similar amount, comprising existing, committed and unutilized facilities and cash resources; in addition to significant in-country banking facilities. As you can see, we are well positioned to face the challenges that the current economic and financial conditions present.</p>
          <p>Moving to our financial outlook. We currently expect our financing costs to be broadly similar in the second half to those in the first half, although the current volatility in financial and currency markets introduce a measure of uncertainty as to the full year finance costs. We anticipate that our full year tax rate will be approximately 31%, lower than in our previous financial year as we continue to benefit from lower statutory tax rates in certain countries, a beneficial mix of profit growth and effective tax management.</p>
          <p>Commodity cost pressures have been slightly ahead of that which we anticipated at the time of our preliminary results. However, we continue to expect raw materials per hectoliter for the whole Group, including MillerCoors, to increase in line with our original estimates of low double-digit growth. However, we have experienced significantly increased fuel costs given the high oil price prevailing for much of the first half of the year. And we now expect cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low double digits as a result.</p>
          <p>Although we have seen an easing in commodity markets recently, a combination of our raw material hedging arrangements and weaker currencies will continue to exert pressure on input costs in the second half of the year. In the light of the current economic uncertainty and slowing consumer demand in some countries, we are actively taking steps to curtail costs where appropriate, both capital investment and operating, as well as to improve efficiencies.</p>
          <p>However, as some major capital projects are nearing completion and capacity are still required to remove constraints in some countries which are expected to continue to show volume growth, we still expect capital expenditure for the full year to be around the level of the prior year and in line with guidance at the time of or our preliminary results.</p>
          <p>The current foreign exchange volatility, and with many of the Group's currencies currently trading at lower levels against the US dollar than in the prior year, we would expect a negative impact from currency translation on our full year results should these currencies remain around the current levels to the US dollar.</p>
          <p>I will now hand back to Graham.</p>

          <p>Thanks Malcolm. As you all know, our first half comps were very challenging, following two successive years of extraordinary growth that had been well ahead of our expectations across all regions other than the US. The graph on this slide illustrates these growth rates for last year. Europe in particular is notable, having grown volumes at approximately 10% in each of the preceding two years.</p>
          <p>And Europe's growth has had a very positive impact on the Group's P&amp;L over that period. These comps are now easing, but our top line outlook is clouded by the weakening environment for consumer spending. Higher inflation and lower disposable incomes make it difficult for us to predict the timing of renewed volume growth.</p>
          <p>Commodity costs have been falling, which is good news after the sharp rises of the past two years. But due to both our forward purchase arrangements and recent currency moves, as you've just heard from Malcolm, any positive impact on our financials will be muted in the short-term. And as you've also heard from Malcolm, the recent strengthening of the dollar will have quite a material impact on our results through higher local procurement costs and on the translation of our earnings.</p>
          <p>But we believe that we are well placed to ride out these difficult times. The beer category is comparatively resilient in times like these. Beer is a staple part of consumers' lifestyles and its affordability is good relative to many other products. While the growth of the beer category can be cyclical, we've seen that its peaks and troughs are less pronounced than those of many other sectors. And so we do not expect to stop growing. Having said that, no one is immune from the economic environment.</p>
          <p>All in all, our wide geographic spread can act as something of a hedge against overexposure to any one region. We are seeing wide variations in the way that the current global turmoil and financial markets is impacting on the real economy in each of our markets. Some countries such as South Africa and Colombia have seen a pause in consumer spending growth following steep interest rate rises. In many others, including Eastern Europe and China there is a slowing of the previous blistering pace of growth with hopes of a soft landing. In certain countries, like Peru and much of Africa, we've yet to see a slowdown. And in the US, there's little evidence that a weaker economy will affect beer volumes, although there may be implications for the mix of sales between channels and segments.</p>
          <p>Our leading local brand portfolios around the world position us well, and cater to varying consumer needs, supporting growth in volume and in local market shares, and providing resilience in challenging times. It's not easy to successfully span the economy mainstream and premium categories in every market. And few brewers do this well. But we believe that this continues to be a significant competitive advantage for us. Our particular strength in the large and profitable local mainstream and local premium segments is also an advantage now, as affordability increases in importance in some markets.</p>
          <p>Our share of alcohol revenues also continues to rise in most markets, largely as a result of our brand marketing efforts. And perhaps most importantly, as I highlighted six months ago, our brand equities are also enabling healthy price increases, often market leading, to offset our much higher input costs. Our percentage margins are nevertheless down due to these input costs to our investments and to some country-specific factors.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe in the growth prospects of our markets, and in our ability to increase our share of alcohol over the medium term. We remain a growth business, and our continuing investment in brands, packaging, innovation and capacity all affect us. New capacity is coming on stream this year and next, some of which is perhaps overdue and some will enable continued medium-term growth and operational flexibility to support more varied brand portfolios.</p>
          <p>We are responding to the challenging economic conditions, resulting in growth coming off the world for the industry from its previous rapid pace. And in this context, we are re-examining all CapEx, applying stringent return tests that reflect the risks of each distinct country. And in all areas of the business, we will focus on our cost base to be as lean as possible. Having said this, we must acknowledge that the beer sector has a relatively high proportion of inflexible fixed costs. And so as you heard from Malcolm, the combination of slower growth, higher input and wage costs and continued investment, results in lower margins for us at the moment.</p>
          <p>Now turning to take a look at each of our divisions, and starting with Europe. Our business model in Central and Eastern Europe has been enormously successful over the past five years in delivering high volume and profit growth. While we continue to implement our proven strategies, it is clear that the business faces increased challenges in a now difficult operating environment. These challenges are both limiting growth and resulting in higher costs, leading to the reduced margins that Malcolm's described.</p>
          <p>In Central Eastern Europe, consumer spending growth has slowed materially. And that, combined with the high per capita consumption levels we've achieved over recent years, means that beer as a category is slowing and maturing. But it's pleasing to see the strength of our brands and operations in our continued recent market share gains in Poland, Romania and Italy.</p>
          <p>Across Europe, we continue to implement 360-degree marketing programs and effective sales and trade investment tools. We've led the industry on price increases in many markets to cover higher input costs. And we're managing for value in markets where competition demands it, or where others haven't taken price as much as we have, as in Czech and Hungary.</p>
          <p>The Russian market slowed and our growth has paused, exacerbated by the distributor stock issues that you heard about earlier. But we still see good growth prospects over the medium-term, particularly in the regional cities. As a result, we're on the brink of significant geographic expansion with our new plant in Ulyanovsk and the acquisition of Vladpivo in Vladivostok. We're also confident in the pipeline of innovation.</p>
          <p>And then turning to Latin America, it's a mixed picture. In Colombia, consumer spending has flattened across a wide range of categories. It's clear that the very pronounced increase in interest rates has been the leading cause. Wage increases have been used to pay down debt rather than on consumer spending. We're anticipating the negative volume trend to flatten. And we've implemented another price increase last month and achieved a further reduction in retailer mark-ups.</p>
          <p>In our other countries in the region, it's a different picture with some strong performances. Our initiatives to build effective brand portfolios and improve beer's image are having the desired effect. So the impact of this economic climate notwithstanding, we're pleased with the work of our teams on the ground. And the evidence is in the fact that we've gained share of alcohol in all the key countries.</p>
          <p>We're succeeding on the base of very focused in-market execution and product innovation like the new packages that you see here on the slide developed for &#x2013; to target specific needs, delivering the right brands in the right packs for different consumers in the appropriate channels and increasing our market penetration.</p>
          <p>In Peru, our share has stabilized. And we've been able to achieve that while remaining firm on price, even when the competition introduced new even lower-priced offers. However, it is true that unit profitability in this market has been reduced, and it shows up in the margins. As you know, we've been investing in our Latin American business in all areas. Partly as a result, we're reaping some impressive efficiency gains. Yet, with the rapid rise in input costs, margins remain under pressure.</p>
          <p>Then the new MillerCoors business is performing well, considering the current environment. On other hand, we're not complacent, and we're certainly nearer the beginning than the end of the integration process. There is a tremendous amount of change that the team is managing at the moment, creating a new company with a new culture. The early stages of this process have been going well. They're trading well, and managing the portfolio deftly, without conflict between the key brands.</p>
          <p>Seven out of the twelve key brands grew, led by Coors Light. And MGD 64 has started well, stabilizing a franchise that had been in decline for some time. Affordability is becoming important in the US. And for a number of reasons, the leading imports have softened, although smaller, more differentiated imports and domestic craft beers are up. In this context, MillerCoors' import and craft portfolio is doing extremely well, with Blue Moon, Peroni and Leinenkugel's all up significantly.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors is also working to create the best possible distribution network for its products, leveraging its wholesalers' leading skills and experience. MillerCoors is encouraging the current distributor consolidation process to create an optimal and efficient network, a process that will continue into next year and well beyond. And they're on track with the $500 million of deal synergies that we identified. In fact, last week we brought forward their achievement plan by six months.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, we've just finished our first twelve months in the new competitive environment. I think the sales volumes of the business have been satisfactory, with a better market share trend than we expected against the new competition. Conversely, the competitors' volumes have been lower than we expected. In the marketplace overall, with the economic climate and high inflation and interest rates hitting the consumer, there's been very little consumer spending growth at all.</p>
          <p>Despite this, overall beer industry volumes have grown by 2%, in line with our earlier guidance. In the current economic climate, price/mix has been affected to the determent of premium volume performance. But we are the beneficiaries of that trend, as consumers shift to mainstream, which is our traditional strength. We're investing to sustain our leadership across the beer category. And that involves packaging upgrades in core mainstream brands, new premium brand introductions, new marketing campaigns, as well as continued improvement in operations to deal with greater complexity, higher costs and outlet licensing.</p>
          <p>This investment is part of an extensive process to strengthen our business in South Africa. On the soft drink side, we've seen a net increase in our Coke business led by the launch of Coke Zero. Overall, the result of these higher costs, a significantly weaker rand, more investment and negative mix movements, is the substantial reduction in margins that you're seeing. These P&amp;L pressures are set to remain over the coming 12 months, from which we then hope to build.</p>
          <p>Africa continues to perform strongly. We've stepped up investment in both brands and operations across Africa, and that's driving a new phase of growth for us. And with low per capita consumption, there's still lots of upside over the long-term. We're excited to see our volume growth momentum sustained, or in fact, even accelerating.</p>
          <p>The first half in Botswana was pleasing. However, looking ahead, we have to recognize that the recent introduction of a 30% social levy is a threat to our business there. In India too, overregulation continues to be the biggest influence on growth, now and in the future; more than the economic situation.</p>
          <p>China has had a lot to deal with over the last months: the major earthquake in Sichuan, which had a disproportionate impact on us compared to the industry nationally, and other factors to a lesser extent; some bad weather, foot and mouth outbreaks and the impediments in the trade during the Olympics. And as you know, we've put through a significant price increase. Volumes were flat, with an improving trend in the second quarter and a substantial increase in profits. Input costs have risen, but our price increase, together with mix improvement, grew unit revenue by over 20%.</p>
          <p>So in summary, with easier comps ahead of us and input cost pressures easing off a bit, we might have expected to see an improving performance into the next year. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty and unpredictable economic difficulties ahead of us around the world, while the industries input costs have risen. And in this context it is appropriate for us to scrutinize CapEx based on risk and return prospects, and cut costs wherever possible.</p>
          <p>Yet the business is resilient. We have strong brand portfolios, a strong geographic base and we're in resilient category. We've continued to invest in our brands, our packaging, sales effectiveness and capacity, because we are still confident in our medium- and long-term prospects. We remain a growth business. We're confident in the continued relevance of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Our formula for running the business with strong brands, local execution and local accountability in each market, combined with the effective use of our global scale, works for good times and bad. And as you know, tougher times generally give rise to opportunities for stronger and more capable companies to increase our lead versus competition, to invest and expand selectively, and to emerge stronger yet as the environment improves.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'll take your questions. Operator, back to you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Simon Hales from Dresdner. Three questions if I can. Can I just start with Africa and the margins there in the first half? I wonder if you could just flesh out a little bit what was happening there? Obviously you've talked about very strong top line growth. Is it the higher depreciation costs on the investment and thus high raw materials which have disproportionately hit the African margins in the first half?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on working capital, how should we be thinking about the working capital outflows for the full year? Should we use the first half as a guidance, or it just seasonally very high on the back of some things you highlighted, Malcolm?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just on the replacement of the bottle and the containment, container pool in South Africa and Latin America. Could you just remind me whether that's pretty well fully complete at the end of the first half in those two core regions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Simon, it's Malcolm here. As regards Africa, the margins are down quite heavily, as you've seen. And it's actually right across the board. It's input costs and it's also from depreciation, higher depreciation that has resulted from CapEx coming into the different regions. And so there's no one item which is the major issue. It's a package of items which has impacted us. But input costs is one of the bigger issues.</p>
          <p>As far as working capital is concerned, I must say that the output we had this half was a little disappointing, and certainly I'm personally concerned about it. We have looked into this in detail, and there are some excuses or reasons for it. You know that inventories have been priced at a much higher level because of the higher input costs so our inventories stand at higher prices even though volumes are the same.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we have higher receivables because our prices are up quite strongly right across the board. And we did do some extra buying of agricultural products in Africa. So there were a number of issues which actually resulted in the net working capital going up. But we certainly are trying to get that down back again to where we were by the end of this year. So there is a lot of activity taking place in this particular department.</p>

          <p>On the bottle replacement question, Simon, yes, the South African program is coming to an end in the second half of F'09. So it effectively will be over by Christmas of this year. So it's not entirely out of the &#x2013; in the books in the first half, but it will be during the course of the second. Most of the Latin American programs, similarly, there are some smaller programs involving some small pack presentations that we're looking at there, but again most of those are already in the base.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Here in Europe, most organic costs I think were up around 10% per hectoliter, which implies the raw materials were up well ahead of the increased guidance that you're giving for 2H. Did you have to go into the spot market at all this half? Have the general costs of competing really gone up so considerably to account for this? And a second more general question, your recent price increases that you've put through, is that going to allow you guys to overcome the cost pressures of the second half and maybe keep the margin flat on year-on-year for 2H? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Grant, the European commodity situation, yes, there were some failures in those markets, in fact. In general, we don't buy spot at all. We're on long-term contracts. But there has been quite a lot of turbulence in those commodity markets in Europe so there was a little bit of activity there. Cost of competing is &#x2013; I'm not sure that I would really say that the cost of competing per se has increased outside the cost of commodities. Certainly competition has risen, particularly in Russia, competition has risen. But overall, our competitive situation I think is pretty healthy.</p>
          <p>As far as price increases in the future are concerned, we think that we will still be under pressure in the second half, and there will be no real amelioration of that pressure until well into F'10. You have to recognize, of course I'm sure you do, that the spot increases in those markets are way, way, way ahead of any increases that we've put through in our costs because of our forward buying. So we've avoided the worst excesses of the markets as they've gone up. But also it takes quite a long time for our costs to start coming down because of the stickiness on the downside as well.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions if I may. First one is a follow-up on Simon's question with regard to the bottle investments. Could you quantify the impact for South Africa of the incremental depreciation on these new bottles? And when we should expect that depreciation charge to fall away? Because I think you depreciate them over very fast period, two years or so.</p>
          <p>Second question would be on your volume outlook. You said you expect flattening of volumes in Colombia. What is your view directionally at least for South Africa and Europe for the second half, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's Malcolm here, Thomas. On the bottle investment, as you know in the case of our bottle packaging, what we do is we write them down to deposits, and then write those off over the course of about three years. So this year, there'll probably be an extra amount of about $10 million included in there in this half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the prospects are concerned, Thomas, we don't know anyone who does know where exactly the markets of Europe are going because the rate of change in Europe has been so dramatic. The &#x2013; many of those markets are still &#x2013; some of those markets are still doing fine. Romania is still tracking ahead very well, although we're not confident that will necessarily continue at this &#x2013; or can continue, at this kind of pace. Poland has been all right. Hungary's been down. Czech has actually recovered a little bit, and so on. So it's a mixed bag, but the rate of change in Europe has been I think a surprise to everyone.</p>
          <p>In Colombia what we think is is that the downward trend will flatten out simply because the factors that have led to that seem to have themselves flattened to some extent. But there and in South Africa, we are again moving into somewhat uncharted territory because of the fairly substantial drop in the value of the currencies. Both the Colombian peso and South African rand have fallen fairly sharply against the dollar.</p>
          <p>So I would say that the prospects there are somewhat dependant on foreign currency moves, because if those currencies stay as weak as that, then I think there will be further pressure on the consumer in CPI increases. And we'll have to deal with that as it comes, as it plays through. So all in all, we think that the resilient &#x2013; the volumes in South Africa have been relatively resilient, although there's been the down trading to some extent. In Colombia, there's no real mix effect, and volumes have been subdued. We don't see any reason to think that things will get worse. But there is certainly the ForEx issue to worry about.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Melissa Earlam of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. Three questions, please. First of all, can you explain why your central costs went down on year-on-year basis? And secondly, obviously your pricing has been very strong in the first half of this year. Can you just comment a little bit about how you expect the pricing outlook across all your markets over the next 12 months, given that the consumer is weakening? And the third question is what measures you're introducing to control bad debt amongst some of your wholesalers and if that is an issue at all? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, perhaps I'll just tackle the &#x2013; your first question. The item you see there is actually not central costs. It's called corporate. And what it is, is it's the central clearing house. And it includes our corporate costs, but it also includes all of our arrangements between the center and the hub. So what happens, we have pricing of projects which are undertaken on a Group-wide basis. Sometimes those are held at the center; other times when they are done in conjunction with the hubs, the hubs pick up some of those costs.</p>
          <p>So there's also royalties that we receive on the international worth-more brands, which are held at the center. So there's a number of clearing items. And what can happen is that in one year we may find that there are more costs picked up at the center, whereas in other years there are more transactions entered into where the hubs participate and the benefits are for the hubs and they pick up the costs. So you do see some volatility in the corporate, but we wouldn't expect the second half to be at the same low level. We'd probably expect it to be in total for the full year probably $100 million or less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then listening to your second question about pricing, quite frankly, we still see pricing going through into the market. We talk about strong pricing, but if you look at the actual numbers in local currency, actually compared to other elements of inflation the consumer has been seeing, these are very modest increases indeed. You talk about 6 to 8% rising to perhaps 10% at most in most currencies.</p>
          <p>And as I say, when you look at what the consumer is subjected to in other raw material with food inflation and other spot increases, that's actually quite modest. So we think that we will be, and if the competitive situation will allow us, to continue to recover costs broadly at the sort of rate that we have been doing. And we don't think that that's out of line with the consumer economy, the consumer realities.</p>
          <p>As far as wholesale inventories and bad debts are concerned, yes, that has not surfaced as a major issue. The &#x2013; and we, obviously are watching it extremely closely. Wholesaler inventories are highest actually in the United States where the wholesalers are much bigger, more sophisticated businesses, carry a wider SKU range and carry longer stocks. And by and large wholesalers in the States are in reasonably good health, and I don't think there's any particular reason for concern there.</p>
          <p>In Europe, there has been a systematic winding down of wholesaler inventories in some markets. In particular, Russia we've pointed to but the same has applied in some others. And we are watching them very closely. And thus far, it hasn't been a situation that has &#x2013; to alarm us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Three questions if I may. About the wholesalers, maybe you can &#x2013; I don't think you'd answered really the question on the bad debt provisioning at wholesalers? Second question is on your cost. You say that you are looking more intensively to CapEx. Can you give somewhat more light on that, where you are looking to keep that down? And also in your operational cost base where &#x2013; to what items are you looking? Is that in production? Is that in marketing?</p>
          <p>And third question is on premiumization. I read from several regions that still you're worth-more portfolio is increasing relatively healthy. In South Africa, you're talking about price/mix under pressure. But is that not only the case because of the fact that your competitor there has taken away the Amstel brand, et cetera and taking away the money spent in premium away from Marzen Gold to Amstel? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, I'm not sure that I understood your question about wholesalers because I think I answered that. I &#x2013; the bad debt provisioning in effect has &#x2013; goes with the inventories. And what I was saying was that we haven't seen any dramatic rise in bad debt indicators. And we haven't had to raise provisioning against that. What we have done is to run down inventories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that I think is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...all right. As far as CapEx and operating costs are concerned, we have a very extensive, have had a very extensive CapEx program. I think this is now about $2 billion a year. And in fact, in this first half as it happened, simply because of the timing of some very, some fairly large projects, there was an acceleration of outflowing, of outgoing cash. But we are reexamining our CapEx programs across the board. We are not cutting them systematically or uniformly because some of, in some of the markets capacity is still required.</p>
          <p>New capacity is still required and can be very easily justified. So the capacity expansions that we're putting in in the form of new breweries, for instance, in Africa, those are going ahead. We are still engaged in the mid to final stages of expansion in Russia. We've just come to the end of an expansion in Poland. We still require expansion in Peru, because that market is growing. Possibilities in Romania. So it's a very mixed picture.</p>
          <p>What we are trying to do is to cut out more discretionary CapEx in infrastructure or development in the marketing CapEx, reexamine some of those projects. But it's difficult to generalize past that. As far as operational costs are concerned, the same thing. It's a very broad group. It has very different businesses. We are looking at infrastructural costs in particular, and trying to pull those things back. And we're obviously trying to minimize reductions in marketing cost or marketing support as we've said in the outlook.</p>
          <p>So the last thing to go, we would hope, would be marketing. Our marketing expenditures are healthy. And I certainly wouldn't like to give the impression that we are cutting back at all dramatically on brands, on brand support. As far as the worth-more mix is concerned, we've talked about the slowing of the premium drift in many countries. In South Africa, it is not what you've suggested, just that the volumes have gone to Heineken with the Amstel brand. In fact, the whole premium segment is down, Amstel included.</p>
          <p>One of the things that I mentioned was that the volumes of the competitor there are below expectation, our expectation, and that's the same point. The premium end in South Africa has stopped growing in total. In fact, our participation in it is rising. But the segment as a whole is not growing as it was. And the same is true in America, certainly as far as imports are concerned. Elsewhere, in Europe, the premium, the rate of drift to premium has probably slowed, but it hasn't stopped.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Do you think that CapEx will be at the depreciation level in 2010?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Malcolm here. No, I don't think CapEx will be on the depreciation level because that's quite a low level, which we would balance with our maintenance CapEx. And as you've just heard from Graham, there's many areas around the globe that are still growing. And we obviously want to make sure we don't undersupply those markets or allow our competitors to get market share. So we will be investing there.</p>
          <p>And perhaps I could just add something to your question about CapEx and going forward. If you look at the first half, it is quite significantly ahead of what you would've expected. And there are some additional items in there for the very reason that we do have part of our geography growing very quickly. So when we say that we're looking at our CapEx, what we will be intending to do there is to bring back what looks like a run rate which is higher than our initial guidance in May. The idea is that we will bring back CapEx to our initial guidance, whereas it may well have been ahead of that. So we're trimming back on CapEx where we're seeing that growth has slowed down.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Graham. Good morning, Malcolm. I wonder if I could just press you a little bit more on the input costs, and if you can give us a little bit more guidance about exactly how far forward you have hedged? I'm particularly interested in aluminum, which is relevant to your US business, and when we can start to expect to see the effects of those lower prices coming through?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, just a question on the tax rate for the MillerCoors joint venture, should we expect that to be close to 40%, or will there be some savings in that regard? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Anthony, it's Malcolm. On the input costs side, obviously, region-by-region and also product by product we handle that slightly differently. But if you look at our mounting costs, and aluminum is the particular one you pointed out, we do hedge forward anywhere between 6 and 24 months. Although in the case of barley, as an agricultural product, we can't actually hedge too far forward on that.</p>
          <p>As far as aluminum is concerned, we would see no real benefit of the lower spot prices coming through over the next 6 to 12 months. We think from that point of view, there are hedges in place and they will need to run out. The MillerCoors joint venture tax rate, essentially, there's no real change there. The tax rate stays the same. But as you know, the &#x2013; we handle the tax ourselves and the actual MillerCoors joint venture is a partnership arrangement that doesn't have its own taxable entity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thank you. Can I just ask a follow-up? Just &#x2013; if we look further then 6 to 12 months, would you anticipate that we could see quite material cost reduction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it obviously depends on where the spot prices go to. But as Graham mentioned earlier, we don't really buy at spot. As prices go up &#x2013; we've seen the cost of malt, barley go up anywhere between two and three times, and hops seven times and above &#x2013; and as we've guided, our brewing raw materials and packaging raw materials have only gone up in low double-digits. So we enter into fixed rate contracts in bulk, and we actually don't buy at the very high spot prices. So we don't see the peaks, but then, of course, we don't come off that quickly because our prices are much lower in any event.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With aluminum, though, Anthony, the, it's true that aluminum spot prices are down. But aluminum futures are trending up again. So when our positions start to run out, when we can buy for the future, we don't know where those will be.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Two questions. Firstly, I would be grateful for some advice about how we should interpret the dividend, interim dividend, which has been held in dollar terms? And what that's supposed to send as a message for the full year? And secondly, you've given us some very good thoughts about how you see the beer industry for the next 12, 18 months. Would you look at the soft drinks industry where you're involved in a similar way, or would you be more cautious?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the dividend side, I think you shouldn't read anything, or too much into that. You've seen that our outlook statement is actually, I think, a prudent and cautious one given the changing environment. In the last four, five months the environment, the global financial and banking environment particularly and now into the real economy, has changed dramatically. So looking forward over the next six months, the Board adopted a prudent approach, and said that we'll maintain the dividend in what is a uncertain environment. And then we'll look at that at the end of the year. So I don't think you should read too much into it.</p>

          <p>Just in bigger picture terms, Malcolm, I'm not aware you've ever had a stated guidance to keep dividend cover above a certain level of two times say, EPS. But is there some sort of threshold that you think about there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we do. We have a very clear policy on that. We like to maintain our dividend covered between 2.2 and 2.5 times by earnings per share. So we have strayed out of the parameters slightly on both ends at times. But that's generally where we would like to keep the dividend.</p>

          <p>As far as the soft drink question is concerned, Ian, yes, I think that the soft drink market the soft drink market &#x2013; well, the soft drink market is subject to the same sort of affordability issues as beer. Our biggest soft drink positions are in Africa. And overall in Africa, the soft drink growth has been slightly ahead of beer. But again, it's quite difficult to generalize because you've got markets like Angola where it is storming ahead, mind you, as is beer. And you've got others where it's much more conventional, like in South Africa.</p>
          <p>So I don't see any reason to, for that pattern to change much. I would expect soft drinks to more or less follow beer trends. But perhaps in Africa, the secular trend is a little bit ahead of beer, couple, a few percentage points ahead of beer. In LatAm, we do have the soft drink positions, but they're not really material in profit terms. There is one factor, which is that, as you know, there's this alcohol levy, a social levy being applied in Botswana, which will likely depress volumes there somewhat. And it won't do that in soft drinks. In fact, soft drinks may I suppose be a &#x2013; something of a beneficiary of that. So there may be a little bit of an offset there. But that's a relatively minor effect.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. Couple of follow-up questions on South Africa. In terms of the first half margin movement, you mentioned there was a FX gain in the prior period that obviously impacted the margin. Could you give us a feel for the scale of that? And then on some of the cost pressures that had been running, such as importing glass and direct distribution expenses, just to get a feel whether those will start to run-off in H2?</p>
          <p>Then also on South Africa, the second price increase and you put through in September. You mentioned the market was growing at 2% in the period reported, whether that secondary price increase has had any impact? And then just finally on net debt to EBITDA, is it fair to assume that you could still borrow up to three times, even in the current market? Whether you'd look to or not, I'm not sure, but would &#x2013; is that a sensible figure that you can borrow to? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want to take the FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, perhaps I'll just comment on the FX and then hand back to Graham to cover the other South African issues. It's not in and of itself a major contributor. It's just one of the items, as you've seen, we've given you a whole range of items that have impacted the South African situation. It is just a little bit more material in this half because we had a mark-to-market profit in the prior period, which in relation to the 12 months was &#x2013; we didn't really mention it because it was that small. It's a little bit bigger in this period. But it's just one of all of those items that's impacted the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As far as the costs are concerned, Chris, of the factors you mentioned, yes, the importing of glass, certainly that should be running out. And the glass situation has eased in South Africa, but &#x2013; because of the economy and because of also getting to the end of the glass replacement programs.</p>
          <p>The DSD costs, that is more discretionary. I don't think that the DSD program is going to accelerate certainly. And in fact, it's driven to some extent, or to the extent that we can implement it, it is driven by a local licensing. And that &#x2013; and the outlook for more local licensing is not looking any brighter than it was. And in fact, the noises are for more impediments. So I don't think that the DSD costs themselves will accelerate noticeably, anyway.</p>
          <p>As far as pricing is concerned, yes, there was the &#x2013; or pricing and volumes in South Africa are concerned, there was a fairly dramatic acceleration towards the end of the half in volumes because of the price increase that we put in. And we think that that's more or less now played itself out. And in fact, if you look at consumer inflation in South Africa, I think that that price increase was very necessary, and was unremarkable against the rest of the pricing environment there. So I think that the longer-run trends in South Africa are basically re-asserting themselves about from now. And what was your final question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net debt situation, the net debt to EBITDA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't you take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, on net debt to EBITDA, yes, we have said in the past that we, very comfortable to move up to three times, if there was a very good reason to do so and an attractive transaction opportunity presented itself. What that means is that we probably raise another close to $4 billion on the basis of that calculation. Just make a couple of points. Obviously we would not do that unless there was an attractive opportunity. And if there was, I'm very confident that we would be able to raise the funds.</p>
          <p>I think the money is there for good transactions, and we have a very good relationship with our banks. And as an example of that, during the course of the financial crisis over the last three or four months in, at the middle of July, we raised $1.25 billion in the capital markets. In August, we raised from, three-year money from the bank of $600 million. And in the beginning of October, which I think was probably right in the middle of the financial crash, we extended our one billion loan facility with all of our banking, bank syndicate for another billion dollars, and that goes with an extra one year turn-out option. So I think we feel confident that on the right transaction, the money will be there, that we have a good relationship with our banks, and that we have a track record that supports that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just so I understand with the new accounting for MillerCoors going forward, the net debt, EBITDA that you will be looking at, is that ex-MillerCoors or will that be grossed up for the MillerCoors contribution? So I understand how the rating agencies will it be looking at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good question. Technically, based on IFRS accounting, EBITDA will exclude the calculation of the EBITDA of the MillerCoors joint venture. However, we would expect and in fact as far as we're concerned it will be, that the EBITDA of the joint venture will be represented by cash dividends, which flow from the joint venture up into both ourselves and Molson Coors. So the calculation will be done on the basis of the EBITDA in our books, plus the cash dividends received from the MillerCoors joint venture. And that would be the figure on which we would calculate our debt/EBITDA for the purposes of credit rating ratios.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And sorry to hold you up, one quick follow-up from Graham, what &#x2013; something you said with regard to the South African price increase. You thought that it was unremarkable. If we do see a period of slowing inflation in South Africa, which it certainly seems to be what people are forecasting, do you think the affordability up there is fine with that second price increase, such that we, you wouldn't expect to have to discount that back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm not sure that inflation is going to drop that much if the rand stays where it is, because I think that commodity costs will feed through on a Forex basis. Yes, I don't think that discounting back is really in prospect. But nor do I think that two price increases a year is something that we would like to continue with. So I think that after that one-time correction we can look forward to very much more of a restoration of our old policy there.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning guys. Just as much as a clarification as a question, my understanding from looking at the Cantos interview this morning was that, Graham, you were saying that margins would potentially bottom into 1H'10, and then improve thereafter. Was that correct? Was my understanding of that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Malcolm is saying that that was his interview, so then you answer the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was. What I was asked was to make a prediction of that. And what I said was that that's a very difficult thing to do, because it depends on a whole range of issues including: our volumes, the whole range of spot prices going forward and therefore the cost of input, foreign exchange rates affecting costs. So I said that all those things being equal, if one looked ahead at this particular point in time and where our hedges were running out, and the fact that commodity prices look as though they were coming down, we would see pressures continuing for this second half.</p>
          <p>But that possibly in the first half of next year, we may see a bottoming of the margin. Now, you have to take that in the light of the question that was asked. Which you can't answer that unless you can settle all those different assumptions. So it was a very generalized answer to a very generalized question.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks, that's clear. Can I just also ask a follow-up on the African business? I was surprised, for one, by the extent to which the revenue increased in your associates line. Obviously a couple of different countries in there but we've got a fair idea of what's included in the African and Asia associates. Perhaps was it maybe a bigger contribution from Australia and Vietnam or something like that coming through year-on-year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'm sorry to sort of witter on about this input cost issue, but you've raised your guidance for the expected increase in COGS this year by approximately two percentage points. And you've explained that with the rising costs of distribution and occasionally some wage cost increases. Looking forward into the next six months and beyond, one would expect to see distribution costs falling, I would've thought, with the oil prices and so on. I just wondered if you'd like to talk a little bit further about why you've raised the guidance by a couple of percentage points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Let me just try and give you some pointers here. Obviously during the course of the first six months, we've incurred significantly higher other variable production costs and also distribution costs. And if you take that into account, even with the oil prices coming down in the second half of this year, we still see that our increase that we've had to endure over the first half of the year is going to push that guidance of upper single-digit into a just about a lower double-digit. So there is a, as you say, a 1 or 2% increase. And most of that has taken place in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. If I could just ask one follow-up, which is a rather general one about the impact of currency shifts, leaving aside the translation effect, in some of the comments that have been made it seems to be that there's two particular things going on. I wonder if you could expand upon them? The first is a general economic one, which is the effect on economies of import, rising import costs, and the effect on consumer spending? And the second is that your operating level on, where you're having to import from more expensive countries et cetera? I know it's a bit general, but can you talk a little bit further about how those effects play out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure really where to take that out. I think, in some of the, well, the first thing is that many of the input costs, our input commodity costs, are effectively global commodities: glass, aluminum, barley. The prices are not constant across the, or not uniform, across the globe. But they do move more or less in tandem. And they are linked, they generally are quoted in dollars.</p>
          <p>So where we've had in the past currencies such as the euro and euro-linked currencies and the South American currencies performing strongly against the dollar, those parts of our business have been shielded to some extent from commodity cost increases, because the commodity cost increases expressed in their local currencies have not been that great. Now that shield has moved, has disappeared more or less, because the &#x2013; or to some extent has disappeared, because the euro's declined against the dollar. And the linked currencies in Europe declined against the dollar, as has the Colombian peso, which was very strong.</p>
          <p>So the commodity prices themselves, simply expressed in those local currencies, have gone up. And the same applies to the rand, of course. The rand was &#x2013; commodity costs in South Africa were less extreme than the dollar picture would indicate simply because the rand was relatively strong, and has now come back. So and most of those commodities are bought in ways or in markets which are dollar-linked, or rather, in foreign currency linked.</p>
          <p>There is an embedded price, cost of energy, in most of the commodities we use. Obviously, in agricultural inputs, it's diesel and fertilizer and so on, chemicals. Glass and aluminum are both very heavily energy dependent. Glass linked more directly to the oil price, aluminum through electricity prices. And then there are the elements of our cost base, which are more or less linked at spot to the oil price, and that's diesel. And some of that goes into manufacturing, and a lot of it goes into distribution.</p>
          <p>So to get a picture for all of this is, a simple picture, is very difficult because the input cost pressures take a long time to flow through into final commodity inputs, and they also take a long time to flow out, in effect. I mentioned earlier that aluminum costs are not dropping that much, or certainly in the future they're not dropping too much. Although energy costs have come down, glass conversion costs, or glass bottle manufacturing costs, do seem to be coming down, linked more to the spot price of energy.</p>
          <p>So perhaps there are some advantages there. But for things that are linked to energy at a much longer remove, like typically agricultural commodities, we see the effects playing out with a tremendous time lag. So yeah, I'm waffling a bit, but it's a very difficult picture, it's a very difficult situation to try to summarize satisfactorily, I think.</p>

          <p>Right. Nico, the CapEx for Miller Brewing, which was the first quarter, is actually in our CapEx.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A little bit, yeah, that's right. Yeah, but we didn't move premium prices in South Africa. We moved mainstream prices in South Africa. So there, that gap would have closed a little bit, yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You may remember, Nico, they had a policy before we took over of relatively irregular price increases, big price increases over a long period like once every two or three years. We didn't like that. So we went, we've moved to a, an annual, regular annual price increase. But there's no intension to change that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. And then moving to margins, do you not hedge at all your FX transactional exposure in markets like South Africa, Colombia like your peers do? Relating to the input cost pressures that you buy in dollars? And then is it possible to give us an idea in terms of new fixed cost, i.e. when you will be commissioning breweries and when significant big chunks of fixed costs might be coming into the base in the next year? And would that impact obviously also your margin outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me have a go at that, and I'm sure Graham will jump in. As far as the hedging is concerned, yes, we do. Obviously we hedge all procurement. So as soon as we know what we think we will be using over the period of, as I mentioned earlier, 6 to 24 months depending upon the actual commodity, we would actually hedge, first of all, supply and also where we can, price. So we would do that, but what we don't do is hedge, we can't hedge our translation of the currencies from one country to another. But any transaction, we do hedge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe my question wasn't clear. I understand you hedged the volumes, or you buy the volumes forward. I understand you fixed the price in dollars. Do you then cover the currency converted into rand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Yes, yes we do. We cover the currency. And that is one of the issues on the procurement that was mentioned earlier today about this loss on contracts. What happens is that when you do that, you then have a derivative unless you can hedge account that. And in, some times with procurement where you are buying large chunks in advance and you don't have a specific shipment that you can actually hedge against, you have a general hedge which you can't hedge account. And unfortunately, under IFRS, you have to mark that to market, which is what we had to do at the end of last year, which resulted in a positive.</p>
          <p>And then we &#x2013; it unwound this year when we, when the contract came in and we took the supply into our organization. So it's basically a procurement related foreign exchange contract that we had the loss on. So essentially what it is, it's the &#x2013; it's just coming in at the price that we agreed to buy our goods at. But because we couldn't hedge account it, we had this little profit in one and loss in another. But essentially it's all to do with procurement. And that's why it's not a major issue in the overall scheme of things, and why we're not highlighting a separate amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. But then the comment that you made earlier, Graham, about commodity prices in rand going up a lot more as the rand depreciate, if you do hedge the FX transactional exposure, that impact should be mitigated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. It's &#x2013; once those things start to run out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on your question about whether it was &#x2013; our big cost increases coming along with capacity. In general, no. Where we have a little bit of that happening is in Russia, because we are establishing a new brewery in Ulyanovsk and we have bought the new one in Vladpivo. We think that those will be offset by the improved local availability, and therefore sales in the regional areas of Russia. And also there is a significant offset against long distance haulage costs which have shot up in Russia much more to the levels that you find in the rest of world rather than the heavily subsidized levels that used to prevail there. So there are some offsets there.</p>
          <p>Most of the other expansions have been on-site expansions. So they'd be absorbed in the local on-site costs. And they'd be absorbed by operating leverage. There are three perhaps exceptions to that. There are new breweries contemplated or started in Angola, Tanzania and Mozambique, and each of those will have an increase in fixed cost base associated with them. But in all cases, we would expect that to be spread pretty quickly over local market growth because we expect them to precipitate growth around them. They're all in regions where we don't have breweries right now. And so we expect an up tick in volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on Malcolm's quote, which seems to be haunting you Malcolm, about the margins at the low point in the first half of fiscal '10. Would that imply that if all things stay equal and with the assumptions you had in mind at the time that first half '10 margins will be down from the margins we just saw in this period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, whether it's down or whether it's similar is very difficult to predict. I mean, you're asking me to make predictions with all the moving parts around. I think what I'm trying to give you a sense of is that basically, we should be in the bottom level of the saucer so that our margins may start picking up towards the, after the first half of next year. But as I said, that's all things being equal. Graham has already said that the forward prices of aluminum already seemed to be picking up.</p>
          <p>We know that a lot of capacity that was going to go in for malt processing is now being withheld, including ourselves, where we were going to put down capital expenditure on malt. So we wouldn't expect malt processing costs to start coming off that much, although there is right at the moment, such pressure downwards. So it's very difficult to forecast commodity prices and foreign exchange prices.</p>
          <p>And that's why I said all things being equal, if you look at the cycle, we should be going down still. We have pressures in the second half and they're probably going to continue into the first half. After that, all things being equal, we should start seeing a slight increase from there. But, you're asking me to make a prediction, and I'm sounding a bit woody because that's what predications are like.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the most specific thing I could say is that if we can manage to see net downward drift in raw material costs in the second half of F'10, that would be quite a reasonable accomplishment. That's not a forecast. But if things continue in their current line then, that I think is a reasonable objective to set ourselves. But we're not going to see anything material before then, we don't think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And if the price increases, obviously that's part of the equation. Do you think where &#x2013; I think a lot of the brewers indicated across their whole businesses that they required 4, maybe 4.5%, price increases in Cal. '08 in order to offset their absolute cost, variable cost increase. Do you think they would require a similar, the industry would require a similar amount in 2009 or less?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they need more, Nico. Remember that the dollar is rising and all the other currencies are declining. So the commodity costs expressed in local currencies in the rest of the world, I think &#x2013; you take that into account. Sure, we hedge, and I'm sure everybody hedges their exposure, but those hedges run out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a very quick question. You've been very generous with your time today. Just a theoretical question about global recession conditions and development of economy brands. If you look at the success of your economy segments in Peru, do you see yourselves developing a bigger army of economy brands around the world? And maybe even looking at South Africa regulatory, regulations permitting, introducing something like Eagle to try and offset some of the impacts that the consumer's feeling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Julian, I'm not &#x2013; here, what you see in hard times, in fact what you see is more or less a secular trend around the world actually, is the growth of premium but also the growth of discount. What they call the treat and deal phenomenon. And that kind of plateaus, I think, ultimately. And as you could argue that it sort of plateaud in Western Europe already. The extent to which low price brands succeed depends on a lot of factors.</p>
          <p>It depends, in our research, a lot on how strongly the local populace feels about their local brands, and whether they feel this is a country that produces beer brands that they're proud of. Or whether they prepared to drink cheapies that perhaps come from somewhere else or just got a retailer's name on them, or any of those sort of things. I &#x2013; we are not economy brand. We de-emphasize economy brands. We try not to involve ourselves in them too much around the world.</p>
          <p>By and large, we have moved out of the economy segment in most of our markets. Where we have stayed in the economy segments, it's for very good structural reasons where we need it. We think we need it for route-to-market strength and so on. So we're usually fairly very reluctant participants. In Africa, we have the Eagle and affordability, the Eagle brand and affordability opportunities. And we're exploiting those to some extent. Africa's an extremely poor continent, and we think that that's appropriate.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, you have to have some angle, very inexpensive local raw materials and/or an excise break. Otherwise what you're doing is cannibalizing your major profit. And in Peru, that is exactly what's happened. The cheapies have come in to the market. We've responded, we think, effectively in a commercial sense, but the profit pool has suffered. And it's not something we like to try to encourage.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In South Africa, we have for many, many years, in fact as long as I've been in the company, looked time and again at the prospects for discount brands, and have not gone there. We don't think it's a good place to be. I'd remind you that the price of beer at retail in the hands of the consumer on premise, in South Africa, is still extraordinarily low by world standards. And we think that that's our best armor against any incursion of discount brands or economy brand. The price of a quart in a shebeen's now, even with the double increase, has gone up to 8 rand for a 750, which on today's exchange rate is about US $0.80 for two drinks on premise. That's pretty affordable.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Couple of questions, if you have the stamina. The first is one China, where you have led on pricing. Even though at macro level there are signs that China is coming off the boil, are you confident that robust pricing is now here to stay? Perhaps a comment on competitor reaction would be welcome. And secondly, South Africa, is it right to assume that the slowdown in premium is just a cyclical blip and that the secular drivers are still there, even with a perhaps more redistributive government in power next year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In China, yeah, it's a good question. And the answer is as usual a mixed one. In general, we are holding to our price increase, and that's seems to be, continue to be achievable to keep it in. There are some signs of discounting and, discounting back of that increase by competitors in some parts of the country, although it hasn't got to a worrying level, as yet. And certainly in our strongholds, the pricing is holding. So, so far so good.</p>
          <p>And I think we must take comfort from the fact that we are an efficient producer in China. And perhaps the rather more ragtag collection of competitors would be less efficient than ourselves, so perhaps less able to discount. And obviously, the increases were certainly justified and required against the background of the cost increases.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, that also is a good question. I would say that the drift to premium in South Africa still does have some way to go. And I think it is a secular drift, as you say, and will reassert itself. But, it's gone quite a long way already. In fact, the premium, the proportion of the market made up by premium products in South Africa is relatively high for a country like South Africa, at income levels like South Africa's.</p>
          <p>So I think that to some extent one has to accept that the huge growth in premium over the last, let's say four, five, six years, has been to some extent a function of the very booming economy. And unless we see those boom times again, I'm not sure that we will see that degree of premium drift again, at least not for a while. I'm not sure that a more redistributive or whatever government will change that perceptibly.</p>
