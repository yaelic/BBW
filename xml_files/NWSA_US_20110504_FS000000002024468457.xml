          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the News Corp.'s Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'd now like to turn the conference over to Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, News Corporation. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2011 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer. First we will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter and I'll be happy to take questions first from the financial community and then from the press.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2011, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing.</p>
          <p>Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as adjusted segment operating income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted net income are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of segment operating income and the EPS and net income reconciliation is included in our earnings release.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Dave.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you will have seen in today's earnings release, our results in the third fiscal quarter were led by exceptionally strong performance at our Cable Programming and Television segments. These two segments combined were up 48% compared to the third quarter a year ago. However these results were offset by a very difficult comparison in Film Entertainment related to Avatar's record box office performance a year ago and reduced publishing contributions.</p>
          <p>Our reported results this quarter reflect a one-time $125 million pre-tax charge related to the previously announced litigation settlement involving the company's integrated marketing service business, which is reflected in this quarter's Publishing segment, operating income. After adjusting for this item, we reported total segment operating income of $1.19 billion for the third quarter, 5% below the year-ago quarter's results of $1.25 billion.</p>
          <p>Our share of reported results from our associated companies were down $70 million in the quarter and after adjusting for gains on business dispositions in each year, results were down approximately $80 million. This decline is primarily due to our share of losses from our ESPN STAR Sports joint venture in Asia resulting from their world cricket broadcast as well as from our increased ownership in Sky Deutschland.</p>
          <p>Excluding the net income effects in both years of one-time items, largely this year's litigation settlement charge as well as News Corporation's share of gains by our associates on their business dispositions, third quarter adjusted earnings per share this year is $0.26 compared with the year-ago adjusted result of $0.29. Our press release includes a reconciliation to our GAAP amount. Now I'd like to provide some additional information on a few of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Let's start with our cable networks. This segment continues to drive overall company results generating over 60% of News Corporation's total segment operating income. Third quarter cable segment operating income contributions increased 25% over year-ago levels to $735 million with double digit earnings growth at all our major channels. This growth continues to be top line driven, with segment revenues up 13%. Advertising revenues at the cable networks increased 16% over year-ago levels and affiliate fees grew 12%.</p>
          <p>To illustrate the momentum of this business, I'd like to give you a few highlights. Fox News generated its highest ever operating profit in profit margin in the quarter. We also look forward to continued affiliate revenue growth from affiliate deals to be renewed before the 2012 election. FX now ranks as the number seven most popular cable channel in primetime among 89 basic cable competitors for this March quarter, 18 to 49 ratings, up 20% on average over year-ago levels.</p>
          <p>At our Fox international channels, we now operate the number one and number two ranked pan-regional channels in Latin America under the Fox and National Geographic brand and they are performing well ahead of our plan. In India, where STAR is the leading television network we have already generated 55% more in earnings through the third quarter than we did in all the 12 months of fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>At our Film segment, third quarter operating income was $248 million as compared to the record $497 million we reported a year ago and this is as expected. This decline reflects last year's theatrical box office success of Avatar. As we look forward, the most significant comparison issues related to Avatar's financial success are now behind us, and given Rio's current success at the worldwide box office we anticipate good growth at our Film segment in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter of $192 million increased $152 million, nearly a fourfold increase, driven by a 23% revenue growth at the segment, increased re-trans fees and reduced programming costs at the network. Station revenues increased 8% from a year ago driven by the Super Bowl offset in part by the absence of the BCS broadcast and by reduced political spending. Other telecom and financial advertising were also very strong.</p>
          <p>At the Fox Broadcasting Network, we had a very successful quarter led by the NFL post season, including Super Bowl XLV, a full day of record viewership. We continue to experience a buoyant national ad market, solid ratings from shows like American Idol and Glee and House.</p>
          <p>At Sky Italia, segment operating income declined to $17 million from last year's reported $35 million resulting from higher marketing and installation costs. This investment in the business resulted in an almost 50% increase in gross subscriber additions in the most recent quarter and it's also reduced the year-on-year churn for the past five quarters.</p>
          <p>Revenues declined slightly in local currencies as compared to the prior year's quarter primarily due to lower advertising revenues and an expected decrease in monthly ARPU resulting from our new offerings. Monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged &#x20AC;42, the same as that achievement in the December quarter but down from &#x20AC;44 in the year-ago quarter. And this decrease reflects new subscribers entering at lower price points as well as some migration of existing subscribers among the new package choices.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the overall results to date of the reorganized programming packages. This quarter's gross additions totaled approximately 173,000 versus 118,000 a year ago. This improvement combined with a reduction in churn netted SKY Italia 45,000 additional subscribers versus a loss of 39,000 subscribers in the year-ago quarter. And SKY ended the quarter with 4.9 million subscribers, which is its highest level that it's achieved to date.</p>
          <p>In our Publishing segment, segment operating income of $161 million decreased $82 million from last year's third quarter when excluding this year's litigation settlement. This reduction largely reflects advertising revenue declines at our Australian and United Kingdom newspapers, start-up costs for The Daily, increased newsprint cost and reduced contributions from the Integrated Marketing Service business. The quarter was also affected by the absence of Dow Jones Index business, which was sold last March.</p>
          <p>And, finally, before I turn the call over to Chase, I'd like to address our guidance for fiscal 2011, and as a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding for fiscal 2010 the $500 million litigation charge resulting in a base of $4.46 billion and segment operating income for comparative purposes. Similarly, we are excluding from fiscal 2011 the $125 million litigation charge.</p>
          <p>In early February we reiterated guidance that expected our segment operating income growth rate for fiscal 2011 to be in the low double-digit range, above the $4.46 billion fiscal 2000 adjusted result, and based on all the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are maintaining our operating segment income guidance for fiscal 2011 to be at a growth rate range in low double digits above the fiscal 2010 adjusted result. Given our earnings performance through March, you will infer that we are anticipating strong earnings growth in our fourth fiscal quarter and we are. And now with only two months to go we feel very confident in achieving this growth rate.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Chase for some additional comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. In many ways our third quarter was similar to our second quarter. Our results were driven by strong performance in our television businesses including U.S. and International Cable Networks, our Broadcast Network and our TV stations. Our international satellite platforms continue to focus on growth and strengthening their competitive position.</p>
          <p>As Dave said, this was the last quarter of the Film business where we will face the difficult Avatar comps in a material way and we're excited about the upcoming releases. We're on course to address MySpace through a strategic transaction and are moving forward with an array of digital initiatives from The Daily to digital versions of our newspapers, to authentication, and to premium VOD. Overall, this quarter, solid progress.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we're now truly poised to take our business to much higher levels of profitability over the next one to two years. Our U.S. channels, both cable and broadcast, will clearly be one driving force in that growth. At Fox News, we will have completed our newest round of carriage agreements with slightly over half sub-universe by the summer of 2012 with new rates that reflect its increased importance in the market. FX has just completed its highest rated quarter ever and is poised to build on that growth through increased advertising and affiliate revenues. The Fox Broadcast Network American Idol has truly found a second life with the renewed level of energy and excitement which when paired to the X Factor in fiscal 2012, given it's an unrivaled one-two punch, and frankly, allows us to plan the business with much greater confidence.</p>
          <p>We're making good progress with our stations and affiliates in retransmission, although we still have issues to work through. On the ONO side, we plan to have re-trans agreements with well over half the households by the end of this calendar year. In fact, we look to have agreements in place with over 80% of that universe by the end of calendar 2012. Additionally, by the end of fiscal 2012, we expect to have new affiliation agreements in place with over two-thirds of our affiliate universe measured by household numbers, generating appropriate compensation for us for the value Fox delivers in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>The upfront ad-markets, for both cable and broadcast, seem well positioned for truly strong results with scatter continuing to sell at big premiums to last year's upfront. The U.S. local ad market is facing tougher comps from a year-ago and the Japan tragedy is having an impact on short-term local ad spending. Q3 spending was up a bit and this quarter, the quarter ending June, looks to be low to mid single digits.</p>
          <p>Our international channels are expected to register growth rates that will likely equal or exceed those in the U.S. This growth will be across the board but particularly strong in markets like South America, India and Southeast Asia. We have competitive strengths we can build on to drive this growth for years to come.</p>
          <p>In our content businesses at Fox, I noted earlier that we're ending a series of quarters with difficult comps in our Film business and look forward to some exciting upcoming releases. Rio will soon cross over $400 million in the worldwide box office. We feel very good about our upcoming summer films, X-Men: First Class, Mr. Popper's Penguins and our Planet of the Apes prequel.</p>
          <p>Our TV Studio continues to be an industry leader and we're taking advantage of new competition from Netflix and other emerging platforms, which are creating a new and incremental source of revenue for library rights to our shows. At the same time, we're focused in ensuring we protect the currency and the value of our series and on maintaining flexibility to address this evolving market.</p>
          <p>Our satellite platforms all have a renewed sense of growth. I don't want to say much ahead of Sky Deutschland's own quarterly release, however, we feel great about the real momentum and sub growth and overall platform development in the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>Italy has also continued to show renewed strength in sub growth and is in the strongest competitive position it has been in for two years. Our technology content and service have all added new dimensions. For example, last month we concluded an exclusive agreement for rights to the European Champions League.</p>
          <p>Subscriber growth has been our clear priority, and this has required us to invest in marketing, consumer offers and technology, which has impacted current profits. However, we believe it is critical to position ourselves for long-term financial growth and leadership. In support of these objectives, we expect Sky Italia to cross the 5 million sub threshold this summer.</p>
          <p>We know that we have some headwinds to navigate like advertising slowdowns in the Publishing segment and start-up costs in places like The Daily, but we feel very good overall about our business and geographic mix and are really excited about our growth prospects over the next couple of quarters. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Operator, we'd like to now go to the Q&amp;A session with the analyst investors.</p>
        </plist>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question will come from the line of Alan Gould, Evercore Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Chase, could you just update us on any news on the BSkyB deal, when we should hear from Mr. Hunt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we're &#x2013; I mean, our focus right off &#x2013; I'll address it briefly. I'm not going to handicap the regulatory timing. I think it will be soon. But that really does &#x2013; our focus continues to be on completing the regulatory process and that is where our focus. However, I guess that will say what I said recently the movement in the Sky stock price is clearly troubling. The Sky stock was trading between &#xA3;5 and &#xA3;6 before we made our offer and that already represented a significant premium to its pure cable and satellite distributors, largely because Sky was expected to continue to generate very good results. And to their credit, Sky management has generated good results since then. However those results are really essentially in line with not only our expectations, but analyst expectations.</p>
          <p>I mean these results validate the premiums Sky was trading at last summer but not a whole new premium on top of the pre-existing premium. Because I also want to note there seems to be unrealistically rosy view of the challenges Sky must now navigate going forward. Sky management is second to none. However, the business is certain to face pressures and demands from emerging technologies, competition and the overall economy and many other places that Sky will have to navigate. Therefore, I want to reiterate one more time that we'll be very disciplined about this process and we will pursue other options for that capital if we can't reach a reasonable deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Adam Alexander, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Chase, could you maybe just elaborate what would be plan B if the Sky share price continues to run ahead of where it is? And just on Sky Italia, the business seems to have gotten a lot of momentum in terms of sub-additions but we're not really seeing financial results come through. Can you just update us on where you think that ARPU might settle? And maybe a little bit more color on the current operating environment in Italy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean in the U.K., I'm not going to get into hypotheticals. Again, our focus is getting this through the regulatory process and trying to conclude a deal. We'd like to conclude a deal if we can reach a reasonable deal. So I'm not going to get into hypotheticals about options at this point.</p>
          <p>In terms of Italy, if you want growth, you've got to invest in growth. I've sort of lived this firsthand in other places. And when you're adding subscribers, you're investing in marketing, you're investing in offers. Clearly, we're going through a process. Dave touched on it where we modified offers last year to have more competitive offers to give us really long-term strength in the marketplace. There's a settling-through process both with existing and new customers in terms of that. I think as you get into &#x2013; as we get later into this year, we sort of get through that settling process. But &#x2013; yes &#x2013; I think it does require investment on all those fronts including technology. We're putting more technology in the homes. We feel very good about the ability to create a set of program packages and services, DVRs, HD and the like, that will have good solid real long-term growth and that really is our focus at this point.</p>
          <p>Strategy strengthening, the programming offers I mentioned the Champions League, which we're taking exclusive rights to. Our focus is really about creating a competitive strength, unique strength in the marketplace that lets us drive all these metrics forward from a position of real leadership. We obviously have that leadership today. We think this is a time to invest and solidify and build on that leadership position to enable us to give us the platform for long-term growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen, Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two questions for Chase. Chase, you mentioned that Fox News, half the universe will be &#x2013; the deal complete by the summer of 2012. Is that between now and 2012? And what kind of increase should we be thinking about? I mean, the last go around was triple. Can pay TV be up or even stomach that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I'm not going to advertise what we're looking to achieve. First timeframe wise. Yes, I was talking about &#x2013; I think it was slightly over half our universe by next summer. So it's coming up in that timeframe. It's not all out next summer but that's when this sort of half that I referred to comes up.</p>
          <p>Look, I think we feel we're warranted an increase that reflects the strength of Fox News. I've said before, I think Fox News is a channel that is probably today second to ESPN in terms of importance and clout in the marketplace. 2012, we also happening to be heading into a thing called an election. And that probably adds a bit of energy to it. So I think we're going to try and be. I think when we've dealt with these issues whether it's on any of our channels, I think we try to look for something that we think is fair and reflects the value of that marketplace.</p>
          <p>I think with Fox News we've created a channel that is due an appropriate increase given its strength in the marketplace. And here we're cognizant certainly about pressures in terms of the market and the programming costs and the consumer and the like. But, equally we think that it is important that we get fair compensation for our content. I mean if you look at this as still a very healthy segment on all levels. Some of that you've just seen again in the last couple of days, but I'm not going to put out publicly what &#x2013; I think negotiations should be handled in private. So I'm not going to put out what we're.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But something that has been a little more public has been like the re-trans. So you kind of laid out how much of the footprint of the U.S. is coming up over the next year or so. Can you just maybe give us a range of how meaningful a contribution from re-trans and reverse comp we should be looking for in fiscal '12 and again in fiscal '13? What's the incremental increase that we should be bearing in mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've been pretty clear. Then again, these sorts of things I think are private negotiations. It's important to us. We view it as &#x2013; we want to create a real dual revenue stream. And have compensation that on the subscription side that begins to reflect the value of the Fox Network. In reality, if you look at competitive rates it's higher than anything we'd be asking.</p>
          <p>But it's an important and significant major source of revenue. But I don't think we're going to get down to what the specific rates are again. I'll reiterate what I said before, we said the broadcast business and I really do think in many ways it's business between the stations and network. We'll be $1 billion plus business in the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Chase, I wonder if you can provide some operating metrics at The Daily and more broadly, what the experience at The Daily is telling you about the potential of the tablet market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think The Daily, I'm not going to give a whole lot because just I think in the quarter &#x2013; on financials I mean &#x2013; I think in the quarter we lost about $10 million on The Daily. It's real early days for The Daily.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's very early days. We're making progress. It's only a month plus that it's been pay based. It actually is one of the most downloaded news apps out there. But it's a work in progress. I think we know that.</p>
          <p>We're improving the technology. We're refining the content and the tablet market is still in its infancy. If you look at any of the numbers, the tablet universe today versus numbers people have out there for the end of this calendar year or the end of the following calendar year is a small fraction of what that will be. So I think on all fronts whether it's on The Daily itself or the tablet market and how it evolves I think it's pretty early days on all those fronts.</p>

          <p>Sorry, I have two. One for Dave and one for Chase. Dave, I just wonder if you look at your operating profit with the studio, your down $500 million or so year-to-date. Can you give us a sense of what percent or what part of that decline is from Avatar? Or is there any other thing that's dragging you down year-over-year that may be more than Avatar?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the quarter almost the entire decrease is related to Avatar.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So some people look at it &#x2013; okay. Then, Chase, question for you. What would be year-to-date, you're up double digits in affiliates' fees domestically. While you don't want to talk about what Fox News is worth, the question would be is can you grow double digits including fees the next couple of years based on the deals you're doing and the deals that are to come. So is double digits a fair level of growth for affiliate fees domestically?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, again, I'd probably say when you look at what we have coming up in terms of affiliate negotiations, we expect it to be an area of real solid growth for us going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A couple questions, one just on sports. You signed the Pac-12 deal, just broadly not just including News Corp., but it just seems like sports costs and what people are willing to pay for league RF and team RF is really spiraling to all new levels. I mean, even hockey which I think ratings are pretty horrible and got over $200 million dollars a year from Comcast NBC. I guess the broader question is how do you think about sports? How does the Pac-12 fit in with losing the Lakers for you? And do you worry about what the ending impact of all of this is going to be on the actual consumer who's got to pay for all of these sports channels that are being created by teams, leagues and other?</p>
          <p>And then just a broader question for Dave on the balance sheet. You've got I think almost $12 billion of cash now. If for any reason BSkyB doesn't happen, is a tender something you would seriously consider? It just seems like you've got tremendous capacity with the cash sitting there and cash flow building. Just would love to know, like, how long you plan to sit on $12 billion of cash if you decide to move on from BSkyB for whatever reason. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of sports, sports, it clearly is a double-edged sword. It's certainly the costs are a challenge and we're very cognizant of it. I think the flip side is the value of sports is unique and probably becomes more unique in an era of fragmentation and DVRs and other technologies and the passionate interest in sports continually distinguishes it from other things. I think we believe and have proven around the world with sports rights that we've been able to navigate these costs and generate real value. Sports has certainly been a big part of our growth story and we have really in all our territories and regions and have been a major part of building our businesses. We're obviously not ignorant of the costs but I think as we look at it, we look at &#x2013; and I think what is important for us. I mean you touched on the regionals, the nationals, the network.</p>
          <p>If we have the appropriate vehicles internationally become the platforms as well and all these sports rights that we have the appropriate vehicles to use these sports to build value and build our businesses. But I think these &#x2013; I think truly event sports, as I said, really are becoming more and more unique and probably more important than ever. I think what you do need to make sure is we've got enough vehicles to figure out how do we build value around these sorts of franchises. I think we, I guess I'd contend we've got a pretty good track record proving we can do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Rich, just on the balance sheet obviously we're not going to sit on $12 billion regardless of the extent that we're not going do a BSkyB transaction. We have a lot of I think options as to what we would do with it. I think we'll face it when we get there, if we get there. We're certainly not going sit on $12 billion and have the inefficient use of our capital structure that would affect. Just, I think this was Michael's question with respect to the film company. One other major thing during the &#x2013; this is in the year &#x2013; for the year that would affect the film numbers is we had Ice Age last year which is a significant profit contributor which we don't have in the current year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking the question. In the context of the affiliate renewal deals that you just alluded to, Chase, when you talk to your distribution partners, are you calling out separate authentication rights, also iPad streaming rights? I'm just kind of wondering how confident that you are that you will be paid for these rights. And I think you guys also have a unique position with The Daily. So I'm just kind of wondering, do you feel that the iPad rights are embedded on the Entertainment side? Is there any distinction you make between the news and the entertainment when you think about those rights and the value that they may have to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd say, I think in general, authentication, it's a good thing. And I think part of &#x2013; I can't remember which one of the questions &#x2013; a couple of the questions addressed the issue of increased cost of content or increased cost of programming, but one of the ways you deal with that vis-&#xE0;-vis a consumer is to give the consumer increased value and give them a new experience. And I think the ability to access this product again in the proverbial where you want, when you want, how you want, multiple screens, is a good thing. So I think we are looking to work with distributors to provide this richer experience.</p>
          <p>I think there's sort of two fronts, a richer experience in the home and then the richer experience out of the home. I think they're all going to be part of these discussions. I think we &#x2013; and we are looking, and certainly I think in the home is probably the primary focus. We're looking to work with distributors to provide that richer in home experience. And I think there was recently an announcement about us expanding with Comcast, as an example, the VOD experience. And we think that's an important part of us.</p>
          <p>Again, while we have tough negotiations, I think together we need to continue to figure out, we continue to make some good experience for consumers and do our part to provide a richer and better experience and ways consumers can have new features and new functionality and things that excite them. And I think directionally that is where we'd like to go.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can ask a quick follow-up on the NFL situation. Just kind of wanted to get your view on that and how this might play into the upfront dynamics. And I think recently you alluded to some kind of mitigation plan that you guys have in place should there not be a season. I was wondering if you can also perhaps share some of that with us. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our real hope is level heads prevail and this issue gets resolved. So I think that's our hope and I think that's what initially people will move forward with the expectation things will get resolved. Obviously, as they go along we'll have to deal with it. I think we try &#x2013; I mean for us it's the afternoon, so it's not like we're preempting primetime, so it doesn't &#x2013; the afternoon is fairly discrete. I think we'd try to mitigate it. In reality, there aren't a lot of NFLs around, so you could do some other things. There's nothing &#x2013; one of the reasons why it is what it is, is because there isn't anything to &#x2013; if there were something to slug in its place, you'd have a pretty different world, but there isn't. So I think as you move forward, we'd try to, due to whether to mitigate sort of the content or mitigate in terms of where those advertisers who want to reach an audience, how do they reach that audience.</p>
          <p>I think it will be &#x2013; but I think it will &#x2013; there'll be limits to how far you can go. We'd certainly work constructively with everybody to deal with it. I think it will be equally complicated because you're going to always have a fairly short-term time horizon to not know how long does this go on and when could it get resolved. So I think we've obviously talked about ways we can mitigate on an array of fronts. But I think we'll have to play this out as it goes. And again our real hope would be logic prevails and everybody recognizes the best thing for everybody is to get this done, get the deal done.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Fox is in a pretty unique position relative to most of even the media conglomerates in the world right now in that there's a tremendous amount of television content that arguably you could exploit in the same sort of tonnage deals, like CBS has done and to a certain extent Disney. Can you talk about what your strategy is with respect to the content that's arguably been pretty exploited? And you could kind of do these tonnage deals and just pick up a bunch of sort of free money. What is your view of those deals that have gone on...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Big parts of libraries that are have been relatively well exploited but there's still a market in the online and the distribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean like the Netflix deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think in many ways libraries have been under-exploited. I mean it's probably one of the positives about Netflix realistically. And we'd like to see more of these and I think the digital world will create more of these. Our library product has been an under-exploited asset. I think Netflix is actually going to provide some truly incremental value for libraries where you actually have product that probably &#x2013; if there hadn't really been a viable market for it, all of the sudden there is a market for it. I think as more of these digital platforms arise in different shapes and forms. I think it is &#x2013; I think it provides an opportunity to capture real value off of a unique product that just didn't have appropriate outlets for it.</p>
          <p>I think it's one of the reasons why I think we're participating in that. We have a pretty clearly defined view of what we think &#x2013; what is the type of product and at what point should we sell it. I think what is the type of product and rights that we need to protect that should be sold. What should be sold in one place and what should be sold in a different place. And I think equally when we do these deals, we want to make sure we maintain flexibility and control over our long-term destiny and we're not doing deals that lock us into something we can regret.</p>
          <p>And so I think our priorities has been to try to take advantage if we can get fair value. If we can't value for value, we're not going to do it. But be disciplined about our rights, take advantage of these emerging distribution platforms that are largely digital and make sure we maintain flexibility and control as these markets evolve. Because I think they will evolve and I think you'll have new and different opportunities. So I think &#x2013; it pays to be &#x2013; to not grab a quick buck, that may look like a quick buck today and not be quite as attractive a buck literally 12 to 18 months later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think we could expect you guys to be able to do a deal like we've seen from CBS or like we've seen from Disney with the expectation that it would be fairly not disruptive to all the other economics you're enjoying for your content? Sorry, just a quick follow up. What has stopped you so far from doing those kinds of deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've actually done some deals. So it's not &#x2013; we have. And again, that's what I was saying. I think we feel it's very important to try to clearly define the line between current &#x2013; and if the current product and library product and we have a clear view on where that line exists. I think equally we recognize that there's product that may end up being and I think increasingly, this will be the case with fit product that only goes one place or the other, not both. You'll end up finding important product that is bought and in some ways some of these digital platforms are competing with sort of the more established linear platforms for rights as opposed to existing in both and they exist in one place or the other.</p>
          <p>I think it's why I talked about flexibility and discipline. But we have &#x2013; we certainly have had done deals. I wouldn't call them tonnage deals. I think they're deals, which we can take advantage of the opportunity and certainly real revenue to us. But again, I think by adhering to a set of views that, as you said, protect and certainly recognize that we have networks and unique content that we need to manage and have ways that it distinguishes itself in the marketplace. Distinguishes itself with unique content. Distinguishes itself with unique rights. Whether that's on a network side or a content side or a digital platform side.</p>

You mentioned that U.K. newspaper advertising and Sky Italia advertising revenue were both down year-on-year. And then second, a broader question. When you look at your pay-TV platforms in Europe, do you feel they have the sets of rights to prevent online video interlopers eroding your content advantage in terms of U.S. movies and U.S. TV series being distributed in Europe?

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, in the U.K. Our advertising is down around mid-single digits in the quarter and the markets are a little bit soft.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in Italy, we clearly have some &#x2013; the economy's tough there but there's some headwinds on the ad side in the Italian marketplace as well. I think in terms of the digital rights and the like, in some ways one of the benefits of these being emerging platforms is you really plan your business knowing those things are there. And I think in many ways, we look at them as a part of the mix, a part of the way of being a player in those things, not sort of viewing ourselves within a sort of limited four walls, but being smart and intelligent. And it is in some ways the benefit so in places like Italy, Germany, what have you.</p>
          <p>We're still in the early stages of growth in those marketplaces, and so it gives us the opportunity to plan and look at our business in a way that doesn't look at it in too limiting a way. And I think in some ways to their credit, Sky in the U.K. has done a good job of proving that they're going to take advantage of emerging technologies to continue to develop and build their business. And I think to their credit, Sky U.K. has done a really good job of building upon these emerging technologies. And these newer platforms in Germany and Italy, certainly our plans would be to continue to do that, to take advantage of these things. And I think we've already announced some things in those markets that will take advantage of it.</p>

And then maybe lastly, Chase, there was &#x2013; the recent Hawaii Five-0 deal that TNT syndicated was reported to have rights &#x2013; basically a block of Netflix-like services for that show while it was in the syndication which I think was going to go out for many years. Just wondering, as a buyer of syndicated content, for example like in FX, if you think that that type of a transaction makes sense, if it's important, worth paying up for, for that kind of exclusivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean as a buyer on the FX side, I would increasingly certainly look at FX as, and I may later, as I think about it, it's a competing network, whether it's competing with HBO, competing within an FX or &#x2013; and I think if you're buying &#x2013; if you're looking at premium property, I mean I think exclusivity matters, and I think it's critical. So I think it will become very much a part of the mix as channels go forward. And if you have something that &#x2013; if you're going out to unique properties that are going to be a part of defining your network and distinguishing your network, I think controlling all those rights and getting exclusivity I think will be critically important, and certainly for us at FX. It's been a part of our strategy already in place and we have been &#x2013; as we've been acquiring rights, if we're acquiring key rights, we're acquiring rights to control the Netflix-type rights, so we're not competing against them. So that point is &#x2013; so not only is it important, we've in fact been doing it on rights we acquire that are key properties.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask if you could address a report about potential interest at News in joining a consortium to bid for Formula 1. And even if you can't address that particular thing, just talk more generally about the question of ownership of sports given the escalating cost of sports rights and the importance of that on TV. Does it make sense to think about going back to a day where you own more leagues, own more teams as a way to protect your television properties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Formula 1 specifically, there's not really a lot. You're going to add to what we said, I think as we did say, it's really at an exploratory stage, it's not clear where it goes. We're talking about forming a consortium. So clearly it is very early days. I won't repeat too much, but I think a few minutes ago talked about essentially the importance of value of sports rights and recognize certainly the complexities that come with costs. I think it's difficult to make a leap and say that because of dealing with the costs that you want to try and be in an ownership role. I think you sort of got to deal with each one of those on &#x2013; deal with each situation on its own merits. I mean there are obviously places certainly in the U.S. where you've got 32 NFL teams or colleges you're not going to acquire that it obviously is just not realistic from the get go.</p>
          <p>But I think you want to be &#x2013; this world is certainly continuing to change and evolve. I think you want to be innovative and open-minded about ways to try to deal with key unique rights. And I don't think that rules anything out but I don't think you can sort of have a one-size fits all strategy and say that you're going to pursue things, pursue everything this way or that way. I think you sort of have to deal with each opportunity on its own merits and make a judgment about what's the best way forward.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's actually James Dix for Max. Just two questions, you basically reaffirmed now your guidance at the beginning of the year for operating income growth, just wanted to know whether there are any variations in terms of how the segments are tracking for the year, any ones which seem to be standing out of your expectations. Particularly interested in your view on Cable. And then secondly just following up on the sports topic, do you think strategically you have an advantage in going after sports or being flexible in how you go after them by having both Broadcast and Cable networks in the U.S.? Or do you think that's &#x2013; it would be just as easy for competitors to build a consortium, split up games, for example, like how Turner did with CBS? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a guidance we're expecting &#x2013; I mean, Cable is just continuing to grow as it has all year. It's doing great. We're expecting a strong fourth quarter out of both FBC and our television stations. As I said before both Film and the Television Production business are going to have a good fourth quarter, and you'll see Sky Italia rebound in the fourth quarter as well. So there's not &#x2013; I wouldn't say there's any significant changes from how the business has been operating. And for that matter, you'll see Publishing which had a down quarter for a variety of reasons partly because, as I mentioned, because of the American marketing, partly because of the weakness in Australia and our bids in Australia. But you will see that rebound in the fourth quarter so the business is looking very strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think in terms of sports and having I guess a network or multiple &#x2013; I think having multiple outlets is critically important. I think the fact that we have in this country buckets, networks, cable networks, regional networks. I think it's instrumentally important  as you look at a franchise. There are differing components of it. Digital obviously is going to become a part of that channel, increasingly a part of that too. Internationally as I said we've got unique dimensions to our businesses there. But I think having those platforms gives you an ability to take rights that may have different ways to be exploited in each one of those and make sure you can maximize both the value for us, achieve the things these sports leagues, teams, conferences want to achieve. So yes, I think without question having a breadth of outlets and expertise is tremendously important to being able to maximize the value of these key sports rights.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Two quick questions, one, as you head into the upfront this year, can you talk about how you approach a new program like the X Factor that has the potential I think to be a big hit? And how do you sell that? Do you hold some of that back? How can you leverage &#x2013; I would think you would hope to be an American Idol type of product given that you don't have much insight into the ratings on it yet. And then second just over at Publishing, can you talk about how much of the weakness in Australia may have been weather-related? Do you have any indication of what that is, if any of it is kind of maybe more one-time in nature? That would be helpful. Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's really difficult. I mean, listen, there's no question we were affected particularly in the Brisbane and Queensland area by this. It's very hard for us to quantify. I think we're more affected by the slowdown in the economy particularly in the retail trade. It's hurt the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think in terms of X Factor, we're very excited about X Factor. You can be assured we will have very unique strategies on how to sell and maximize that. Typically, we don't share those publicly. I think those are the types of things we plan to keep to ourselves and use to our advantage. But we're excited about having it and we believe we can do some very exciting things with it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning gentlemen. Chase, I just wanted to ask a question about events of recent days. I mean what's the News Corporation outlook both financially and also I guess editorially given the killing of Osama bin Laden? Does that change News Corp.'s view of the world, I suppose especially given the resilience of the Fox News Channel over the past 10 years?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>I don't think it's &#x2013; it sold a lot more papers and certainly created events that people, were tremendously important to people and I think gave everybody appropriately a lift. But I think if you're talking sort of really the challenges and issues, the economy and sovereign debt, the macroeconomic issues that out there in the world I don't think that, maybe it's tough to say that event leads to a differing view about what are the risk challenges of what's the future look like in these economies.</p>

          <p>Hi, Chase. Wanted to ask if you have any reaction to the National Association of Theater Owners asking that you guys release premium VOD sales data and was wondering how you guys think about how you will evaluate the success of premium VOD. What timeframe do you envision to figure out whether that's something that works? And how will you evaluate the success?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a task where we're in the very early stages. We had one small film. I don't know that I've got a specific set of here's the point and time that we make a judgment about it. I think in some ways it's obviously, and I understand there's concerns about it. Look, the theatrical market is a very important market us to. It is essentially the market that sets the pace for our film industry. And we don't, there's an opportunity for some films, certainly as like all films for us to create a window as appropriate for a segment. We don't think it's a big segment. I think in some ways I think part of what we're trying to do is set a value for our product as it moves down the chain.</p>
          <p>I mean I do think one of the fundamental problems we've got out there is sort of the fact that we ended up with $1 rentals five or six months after theatrical release and that's our product. That does not, that doesn't work. That undervalues our product to an extent that makes no sense. So we've got to build appropriate values and windows into our business but certainly the theatrical business is second to none in importance to us. And I think we're going to go forward &#x2013; we're going forward with this carefully and we'll judge it as we get some data and get some experiences. But I don't have a point in time, date in time or formula by which we're plugging it in to judge it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chase. Wondered if you could talk a little bit about your digital publishing strategy right now and whether you're looking at doing more along the lines of The Daily, taking it outside of the U.S. And what other areas you're looking at in terms of converting some of your properties to pay online properties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, what I hope and I expect as we go through the budget process now like every one of our &#x2013; realistically every one of our franchises should have a digital extension to their business. I mean that's the world we're in. So whether it's news, sports or entertainment or sort of what's traditionally video or print. And obviously in some of these &#x2013; those things blend together and become a multi-media, largely, in many ways, become a multi-media product. We've got to be developing extensions for all those, in all those places. And so I think in every one, and obviously to some degree every one of them is doing some version of it today. Some of it's a more straightforward, like the Times or the Post that are putting a &#x2013; creating an iPad version of their printed product and in some places it will be product that is can be more expanded and tailored to the digital world and take advantage of interactivity. And again the ability to more &#x2013; put together multiple experiences in sort of The Daily is pushing towards it integrating new technologies and 360 video and moving video inside a printed product.</p>
          <p>But each and every one of our businesses has to be, figure out how do they create those &#x2013; how do they participate, and sometimes it's working with others in terms of their digital sites, in many ways it's developing our own extensions digitally, of our brands, content and franchises.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're like &#x2013; we're about a month into this. In many ways, we're not going to build this in a fish bowl. I mean I think we recognize that it's a work in progress, it's an experiment in many ways in terms of developing and finding what consumers like and what things really work and how do we improve it. But we're not going to &#x2013; I think that's sort of detailed information is not something that we're going to share public &#x2013; we're going to be putting out publicly at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Along those lines, maybe this isn't that detailed, could you say whether you see that people are preferring to pay weekly or are they preferring an annual subscription?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In many ways, I mean part of this is sort of working through on a lot of these platforms where they're still trying to figure out the subscription process. So there's a lot of moving parts here that end up being &#x2013; part of what you've got is so many digital platforms and like the tablets are obviously &#x2013; in many ways they're in their infancy. So it's more complicated than that because you sort of got a good deal of not only what you want to do but what can the market handle and what are the various players the markets say they're capable of doing. So there are a lot of moving parts to this and I think it will be a different business a year from now and two years from now it will be a very different business than it was a year earlier. So it's going to continue to evolve.</p>
