          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Emerson Third Quarter Fiscal 2009 Results Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 4, 2009.</p>
          <p>Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available in Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>In this call, Emerson's management will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is contained within a presentation that is posted in the Investor Relations area of Emerson's website at www.emerson.com.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand the call over to Ms. Lynne Maxeiner. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Larissa. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Emerson, and Walter Galvin, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2009 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation.</p>
          <p>Third quarter sales were down 22% to 5.1 billion, and underlying sales declined 19%. Sales in the third quarter were flat sequentially with second quarter. Our operating cash flow was 916 million and free cash flow was 800 million. Our free cash flow to net earnings conversion was 206% in this quarter. Operating profit margin of 14.7%, up 60 basis points sequentially from second quarter on flat sales. Pre-tax earnings margin was 10.7%, adversely impacted by restructuring expense of 83 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We have been aggressively restructuring and expect 280 to 300 million in restructuring expense in FY '09. There was a negative $0.05 impact on the third quarter year-over-year earnings per share comparison due to the increase in restructuring. Earnings per share was $0.51 for the third quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we've aggressively reduced inventory. Our operational inventory was reduced over 275 million from second quarter '09. This will strongly position us when the cycle turns positive.</p>
          <p>Slide three, the P&amp;L. Again, sales down 22% to 5.091 billion. Underlying sales, down 19% &#x2013; currency subtracted four points and acquisitions added one point. Operating profit in the quarter of 749 million, or 14.7% of sales, with the de-leverage on lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix and aggressive inventory reductions as main drivers of the decline. We did see a sequential margin improvement of 60 basis points on flat sales versus the second quarter. Net earnings of 387 million in the quarter, diluted average shares in the quarter of 754.7 million, no shares were repurchased in third quarter '09, which gets you to the EPS of $0.51.</p>
          <p>Slide four, underlying sales by geography. In the U.S., sales declined 23%. Total international was down 19%, driven by a weak Europe that was down 25%, Latin America down 15, and Middle East/Africa, down 13%. Asia was down 5%, which includes China, which was down 2% in the quarter. The total underlying sales were down 19%. Currency subtracted four points and acquisitions added one point, which gets you to our consolidated sales of down 22%. Given that emerging markets continue to outperform the mature markets, they could represent 32 to 33% of Emerson's fiscal year '09 sales, and they will recover faster versus the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Next slide, more income statement detail. Gross profit of 1.838 billion, or 36.1% of sales, the decline driven by volume de-leverage, unfavorable mix and our lowered production levels that drove our inventory reductions, which was partially offset by cost reductions. SG&amp;A of 21.4% getting you to an operating profit of 749 million or 14.7% of sales. Other deductions of 141 million, which includes a $59 million increase in restructuring. Interest expense of 64 million, getting you to the pre-tax earnings of 544 million or 10.7% of sales. Taxes of 157 million in the quarter include a net operating loss benefit and an additional credit from the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 28.6%, and the full-year tax rate is expected to be approximately 30%.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow, up 11% in the quarter to 916 million. CapEx was down 25% to 116 million, getting you to our strong free cash flow of 800 million, up 19%. Our free cash flow conversion was 206% in Q3 and 110% for the first nine months of our fiscal year. We reduced our inventory balance 200 million sequentially from March 31, '09 and more than 400 million from December 31, '08. Sequentially, since the second quarter, we reduced operational inventory 275 million. Currency and acquisitions added back 75 million, getting you to the net inventory change of approximately 200 million.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, the business segment P&amp;L. Business segment EBIT of 637 million, or 12.1% of sales. The decline driven by volume de-leverage, negative mix and increased restructuring. We did see a sequential improvement in EBIT margin of 90 basis points on flat sales versus second quarter.</p>
          <p>Difference in accounting methods of 48 million, corporate and other of 77 million, an improvement of 44 million, driven by lower incentive comp, 12 million, lower commodity mark-to-market losses of 10 million and a one-time gain of 6 million. Interest expense of 64 million, up 18 million. As we've communicated, we did issue long-term debt in January and April, which gets you to the pre-tax earnings of 544 million.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, we'll go through the individual business segments. First, Process Management. Sales in the quarter down 13% to 1.505 billion. Underlying sales were down 9%, currency subtracted seven points and acquisitions added three points. By region, the U.S. was down 18%, Asia was up 3%, Europe down 3%, and Middle East/Africa down 5%. The end markets for Process Management remain mixed, but we believe the long-term demand for energy will drive capacity expansions and facility upgrades.</p>
          <p>EBIT margin dollars of 222 million, or 14.8% of sales, the decline driven by de-leverage on lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix, with the Measurement and Flow product declines greater than System declines due to the backlog. We also had higher restructuring of $14 million in the quarter. All of our business segments have been aggressively working to reduce inventory, and at Process Management we reduced inventory by approximately 50 million over the last 12 months and about 70 million since the end of March. We believe certain industry segments such as power will continue to provide areas for growth during this downturn.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Industrial Automation. Sales in the quarter of 813 million, down 36%. Underlying sales were down 34%, currency subtracted five points, and acquisitions added three points. By geography, the U.S. was down 36%, Europe was down 37%, and Asia was down 19%. EBIT dollars of 41 million or 5% of sales, heavily impacted by volume de-leverage.</p>
          <p>Industrial Automation also aggressively reduced inventory by approximately 150 million from third quarter '08, impacting margins negatively. There was also higher restructuring expense of 8 million in the quarter. We have seen significant order declines in the power generating alternator business. The G7 gross fixed investment is expected to remain negative through the first half of fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, Network Power. Sales in the quarter of 1.306 billion, down 22%. Underlying sales were down 15%, currency subtracted four points and acquisitions subtracted three points. By region, the U.S. was down 23%, Asia was flat and Europe was down 30%. We saw broad declines across the uninterruptible power supply, precision cooling and embedded power businesses.</p>
          <p>EBIT dollars of 135 million, or 10.3% of sales, negatively impacted by volume de-leverage and negative acquisition impact, which was partially offset by cost reductions and a decrease in inventory of approximately 120 million from third quarter '08, also increased restructuring of 24 million. Excluding restructuring, EBIT margins were 12.7%. We also saw a sequential margin improvement of 210 basis points from second quarter '09. We have seen stability in the three-month trailing underlying order trends for the last six months. We have been aggressively restructuring the business to continue to reposition the cost base.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Climate Technologies. Sales in the quarter of 859 million, down 21%, with underlying sales down 20%, currency subtracting three points and acquisitions adding two points. By geography, the U.S. was down 16%, Europe was down 30% and Asia was down 23%. As you already know, summer weather patterns across the U.S. have been cooler in 2009 compared to last year. We have seen some stability at Climate Technologies, with year-over-year underlying volume declines at similar levels in Q2 and Q3.</p>
          <p>EBIT of 131 million or 15.2% of sales. We have seen a sequential margin improvement of 620 basis points from the second quarter. Cost reduction efforts in the quarter were offset by volume de-leverage and restructuring. We believe the HVAC stimulus programs recently enacted in China should provide future benefits. In the third quarter, we completed the Vilter Manufacturing acquisition, which expands our refrigeration business to include industrial refrigeration. This is a great adjacent market for Climate Technologies, and we're excited about this acquisition.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Appliance and Tools. Sales in the quarter of 771 million, down 23%. Underlying sales were down 22% and currency subtracted one point. By region, the US was down 21%, Europe was down 33% and Asia was up 1%. Our consumer-related businesses continue to show signs of stabilization. EBIT margin of 108 million or 14% of sales. We saw a 560 basis point margin improvement sequentially from second quarter '09. In the third quarter, cost reductions, price and material cost containment were substantially offset by volume de-leverage. We also had a benefit from a $9 million charge that was recorded in the same quarter prior year. We continue to focus on costs and asset management to create value in Appliance and Tools.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn it over to Mr. David Farr.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lynne. Needless to say, Emerson is still facing very difficult and challenging times around the world. And first of all, I want to thank all the management team and the global operating people around the world as take their very difficult actions to strengthen the global business, and, in this difficult time period, both from an economic standpoint and the current tough political environment.</p>
          <p>We are, as I look at it now, in the depths of this economic downturn, and you'll see on the next page when we go to it, you'll see that we have laid out what I look at the next three quarters from the standpoint of our underlying economic forecasts and what we look at our underlying economic sales growth for the company. If you look at today, we'd be down 19% in this quarter, and I think we'll be down somewhere in the 18 to 20% in the next quarter. We are taking a lot of actions to strengthen this company, both from a P&amp;L standpoint, from a global restructuring, best costs, we're cleansing the balance sheet, both from a working capital and a fixed asset, we're generating high levels of free cash flow, and we continue to make the critical technology investments, which will be very important to us as we come out of this downturn and start recovering in late 2010, which is consistent to what I've said in the past.</p>
          <p>Right now, the operating profit margins are being impacted by, at each of the divisions, by significant production level reductions, as we drive our production significantly below our sales levels. We will continue to do this until we see an underlying recovery from our customers. I would expect us to continue to reduce our inventory levels until December or January and the coming months, sometime in December 2009 or January 2010.</p>
          <p>As we look at the economic bottoming right now, and it is forming, it's pretty clear it's forming, but it doesn't &#x2013; I do not see much of recovery here in the very near future. Our order rates are clearly re-stabilizing, our early-cycle businesses, as you saw in the quarter, have slowed down the rate of decline. They're starting to get the impact of the restructuring, they've got the inventory reductions behind them and so we're now seeing the benefits of that in the P&amp;L. Whereas the later cycle businesses, the Process, Industrial Automation and some of the Network Power are in their early stage of significant reductions relative to their inventory and the overhead. But when we finish this year, we will leave 2009 in a very good cost position, both from a P&amp;L standpoint and also from a capital structure standpoint, as we generate the free cash flow this year and going into 2010.</p>
          <p>The view that I see today is we're going to be looking at our underlying economic forecast this quarter of around 14%, next quarter of around 14% and then the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 around 10%. This is going to drive our underlying sales growth around 18 to 20% negative in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter, a very difficult quarter for us also, 18 to 20%, and then I start seeing a slowdown of those negatives as we go into the second fiscal quarter, which ends as you know, March of 2010, in that 10 to 13% range. So as we position the company today, both from a cost structure standpoint or overhead structure standpoint and a personal, personnel standpoint, we are getting ready for a continuation of a very difficult volume environment and production environment.</p>
          <p>So as we look at the full-year numbers, we're talking our sales declining somewhere between 12 to 13%, which gives us approximately &#x2013; our sales revenue around $21 billion, down 15 to 16% versus prior year. Our restructuring is going to be somewhere in the 280 to 300 million level, depending on what we can get done here in the next two months, as we're running out of time relative to this fiscal year. We will not slow down restructuring in the first quarter of next fiscal year &#x2013; we will continue to get the job done. We're not going to stop just because it's the end of the fiscal quarter, because as I've said, we're looking at some very difficult time periods ahead in the next couple quarters.</p>
          <p>We now expect earnings per share to be in the 2.20 to 2.30 range. As you know, this has been an extremely tough year relative to trying to forecast both the top line and also from the standpoint of trying to forecast the earnings per share line as we've ramped up our restructuring and as we've taken out significant levels of inventory. Our inventory has gone from a peak of around 2.5, 2.6 billion down to a little bit under 2 billion now, excluding the acquisitions, and we will continue to reduce that inventory below $1.8 billion before we're all said and done in this cycle.</p>
          <p>From an operating cash flow standpoint, the operations are getting the job done, both from a working capital side and also from a capital spending side, and I would expect our free cash flow to be in the 2.4 to $2.6 billion range, a very good performance on very challenging economic time period. So as we look at it, and you think about where we are today, and you want to go to the next chart, Lynne, if you have that numbers there, the economic numbers, why don't you move to the last chart, if you flip to that chart there. Okay, I'm looking at two, three more challenging quarters.</p>
          <p>The bottom is forming, it's been forming now for the last two or three months, and we're ready for it. I reviewed it with the Board today, and we believe we have our cost structure in line, we will see sequential improvement in margin again, like we saw this quarter. We have seasonal patterns of those things. We believe our volume will continue to be below prior year into the second half of 2010 on a fiscal year basis. So tough times, we're still generating very good levels of profitability, we will generate a profit margin somewhere between 15 and 15.4%, with our sales down underlying 12 to 13% and a reduction of $500 million of inventory.</p>
          <p>So despite the challenging environment, we have continued to generate high levels of profitability and we will generate somewhere around $1.7 billion of net earnings. Yes, it's down from last year's record level, but still we will generate a lot of net earnings with a lot of restructuring and a lot of actions being taken in the company. And we will generate close to last year's free cash flow. So, not bad performance in a very difficult environment, and I'm proud of the people around the world dealing with this, because we have situations right now where our customers have basically shut down and reducing inventories, and we are having to deal with that from our own production standpoint at the same time we're having to reduce our own inventories.</p>
          <p>So we are where we are, nothing to apologize about, challenging year, it is starting to form a bottom, we will recover as we go into 2010 and we will have positive growth by the time we finish 2010. And that's where we sit.</p>
          <p>And so with that, I'd like to open the floor and have questions. But again, I want to thank everybody out there around the world with Emerson for what they've done, and I want to thank the support of our customers as they've worked with us in these very difficult times. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Want to talk a little bit about China, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think this is your first quarter of the down cycle where China was in negative territory, and what I'm asking, I guess, is a couple of things. One, if there are some timing issues that drove that number negative, because certainly we've seen China PMI picking up. And then second, there in the slides you mentioned the China HVAC stimulus program, if you can walk through what that means, what the timing of it is, and how much of an impact you would expect to see in your China business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my perspective, Scott, I think it's a timing issue. We've got -- as you know, you're right, this is the first negative growth we've had in China in quite some time. I would expect us to actually see our fourth quarter to be negative again, from the standpoint, we're coming against some very, very difficult comps relative to our process business. We've held up well all year long. I would expect us to be positive for the year, but I would expect us to see this quarter, and probably the first quarter of 2010, also to be negative.</p>
          <p>The process guys right now, the process business is a key driver in the space relative to what's going on there. We are starting to see HVAC be less negative, it's still negative, but we're starting to see less negative there. And what's going on right now, the government is encouraging people to go with more energy efficient products, and they're making the transition, and they're making an investment. So I think China is going to be a struggle here for the next three, six months for us, and then we'll start seeing a little bit more positive from the benefit of what's going on, but it's not going to be a real hard negative for us. I think it's going to be slightly negative, in the negative 2, negative 5% range for the next couple quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And as a follow-up, if we could talk a little bit about your restructuring efforts, it's been fairly large levels of restructuring, and could you help us understand when you're going to spend 280 million to $300 million, I mean, how much of this is on head count reduction and severance type issues versus how much of it is reduction in actual physical plant and asset levels or even goodwill write-downs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is now goodwill write-down in that number. We would tell you that, that would have be an impairment charge. We don't try to hide numbers, unlike maybe somebody else. What you're seeing here is currently our head count peaked at 141,000 people at the end of last fiscal year. We have currently reduced our overall head count more than 20,000 worldwide not including 6,000 temporaries around the world. We would expect that to continue to go down probably somewhere another 5 or 6,000 level people here in the next couple &#x2013; the next several quarters, as we go after some very significant, what I'd call long-term, high cost structural facilities that we will be permanently closing.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of restructuring from the standpoint of both head count, but also taking old nonproductive facilities offline, going after facilities where we no longer need that capacity, and we want to move into best-cost locations. We have a lot of that going on here in North America, a lot of that going on in Western Europe, even Mexico, even in some parts of Asia. So we have a lot going on. Most of our restructuring, if you look at it, is fundamentally relative to fixed assets as we shut down a facility and severance costs of eliminating the people, the personnel relative to taking out 25 to 30,000 people, as we're taking out across this company around the world. There is nothing funny in there. When you go through and shut a facility down, you may have a little bit of 1.2 million, type of million dollars here and there relative to some bad assets, but fundamentally, we're cleaning up facilities that we no longer need, and when the economy does come back, that manufacturing will be produced &#x2013; or that production will be in best cost locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So pretty high &#x2013; pretty quick payback on this type of stuff, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think some of it will be quick, some of it will not be quick. As you look into some of the Western European, the paybacks are typically more like 2.5, 3-year paybacks and we have a lot of Western European restructuring going underway right now. When it's all said and done and we lay out the fiscal year for everybody in the November timeframe, you'll be able to see &#x2013; we'll show you exactly where it's all said and done and where things have been announced and discussed and disclosed to employees involved in this.</p>

          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess it's no coincidence that the businesses where you're being most aggressive on restructuring were the ones where the margin trends were much better this quarter, particularly within Tools, Climate and Network Power, if volumes are flat from here, Dave, do margins stabilize or do margins actually still go up on a Q-on-Q basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're going to see, this business is becoming less negative as we go forward here and eventually will go positive as we move into some part &#x2013; in the early parts of 2010 from a cycle standpoint, the early cycle businesses will start going positive. I &#x2013; we would anticipate margins to continue to improve as this business goes forward, based on the volume levels you see on a quarter-on-quarter basis and the seasonal patterns. But they've reached bottom, they have taken the inventory action and the reduction and restructuring actions earlier on versus the later cycle businesses. So we'll start seeing the &#x2013; those &#x2013; the early cycle businesses starting to see them &#x2013; improvement of margin next quarter, and then as you move into the first half of &#x2013; in 2010. So I think we've &#x2013; we feel very good about those right now from the standpoint of when you see the restructuring by business and their inventory reduction by business, we've got that action taken care of right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then how important was the relative price inflation gap in Tools and on Climate this quarter and how do you see that gap trending over the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; from a standpoint of Tools and Appliance components, the price-cost relationship was not that important.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now, it's still &#x2013; we still have it in check, we have it pretty under control, we have not seen any outrageous inflation standpoint relative to the price-cost in the Appliance and Tools area. We have had a situation where the &#x2013; and a timing issue relative to pricing actions and relative to material actions in the Climate Technology, where we had the pricing kicked in and now the price costs are back in line. So, that's helped us here in the second half. But right now, our overall price costs for the year is in good shape, we'll be slightly positive. I'm looking probably for the overall corporation probably slightly under 1% price increase, and our net material inflation in check from that perspective. So, we're in pretty good shape there, and we go into next year, I think we would expect right now, in the first half of the year, less price as inflation, I believe, inflation will start coming in, you will have to have some inflation pressure and pricing pressure as you move forward toward the end of 2010, early 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned, David, in 1Q 2010, restructuring will still be quite high, do you &#x2013; I mean you typically spend between 80 and 100 every year, year-in, year-out, do you want to give us a placeholder for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I make comments the first quarter, because I think what's going to happen to us, Walter and I have been through this enough that we know that even though we're saying 280 to $300 million, it's hard to get everything done. So, I would expect the level in this quarter, it's going to be around that $100 million, it's going to stay up at a fairly high level probably in the 50 to 75 million in that first quarter. And I think we're going to see overall restructuring next year, I'm going to give you a very broad placeholder right now, somewhere between 125 and 175 &#x2013; Walter, anything? That's about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's where our placeholder is right now. We'll get a better fix on that as we look at what we close out this year. The other thing is we have seen our modeling, and I've held back in giving what I would say more tighter guidance relative to our sales and earnings in the last couple of months, but I have seen them, our forecast of economics and our sales forecasts have pretty tightened up into this band right now. So, I think our restructuring will come down, because we're getting it all done, but it is still going to be pretty high levels in the first part of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then just one final one, you mentioned power gen will stay strong. Just to clarify, do you think that stays strong through 2010 when the rest of business is under pressure, or do you think power gen stays pretty good for the next three or four years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, what we are talking about is primary power &#x2013; when you say power gen, I am thinking of gen, what we're talking about as our power industry on the process side. Right now, the investment, both from around the world, there's some new investments going on, but also the upgrades of investment. So I expect &#x2013; I mean I'm looking at both 2010 and 2011 to be pretty good businesses for our power business, not the power gen business, but the power business relative to our process area, which is our control systems, the automation of control valves and instrumentation like that. We've seen a very good demand and that has not slacked off. And I think that will keep on going for at least 18 months.</p>

          <p>Hi, Dave, I'd be interested in hearing, because you mentioned in the answer to Nigel's question about seasonal patterns, can you talk about the seasonal patterns in Climate Technology, and especially it's been cooler than typical, and what have you done with inventory there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Inventory's at levels this industry hasn't seen in a long time. Inventories are &#x2013; as I look it at the channel, at our customer level and at our level, our inventories are in very, very good shape. They're very low, I want to say the Climate Technology people, both in our end and also people at our customer level, have done a good job of keeping those volumes down. And there has been no build here, because we reacted very quickly, we're talking days when we change things.</p>
          <p>The one thing that &#x2013; what I see happening right now, as you know, we're getting ready for a transition relative to the refrigerant in U.S., and on December 31 of 2009, the refrigerants are going to change. It's going to go from R-22 to 410A. There is discussions right now out there in the channel, nothing is going to be &#x2013; has been finalized. But I would expect that we would see some build as we finish this year, this calendar year &#x2013; not a fiscal year, but the calendar year, which is our first fiscal quarter &#x2013; getting prepared for that transition. I would expect that to happen. We have no indication at that point in time. That will be good news, because from the standpoint of inventories are low and our factory inventories are extremely low. And hopefully our customers will plan this carefully and not drop it on us in one day's notice, because we were down low from a standpoint of manpower and inventories. But I think that will be one positive we'll see as we close out this calendar year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a &#x2013; as we look at that market space, from a horsepower standpoint, it's a screw compressor technology, and we could not take Scroll up that high. We can only go up to certain levels and this &#x2013; 150 horsepower, this allows us to go up to 2, 3, 400 horsepower. This also allows us to go after the natural gas industry through our process business using the screw technology from the standpoint of getting into that market channel, and it helps us globalize this business, which they're very much a U.S. business today. So it really allows us to get into a bigger market segment from a refrigeration standpoint, and then also from some of the natural gas marketplace, which fits very nicely with our natural gas business relative to our process business. It's a nice little strategic fit. If we continue to move in this space, it will &#x2013; there are opportunities out there around the world to do more.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Process, I mean, what's the top line look like, and more importantly, would a &#x2013; first of all, give us the top line expectation, and then the margin in Process for 2010 please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I said, and I think if you go back and look at the transcripts, I've been saying that I think Process will be down underlying sales next year 12 to 14%. I believe Process will be down 12 to 14%, they are trending &#x2013; the order pattern is trending that way. What you're seeing &#x2013; and I'll come to margin in a second, what you're seeing going on right now is Steve Sonnenberg, who is the business leader, and John Berra, who is now running the systems business, but also helping Steve quite a bit, is that they are tacking their infrastructure of this company, which has been, as you know, growing quite rapidly for the last five years, and they're repositioning things &#x2013; they're taking inventory levels down, they're going after restructuring from a cost standpoint. And so we went from the first half this year growing very nicely to now all of a sudden shrinking, and they are doing an about-face and starting to run 100 miles the other way. And so there's a lot of &#x2013; what I would say, a lot of things going on inside this business to quickly attack the cost structure, knowing that they're going to be down somewhere between 12 and 14% next year.</p>
          <p>I'm still of the opinion, these guys in the next six months will get their cost structure together. They are under enormous pressure right now from Walter, I and Ed Monser to get restructuring things done, getting ready for the tough times in 2010. I still believe, as I said last time, they will lose somewhere between 200 and 300 basis points as they go into 2010 from a margin standpoint. And I still believe that. I said that last time, I still believe that will be the case. These guys are getting their act together, their cost structure is in good shape and we have a lot of technology going the right way for us, so. As of right now, the stake in the ground is 12 to 14 down sales, margins down somewhere between 200 and 300 basis points next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that margins after restructuring, or is that margins before restructuring?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That will be, as I look at right now, I think it will probably include both of them, it will probably include &#x2013; they are going to get a lot of restructuring done this quarter and the first quarter, next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And here is the key question I think, you're looking at, you gave the restructuring decline. You didn't give us a cost-out target for 2010 as well as restructuring for whole company, and then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...the companion question is the overall impact on the year of the inventory takeout is around one point I think for the year. But why don't you walk us down, as we model 2010, right. You gave us a restructuring cost, I heard, you just said you're not going to tell, why not? What's the cost take-out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't go out and &#x2013; I mean, we have, from our perspective, we &#x2013; there will be a significant cost reduction when business returns to normal. I'm telling you right now my underlying sales will be down again next year. They're not going to be down 12 to 13%, but they're going to be down again at a significant level, maybe half that level, but they're going to be down. And as I look at where we are from an inventory standpoint, the first say three or four months I think we'll continue to take inventory our, but not at the same level. I'm also looking at my largest business is going to have a down year with profit margins being down. We are going to be looking at our margins down again next year, unfortunately. At this point in time, I have no magic wand or magic &#x2013; whatever to stop that at this point. But we, our goal as we go into our planning process, we're going to have some businesses coming up, we're going to have some businesses going down, we'll have some businesses probably being not much change. But the fundamentals are, we will have down margins next year, Bob. I can't stop it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now when you think about margin, are you thinking about your operating profit margin on the cost of goods, SG&amp;A margin before OIOD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm thinking about my operating margin. I will have less restructuring, so obviously that will help me down there, but I'm also &#x2013; I'm thinking about operating profit margin. I will have a down offering profit margin next year. And so as I look at it right now, we &#x2013; I mean, most people, including myself, I'm expecting our earnings to be down again next year. The challenge that we will face is, it's going to be year of two halves. It's pretty clear to me as I look at the underlying structure, what's going on in the recovery, some time in that March/April time period, we're going to start turning and the wind is going to shift to our back. And the question will be that, how fast does that wind blow. But I think it's going to be a negative thing for us.</p>
          <p>The other issue we have next year is our long-term &#x2013; we put long-term, a four-year compensation plan in place, and next year we have our overlap year. I mean, another thing going against us, but those things happen, every four years &#x2013; every three years that happens. So I'm looking at it right now, I think we're well positioned, and we will have a down sales, we'll have a down earnings and we'll have a down EPS growth situation next year. But I feel right now we're going to do a pretty good job of minimizing that impact as we go into 2010, given everything we're doing right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, just a little more on Process if we could. There was a little discussion in the press release about mix, obviously with maybe instruments weaker than systems. I wonder if that also is kind of an MRO versus new installed dynamic also, if you could flesh that out a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, there is three things. The first thing is, our North America business, our U.S. business is a very profitable business, and our European instrumentation business is a very profitable business, and both of those businesses were down significantly in the quarter. We've been hit pretty hard here, which has been, part of that is the MRO business. And so MRO has not seen the recovery yet. I still expect it will recover in the cycle, it typically will restart recovering, but it hasn't recovered yet. So we're getting hit hard both here and in Europe from the economic standpoint and the MRO standpoint of bad mix.</p>
          <p>And then our emerging market business, which continues to do pretty well. And obviously some is growing, some is shrinking less. So our emerging market business is going up. I mean, right now as a percent of total sales this year, as we said in the release, I think our emerging market sales are going to be somewhere representing 32 to 33% of our total sales, up from last year's 30. So we have &#x2013; we do have a mix working against us. That will stabilize, and as we get to a point where MRO starts kicking in here in North America, which I believe, it will, it always has in the past, then we'll start seeing the margin stabilize in North America. And some of the order patterns we're seeing in Process right now, the last couple of months, would say it is starting to stabilize in that marketplace in North America, which is a good sign for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just to explore that a little bit more, because I think one of the &#x2013; obviously, there has been some skepticism about your margin target that's down 2 to 300, but I think one of the things underpinning that is or was your belief that MRO would be pretty solid in 2010. But as we look at these pressures on utilization rates across these end markets, I mean, you did just in fact say that you see some firming, but is there some risk there that that's a little bit softer than you thought? What kind of visibility do you really have there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The risk &#x2013; clearly, the risk for us relative to the 2 to 300 is what you just, exactly, there is the stabilization and the slight improvement in the key U.S. marketplace for 2010. The visibility is pretty good. As we go out of this year, if the underlying trend lines that we're seeing right now in the Process in the U.S. continues to go the way it's going, I'm going to feel better about it as we go into &#x2013; as we close out this fiscal year. If it stalls and starts slipping back down, then we will have a problem relative to that. But the last couple months, we have seen a flattening and a slight tick upwards in certain parts of that. I think we're seeing that bottom forming here in the U.S. relative to that Process MRO market, which is key to us making a margin not dropping off as far as we would expect with the sales decline next year. So I mean I think right now, I'm encouraged by, but the last 12 months have been pretty tough. I've not done a very good job of forecasting. I mean I've been humbled quite a bit about that. But right now I feel I see the signs of it happening, and I feel good about it, and I feel very good about what Steve Sonnenberg and John Berra and his teams are doing around the whole process business getting ready for it. And they are reacting extremely fast, which is very important relative to the margin stabilization and not declining as much as you think. Walter, anything else you want to add to that?</p>

          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon. Can you give us a little bit of color on what your expectations are for free cash in 2010, given what you're doing with inventories and some of the moving pieces there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first half will be good. The issue will be, when we start recovering, our balance sheet will start &#x2013; we'll start adding to our balance sheet. So the key issue for us will be, as I look at free cash flow, and one of the components is capital spending. Capital spending will be down again next year. So this year we're going from 714 million to let's say 570 million or somewhere around there, 560, 550, somewhere around that range. We will go down towards 500 million next year. So I'd put a placeholder right now around 500. I can't call capital plus or minus 10 million, but say around 500 next year.</p>
          <p>Then what's going to happen to us is as we go into the second half of the year, our plants, on my opinion will start producing again, come, in the March, April, May time period, and our receivables, our payables, and our inventory levels will start going up again, which will take some cash off and put, our balance sheet will start growing. So free cash flow next year will be tougher to reach this year's level, and it's going to be a challenge for us. And it's a question about how tightly we can manage our inventory as we come out of this recovery, because we are doing a very good job of getting it off right now, and we know it has to come back on it at some level as we start expanding and growing again. But that will be a good sign, because that means my operating earnings are going to be going back up too. So it's going to be tougher next year. My gut tells me right now, free cash flow will be slightly less next year than it is this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And given the emphasis on generating cash right now, how do you think about share repurchase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, given acquisition opportunities, we continue to do acquisitions. We've had got a couple we took in front of the Board again this time, and we have a couple we're about to close this month or next month. We anticipate to do somewhere between 1 million &#x2013; or I'm sorry, 1 billion to 1.5 billion of acquisitions next year, and I would expect us to do some share repurchase again next year, but most likely at half the level or less than half the level that we did this year. So, this year we're doing around &#x2013; we did 700 million. I would expect us to be somewhere in the 2, 3, 400 million &#x2013; 2 to 400 million range next year, assuming we do that 1.5 billion acquisitions.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Doing great. Just, it strikes me the fourth quarter guidance is actually pretty impressive on margins. If you look at the low-end of even the revenue guidance, it implies that operating margins year-over-year are flat to up, even excluding restructuring, which I think is impressive, especially if Process continues to decline. I guess A, is that hang together, and then B, I guess, where are the biggest sequential improvements coming in margins, I presume it must be either Climate and probably Industrial Automation from this trough?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Walter will go through the numbers with you on a macro basis first, and I'll give you comments about the business. Go ahead, Walter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you look at sales and the ranges we gave you on page 15, looking at the underlying sales growth being still down, and rather than trying to hit the ranges looking at the midpoints and trying to keep it simple, it would look like the underlying sales should be up based on the midpoint of that about $200 million, at a 30% leverage going up would be about $60 million. We also expect to liquidate less inventory. We liquidated over 275 million. We will probably liquidate something, say, 175. Liquidating 100 million less, doing it sequentially third to fourth quarter, we should pick up about $20 million of additional OP.</p>
          <p>Normally, because you've been following us a long time, Michael, our third to fourth quarter OP, because of holidays and other things, vacations in Europe, generally move up about 0.5 point. That would be about 25 million looking at it sequentially. Also, for what we have been spending on the restructuring, cost reductions, price cost issues others, we should probably up pick up about $50 million. So, that would be the major drivers.</p>
          <p>You also, as you look at currency and what has happened and acquisitions, we will probably pick up on that front about 75 million in sales, say 15% in rounding, that's $10 million of additional OP. Clearly restructuring, we gave you the number of 280 to 300, you can subtract it and say it's going up between 5 and 25 million, take the midpoint, say you are down 15, and so that gives you an EBIT number. There are also some pluses and minuses. We told you the tax rate of 30, so you can back into the fourth quarter tax rate and then move forward, and you can see we're about at the midpoint of the range that we gave you on EPS guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then to follow up on your points, the early cycle guys will continue, as I said earlier, they will continue their margin improvements. We're going to start seeing, Appliance and Tools will be &#x2013; should do okay. Climate Technologies should do okay. The Process guys will still be impacted Jean-Paul's Industrial Automation will continue to be impacted, and we're feeling better about the Network Power business in the quarter, as these guys are getting their acts together, and we have a decent backlog there. The restructuring is helping them. So --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There are some as we &#x2013; we're not going to give it to you division by division, but there is a half a dozen divisions where they got the restructuring done earlier, and so we will internally see a very good margin improvement in Tools, some of the Tool businesses, some of the Industrial Automation and other, because they got the reduction in sooner, and the OP will go...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think fundamentally, reviewing with the Board today, and Walter and I have been spending a lot of time on this and getting ready for the top 30 guys in the &#x2013; guys and gals in the company will be here together for the next three days. I feel we are doing the right thing to get back to that 16.5% level of operating profit margin as we come back and get this thing growing again. But we are starting to see some of the benefits of it already, and the reason I don't want to give number targets for improvement of operating profit from restructuring is because the volumes are so much lower. We've lost, the last two or three quarters, we have lost $1 billion a quarter of sales. And that's a lot of volume change going on in these plants here. So I feel very good about where we are at this point in time, Mike, and we 're starting to get some of that benefit. So I feel good about that.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question, I appreciate the fourth quarter dynamics, that's good detail. When you're looking at Network Power, there has been some news around the slow uptake of 3G. Is there any risk there that they slow the roll out there? I'm not totally in tune with what's going on in China on telecom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not seen a really big change. We changed our China Network Power business to a lot more data infrastructure. The telecom business is less and less, but it's still there. But, we don't see any slowdown there. We think we will see the slowdown next year, and, but the infrastructure business today, the infrastructure business will continue to do well. But, we think next year 3G will slow down, will be an issue for us as we get into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then U.S. resi compressors, were they down about in line with that 16% decline in Climate? And maybe could you talk about what you're seeing on the fix versus replace type of dynamics, since I think you guys would see that a lot more than the OEMs? Could you maybe talk about what's going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've actually seen the fix business do very well for us, our reman or rebuilt, that's gone extremely well. So, we've seen, that's performed better than the underlying market, as people have decided to just replace their compressor rather than buy the whole system. I think, the next thing right now, Steve, is in this marketplace, we've had a, very cold in most of the United Sates, the inventories are at low levels. I think the next thing is, as I said earlier, what's the build-ahead that we see the OEMs and we will have to work on that 410A build-ahead, because I think you will see a little bit of that, of getting R-22 in stock before you can no longer manufacture it after 12/31. And, I think you will see a little bit, just like we saw in the 13010 thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just lastly, you talked about the margin dynamics for the fourth quarter, but you said down 2 to 300 bps at Process next year. The decremental was relatively tough this quarter. What does the margin look like in Process in the fourth quarter, and maybe you could give us &#x2013; or just a base as far as what that 2 to 300 bps falls off of next year?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, he's talking pretty soon, based on what he's seeing going on now. Just a couple questions, in all fairness, currency is going to go in your favor probably next year. Just wondering whether you've factored in, as you look at next year, and currency not being a negative, but probably even being a neutral if not positive in next year's numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be a positive next year, but when I give forecasts, I give underlying sales forecasts out. I don't really, I mean, we'll put our stake in the ground in currency when we get into November and we see where the dollar is, but the odds are extremely high that we'll see that, this year we had a decrement of about $1 billion in sales. Next year we'll have currency helping us. And you're right, and that typically flows through anywhere between the 12, 13% margin level, it's a low number. But I would expect, Eli, that we will have a positive growth top line from currency next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the pre-build that may happen in the calendar fourth quarter in the compressor resident coolant change, are you expecting that to be taken away from the first part or at least the second quarter if not further, your second quarter in 2010? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say so. I think what you're going to see is you're going to see some of our OEMs make the decision to build R-22 units before they can no longer build them at the end of, the date is 12/31/09. So I think you're going to see some build, which will cause us to build more R-22 compressors and that will be pulled into the channel, they will hold it and they'll move it out, some of them hold and some move it out, and so that will be a little bit of pull from the early part of the second quarter, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And one final question, how long do you think it'd take for oil to hold over $70 before the MRO business in Process begins to start taking, to start revamping itself? I know you're seeing some stabilization.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've got to have two to three months of pretty good oil prices, 70 plus type level before you start seeing that, but if it stays up there for two or three months, you're going to see it.</p>

There's a lot of very difficult actions being taken across this company, and at a very quick pace, both from a restructuring and from an inventory reduction standpoint. To take out $500 million of inventory in a matter of seven, eight months is a lot of work to do, and on top, the underlying sales being down 12 or 13%. So I want to thank everybody for doing it, and I also want to thank the people for joining us today and I appreciate all your support and look forward to seeing you again when we come back up.
