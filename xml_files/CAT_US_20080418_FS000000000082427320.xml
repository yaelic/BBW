          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2008 Earnings Results <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, the Director of Investor Relations, Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and good morning everyone and welcome to Caterpillar's first quarter earnings conference call. I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. And I'm very pleased to have our Chairman and CEO Jim Owens with us today; Group President Ed Rapp; our Chief Financial Officer, Dave Burritt. We'll all try to answer your questions today.</p>
          <p>Now this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the express written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, you can go to the SEC Filings area of the investor section of our cat.com website or to the SEC's website, where it will be filed as an 8-K.</p>
          <p>In addition, certain information relating to projections of our results that we'll be discussing today is forward-looking at involves risks uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors, either individually or in the aggregate that we believe could make our actual results differ materially from our projections discussed here can be found in the cautionary statements under Item 1a, Business Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22.</p>
          <p>Okay. Earlier this morning we reported results for the first quarter of 2008 and the headlines of the release were pretty positive, particularly given the current economic environment. There were two points from the headline in our release this morning that I think are worth reiterating as we start today. And those two points are: sales and revenues and profit per share were both first quarter records, and both were up about 18% from the first quarter last year. And two, this was the best first quarter ever for our financial products business. We had our best first quarter ever in terms of revenues, and our best first quarter ever in terms of operating profit.</p>
          <p>With that, let me summarize what happened in the quarter and let's start with the tope line. Sales and revenues were up to just under $1.8 billion from the first quarter last year. And the elements were: machine volume up 724 million &#x2013; and that's about 11%. Engine volume was up 363 million, and that was about 13%.</p>
          <p>Currency impacts increased sales 310 million and that means that sales that were actually dominated in currencies other than dollars translated into more dollars because the dollar was weaker on average than the first quarter last year. Price realization added 260 million and 160 of that was from engines and 101 was machinery. And financial products revenues were up 122 million.</p>
          <p>Now if we take that 1.8 billion increase in sales and revenues and look at it by region, we see that the trends are very similar to what we saw for the full year of 2007. And that the weakness in North America is more than offset by strong growth outside North America.</p>
          <p>Sales and revenues in this first quarter were up 37% in the Asia-Pacific region. They were up 30% in our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, which includes the CIS. Latin America was up 24% and even North America was up 4%.</p>
          <p>The strength of our first quarter sales outside North America is clear from those numbers. However, if you dig a little deeper in terms of sales outside North America, what you'll find is that they were primarily driven by increases in the developing world. And that's Asia-Pacific excluding Japan and Australia, the CIS, Africa, and Middle East regions of EME, and in Latin America. These regions have tended to be the beneficiaries of rising commodity prices, their economies are growing faster than in the more developed world, and they are spending it on infrastructure growth. In total, 58% of our sales and revenues were outside North America in the first quarter. A year ago, that number was 53%.</p>
          <p>Now, growth outside North America is not a new story and you probably expected it. However, the fact that North America increased 4% in the face of end markets that continue a severe decline may have been a bit of surprise to you. Remember though that end user demand for new machines is continuing to decline in North America. And we are definitely still in a severe trough in the United States. However, as we said in our original outlook for 2008, our overall sales and revenues in North America should perform a bit better than end user demand for new machines in 2008.</p>
          <p>There are several factors that you need to keep in mind that are helping our sales in North America again despite the depressed end market for construction equipment in the United States.</p>
          <p>First, as is usual for the first quarter, North American users increased inventories. That's very common from a historical standpoint. Dealers do tend to build inventory in the first quarter in preparation for the spring and summer when their deliveries are higher. Remember, last year North American dealers took out about $1.1 billion of inventory in the full year and last year in the first quarter, they actually held inventories about flat.</p>
          <p>What that means is for the full year 2007, Caterpillar sales were depressed beyond what the end markets saw because dealers reduced inventories. And again, we don't expect that to happen again this year.</p>
          <p>Second, mining is doing quite well, particularly in coal. Coal prices are up substantially from last year and U.S. exports of coal are rising. This is an industry that is doing pretty well. In addition, our engine volume was up a little in the first quarter, particularly for truck engines.</p>
          <p>Now, that's not because of what we would call a great level, it's not even at what we would think is a good level. But it is up from last year's depressed levels in the first quarter. Also remember that our sales and revenues include a wide array of service related businesses including aftermarket parts, progress rail, CAT remanufacturing, CAT logistics. These businesses are generally not as cyclical as new machine and engine sales. And finally, don't forget that Canada is an important part of North America and sales in Canada are holding up much better than in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's a review of the top line for the first quarter and again, even with extreme softness in North American Machines, we had a record. Now, let's turn to profit.</p>
          <p>It was our best first quarter ever for profit. Profit was up 106 million from the first quarter a year ago and at $1.45 per share it was up $0.22 from the first quarter of last year. Now that profit increase was a result of improved price realization, higher sales volume for Machinery and Engines and better profit from Financial Products.</p>
          <p>Now while the sales volume was higher and a positive, our product mix was actually negative in the quarter and offset some of the benefit, also the net positive impact from higher sales was partially offset by higher costs.</p>
          <p>Overall our manufacturing costs were up 171 million or about 2% and was about in line with overall cost inflation. Supply chain related operating efficiencies and tight capacity in many of our factories continue to be an issue for us, we have those issues this quarter and we had them last quarter, that said, the situation seems to have stabilized and we do expect continued improvement as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A and R&amp;D costs were higher as we expected in our original outlook, but both improved as a percent of sales in revenues. The impact of currency was also a negative in the quarter, in total about $100 million for Machinery and Engines.</p>
          <p>Gross margin was negatively impacted 33 million, SG&amp;A and R&amp;D were negatively impacted 21 million as a result of currency, and the currency impact in our other income and expense line which is below operating profit was also negative 47 million versus the first quarter, last year.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that in this quarter and in the first quarter of last year, we had gains on the sale of assets. Last year, we sold an investment related to our marine engine business and this quarter we had the gain on the sale of our interest in ASV.</p>
          <p>Okay, let me switch gears for a minute and talk about our rate of profitability &#x2013; our rate of operating profit. Total consolidated operating profit in dollars was 1 billion 293 million and that was 11% of sales and revenues.</p>
          <p>Now, it was 11.4% in the first quarter last year and so we're down four-tenth of a percentage point. Price realization was up and was a bit more than enough to offset manufacturing in SG&amp;A and R&amp;D cost increases, so that was a net positive. But currency impacts were net negative to the margin rate. Again sales were up 310 and total operating costs were negatively affected 364.</p>
          <p>If you were to adjust sales and revenues and operating profit to take out the impact of currency on operating profit, it would have been about a half a percentage point higher. Also our product mix was unfavorable in the quarter and that had a negative impact of about eight-tenths of a percentage point at an operating profit level compared with the first quarter last year. So in total, our operating profit was hurt by currency and product mix by about 1.3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Now related to the operating profit percent, if you look at our operating profit pull-through, and that is the change in operating profit related to the change in our top line sales and revenues, you also see a negative impact. Our total pull-through was only about 9% in the quarter, but if you adjust it for the currency impacts and sales mix, it would have been about 21%, and that would be more inline with what you would have probably expected. Okay, that was a quick summary of the quarter, let me talk for a minute about the full-year outlook, and then we'll move on to the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>The headline is that we are maintaining our full-year outlook for 2008, for the top line to be up 5 to 10%, and for profit per share to be up 5 to 15%. However, the elements of both have changed somewhat. In terms of sales and revenues, we see North America, particularly the United States, weakening even more than we expected just three months ago. We've lowered our full-year GDP expectation for the U.S. to half a percent. That's down from our prior forecast of 1%.</p>
          <p>In our business, we are seeing weaker dealer sales to end users and we are lowering our full-year estimates for North America sales and revenues. We've moved North America from an expectation of being flat to up 5% from 2007 to being in a range of down two to up two. However, we have raised our forecast for sales outside North America.</p>
          <p>In terms of profits, the makeup of the forecast has also shifted a little. As we announced earlier, we are taking the mid-year price increase in many regions of the world and that should help price realization this year. But we do expect that material costs will be higher than our original outlook particularly for steel. Those are the two main changes in our profit outlook and on balance we've kept the outlook unchanged. Now let me just summarize a couple of key points and then we'll do the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>First, we did have a good quarter and that's despite negative impacts related to currency and having had a negative sales mix. Those two things were negative to profit compared with the first quarter a year ago in the ballpark of $200 million.</p>
          <p>Second, our costs are up from last year but generally in line with inflation. We still have a lot of room to improve in terms of manufacturing labor and overhead costs, we think we're doing the right things to drive that improvement and we do expect it to improve as we move through the year.</p>
          <p>Third, in terms of the outlook, we do see a weakening picture in North America, Western Europe and in Japan and that is included in our full-year outlook.</p>
          <p>Fourth, our order backlog continues to be very strong, commodity related end markets are doing extremely well and from a geographic standpoint the developing world continues with very good growth.</p>
          <p>Fifth, our sales of many products are production constrained. For most large Machines and Engines, we are selling as much as we can make.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have a diverse business in terms of products, services, end markets and geographies. We have some that are doing very well and are helping to offset negative impacts and others like machine sales in the United States.</p>
          <p>Okay, that's it for the wrap-up of the quarter, we're ready to move on to the Q&amp;A portion of the call; and again, we want to get as many of your questions in as possible, so please be as brief as you can and try to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.</p>
          <p>And we're ready for the first question then.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today is coming from Jamie Cook [Credit Suisse]. Please announce your affiliation then pose your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>High, good morning and congratulations on a nice first quarter. I guess, just my first question, could you just sort of give us an update. Last quarter, you guys were nice enough to provide sort of more granularity on your operating costs. What exactly now are you assuming for pricing and for material costs because that should be a headwind. As well as I think before you assumed variable manufactured costs to be about flat, if you could just go through those line items for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jamie. Material costs, just to kind of give it a little bit of background before I look forward-looking, material costs were up about 1% in the first quarter or about $60 million. The remaining 110 were other costs besides material and manufacturing. Our outlook for material costs is up a bit from our original outlook but not anything that you would, not massively, I mean we have the $60 million increase in the first quarter, it's probably going to go up from there as we progress through the year, particularly in the second half, but we should offset it with the price increases that we took.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give a percent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is one of the uncertainties in the outlook &#x2013; this is Jim Owens. I think we, we're certainly watching very carefully what's going on with global steel prices and one of the things we're working very hard on is working with our global supply base and trying to work with our product teams to work on material cost reduction opportunities, and some of these will offset some of the commodity driven inflation that we're seeing in our material costs. So, this is something we're keeping a close handle on and partly the reason we took some of the mid-year action that we've announced on price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you view this as the biggest risk to your earnings guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's the reason we have the range we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I guess, Jim, just because you are on the line and I guess my follow-up question, if you look I mean you reaffirmed your 2010 outlook of 8 to $10 per share, I guess over the longer term the thing that concerns me is North America appears weaker than we thought and while overseas is very strong, North American margins are generally higher, the recovery takes longer to materialize. How do you achieve your peak margins and are you assuming any improvement in your international margins or are you assuming the gaps should narrow between international margins and overseas to achieve your peak 2010 target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'm very pleased to say that the margins in our overseas sales have improved significantly over the last three or four years anyway. We've been working very hard on that and we've got substantial improvements. I would look for them to continue to improve, but the other thing I would point out is that yes, North America is down, it's down very sharply. At the retail level kind of peak-to-trough it's probably off on the order of 44% already, kind of on a sliding basis since it peaked in '06. But we would see the United States certainly coming back, housing is going to over correct on the downside and as we move out into '09 and '10 and with the economic stimulus both fiscal and monetary policy and stabilization of credit markets I would think the United States, as long as we don't do anything silly on the policy side, and we keep ourselves open and engaged in trading in the world market, I think we'll see a nice economic recovery in the United States out there in the '09 and '10 timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're assuming North America is still, that '08 is still the bottom in the North American machinery cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will continue down for another three to six months and then we'll find a bottom and we'll start moving up from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree, Jamie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Terry Darling. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Goldman Sachs. Wondering if you could elaborate a bit on the negative mix effect from machines? Is that, mix of product, mix of geography or a bit of both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's actually a little bit of both but quite a bit of it was with product and I'll put it in three big buckets. As you can imagine, a company like us with a massive variety of products and services, trying to summarize it into sound bites that capture it can be tough. But I'll put into three big buckets for you here. One is, if you think about aftermarket parts, that's generally a pretty good &#x2013; we get pretty good margins on those sales and they tend not to increase or when you have a negative situation decrease at the same rate as new machine sales or new engine sales. And what we had in the first quarter is we had actually new machine and engine sales increasing at a faster rate than the aftermarket business. And so that was a bit of a negative mix on the machinery line.</p>
          <p>Second thing is although we didn't have major acquisitions last year, we did have a couple of small acquisitions. One that we talked about quite a bit was Shandong Engineering Machinery, that in this first quarter it wasn't in the first quarter a year ago, and the margins on that product are -- the company overall is profitable, but the margin rate, particularly at a gross margin level is dramatically below the rest of the company. So that had a negative impact on the machine margin rate.</p>
          <p>The third thing is, and this is a little bit counterintuitive, our large machine business increased nicely, its capacity constraint at the moment, but it actually increased at a little lower rate than the rest of the new machine business. You know last year in the first quarter, we were a bit constrained on shipments, particularly with backhoe loaders we had a production quality issue and we weren't shipping. This quarter we certainly are. So, what we saw is small machines actually increase faster than large machine in this quarter because of that.</p>
          <p>Another point and this brings in a little bit of geography, even if you look product-by-product and geography-by-geography, we had a bit of a small negative impact related to that as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, like so when you look at the year-over-year degradation in margins for machines, 270 basis points above the rate of deterioration last year, it sounds like you're looking for that to improve as we move forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I think if you look at and I'm probably preempting another question that is going to come and after this Terry we'll move on. If we look at our overall machine margins, and I'm sure that is a big question mark for a number of people waiting to ask a question, so I'll just hit it right now. Our machine operating profit was down and our margin rate for machines was down. And if we go through the reasons for that, this is one of the items; this negative impact of sales mix was one of the items. In addition to that most of our cost increase in the quarter whether it be SG&amp;A and R&amp;D or whether it be manufacturing cost, the vast majority of it, order of magnitude 90%, was in the machinery business not the engine business. Costs for the engine business were pretty flat quarter-to-quarter. So, most of our cost increase was in machines. But only 101 of our 261 million increase in price was in machines. So, we did have a negative relationship for machines between price and cost and a very positive relationship price to cost on engines.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, the bulk of our unfavorable impact on operating profit from currency found its way to machines. There was a little bit of that in engines but the vast majority of it was in machines.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize the engine margin issue; it's mix, it's the relationship between our cost increase and our price increase, which was the price increase was subdued for machines certainly, and sales mix.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Longbow Securities. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Eli, I saw you on TV this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just very, just quick questions following up; you talk about the big step up in margins in engines, which was very impressive for the quarter and whether or not &#x2013; how sustainable is that? And tied to that, you did have positive cost/price in the first quarter. I assume from your comments it isn't likely that will stay positive cost/price next couple of quarters given probably the late impact of the 5% price increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, engine margins in the quarter were fantastic. I don't know how else to describe it. We had good solid price realization. Remember big engines are in significant demand. There's a long backlog. The customers in those areas are getting a lot of price on their work and we've been able to pass some price into those markets. So, pricing for engines overall has been very good. They did an exceptionally good job of holding costs in line in the quarter. I do want to come back to kind of the forward-looking view. We didn't actually announce a 5% price increase. We said it would range based on models and territories somewhere between 0 and 5 and I guarantee you the impact is going to be dramatically less than 5%.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the cost/price relationship going forward, we had a fairly balanced view in our original outlook. We said price would be up around 2%. We said cost would be up 2 to 2.5, and that gives us a pretty even balance between the two in our outlook. And I don't think we've done anything here in this outlook that's changed that. So, I would say on balance as we go through the year, it certainly could vary quarter-by-quarter but in balance our outlook looks for costs and price to be pretty similar for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and one quick follow-up. With the inventory being built in North America, normal seasonally, but demand falling off that quickly, are we looking at lower North American production in the second quarter than we normally have in seasonally? I mean, are we going to pare back because end user demand was that weak?</p>

          <p>Yes, two points. One, production in North America is significantly driven by things that we ship outside. Thankfully, we are in a situation where we have free and fair trade and we are a big net exporter. And a lot of what we're producing here in North America is for export. So, I don't see it having a major impact on production in North America at all.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eli, I'll just chip in on that. Jim Owens again. Our exports were up 27% in the first quarter and we're working very hard with our marketing companies and U.S. dealers to be sure that we continue to manage for higher inventory turns, dealer inventory turns, and we do not let any excess inventory build up because we have an opportunity to export that product if where we have end use customer demand we don't want it sitting in inventory anywhere in the value chain.</p>

          <p>And Eli, this is Ed Rapp. I mean that's even spilling over to the small end of the line or even on backhoes and skid steer. We're benefiting from the strong emerging markets' demand shipping a lot of that product into Latin America as an example to relieve some of the capacity constraints we have in Brazil.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I go back to your explanation on your machine margins? I was a little surprised that you said that most of the increase in SG&amp;A and R&amp;D is in machines. I thought coming into the year that the reason for the increase particularly in R&amp;D was engine emissions. So, I'm a little surprised that is that yet to come then on the engine side, one should expect the R&amp;D spend to go up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we said for R&amp;D is that we were spending on Tier 4 which includes... I mean there's some certainly some... there's engine work for Tier 4 but a lot of machine work and other component work related to Tier 4 as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so, we shouldn't expect a huge increase in R&amp;D spend in engines as we go forward is that....?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we didn't break down our expectation for R&amp;D in the outlook between machines and engines. We don't actually do our outlook that way &#x2013; our external outlook anyway. What we said was that we expected R&amp;D to be up 15 to 20% this year and we've certainly not changed our view of that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ann, Jim Owens, again. Not really much to elaborate on there. We continue to work on our strategy. This is kind of a post-2010 thing. We're in the truck engine business. We've got a tremendous service business associated with that also, and we're going to stay in the truck engine business obviously. But with vertical integration going on in the industry, we're thinking about our strategies sort of in the post-2010 timeframe, and as soon as we have something to announce with clarity on that we will do so. It's taken a little longer than we would have liked to get to a final conclusion. But as soon as we have something to announce we'll announce it, and there's really not much more we can say about it today.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Citigroup. My question is on the sales growth. Given the 18% sales growth in the first quarter, the full-year guidance, even if we use the high end of the range, it implies the rest of year growth slows to 7.8% midpoint, sub 5%. Can you elaborate why, especially if you think your currency helps, why would the growth rate slow so dramatically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good point, David. I think the real answer there is, we had quite a bit of growth through the rest of the year, last year. I mean our first quarter last year was 10 billion, and that related to our last year full year which ended at 45. So, relative to last year we had a lot of growth after the first quarter last year. Remember, truck engines in particular were very depressed last year. So, I think we had more significant growth in the last three quarters of last year. So, it's not that we don't expect growth; it's just the coming off of higher comps it will be tougher to make up this kind of difference. Also, I think we are somewhat concerned about what you see in the economy out there and it's certainly &#x2013; we had a great first quarter, no doubt about it, but I think to some degree it's still early in the year, we're at the end of the first quarter and we certainly want to see how it plays out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And David, I think it would be fair to say if the currency &#x2013; if the dollar stays as weak as it is, then there is a reasonable probability we might be towards the high end of that range. But right now the range seems appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would think it looked a little light. But on the issue of price versus cost, it appears in the channel that your price protecting customer invoice orders, pre the announced price increase beyond the July 1. It's going to the dealer inventory, rental fleet, you're not price protecting.</p>
          <p>Can you give us some color on what percent of the shipments you think in the third quarter and really ideally second half that are going to be price protected? And also the idea, as truck engines get a little better, that's usually a bit of a drag on your engine margins? Just trying to think through margins for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the way to think about the price is, it will be a nice increase, it will be enough to offset or maybe even slightly more than offset material cost increases. It's probably not going to happen or start really flowing through results until &#x2013; it will certainly not until the third quarter, and the fourth quarter will certainly be more than the third quarter. What percentage of the orders are price protected, David? I don't know, but I don't &#x2013; I think most of the impact is going to be in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll hop off. And one thing, if you can explain, I've never seen your truck engines be up so strongly or so different than the retail sales. The first two months of the year you show retail sales for truck down significantly, but you just reported North American truck up 18%? If you can , I'll hop off. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, two things about that. One, when we are reporting our sales, and our quarterly release includes all of the service-related revenues related to that business, it's not just sale of new engines. When we post up the retail statistics monthly, that's just new engines and new machines. So it doesn't include the service-related piece of it which, particularly for truck engines is a pretty decent chunk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That must have been huge though, right? I mean the retails was reported as down 60 the first two months of the year; then you just reported up 18, there must have been something a little bit abnormal in the service business. I know there's some Brazil and so forth but, that's a huge diversion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, the other abnormal factor was, there was this very significant pre-buy of engines that went into truck production in the &#x2013; so we sold the engines in the fourth quarter of '06; first quarter of '07 we virtually didn't sell any. And those engines that we sold in the fourth quarter of '06 went into truck production in the first quarter of '07. This year, we actually shipped engines in the first quarter of '08. So, it was up from a terribly anemic level in the first quarter of '07, so that &#x2013; I think it's the inventory &#x2013; the work in process inventory of the truck manufacturers swing is what explains it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, one more point I think, and this is actually probably the biggest point is, the three-month average that's on our website is December, January and February. And December '06 was a monster month. So I think when you look at the three-month rolling average that's January through March, which will get posted up a little bit later today, you'll see a different picture as December drops off and March comes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on machinery, the operating margin performance; I'm not going to belabor it too much, but it kind of was flattish sequentially. Do you think it's possible to get that back to double-digits this year, or is it more of a future state?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess almost anything is possible. I mean we do have price increases built into the rest of the year. But right now, it's below 10%, it's in the mid-8s. I think certainly for the full year it would be tough to get it above 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then within the engines business you had a commentary in the release about a 21% decline in electric power in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that market-driven or was that a decision to reallocate some higher horsepower engines elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's actually really a little bit of both. You'll find that throughout the world, sales of petroleum were up very nicely. And so there's &#x2013; again, we're supply-constrained on big engines and I think in the first quarter a little more went to petroleum than electric power. But that said, there is a link in terms of demand between commercial construction and electric power and in the United States, as commercial construction comes off, we would expect some weaker demand for the small and mid-size, in particular, electric power.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alex Blanton. Please announce your affiliation and then pose your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Ingalls &amp; Snyder. I'm going to go back to a similar question, similar to what David Raso asked, only nearer to the earnings per share. Your first quarter is typically well below the other quarters in EPS, but if I annualized the first quarter now, I get $5.80 which is only $0.10 below the midpoint of your range, which you haven't increased even though you had a big surprise &#x2013; positive surprise in the first quarter. So, could you comment on that? Why haven't you adjusted the range of EPS up a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question Alex, and I think that your comment that the first quarter is usually a lower quarter in terms of profitability for the full year is true. It usually is a little bit less than average, and that was the case last year as well. But I'll go back to the point that you made before. If you annualized the first quarter, it is around the midpoint of our guidance, or pretty close to the midpoint of our guidance. You know it's still early in the year. The material cost situation is a little bit fluid at this point; we've just announced a price increase. I think at this time of the year in the first quarter it's probably a little bit too early to make any changes to full-year guidance, I think we need a little more time to pass to see how things are actually going to play out. Economically in the world, it's a pretty, it's probably as diverse as we've seen it in terms of our business. There is significant growth outside the U.S., significant weakness inside the U.S. I think the answer to your question really is, it's too early in the year to change the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The follow-up question relates to what you referred to as pull-through, but I think you'd agree that's really incremental margin is what we usually talk about, incremental margin on sales, and I adjusted the first-quarter gross margin line for currency and came up with about just under 18%. And then I adjusted it for mix based on what you told us earlier in the call, and it came out to 24%, excluding the mix effect that you gave us. But still that is, you said that's what one would have expected I think is what you said. But really it isn't. In the past, when you've been filling up capacity, you have usually achieved 30 to 35% or even more, sometimes as much as 40%, incremental margins on sales increases like this. Now at CONEXPO I asked that was it true that the poor incremental margins that you have been experiencing for the past year, if that was the result of capital expenditures being very high and expanding capacity to meet future demands through 2010 or 2012 that you have talked about growing at very good rates for the next few years. That would raise your costs and hurt your incremental margins as you expand that capacity. Now is that what occurred in the first quarter? You really haven't addressed that. You've talked about costs of materials being up and so on and offset by price, but you haven't really talked about the cost of expansion and how that is hurting your incremental margins at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This will be a long discussion Alex that we could probably take off-line maybe later today as well. But in general, our margins overall, there is one thing if you're talking, are your margin rates at a level where you think they should be long-term? And another question is how did they change from the first quarter of last year? We're kind of mixing up both answers here, but I think to your point the fact that we're close to capacity, the fact that over the last few years we've had cost increases that have been at or quite at the same level of price increases, part of that being driven by the need to increase capacity, part of that, the impact of pushing the supply chain in some areas kind of to the limits and having ongoing disruptions. There is a whole myriad of reasons why I think margins on an absolute basis are not where we would want them to be. Geographic mix is certainly one of those. In terms of quarter-over-quarter, we did okay on price versus cost. Our quarter-over-quarter issue, I think, more than anything, was currency impacts and the sales mix. We can pick this up maybe later Alex, if you would like I could delve into it more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah well, quarter-over-quarter, you weren't that bad. It was year-over-year that was the problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, I think it sort of feels like you have got a point there to me. I mean we have substantially increased our investment in capacity expansion and modernization and actually CapEx that will help us take costs down going forward. But it does take a certain cost structure to effectively deploy that capital, get it up and operating. And of course our depreciation is going up in the wake of some higher CapEx that we have had the last two years. So I think directionally I think your question is correct in that we are driving some costs there that will be very beneficial to us long term. But we are in this game for the long term. We have got three new factories under construction as we speak in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And Jim we are starting to see some of the benefits on the engine side with the Lafayette expansion. It started a couple years ago. Some of that capacity is coming online and that was one of the things that drove the improved numbers with engines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is true. It is going to steadily come to us and with that and coupled with process improvements we are making, as we mentioned in the release we are still seeing, particularly on the machine side, disruptions in the supply chain that we are very committed to shipping as-delivered product quality at the highest level. So we find these things, we are working to be sure we get them corrected and fixed before they get in customers' hands, and there is some disruption there as we are running right at the edge of capacity for most of our core and large machines. But I think we are doing the right thing for the long term here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It is Cleveland Research. Good morning. I am wondering if you could talk more specifically about the change in the outlook in North America for non-residential construction. What were you thinking about before and what is the current outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think our view of construction overall continues to weaken. If you look at the dealer retail sales for the first couple of months of the year, and actually what is going to be posted up here a little bit for March, they continued to weaken. We see our sales to housing a bit weaker than we thought. We see sales to non-residential a bit weaker than we thought. So I do not know that it is significantly inconsistent with our overall view. It is not a dramatic decline from where we have been, but modestly lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never had the bubble with the non-residential construction that we had in housing, certainly. In most of the country there is not a big overbuild or excess capacity. But it is tailing off and it has been. It went off faster than we thought in '07, and has steadily tailed off, and I think the current credit market conditions in the US are taking it down further, in line with the recessionary expectations that we have for the US economy this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, let me ask you a question about currency. How much of an impact of currency is in the 5 to 10% revenue outlook? Presumably, it's a larger number than it would have been 90 days ago with the change in currency relationships, and with that change and the fact that you guys disclosed that you have lost $0.11 here to currency, is that something we should expect to continue each quarter if the currency relationships stay the way they are right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a fairly complex question, Mark, and I will do my best. We do have a Q&amp;A on currency in the release that might help a little bit. But in our original outlook, we did expect that currency was going to be a slight negative this year. And in our revised outlook that we came out with today, actually, what we said in the back is we thought the price increase that we were putting in place would be about offsetting the impact of higher material costs and a slightly more negative year-on-year view of currency. The piece of currency that's in other income and expense really doesn't have much to do with what happened in the prior year, it's whether or not you had a net change during the quarter. So, the piece that was down in other income is likely not to &#x2013; well I shouldn't say likely, it depends on what rates do for the rest of the year. But if rates don't move much further from where they are now for the rest of the year, that should be a much more neutral impact. In fact, I think in the last half of last year, it was negative. So, if it's neutral, at least down there, that would be a quarter-over-quarter positive. We will have to see how rates come out.</p>
          <p>For the impact on operating profit, again, we don't try and forecast exchange rates. Heck, we have a tough enough time figuring out how to forecast machine sales. And at today's rates, we are weaker than our original outlook and we're weaker than last year. So, probably a continued negative impact for the piece of our results that are related to translating non-US sales and non-US costs. That said, we do export in dollars to territories where the competition is dollar based even if it's not in the US, places like the Middle East and much of Latin America and some of Asia. And the weaker dollar is actually helping a bit on a competitive standpoint in those areas and I think one of the reasons that particularly outside North America, we were able to do a midyear price increase is in some of those regions. So, on balance, I think a weaker dollar is helping us in terms of our ability to pass through that midyear price increase. But on a straight translation basis, it's probably a little bit more negative. I hope that wasn't too convoluted of an answer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If your unchanged top-line outlook for the full year now incorporates better price realization and a little bit more favorable currency translation than previously that implies that your overall outlook for volume has declined a little bit. Your outlook for North America has come down. Your outlook for International has gone up. Is your outlook for volume internationally gone up? Or are the increases in your forecast there is strictly a function of the price and currency changes that you were just talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a couple of things. One, price and currency are both an impact, and two, remember for a lot of our products, right now, we're capacity constrained. And so as North America declines, it gives us the opportunity to actually sell more, provide more of the output in some of these &#x2013; outside North America. In fact, our exports in the first quarter were up pretty dramatically. So, some of it is volume, some of it can be price and some of it is currency as well. I think, and I don't want to overly dwell on this one point, but I think it's a fair statement to say that overall, as Jim said a little while ago, I think we're probably more confident certainly about where the top line is going to end up this year. But, it's still, we're here at the end of the first quarter in what is kind of an unprecedented time in history with North America so weak and the rest of the world so strong. It's just a little too early I think to change the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's appropriate. So, in other words, it's probably not appropriate for me to assume any significant change in expected volume, but rather that your outlook has improved slightly, mostly as a result of price and currency, for the top line?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. And then just for clarification purposes, you talked, Mike, about the offsetting strength in the services businesses in North America and how they help stabilize the top line there. Can we infer from that that you meant to tell us that you registered year-to-year increases in Logistics, Three MAN and in the real services businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what I was really trying to say when I mentioned that is it kind of goes back to an earlier comment, I think when David asked about truck engine sales. If you look at what we post up on the website as retail statistics it's only new machine and engine sales. It is not &#x2013; it doesn't include the rest of the service-related piece of the business. So, I was just trying to highlight that when you look at what happened with <mark type="audio gap" /> (53:48 &#x2013; 53:54) fewer sales to users in North America, you'll get a much more negative number than if you look at our sales. And there are a couple of impacts; one is that those retail sales numbers that we post up monthly, don't include all these service-related businesses at all; and secondly, then I highlighted the dealer inventory build in the first quarter. But I think...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Well, there's also &#x2013; you could &#x2013; Progress Rail was up; Financial Products is up; Cat Logistics is up; Solar is up; Parts in the U.S. down, but substantially, substantially less than retail sales.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Barry Bannister, Stifel Nicolaus. One of my questions earlier was answered, so as my follow-up, I'm concerned that since engines tend to be sold at spot, you're getting the full benefit of oil and gas and EPG. But minerals are also pretty strong, and I don't think CAT is monetizing the full conditions in the mining equipment business. So I'm concerned that maybe you have some global mining agreements or lack of pricing flexibility in the face of steel and tire issues that's restraining your margins in that segment. Can you talk about your mining equipment margins versus the cycle of the last decade, which was very strong as well, where I think you got better margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me address global mining, sort of in the middle of all that, Barry. But first I'll say, engines at spot, I think if what you mean there is we &#x2013; outside of Truck we don't have just a few big customers that are locking in an agreement for a long period of time and outside of Truck that's true. But let's just talk about mining and our pricing and partnership agreements with the global mining companies. They are very favorable agreements for us; they do a ton of positive things for Caterpillar. We have an exceptionally good view into what's going on in the marketplace, they have provisions for aftermarket content, they protect us and the customer on pricing, but I think it does lag &#x2013; the pricing piece of it does lag.</p>
          <p>Many of them have built in into the agreements, pricing escalators that are different but they're based on other marketplace indicators. So, if the point is are our machine prices aren't rising anything like commodity prices, I think that's probably true but, on balance, we really like these agreements, they drive strong cooperation, they help on volume and production planning, they give us a very tight relationship with the customer, and I think have actually improved our aftermarket with them as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even on the engines side, most of our large engines, for example, are sold with some pretty long lead time commitments. The price increases that we're seeing coming through the market now, we announced an extended period of time ago. But if you're building a ship and you buy the engines from us and we make a commitment on ship dates and price, we honor that. So, there's not instant flexibility even with large engines that are going to customers who buy relatively small numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know that it's granular and it reaches back to a distant memory of the last cycle, but, would you be saying that the margins on large mining trucks, where CAT has always enjoyed a strong share, are less this cycle due to the invention of the GMAs than it was in the prior cycle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have those &#x2013; I don't have the margins for the prior cycle or '98 or '97 in front of me, but I think on balance, we like where we are with mining overall. And I don't think even in a prior cycle we would have passed through giant price increases to these customers. So I think on balance, we're pretty happy with where we are. I think the operating inefficiencies is the area that prior &#x2013; we have opportunities to improve our margins there and that's because we are literally operating at above capacity levels to try to meet customer demands and doing a lot of expediting to try to meet their needs at some margin erosion due to the higher costs associated with that. And we're investing simultaneously to put capacity in, working very hard with key suppliers that are unique to this large product and we're just working right at the bleeding edge, and we have been for a couple of years, and demand keeps getting stronger. So, some of the new investments that we're making, I think, will give us significant improvements in operating efficiency, enhance our product, and improve our margin as we move out with the mining industry but I don't think it's a pricing issues.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Bernstein. Actually just want to follow-up on the revenue side of this again. So the way you characterize this is weaker North America developed markets generally, Western Europe and Japan, you're seeing weakening. You see continued, frankly, pretty extraordinary strength in emerging markets. The way you aggregate your geographies, Europe, Africa, Middle East, for instance, effectively smooshes together really big emerging markets like CIS, Middle East, parts of Africa types of mining with a highly developed market. So if investors believe that Western Europe is slowing, how big a deal should that really be for the group you call EAME?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll just sort of give you an order of magnitude ballpark here. Western Europe would be order of magnitude &#x2013; and this varies quarter-by-quarter, but somewhere in the ballpark of half of EAME. But I'll tell you, most of the growth or much of the growth in EAME has been driven by CIS, Africa and Middle East.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The point is to your question, we are supply constrained in the region for essentially, all of our core and large equipment. So to the extent that Western Europe now is going to be slower than we expect this year, that supply will go more to the Middle East, southern cone of Africa and the Eastern European CIS region and we don't expect any significant change in the total. I mean, it's shifting within the region, but within EAME, the total that we will supply is going to be about the same as we currently see the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what we're really saying is a slowdown in Western Europe, at least in 2008, if it doesn't turn into a big recession, likely, actually still means that you continue to grow in that region without as if almost there wasn't slowing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; and again, I think that goes back to the point that I made earlier and Jim made, for a lot of products, we're selling as much as we can produce.</p>
