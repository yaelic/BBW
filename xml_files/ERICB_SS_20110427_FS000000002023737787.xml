          <p>Welcome to the Ericsson's Analyst and Media Conference Call for the first quarter report. To view visual aids for this call, please log on to www.ericcson.com/press or www.ericcson.com/investors. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, a replay will be available one hour after today's conference.</p>
          <p>&#xC5;se Lindskog will now open the call. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ericsson's call today. With me here today in the room I have Hans Vestberg, President and CEO of Ericsson. Jan Frykhammar, who is our Chief Financial Officer. I have also Johan Wibergh, who is the Head of our Business unit in Networks; and in addition and also Magnus Mandersson, who is heading up our Business unit Global Services.</p>
          <p>So first of all, ladies and gentlemen, I have to remind you that during the call today, we will be making forward-looking statements. These statements, they are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions which are subject to risk and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially due to factors mentioned in today's press release and discussed this conference call. So I encourage you to read about the risks and uncertainties in our earnings report, as well as in our annual report for year 2010.</p>
          <p>So with that said then, I would like to hand over to Hans Vestberg for comments about our performance and plans going forward. So here, Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, &#xC5;se. I will go briefly through the first quarter result, and I will be doing that sharing with my colleagues here in the room, as well.</p>
          <p>First of all, just a reminder that the result for the P&amp;L is in 2011, including restructuring. In 2010, it's excluding restructuring. And I will point out when it's not, but just to have that clear. We will not make any specific comment on that, but it's so that the 2011 is loaded with restructuring charges, but 2010 is not when we compare.</p>
          <p>So we ended the first quarter with SEK 3 billion in sales. To summarize in one simple line, mobile broadband is driving a lot of that growth around the globe. That's the short of it. The net income SEK 4.1 billion, compared to SEK 1.3 three last year, and this is net, net, both of them so these are apples-to-apples as these are including restructuring, both of them. And that's driven by increased volumes but also the improved profitability in the Networks segment.</p>
          <p>Cash flow ended at minus SEK 2.1 compared to SEK 3 billion positive last year, and this is adjusted cash flow which means we expect the restructuring shortage that were cashed out in the operational cash flow. The reason for the negative cash flow is the higher level work in progress in the regions which is work in progress and the continued ramp up for production that is increasing our working capital from the profit where we expect a good cash flow, but what we are tying up is the capital on the inventory side especially.</p>
          <p>Net sales up 17% year-over-year, 25% organically and in constant currency. We have now five regions growing out of the ten. If we take the segments quickly, we'll come back to them. Networks up 35%, very much driven by mobile growth but there was a GSM edge in China, which is partly driven also by smartphones using Edge, I would say. Global Services down 4%. And here, before Magnus will talk about it, just a reminder, this is, of course, a business that are very much impacted by currencies as we are trading services in local currencies. And they are growing if we subtract that currency change <mark type="ph" /> as well had (4:26) for one year, for year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Multimedia, flat or minus 1%, and here's the same, of course, with currency, this would be growth. We see revenue management coming back in volumes but not to the extent before but definitely coming back, IPX, as well. That is quick on the net sales.</p>
          <p>Net income or profitability, as I said, SEK 4.1 billion year-over-year, dramatic improvement, 220% quarter-over-quarter, down 7%. We need to remember that volumes in Q4 was substantially &#x2013; was higher. This is impacted by high volumes but also on the profitability improvements in the Network segment especially.</p>
          <p>As we have talked now for two, three quarters, about the network monetization, they have started and they are partly impacted the first quarter. The other thing that's impacting, of course, is when it comes to net income when we compare apples-to-apples, including restructuring. We had less structuring in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>If we take the regions, quickly here, you can say that we have five regions growing: North America, Latin America, Northern Europe and Central Asia. We have China, Northeast Asia and India. And a couple of quick notes. North America is continuing with expansion on the mobile broadband, but also we have a very good service business there, so that's continuing to grow. Latin America is up 1%, coming from a lower investment level last year, and of course, with currency, this would be higher, but we see definitely mobile broadband and rural expansions happening.</p>
          <p>Northern Europe and Central Asia, here is Russia one of the markets that is really driving it and we see capacity expansions both in 2G and 3G in the region, but particularly in Russia. We are growing 45% in that region.</p>
          <p>India, we say easy comparison. Not sure it's fair, but last year, we had an impact in the first half both from waiting for 3G investment but also from the security issues there were, so we had a lower volume there than normal. This quarter, we're coming back on more normal volumes but clearly we're now deploying 3G in India and we're rolling that out.</p>
          <p>Finally, China and Northeast Asia, all main markets in that region are growing well, that is Korea, it is Japan and China. And mobile broadband combined with GSM in China are the main drivers. You can also see on the region update that the Mediterranean and Middle East has an impact of the political unrest in North Africa and in the Middle East, which means that some markets there have been low in investment, more in maintenance mode, for obvious reasons. And then, the three remaining markets, Western Europe, Sub-Sahara, Southeast Asia, they are on a lower volume as we have seen for quite a couple of quarters. But on the other hand, we also see that they are coming new modernization in Europe and things are start happening in Africa. So it's a mixed picture, five regions growing and five regions not growing.</p>
          <p>I will hand over to Johan to talk about Japan and the global supply chain. Johan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans. So let me comment a little bit on the tragic event that happened in Japan with the earthquake and the tsunami. First of all, it has had no impact on our sales in Q1 and our production volumes in Q1 have been extremely high, as you have seen from our results. And our global component supply chain is partly dependent on Japan. We have no production in Japan but we source some important components from Japan. And so we anticipate then, we estimate then that there will be delays in delivery of certain products so that we cannot fully meet the strong demand that we see for our products.</p>
          <p>This is not the first time that we have had earthquakes or fires in factories disturbing our supply chain, so therefore, we have a well-established procedure for how to act in this case. So within a few hours from the earthquake happening, our crisis management team was active and we had since a few years back then a request that all our suppliers to tell us which component that are produced in which factories, so within a few hours we knew exactly of the potential components that may be affected of this event and that enabled us during the Friday, Saturday and Sunday with this event and to go out on the spot market to buy as many of these as was needed and also placing orders to second source suppliers of these components. We also immediately started evaluating alternative components of key areas.</p>
          <p>The best estimate that we have is that the majority of the delayed volumes will be delivered before the end of the third quarter and, of course, this is also dependent on the overall recovery in Japan. It can go quicker. It can also take longer time but overall, I'm really impressed with how quickly Japan is recovering, how hard they are working and the speed of things are getting back to normal. So that of course makes all of this a little bit harder to judge how long a time various things will take.</p>
          <p>Moving on then to the next slide and looking at how we work in these cases is that you see on the left side then that's the normal production, you have then the earthquake. We used then of course a lot of components we have in stock so we can continue to produce. And so far, it has been a good production month in April. Then we go to the spot market to complement the missing components. We put in alternative sources and what you have there in white in the middle is then the potential gap that we then tried to close as much as possible. You get the redesign of the products and then have you the recovery in Japan.</p>
          <p>So with all of that, what happens normally in these type of cases is that the first day things look really, really bad. You plan and anticipate the worst. Then as your mitigation activities kicks in as time goes by, you get more and more improvements, and then we have seen a lot of good improvements the last few weeks.</p>
          <p>With that, I leave the supply chain and move over to the segment, and then I take my own segment, Networks then. So as has been reported, we have had a good start of the year, 35% up year-over-year. This is being driven by the market share increase that we are seeing back in 2010 that we talked about in the quarter report, and this strong portfolio that we have. And we get good really good feedback from our customers on the technology leadership and the performance of our portfolio. That then has resulted in high sales of our RBS 6000, our multi standard radio base station that we successfully launched in last year, and for us it's very important, because this is really when we have been replacing our existing radio-based station families that we had been having for some 10 years, that we have replaced a new generation. That switch has gone really good. So high sales of RBS 6000, high sales for packet-core, IP routers and microwave backhaul.</p>
          <p>It was a highlight then that Q1 would be good when it comes to GSM. And GSM Edge in China as fall back for mobile broadband. And overall, CDMA driven by mobile broadband, CDMA EV-DO.</p>
          <p>Last year, we made an acquisition of 50% of the company LG Nortel from Nortel, nowadays LG Ericsson, and we have been really happy with the contracts that we have then gained in several areas. So that has performed quite well.</p>
          <p>Moving over to margins, we have had then in Q1 a positive volume effect. We are quite volume dependent, and of course, when volumes go up, it gives a good effect on the bottom line. But we also had a good business mix of expansions and upgrades in this quarter. But we also have seen some of the efficiency gains. We've been working quite consistently both on the setup of the portfolio, what it takes to produce it and how it is built in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Finally, our network modernization projects, in Europe, we estimate when these new projects that we have on so far, when they are executed, we would have gained 3% market point in 2G and 3G in Europe.</p>
          <p>And with that, I hand over to Magnus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Johan. So let me go through then the Global Services quarter results. Let me start with that we are still growing our market share on the Global Services market. We are now well above 11%. I think that's worthwhile to mention. We are growing our business in five out of 10 regions. A year ago, we did two regions out of 10. We're seeing still a strong growth in Professional Service, I would say, with 3% year on year, but also 11% from Managed Services and a good completion in bringing in new contracts. We continue to expand old contracts as well as win new ones.</p>
          <p>TeliaSonera's subsidiary Yoigo, we have a four-year extension in Spain. We did our first Managed Service contract with EMOBILE in Japan. We are also selecting to modernize the IP network with du in the Middle East. We're into the media and over-the-top services with MediaCorp in Singapore, as well as then the full modernization managed service of the DTAC asset of Telenor in Thailand.</p>
          <p>Also, we're building up capabilities in our global centers, both in Romania as well as in India, serving then the increasing need and demand of OSS/BSS transformations as well as greater part of plan design engineering of mobile broadband. Then moving into a bit of the lowlights, we are seeing then that we are getting less integration projects on the product near services, especially on the systems integration than revenue management in the quarter as well as in voice core. Mr. Vestberg commented in the main press conference.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing then that we are, of course, having quite a lot of disturbance in the installation phase and completion of our NRO business based on the disturbances we had of the industry component shortages previously the past six to nine months. That has given us then a loss in network rollout and, of course, this is also giving a bit lower margin for the segment and, of course, a little bit lower margin is also &#x2013; is not met with the fixed cost we are having, so that is also taking a bit of the margin out of the business. We should also remember that the restructuring cost is not included in the result last year, which we have now in 2011.</p>
          <p>I think I will leave the comments now over to Hans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Magnus. Thank you, Johan. Quickly on Multimedia; as I said, flat sales. We see Multimedia brokering, growing well and revenue management coming back, not to historic levels but clearly on higher levels than last year. TV, that had a good round last year, all through, I would say, had a bit of a weaker quarter this time. Overall, the volumes are not creating a profit, we have a 7% negative EBITA due to basically the volumes and product mix and &#x2013; but is partly offset over the continued efficiency work in Multimedia.</p>
          <p>Let me also mention a little bit about the joint ventures. Sony Ericsson report last week, what we can say is that they made a fifth consecutive quarter profit. They're arranging a new product in the Android segment, which are doing well, and we're looking with excitement at those products. ST Ericsson, a little bit different, they're on a different cycle. They have a legacy business that is falling and at the same time, they are now introducing the new platforms, which are addressing the smartphone segment.</p>
          <p>However, there is not an offset yet from the new portfolio and the decline on legacy, so we're widening the loss in Q1 compared to Q4 and it will take some time to ramp up the new portfolio to offset the legacy business and this is a very critical moment for ST Ericsson to achieve that design wins into production. They are now present in seven out of the nine largest handset manufacturer in the world. But it is going to be a phase right now that were going to be critical for them to really see that they are executing well on the new portfolio.</p>
          <p>Ericsson is, of course, is very committed to create a very good chipset manufacturer that's going to compete in the smartphone market and we'll be there to support them in this transition. Finally then, the joint venture has created $0.5 billion loss, mainly a loss from ST Ericsson and again from Sony Ericsson, all and all, almost at the same level as last year but a little bit different distributed between the joint ventures.</p>
          <p>Jan, I'll leave it over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans. Good afternoon to all of you. And let me then give you some highlights on the profitability and cash flow in the quarter. A lot has been said I think on the profitability already. I think highlights in the quarter was clearly the strong volume in Networks, together with the business mix, similar business mix that we enjoyed last year also and prevailed in this quarter with expansions and upgrades driven then by mobile broadband. Continue to see good momentum on the efficiency gains in cost of sales both on the product side as well as on the Services side. We had a one-off sale of a patent that created a revenue of some SEK 300 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, a bit on the margin, you can see for yourself, India volume has increased a lot in the quarter. We started to see some impact of the network modernization projects, and I think on that point, compared to where we were in January or when we met for the Q4 report, I would say that, overall, these projects are executing according to the overall plan but slightly later than anticipated, but will still have some impact in the quarter. Again, the net impact of the margin is very much impacted by our ability and capability to generate mitigating actions here.</p>
          <p>On the operating expense side, then, R&amp;D, up 10% year-over-year. This is mainly driven by the planned higher investment during this year in the radio side to secure LTE but as well then on the IP portfolio with the Smart Service Router for instance, that these are important developments for this year. We also have a bit of an increase related to the acquisition of the LG Ericsson asset.</p>
          <p>On the selling and G&amp;A side, plus 10%. Again, quite easy explanation there, LG Ericsson, and then we continued to have quite a lot of activity around the LTE trials in the market. We should remember then when we look at these numbers, there is around SEK 200 million of restructuring charges impacting the gross margin and there are around SEK 200 million of restructuring charges impacting research and development expenses in 2011 Q1.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the operating margin, 11.9% versus 10.1%, and again, we have now included restructuring charges in this quarter and excluded for last year. But, again, this is related to the volume growth in Networks. That business, as Johan mentioned, has high fixed cost structure in R&amp;D, and when you get the revenue growth there, it impacts the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Looking at the net income, the only thing I want to highlight there is that we have now disclosed an earnings per share measurement excluding amortization of intangible assets, and that's on that page. That's on that slide as well. If we look at the balance sheet, some ratios, days of sales outstanding, was an increase compared to Q4 and a decrease compared to Q1 of last year.</p>
          <p>As in Q1 of last year, the reason for the decrease then is related to volume. But as well as then that we continue to focus on collections and turnaround of receivables. Compared to Q4, it's purely a volume difference. And inventory days, as you can see for yourself here, we have had an increasing trend basically during 2010 and into 2011. The majority of this inventories is then related to projects or what we call regional inventory here. And that is reflecting the higher activity level in the market. And then as well, there is some more inventory with regards to ramp up of production as Johan mentioned.</p>
          <p>If we look at the cash, the thing I want to highlight here, first of all, we continue to have a strong net cash position, SEK 48.3 billion in the quarter. If you look at the operating cash flow there, minus SEK 2.9 billion or minus SEK 2.1 billion adjusted for restructuring charges for outlays. From an income point of view, we end at positive cash flows, but from a working capital point of view, we tied up capitals and net net, we had a negative impact. So our main issue in the quarter is actually working capital.</p>
          <p>So with that said, Hans, I hand back to you or to &#xC5;se.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">

          <p>Thank you very much, Jan. So then, operator, we are ready then to open up for questions.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As always, please limit yourself to one question at a time and please keep your questions at a broad level. Detailed information is provided in the reports, and Ericsson's Investor Relations and Media Relations team will be happy to take additional questions and discuss further details with you after the call.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Excuse me, Jeff Kvaal from Barclays Capital is now online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yes, gentlemen. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could help us interpret the 35% year-over-year growth in Network? To what extent is that a function of market growth or market share? Are there organic elements that are &#x2013; or inorganic elements that contribute to that? Another factor might be you've suggested the GSM pickup was continuing. Is that a function of a snap back given component availability, or should we think of that as a sustainable trend? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jeff. This is Hans. What this inorganic growth or whatever, it's the Korean business, that's the only thing we have now that is an acquisition that we didn't have in the first quarter last year, but that is a smaller piece, so a very small piece of the total growth in the quarter. I think that we have said before mobile broadband and the market share gain in mobile broadband, but also that we are present in the market that has a demand and a high level of smartphones is also important.</p>
          <p>We have a good footprint in the world. And, of course, being very present in North America, Korea, Japan, that are driving a lot of the mobile broadband and being very early out with smartphones, that is very important. And that has been a consistent strategy for us to be strong in these markets and we are strong in these markets. And then as yourself added, of course, the GSM in China was also a contributing factor this quarter. So I think you highlighted important, when we talk about mobile broadband and remember what, you want that, it's not only the radio access, it's also the parts, everything from packet-core and routers, etc., that are impacting on this growth because that's the mobile broadband.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Hans, would it be fair to say in GSM broadly speaking that the growth rates in 3G and 4G are now sustainably offsetting what, the 2G's decline from prior years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. I think that we have been talking for four quarters about that we have a mobile broadband growth and which we have had, but we couldn't see it on the segment Networks because of the decline in the voice segment. In this quarter, we see that coming through as we are sort of past the curve there and have a growth in the mobile broadband. But also remember, we are in 10 regions and we are growing five. So it's still regions that are cautious, and but there are markets that are growing well. So you're right, we are past the curve on the mobile broadband there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim Boddy from Goldman Sachs is now online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Another growth rate question and then a quick follow-up on the balance sheet. Should we think about the U.S. as being, in some ways, a lead indicator for Europe where smartphone adoption is just a little behind or are there really genuinely different dynamics in those markets? Because, obviously, Europe is still more or less down from what we can tell and your regional split is, perhaps, surprising. And then secondly, just on the balance sheet, an update on your plans for what's really now an enormous cash pile contributing very little to earnings. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start, if we should extrapolate on North America &#x2013; remember that North America is very early out and adopters of the smartphones and the tablets and applications, so I wouldn't replicate it straight over. But, of course, the usage we see across the globe being fairly equal on the smartphone. It's not that different from the U.S., it's just that the volumes are so much larger there.</p>
          <p>Then, of course, we have in the European market, the network modernization ongoing but don't forget that we have a strong service business in Europe, as well. So it's not only Networks there. We need to balance that out. So, of course, we're going to see more of that trend. But the Networks have been built different, as well, from the beginning. So there are many factors to factor in when you draw that conclusion if it's going to be the same in Europe or not. So you have to take it market-by-market and understand where they are.</p>

          <p>Yeah, okay. So, well, so to start with, and I'm not sure, yeah, it's a strong balance sheet. I would like it to be even stronger. We have a payout here in our dividends that happened a few days ago, so some of the cash pile will come down due to that. But I think overall then, what we have is, of course, the same messages as we have had before. It is so that being strong from a financial position generates business, creates trust, and creates long-term sustainability. And I think that is very important for us. Having said all of that, if we decide to change the way we work with our balance sheet, I'm sure that we will come back and talk to all of you at the same time about that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Hans, there's been a proposal for T-Mo and AT&amp;T to merge in the U.S. What kind of exposure would you have if this were to go through in terms of decline? You are a supplier to both of these two and would it impact any of your plans for LTE? So it's two-part, LTE, but also the bread and butter sales that you do in 3G and GSM in the United States, what kind of impact would that merger have? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as I comment before on T-Mobile and AT&amp;T, first of all, we are main supplier to both of them and wherever this acquisition will go, we will support them in that. And for us, as where they are and what type of plans they have at this stage, it's not relevant. I mean, I think we need to be cautious. We want AT&amp;T and T-Mobile talking about their business and their mergers. But most important for us, we are the main supplier to both of them and we would like to, of course, to be part of any changes in the marketplace. And then, I think we're well positioned for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then you had the question on LTE, if this has an impact on LTE. We can only follow the external announcements that is communicated from these customers and we are not seeing any changes in those plans for LTE that have been communicated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So as your two largest customers in the U.S. market, obviously this would have an impact on the growth rate in the United States. Any feel at all, can you bracket that for us in terms of how large that might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I remember, we have many more customers in North America as well. Of course, these are important customers, but we are working with Verizon, we're working with Sprint, we're working with Rogers, and many other of the medium sized operators as well. So we have a broad base in North America. And that said, I'm not here to speculate in the merger, how it will go and in what sense. I think that these two separate companies will do that. I think that we are well positioned to be part of it.</p>

          <p>Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse is now on the line with a question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. My question is just around the strength of CDMA in the quarter. And I guess, do you expect the CDMA business to remain at this high level of sales for some time, or could that actually peak and start declining? And what impact might that have on your gross margins and your overall margins going forward? The reason why I'm asking is, I think if the network modernization in Europe comes back and CDMA peaks, it kind of feels like your margins could have actually peaked for this year and going forward for some time, especially given you're not doing much cost cuttings. I just want to really understand that dynamic. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Kulbinder, here is Johan. So, I mean, it is, of course, right, that, I mean, going forward, we do expect CDMA sales to decline. And the pace of that will be dependent on how much &#x2013; how quickly LTE will be built out and also the usage of the CDMA networks. And currently, the CDMA EV-DO is growing quite a lot and usage is really going up. So today it's not really clear the pace of how that will happen but, of course, it will one day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can say from our initial plans on CDMA that we anticipate that we see a longer tail than we had in sort of our plans when we acquired CDMA. So &#x2013; but as you well said, it depends now on the proliferation of new CDMA handsets coming out and how it will continue. Right now, we see a good growth on CDMA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on the mix change of the business. If network modernization ramps in the mix, are you signaling then that gross margins could actually see some pressure in the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We already in this quarter mentioned that we had partly having modernization in the mix but we have also mitigating factors and a good business mix. We will, of course, see more of modernization as we go forward, but we also see right now it takes a little bit longer time than we previously anticipated. And when I say previously anticipated, it's Ericsson, not operators. So we don't ask them if they are delayed or something. It's how we anticipated this would happen. But it's fairly complex modernization, so they will take some more time. So they will be in the mix, but they were already part of the mix in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my question is, Hans, what are the mitigating factors? Because from a restructuring point of view, the last couple of years I understood that there was ongoing cost cutting. The pace of your restructuring at the Groups' level clearly isn't quite where it was historically. So what are the other mitigating factors that could offset if network modernization rises, why your margins may not go down, what else could you do, for example? What else are you doing?</p>

          <p>We are doing a lot on efficiency and we can talk through with what we do in Network and Services that we are doing everyday in the company, being present in 180 countries and having a portfolio that we have.

And we will come back in the Management Briefing, talk about a little bit what we're doing in Network and Services to continue to bring down our cost points on our product and services.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hans, is Ericsson now in a position to see improving trends in Network EBITA margins because of your substantive market position and also the volumes? Industry structure analysis seems to indicate that the largest player eventually ends up with the largest portion of the profits. So if you could give us your thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we are striving all the time for improving our, both our growth and our profitability long-term, and that's also how we work with management and setting targets and Magnus, Johan, our regional heads. They are a combination of growth and earnings. And that's also what we have in our long-term variable pace that the Board has set out for us. So, we, of course, believe that scale is very important in this business to have a leverage model, and we saw that in Networks this quarter, that when we get this type of volume growth, our fixed cost is, of course, fixed for quite a lot, and then it falls, too, quite a lot. So, we are, of course, <mark type="ph" /> think it's a board with game (38:15). Johan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To add on a little bit here. We are constantly working with our portfolio to make sure it is competitive from every angle. We pride ourselves to have a technology leadership and see that we have had some customers on our new modernized portfolio has been extremely good. And I think those are part of the reason behind the strong demand we see. We constantly work on optimizing that portfolio to make it more cost effective, driving down production costs, driving down cost of components, but also work with scale across the portfolio. For instance, that the scale we have in Wireless then goes into the IP routers to the optical products, et cetera, so we create a scale of economy there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So with the scale position that you have now, with the scale position you that have now, does network modernization, does carrier consolidation, do those things have less of an issue, are they less of an issue in the future so that we can extrapolate your margin improvements at least for the next several quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it come with these cases, the network modernization case is always tricky, and when we work with this, we work on the business case over several years because we know there's always a cost of acquiring footprint and market share that you then earn back later on with upgrades and capacity expansions, and all of these deals are different and depending on the position and the hunger we have for these, we do a quite thorough evaluation of short- and long-term business case, and depending on competitive position, we then act differently. So it's too early to draw those conclusions that you have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think again, scale is everything in our business, as well as then reach the scale position. I think we have three generations of management of Global Services talking about process, networks and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:21) so this is really what we are doing every day, trimming our organization. The best case is, of course, for instance, if you have already field operations and you add on network rollout with the same field operations work force that's both scale and skill, then you really obtain good margins.</p>
          <p>Otherwise, and then, of course, obtain scale and skill on our global network operation centers. And that is what we're investing in, I would say, everyday. As I said before, we are basically increasing our scale and skill in the global centers in Romania and in India over the quarter, both for plan design and engineering as well as network cooperations for many services. So this is everything. The more we can do on remote deliveries, the greater margin we will obtain.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks for taking my question. My first question was on the component shortage and potential impact. I know you don't give specific guidance, but could we interpret your comments in a way that Q2 and potentially Q3 revenues would grow perhaps slightly less than typical seasonality? And then my second question was on Managed Services, it looks like revenues were flat year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The other services were actually down 9% year-on-year. Margins were pretty low. So I'm just wondering, I think you mentioned FX does impact Services more than Network, but can you maybe give a bit more color on the drivers of that, please? And is this a new sort of revenue growth and margin level? Or is there anything in the near future or in the pipeline that you think would change that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I start then. This is Jan, Kai. And if I talk a little bit about Q2 and possible impact on component shortages and relations to seasonality and things like that. I think, first of all, I think the underlying trend in the market around mobile broadband and mobile data is a trend that is happening, and I don't think that that trend will go away in the second quarter. I think we also need to remember that when we talk about possible impact on components, it is from a production volume point of view, and that depending a little bit on the type of contracts we have, one can say that perhaps in average, it's a lag there of say three months or so on revenue. But it's also so, of course, that if this situation creates incompleteness in deliveries, it may impact revenue both in Services as well as in Networks. But I think in average, one can say that the lag is probably three months.</p>
          <p>I think also that when it comes to seasonality, we need to remember that the first quarter was very strong from a Networks point of view. I think that we have a bit of a headwind when it comes to foreign exchange. So if you look at the very strong Swedish kronor here and the closing rate in the report, we will have some headwinds on top line as related to this. But overall, I would say, remember a bit of a strong Q1 for Networks, the fundamentals will still be there. There is a lag in terms of production volume versus revenue and then some FX headwinds. And Magnus, please, why don't you talk about Managed Services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, again, as we said, we have actually 11% growth year on year. I think that's worthwhile to mention. This is a long-term business that we're into. And then of course when we look into Professional Services and Services, we have <mark type="ph" /> of course an (44:51) impact that this is quite great.</p>
          <p>We are also having then, as I said before, an impact of restructuring costs, which was outside our P&amp;L a year ago. And we have invested quite a lot in offshoring and put a lot of efforts in the organizational structure around that, building up new competency, especially on OSS/BSS, where we believe now that we have a very competitive workforce, being able to do a lot of onshore and offshore projects.</p>
          <p>We have a seasonality, low activity as well on <mark type="ph" /> SI (45:27). I repeat that again, because we have &#x2013; there's an impact of lower sales in revenue management, as you might remember, from the <mark type="ph" /> B&amp;M (45:40) presentation, as well as then the NRO &#x2013; and this is giving us a mixed bag, of course, in between the quarters, and, of course, in the way the different regions is performing, as well as the product mix has changed. But I would say that the mobile broadband momentum is here and the managed service momentum is still here, and we're seeing that still.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I would just like to understand the mix dynamics here. Could you maybe tell me whether the Q1 mix was exceptionally good, or is this the norm for the rest of '11? And just regarding the network modernization, given that depth comes a little bit later and you have mitigating actions that will be put in place or are being put in place, does it actually mean that the impact in gross margins from the network modernization deals will actually be lower than what you initially thought because of this time lag? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will try to answer fairly brief. I think, first of all, gross margin was fairly good in the quarter. And we see both sides start from the negative end. I think we have a mix impact in regards to the fact that Services was quite &#x2013; the Services share was quite small in the quarter. I think when we are looking at the margins, we also know, and you know as well, that the margins vary a bit between quarters and I think if we look at the overall business mix, the business mix with capacity and upgrades is something that has been prevailing now for quite a few quarters, and that is driven by mobile broadband. I think on the modernization, as I said before, the aim is still to execute the majority of these projects during this year and into and next year. Some of the projects have started in the quarter but they will come gradually during the year.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you very much. Excuse me. A couple of questions on Services please. You mentioned that some of your Services revenues are tied to infrastructure sales and lag a little bit. I was hoping you could perhaps explain how that has happened in the past and what differences there might be now and how we can think about that going forward.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the network rollout, I presume, even if I take out the restructuring, there's still quite a negative number on the EBIT. I presume your costs haven't gone up significantly, so is this all about pricing that has been more aggressive as you start modernization projects, for example, Indian 3G rollouts? And if it is a pricing dynamic, has anything changed in the last couple of months to perhaps give us some visibility on how that loss might improve? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Jan, I'll try to answer that then. And I think in the network rollout margins in Q1, there are two, three impacts, really. The first impact is the fact that the margin has been impacted a bit by increased costs in the projects because we have been running with the project organization here during quite a few quarters with more of an unstable supply chain and that has impacted the margin in the network rollout business, and that will prevail until we see a more stable flow of &#x2013; in the supply chain. So that has not to do with the pricing dynamic.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the network modernization project, it is a bit of a pricing dynamic and that has to do with the fact that we sell a total solution, a project that includes both products and services but we report this according to how we have sold it, so to say, and from that point of view, you have a bit of a negative impact on the network rollout margin. And the third area then is that the network rollout revenue is lagging infrastructure and as these projects are finalized, we should also see revenue coming back in network rollout but that's of course depending on the acceptance criteria and so forth, in the projects. I hope that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any sort of lag effect from systems integration related to hardware or is it just network rollout that you're referring to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main reason is really network rollout related to hardware. I think what Magnus meant when he talked about system integration and it was the fact more underlying trend that we have seen in voice related CapEx decline throughout the last two years in the core business as well as revenue management, and then you do more of system integration work.</p>
          <p>So network rollout is more short term. The system integration is more midterm. On the other hand, which we also write in the report then, is that we see a good activity level or a demand for OSS and BSS transformational products, and that is then, of course, system integration in our internal terminology.</p>

          <p>And other than that, I would say that you have the things that we have discussed before. We have &#x2013; we have a good underlying demand on mobile broadband. There is a possible impact on the supply chain that we are working to mitigate. And those are the input I can give you in that respect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any floor you can provide us? Or are you leaving it open?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't guide for the quarter, again. We tried to give you the particulars that we have for the next quarter that you should think about, and again, we are working with all of these in order, of course, to continue to grow. That's our main ambition. But that's what we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the CDMA, the question was raised before, but &#x2013; and we understand <mark type="ph" /> you're coming in the (53:55) hands of stronger for longer, but we're near the end of April. Do you have any visibility of how longer do you think they can sustain at the same level as they are now? It looks like Q1 was at least if not stronger than Q4, so it's look &#x2013; how long do you think they can stay to similar level, one, two, maybe three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have CDMA growing in the first quarter. I think what will define the tail is of course the level of new phones coming out and also the level of LTE being deployed in North America. Those are the two factors. That said, compared to what we anticipated on the business which we acquired, we see a longer tail than that. So, that's important. But, again, it will be defined about new CDMA phones and the push with that market. And as you know, they are coming out quite a number of new phones on CDMA. So still there are an uptake, unless you want to add mobile broadband on CDMA, you have <mark type="ph" /> two similar patents (55:02) on HSPA.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And final one for you, Hans. When you look at your portfolio and the question about your balance sheet that was raised a bit earlier, is there any weaknesses that you would like to address, for example, in the IP routers or anywhere else where you say non-organic would make sense? And you would be open to ideas there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I usually say, on the network infrastructure side on mobility and fixed, we very much believe in organic growth, but it can always be something. We don't have anything in front of us right now. On Services, we are always looking for acquisition. They are usually smaller. We have done a couple of them already in the first quarter. Then I would say on the Business Support System, we believe that's an important piece of the network, and will grow in importance with OSS and BSS. And we're always exploring, but we don't have anything in front of us right now, but we are looking to see if we can strengthen that portfolio, but nothing that we have in front of us right now.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do have time for one last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Anuj Krishan from UBS now online with the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch upon the IP side of the business, and if you could provide some color or talk about the kind of growth that you've seen there in the quarter, especially in light of several operators talking about capacity constraints on the backhaul side of the piece, and, in particular, the traction that you've seen for the SSR, and then I'll have a couple of questions for Jan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we said before, the driver is a little bit different in the Networks all around the world, depending on how they are investing, but it's clear when we talk about mobile broadband growth, it's not only the radio access, it's the packet-core, the IP routers, it's the <mark type="ph" /> mean and lean (57:00) backhaul, all of that is being driven. But I can pick out one operator in North America and then I can pick one in Indonesia, and they will have different bottlenecks where they see the bottlenecks.</p>
          <p>So again, it's hard to generalize on a global level. But I think those components are also important for mobile broadband, and we have a very good portfolio and we are both coming out with new range of technology products but we are also coming out with new core products or IP router products like the SSR that we launched in Barcelona in order to address this. So I think we're strengthening our portfolio in this area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then just for Jan, I guess, on the R&amp;D guidance, we understand it's been maintained at SEK 31 billion to SEK 33 billion, but how should we kind of look at it in light of the FX moves and, I mean, given that, should we think it to be more towards the lower end of the range? And also, in general, the OpEx seasonality going into Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I mean, a range is a range, so please estimate in that range. I think that we have, I mean, the thing we mentioned in the report and what we have been planning is what we are executing upon, and this is really the year of TD-LTE and it is important for to us continue to secure a strong product portfolio on the router side and, therefore, we spend a little extra R&amp;D money this year. But the range is still applicable. I think the &#x2013; one more thing on the SG&amp;A side, it is really the impact of that the acquisition of the LG Ericsson asset and some more activity still on the LTE side.</p>
          <p>I think what we also should perhaps mention before we end here is a bit on the restructuring charges just so we get that clear. I mentioned that at the press conference, as well. We had, all in all, SEK 400 million in restructuring charges in the quarter, SEK 200 million on cost of sales and SEK 200 million in R&amp;D. We mentioned in the full-year report that we think that we will have around SEK 2 billion in restructuring charges for the full year. And I also said then that I think that the majority of the charges will be in the first half year. I still think that the charges will be bigger in the first half versus the second half, but we still think that SEK 2 billion is a relevant estimate, just so you know that.</p>
