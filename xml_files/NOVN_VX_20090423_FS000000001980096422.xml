        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. So, then I'll start with page four, and I'm actually quite pleased to present to you the strong underlying growth and the strong quarter one result of Novartis, mainly driven by the portfolio rejuvenation that is ongoing in Pharma. The Pharma underlying Group performance was however offset by a negative currency impact with net sales of 9.7 billion which is plus 8% in local currencies, however minus 2% in U.S. dollars. And an operating income of 2.3 billion, which is minus 6% in dollars plus but 7% excluding currency and one-time effects. Main driver was the significant growth that Pharma showed with 12% sales growth in local currencies.</p>
          <p>We also had good progress in research and development led by the first approvals of Afinitor and Ixiaro. Now going forward Novartis expects a strong operational performance in 2009 but the  continuation of the recent currency rates could more than offset underlying profit improvement.</p>
          <p>On page 5, you see the numbers with the net sales of 9.7 billion operating income of 2.3 billion which is 24.2% of sales and basic earnings of $0.87 per share.</p>
          <p>On slide 6 you see the performance per division with these very strong results of Pharma 12% growth local currencies of sales, 3% in U.S. dollars. Op. Inc. in constant currency did also grow by 8%. V&amp;D showed a small decline in sales and also a decline in profit, which was driven by the lack of one-time income in the first quarter of 2009 versus 2008. Sandoz showed a strong performance with growth of 4% in local currencies and an operating income of $291 million. And also consumer health did good in a difficult environment or did well in a difficult environment with 1% growth in sales and a strong improvement in operating income of 9% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Now on page 7, the strong operational performance in the first quarter was driven by the portfolio rejuvenation in Pharma. Pharma recently launched products which contribute most of the growth of the 12% in local currency. Vaccines and Diagnostics had modest sales decline mainly driven by lower sales of Encepur, our tick-borne encephalitis vaccine in Europe. Sandoz, as I said a very solid growth outside the U.S. with significant steps taken to address the U.S. performance and also Consumer Health a very strong performance of CIBA Vision where the turnaround makes very good progress, while OTC and Animal Health showed slower sales, actually a decline due to economic situation.</p>
          <p>Now, when we look at page 6 &#x2013; at  page 8, we can see that across all regions there was significant growth in Europe, in the U.S., in Asia, Africa, Australasia but also in LatAm and Canada but this most significant growth actually came from our top six emerging markets with 23% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Now with this I hand over to Raymund Breu.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joerg. We are now on slide 10. The underlying growth of 8% of our business in local currencies is also reflected in the 11% increase in free cash flow before dividends.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we highlight further and detail further the currency impact, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and the weakness in the emerging markets currencies had a marked impact on sales of 10 percentage points in terms of growth rates and an operating income of 11 percentage points. The operating income margin was decreased 0.5% -- 0.9 percentage points so a slight margin contraction and it related to the following factors. We had less other revenue, as the royalties on the Betaseron discontinued in October 2008.</p>
          <p>Marketing and sales, we actually had a slight improvement, as productivity gains in Pharma and efficiency gains in Sandoz allowed to reduce this expenditure a bit as a percentage of sales. R&amp;D, on the other hand, increased by 0.5 percentage point, mainly driven by increases in Consumer Health and Vaccines and Diagnostics.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we then explain the impact of exceptional items. They almost offset each other. In Pharmaceuticals we had lower divestment gains, approximately 100 million, and a non-recurrence of these release of provisions, which happened in the first quarter of 2008 in Vaccines and Diagnostics, a similar event that legal settlement income of the first quarter of 2008 of 49 million was not repeated in the first quarter of this year. Against this we had less restructuring expenses, 54 million, or less impairment, as compared to the levering the first quarter of 2008. Net, net the exceptional items actually reduced the operating income growth by 2 percentage points. If you correct for this and then the adjusted operating income growth is actually 7% up increase.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, I'm now commenting on the non-operating items income from associated companies was down 54 million, mostly related to less income from our investment in Roche. Taxes were down from 15% to 14%, and then the financial results saw a big swing from a gain of 91 million in 2008 to now an expense of 134 million. The factors are explained on slide 15. We have three major elements in there. One was lower liquidity as we had bought our 25% stake in Alcon, so that reduced the income by $45 million. Then we had additional interest of 50 million on our new bonds. Then we had a swing of 130 million in foreign exchange differences where in 2009 we had losses of 59 million versus gains of 71 million in the comparable quarter in 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 shows the development of our free cash flow which is up 11% as explained. The majority of the increase comes from cash flow from operation and in there I should mention that reduced growth in net working capital explains the majority of this increase. Capital expenditure well under control and actually a bit lower than in the comparable quarter last year.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, we summarize for your benefit the bond issues that we have done in the recent past. In Q1 2009, we issued $5 billion of bonds with a coupon of 5 and 1/8 in 5 and 4 and 1/8 over 5 and 10 years. Why are we doing that and that's summarized on slide 18 for three reasons <mark type="inaudible" /> those.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we will use it for potential financial requirements including the Alcon put and finally should, at the late stage, inflation shoot up, obviously then such borrowing would present a good hedge.</p>
          <p>With this I hand over to Joe Jimenez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Raymund. So starting on slide 20, Pharma delivered strong underlying performance in Q1 and I think the best part about it is that all regions and all key therapeutic areas show a very strong growth leading to the 12% constant currency growth. Now our operating income was down 2% in U.S. dollars but if you back out the effect of foreign exchange and the one-timers. It was inline with our sales growth. So that resulted in a return on sales of 32%, which is a good number and excellent pipeline progress also with the approval of Afinitor in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, just shows the numbers, if you flip to slide 22, you can see that all regions performed well. I would note though that the U.S. number of 13% growth does have 4 points in it that I back out, and so the underlying growth truly is 9% which is still a very good number, but the four points is Everolimus sales to Abbott for their drug-eluting stem.</p>
          <p>If you flip to slide 23, I want to highlight our Japan organization's great start in 2009. We received four approvals in one day and this is the first time that that's happened in Japan. We already are starting to see the impact of that even in March and the total Japan business grew 14% versus a year ago in Q1 in local currency.</p>
          <p>So flipping to 24, last year I said that we were investing significantly in &#x2013; in field force as well as medical resources and emerging markets, and we are already starting to see an acceleration of our business there, particularly China up over 40% versus year ago. I think I have said in prior conversations that these businesses on this page represent over $2 billion in total sales for Pharma, so it's a significant amount of our business.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows that all therapeutic areas grew in the double-digit rates. So I look at this and I &#x2013; I compare to our peers, other larger Pharma, and I think that this is further evidence that this is a very strong portfolio that is getting even stronger with the new product launches.</p>
          <p>And you can see on 26 that Lucentis continues to be a significant growth driver for us, execution has been good. I'm particularly pleased with some of the innovative reimbursement arrangements that we have created around the world. This is obviously an expensive therapy, it's a very effective therapy and I think our new commercial approach which looks at ways to create win, wins for us and for the reimbursement and for the patient is really starting to pay off.</p>
          <p>Next slide, also becoming more encouraged with results on Tekturna as we continue to &#x2013; to build some momentum here, access is improving. So in the U.S. we're up to 78% commercial access and 86% access in Medicare. We expect first line indication for Tekturna HCT by this summer probably August and we also expect the approval of Tekturna Diovan combination in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Slide 28 shows the &#x2013; the new product launches and you can see here that 2009 is still very much a launch year. So, I'm not sure that the market recognizes the true transformation that this portfolio is, is undergoing with the number of new launches and what that's going to mean for us as we approach the patent expiration of Diovan.</p>
          <p>You can see it on the next slide also, in the first quarter these new launches generated 14% of our total sales. So we're going to continue to execute well and there is still a lot of growth left as we ramp up these new products.</p>
          <p>Slide 30 shows the pipeline, pipeline delivered good news in Q1. So this besides Afinitor which I already mentioned and the priority review that we received for ACZ which is now brand named Ilaris. We also announced in the quarter that we in-licensed PRT128 which is elinogrel and that's shown on slide 31. This is a very exciting new compound for us. If the profile proves out in Phase III which we fully expect this thing will have significant damages over &#x2013; over Plavix. Faster onset, reversibility, effectiveness among Plavix non-responders, which we know is a significant issue.</p>
          <p>So 32, we anticipate other good progress on the pipeline in 2009, some key submissions FTY720 on track for a filing by the end of this year. Albuferon for HepC, and also potentially a second indication for Afinitor as early as the fourth quarter in carcinoid tumors.</p>
          <p>Our cost reduction efforts shown on slide 33 continue to build momentum and this is also contributing to our strong results. So, to summarize, we're confidently maintaining the outlook pro-forma in mid to high single digit growth rate in local currency for 2009. There is still a lot of unknowns related to the financial crisis, but if we continue to execute the way that we are we can overcome whatever comes at us.</p>
          <p>So with that I will turn it over to Joerg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. I'm on slide 36. When we met last time in January, we shared with you our priority for 2009. And I believe that I can say that so far we have been making good progress delivering on those priorities. We wanted to focus on the dynamic expansion of the new Pharma products, where we now have 14% of sales coming from this product as compared to 8% in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>We want to focus on the successful new launches of Extavia, Afinitor and Menveo. Extavia was approved in Europe and also launched. Afinitor was approved first and Menveo is on track. We want to return Sandoz and Consumer Health to growth in the U.S. and, what I can say right now is that the group returned to growth in the U.S. Sandoz is improving with the U.S. returning to growth in the month of March. And also Consumer Health showed a 1% growth in the U.S. in the first quarter. In addition, we also want to focus to continue to strongly expand in the emerging markets and there we saw a 23% growth in local currency, in the top six emerging markets.</p>
          <p>On slide 37, one can see that Pharma did do very, very well across the Board from whatever angle you look at the performance from a geographic perspective on the left hand but also from a maturity of market perspective on the right hand Pharma did achieve double-digit growth, with the strongest growth coming from the top six emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Now on page 38, this growth was mainly driven by new product introductions and the performance of new launches of products that were introduced over the last two years, which did rejuvenate Pharma portfolio significantly. And more so than it would appear for any other pharma company as you can see on this page.</p>
          <p>On slide 39, you see the pipeline updated. Of course we will continue to focus on innovation also in the future. And the current plans indicate that we would submit more than 130 new products, formulations and indications in many countries across the world between 2009 and 2011.</p>
          <p>On slide 40, you see that we made not only in Pharma but also in Vaccines and also in Animal Health good progress with regard to our pipeline already. But we do have significant further milestones to achieve in the remainder of 2009 and we are confident that we will do so.</p>
          <p>On slide 41, Sandoz delivered solid growth in all regions but the U.S. and its certainly very vigorously focusing on improving the U.S. situation. As you can see here the decline in the first quarter was only 3% as compared to 10% for the full year of 2008.</p>
          <p>On slide 42 you see that the ongoing performance improvement at Sandoz is reflected in growth in net sales, but also in a very respectable margin. As you can see on the top of the slide 4.2% growth in net sales was not achieved in any of the former quarters. And also the margin with 16.9% is very good as compared to most of 2008.</p>
          <p>On page 43, we did address, Sandoz did address the issues in the U.S. with a number of measures. So, for example the management team has been significantly strengthened with quite a number of new appointments. There is purpose in this regard to the pipeline in the U.S. with five submissions and nine approvals in the first quarter. As I said before strong March and then from a long &#x2013; from an overall perspective for the full year Sandoz is still aiming to return to growth for the full year of 2009.</p>
          <p>On page 44, a quick update on the Wilson situation. The remediation of the plant in Wilson is ongoing according to our plan. Also here quite a number of management changes, a new management team is in place, the interactions with the FDA are positive with frequent communications ongoing. And one should never forget that the Wilson plant in total is actually put using more than 30 products whereas only five are affected by the recent inspection findings.</p>
          <p>On page 45, Consumer Health performance driven mainly by CIBA Vision where the strong turnaround is continuing with OTC and Animal Health both being impacted by the economic situation. OTC sees a consumption slowdown and a wholesaler destocking, an effect that we also see in Pharma. Nevertheless, Voltaren and Fenistil did perform very strongly driven by new launches of new formulations and also good performance in emerging markets. In Animal Health whereas we see that the Farm Animal Business is improving, we do also see that the companion animal business is still suffering from fewer visits to vet clinics and price sensitivity among pet owners. CIBA Vision, good performance, strong performance, good growth in local currencies driven by new product launches and also good growth in the U.S. with an 11% increase.</p>
          <p>On page 46, you will see the first result of the intensified focus of Animal Health on innovation. Animal Health did succeed in launching the first new anthelmintic class in more than 25 years very recently in New Zealand with the product Zolvix which has an unparalleled efficacy, a very, very good safety profile and in addition is also convenient to use and will now be rolled out throughout the world in the coming months and years.</p>
          <p>On page 47, Consumer Health CIBA Vision is performing very, very nicely mainly driven by again innovation. Here we had a number of launches of the AirOptix family which is based on the new silicone hydrogel lenses, which drove the performance of CIBA Vision across the world. And also for 2009 there is the intention to launch quite a number of new products not only in the AirOptix range but also in the Dailies range &#x2013; in the Dailies range.</p>
          <p>Also on page 48, also Vaccines and Diagnostics did make good pipeline progress with the approval of Ixiaro, which is now the only vaccine available in many countries for Japanese Encephalitis. The clinical data has been very strong for efficacy and also safety. Initially, the product is targeted for travelers to endemic regions, which are more than 20 million individuals in Europe and in the U.S. The launch is now planned for May in the U.S. and in a number of European countries.</p>
          <p>On page 49, last but not least continued innovation is fine but also in finance. And that is why we continue to work on our productivity. Our forwards is continuing to deliver above plan. We have already achieved 329 million in the first quarter of this year and procurement is still the strongest contributor to that performance. We have also started a number of additional productivity initiatives some of them are running since a number of months already like our GEM approach where we have unified divisional operations in a number of very smaller countries. And that did actually result in significant growth in the double-digit range in these countries.</p>
          <p>We talked before about the "Customer Centric Initiative" in the U.S. where we eliminated overlapping primary care field forces. We have started the "Customer First" project where we want to make sure that our country personnel, our country colleagues are concentrating on customers rather than on internal management processes. And also Sandoz has started a project that's called "Compete" that will drive operating efficiencies on a global basis.</p>
          <p>Now, I come to slide 50, and I can confirm, barring unforeseen events, that we continue to see Group net sales growing at a mid-single-digit rate, and Pharmaceuticals net sales growing at a mid- to high-single-digit rate, both in local currencies. And we continue to aim in 2009 to again deliver record underlying net sales earnings excluding currency effects.</p>
          <p>And with this I think we can open the call for questions.</p>

          <p>The first question is from Mr. Paul Mann of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, yes, for taking my questions. So, a couple of questions, first of all thinking about the outlook for your margin for the year, you mentioned earlier you expected to have a higher proportion of Pharma spending in the earlier part of the year, is that still the case? It looks like cost containment during the quarter was pretty impressive. Was your cost now be more evenly distributed, or was this first quarter indicative of future quarters to come. And finally, just thinking about Everolimus sales to stent manufacturers. How many months of revenues were included in this quarter and should that be viewed as being an ongoing in terms of this number or was there any stocking as well, perhaps? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, this is Joe Jimenez. I will start with the first question around the outlook for the margin, at least in the Pharma group.</p>
          <p>We did expect higher spending in the first quarter, and I will you what happened was, when we saw currencies continuing to get worse around the world, we tightened spending a little bit, but the other thing that happened was that we drove more sales for the same spending that we expected. So I will tell you that I think this is the first indication that some of the new commercial approaches that we're taking in Europe and in the U.S. I think are starting to pay-off as we geo-tailor some of our spending to the &#x2013; the most appropriate opportunity. So that was a positive sign.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin outlook for the year, we have said in the past that our aspiration to increase margin for the full year versus year ago, but also given the current financial crisis and, and some of the uncertainty, it is an aspiration.</p>
          <p>On the Everolimus sales we &#x2013; I think you should assume that there were, there were more than one quarter's worth of volume there, but not a whole lot more. So there were some inventory build due to the just the ramp up in the beginning of it, but we do expect some consistent level of sales quarter-by-quarter rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ven, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Matthew Weston of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Three questions, if I could. Firstly on Diovan, and the slowdown in script growth in the U.S. I would be very interested in your view as to why we're seeing the A2 class slow down, what implications that may have for longer-term growth trends, and particularly the arrival of generic Cozaar in 2010.</p>
          <p>Regarding Alcon, I wondered whether the recent strategic developments in the ophthalmic area, with Abbott now moving in, are leaving you to review the timing of the Alcon deal. And is there anything that you can do to accelerate that from a Nestl&#xE9; perspective?</p>
          <p>And then finally, within the pipeline, on the Menveo vaccine, you highlight in your press release that you still aim to be first in the market with Menveo. Could you update us on the progress and timing of the Phase III studies in both the U.S. and Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will start with the Diovan, the first question the Diovan slowdown in the U.S. There is a slight decline, single digit decline of ARB segment. Now, Diovan scripts were not down as much as market, so we grew share just within the ARB market, but what's happening is a couple of things. First, there is an increase in generic competition around ACEs and around Amlodipine, so you are seeing a shift driven by that.</p>
          <p>Also there is an increase in ARB plus ARB combo usage. So, for example, Exforge grew nicely in the first quarter, and we are really looking at our hypertension franchise in the U.S. as an entire franchise. So remember, as Diovan starts to reach patent expiration, Tekturna starts to ramp up. We've got Tekturna combinations, the Tekturna Diovan combination, coming by the fourth quarter of this year. So we're really managing it holistically.</p>
          <p>We do think that when Cozaar comes in the U.S. in 2010 that it will slow Diovan's growth. So even though Diovan script growth was not up versus year ago, total value was up, and we expect that to continue when Cozaar comes, there will be a slowing of that value growth. But it really won't be until many months after that that we start to see a Diovan decline. So the short answer is hypertension as a total franchise is growing nicely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, I can take the Alcon question. I mean, what I can say here is that there are no changes planned to our contractual agreement with Nestl&#xE9; neither in timing nor substance. And that's leads us to the Menveo discussion.</p>

          <p>So for Menveo, Andrin Oswald here. In Europe, the Menveo program is progressing well. The Phase III trials are close to completion in terms of enrollment. And we do expect to be on plan for a potential filing in Europe in 2010. In the U.S., the situation is different. They are at the end of Phase II; simply due to more stringent safety requirements the FDA has asked us to provide first an additional 700 infants of longer-term data before we could go into the Phase III. Now this data currently are collected and will be ready in the second half of 2009, based on which, we will have our Phase III discussions with the FDA and we will see how this program will look like, once we have these discussions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Three questions please &#x2013; two on Project Forward and one on Sandoz. What proportion of your expected Project Forward savings are represented by the first quarter number?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you've mentioned that procurement is the majority of the number, but could you give us a sense of the marketing and sales proportion, just trying to understand the contribution of Project Forward to the lower level of spending in the marketing and sales that we saw in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And lastly, could you comment please on the lower level of marketing sales spend at Sandoz, and your expectations of how this might change through 2009 once new management has reviewed all aspects of the business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So, Jeff, should we start with the Sandoz question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, with respect to M&amp;S spend, one of the things we saw in 2008, that our total functional cost growth significantly outstripped our sales growth, and that was obviously something that we needed to change as part of the turnaround for 2009. So, what we've done is we've been a lot more efficient about our spending. In fact, we've reduced, unlike in 2008, we've reduced spending to below the level of local currency sales growth.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the outlook for the year on M&amp;S spend, I can't really comment on that. What I can say is that from a productivity perspective, we did launch a broad cross-functional initiative for Project Compete in January with the objective of really strengthening Sandoz's competitiveness by driving productivity and operating efficiency across TechOps development sales and marketing as well as D&amp;A as an effort really to &#x2013; really strongly ingrain continuous improvement and the way that we manage our day-to-business. But I don't want to give an outlook at this point for M&amp;S spending, but I can say that Q1 was a step in the right direction with M&amp;S spending below the rate of our sales growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Kevin. Majority of the savings from Forward now are in the purchasing area and it's in this area where we have implemented and achieved the savings faster than anticipated and there we have exceeded our targets. The spread between the various quarters in 2009 is difficult to put in numbers there, because that depends with, you know, on when individual initiatives materialize. But as you have seen, we have exceeded the target for this year in the first quarter. Don't expect that this excess will lead to <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you are seeing that the cumulative savings until the end of the first quarter are 1.38 billion and that is in excess of the savings that we have foreseen to achieve by the end of 2009 of 1.3 billion. All I was saying is, don't now expect that this excess that we achieved in the first quarter will simply be multiplied by four for the entire year. So, this depends on when individual purchasing initiatives are implemented.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, my questions are pipeline related. On Menveo, my understanding is that you may be supply constrained to launch and when I think about how difficult it is to ramp up vaccine manufacturing, I am wondering if this is something to worry about?</p>
          <p>On FTY, given how the clinical profile of the product has evolved over time and given what you see with competitor products in the pipeline, I am hoping you can talk about how your level of excitement with that drug may have changed over time.</p>
          <p>And last question on generic Lovenox, at least to us it increasingly seems that FDA will require that clinical trials be run prior to approving generics and I am hoping you can comment on your latest thinking here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right, Tim. I don't want to steal the thunder from the American Academy of Neurology meeting next week where we have a, quite a comprehensive presentation on FTY and the transform study. But the impressive efficacy that we discussed in December &#x2013; the 52% reduction in relapse rate versus Avonex &#x2013; has continued to build in terms of some of the secondary and subgroup analyses that we had done and people had actually requested. One of them, for instance, was around, was there any suggestion that the Avonex arm may have underperformed because many patients might have already failed Avonex? And when we looked at the analysis of naive versus non-naive patients, in fact, it came out more strongly in favor of FTY. So, I think the efficacy of FTY continues to be extremely impressive. On the safety front, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, last met in February, reviewed all of the cases and they've indicated to us that we should continue the program unchanged.</p>

          <p>On Lovenox and Enoxaparin, we continue to have dialogue with the FDA around our ANDA as we would with any application. And as you know we submitted our amendment to our Enoxaparin ANDA in September of 2008 related to the potential for immunogenicity.</p>
          <p>As to clinical trial, trial requirements from the FDA, I can't really comment on what the FDA may or may not do. I can say that we are still awaiting FDA response and two outstanding citizens' petitions, and, lastly, that all four of the Chinese heparin suppliers have been inspected and we have no reason to believe that there are any issues with any of them.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Ms. Alexandra Hauber of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of questions, firstly, on the guidance. Since you reported the full year results, the exchanges have actually hardly moved. So &#x2013; and based on the currency sensitivity you provided at the time, at the full year results, we could calculate that their earnings impact at recent rates would be about 8%. So, back at the full year results time, I thought your underlying growth would be greater than 8%, based on that guidance given that there was no qualification for FX. So, I'm wondering what adverse effects other than FX have made you qualify your earnings guidance with the currency effect? So is the underlying growth no longer strong enough to offset the FX headwinds? That's question number one.</p>
          <p>The next question is just coming back to the pharmaceutical margins, the other operating income and expense line was positive this quarter. And that, in the past, was usually a negative item unless it was boosted by a positive one-time. And so could you just let us know what this small positive other operating income was and how that will affect the negatives which are usually in that line?</p>
          <p>And then just a final question on the Wilson plant: is there any timeline at all you can give us for the resolution on the other five products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay on &#x2013; Alexandra, on the guidance that was a very pointed question, trying to find out whether there is further guidance on -- to the guidance that is included in the press release, the answer is no. I can tell you the following: obviously, we are confident about the underlying operating and net income achieving record values but the currencies are notoriously difficult to forecast. So it's very difficult to say where the rates will be through the remaining three quarters of the year. In the first quarter the impact actually Alexandra was 10% on sales and 11% on operating income. And if, and it's a big if, if you would assume that rates now would stay at these recent levels, then the impact will be of a similar order of magnitude for the full year, in the 10 to 11% range. Now you can do the numbers yourself. All we are saying is that we are very confident about the underlying growth of our business and that currencies are very volatile</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, in terms of the other operating income, it literally is a series of a number of very small things, couple of launch provision reversals in there. There's a very small divestiture in there, and it just -- they essentially net out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean I was always assuming that the underlying out of operating income, from which, obviously, we have very little transparency, is around a minus 70, minus 80. Is that roughly right, or is that just a totally unpredictable number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, that's a very unpredictable number because it depends on individual items and add up to a positive or negative number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alexandra, with respect to your question on Wilson, we had a positive and constructive meeting with the FDA in March. And continue to be on track with our remediation efforts around the specific validation, and documentation issues that we have. As Joerg mentioned earlier we have replaced the most of the top management team at Wilson, which was received positively. I really can't speculate at this point as to when we will be able to bring Wilson back on line. But what I can tell you is that Wilson supplies less than 20% of Sandoz U.S. sales. So there are a number of other factories around the world that are quite important for our U.S. supply.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what &#x2013; what's actually required is just the FDA making a quick in the box on your &#x2013; on the actions you have put forward, is it just &#x2013; just that &#x2013; you have made all changes and now you're just waiting the FDA to say well the asset's fine? Is that the missing bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the FDA will come back in a time of their choosing to re-inspect our factory at Wilson. And we have a whole series of things that we're doing on the validation and documentation issues, many of which are really too specific to get into here. But there is no one silver bullet or one outstanding item that we're waiting to fix. It's up to them when they come back and re-inspect and hopefully then we'll be able to get Wilson back on line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I also have a question on the one-time quarter swing, it struck me that the rest of the portfolio, so below the top 20, that was up 13% at constant exchange rates after falling 9% in 2009. Now I've heard that there seems to be a one-time item in the U.S., 3% of sales added. But even if I subtract that you still have a tail of products that did extremely well up 5 to 6%. Can you please tell us what the reasons are, I reckon emerging markets cannot be the reason, because they grew as mature markets. And then, sorry for insisting on the above operating income and expense a normalized number around 80 or 100 million, but I reckon you &#x2013; you can give us a maybe an indication what the full-year number might be after the &#x2013; the typical 300 to 600 range that we're used to?

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay starting with the quarter swings on some of the tail products Everolimus is a part of it, but also when you look at the tail products many of them are in emerging growth markets, and you have to be a little bit careful about the emerging growth market classification that you see. There are six markets in Pharma that account for a very large percent of our EGM markets and some of our mature products, and as those markets accelerate they're going to create growth in also that segment, which historically has declined. So that's really what you are saying. Regarding the other income...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no rebate reversals or so in any markets to explain that surprisingly strong number or stocking effects?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on this other income and expense line, Marcel, I think the easiest way to look at it would be to simply concentrate on the group numbers, because then you have a large enough sample that you have a bit of predictability, and if you look at 2008 then other expense,  it's net expense was 2.1% of sales. I think that's the best you can do if you want to start to model it. Obviously, quarter-by-quarter you may have variations around that so, for example, in the first quarter it was 0.8% of sales and already much inline with the first quarter of 2009, so quarter-by-quarter you may have changes, but those are impossible to predict.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Thank you for taking my questions. Florent Cespedes of BNP Paribas. First on Sandoz, if we exclude Exoprin in the U.S. what could be the main growth driver in this area for this rest of the year? Will it be products from the Wilson plant or other projects?</p>
          <p>Another question on the pipeline of Elinogrel, do you have an idea of the safety profile of this drug? I know its early days but could you give us some color on that? And then last one on Exjade, could you comment on Q1 performance especially in the U.S. which was noted to be weak and is it in your view still a blockbuster potential with the current indications? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David do you want to start on Exjade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll start on Exjade. The U.S. is an increasingly small percentage of the Exjade market because, as you know, one of the main reasons for the drug is apparent overload in <mark type="inaudible" /> which is predominantly in the Southern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p>Having said that we had some inventory billed towards the end of last year and some inventory drop at the beginning of this year, which makes the result look even worse. So the U.S. will continue to grow, albeit at a much slower rate than the rest of the world. In terms of the long-term forecast, we still hold that same forecast which is that this drug will be the blockbuster in time. So, it's going to be a slow build to get there, but we believe it will get there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20">
        <plist>
          <p>On the safety profile of elinogrel, so the potential for an improved safety profile was exactly one of the reasons why we licensed this drug and that's based on the mechanism. The reversibility being important in terms of any circumstance in which we would get bleeding so we would believe from that that you would have an improved safety profile.</p>
          <p>It has to be said though that in this area of thrombosis you need large numbers and large studies to really pin down the safety profile. From the early studies, the proof of concept studies, the indication was that the safety profile would be at least as good as Plavix. We have an 800 patient study, which is now underway, our Phase II study. And we'll see data coming out from that towards the end of this year. That will give us a better idea of the safety ultimately, of course we're going to have a large Phase III program. And we'll see what happens there.</p>

          <p>First we don't speculate for competitive reasons on future launches, but there are several that we anticipate I can tell you that in Q1 of this year. We launched seven products, albeit smaller launches, but that compared favorably to 15 in all of last year and I think also let's not forget that we have what I would characterize as a very strong base business that is over $1.5 billion and so there is really an opportunity to strengthen our key account management with our top accounts and so Christine, our new CEO and I have been doing a lot of that. I was in Florida last weekend at NACDS to that end and I think frankly the last factor is really having a new CEO, like Christine who brings a wealth of 15 years of experience in generics from Barr is really a positive in terms of the people that she's able to attract and the kind of culture that she is creating around the sense of urgency and accountability.</p>

          <p>Okay, but maybe in other words do you believe that the Q1 growth is sustainable for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think it's too early to speculate on that. It's pretty premature, we're just getting going here, Florent, on our turnaround. And I really can't speculate on the kind of local currency growth rate that we will see in any market really much less the U.S.</p>

          <p>Thank you. So now the background noise is gone. Okay, next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Ms. Marietta Miemietz of SG Securities. Please go ahead madam.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon, first question is a financial one. Just coming back to currency, I mean I fully understand the impact on the operating profit, but I was just wondering if you could guide us a little bit about how we should be modeling the currency losses below the line. First of all, is it fair to assume that that's mostly hedging losses and that the non-major currencies, and especially the currencies that have been hitting trouble lately that you wouldn't hedge them, so they wouldn't have an impact on this line? And if currencies hold up the current rate, then would we be looking at a run rate of a 60 million loss per quarter? Or because of the way your hedging contracts work, we would actually see a phasing out of that effect, and that 60 million should sort of be decreasing on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>My second question relates to the low-molecular &#x2013; low-weight heparin guidelines that just came out from the EMEA. I was just wondering if you could help us understand what exactly they mean by equivalence design; how that really differs from a non-inferiority design, and whether you have any idea at all as to what sort of equivalence margins they are looking at and how big a trial you could potentially need to show equivalence to Lovenox? I mean, I'm almost getting the sense reading the document that you are looking at a multiple thousand patient trial here. Would that be right, and what are your, sort of, timelines for filing generic Lovenox in Europe?</p>
          <p>And then I got  just a couple of small product questions. One is on the Aclasta; you were saying that basically this year, success would depend a lot on the re-treatment rates you'd be seeing, and I was just wondering if you could give us some qualitative feedback on that. And also you were saying actually I think it was about a year ago that you were looking into ways to create extra intellectual property protection around Aclasta versus Zometa, and I was just wondering if there is any way that you can extend the patent life of Aclasta.</p>
          <p>My final question, just very briefly, on VR315; I saw that you made a small milestone payment of 2.5 million to Vectura, and I was just wondering if you could give us an idea of what that was relating to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Marietta I can start on the currency question. Your interpretation is correct. It's related to hedging gain and losses, you know these currency gains and losses that show up in net financial result. We normally hedge the transaction exposure that's known transactions that have been booked that we then hedge. Obviously, we can only hedge in markets where the hedging is available and the cost is reasonable. So, most of the time we are not in a position to hedge emerging growth markets because either the market is not available or the cost can be prohibitive. So the losses that you see in the first quarter are related to such hedges. It's the nature of it that they can swing very quickly from positive to negative. So the assumption usually for the full year is, and the aim is, that the total be more or less zero. It can be positive, it can be negative. We would have hoped that it is not always of this order of magnitude negative as it was in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there any sort of a timing effect related to it, though? Where you would &#x2013; I mean if the currencies were actually to hold at the same rates as in the first quarter, would you then basically see a reversal or at least a mitigation of that effect in the coming quarters because of the way you adjusted your hedges last year? Or would you then expect that 60 million to be seen every quarter again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. It will not repeat because these types of hedges are mark-to-market in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, do you want to take the Aclasta?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Regarding the question on Aclasta, Aclasta continues to perform well for us. Regarding the retreatment rate, it is pretty much in line with what we see in terms of oral bisphosphonates. So, retention of patients after about 12 months, so that's something below 40% that is not a &#x2013; I mean, we do believe that that number will continue to build because I don't think &#x2013; I think there is a lag effect. I think there is &#x2013; a patient wouldn't be retreated exactly one year from the first infusion, so maybe a month or two-month lag. So, we expect that to continue to improve.</p>
          <p>And regarding extra patent life, I think we should &#x2013; it would be safe to just assume that, that when Zometa patent goes, Aclasta goes. But I will tell you that this is about creating a clear relationship between the patient, the physician, the infusion center that I believe will provide some level of insulation. We've seen it in other countries, in other therapy areas, when we do put service and extra activity around a particular compound. We have some level of insulation once patent expires.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So, Jeff, before you talk on Vectura let me take the enoxaparin question. Which is of course an interesting question; obviously enoxaparin, or generic enoxaparin, is an interesting product not only for the U.S. but also for Europe. I mean these guidelines, we are probably at the same situation than you are, we are analyzing now what exactly that means in terms of what kind of clinical trial will be necessary. We are very actively looking at that. It's a little bit early to give you concrete details as to what our assessment will come up with. But I can show you that we will be actively looking into this and I hope that in the not too distant future we will know exactly what we will do here.  And with that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing I would add to that is that my understanding, Marietta, of the EMEA requirement is that at least they require one Phase III study demonstrating safety and efficacy in the most sensitive indication. And so specifically, what we understand from it is that it would require a short four-week toxicity study in rats for PK/PD and local tolerance and potentially PK/PD studies in healthy volunteers. But Joerg is a development expert, so I'll defer to him on that. On Vectura, this is a pretty small deal; it is a respiratory milestone that you are referring to so I don't have too much more to comment on it than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jeff. So, we have time for one more question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mr. Michael Leuchten of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I actually have three quick ones if I may. Just on the further profitability initiatives, given that you exceed it forward, is that something you could quantify or at least put a time horizon on? Just quickly going back to Sandoz on the profitability; given that the profitability in Q1 was quite strong, how much of the profitability improvement is just delaying of phasing of costs until you actually back up on stream, or is it really, or are we really already seeing proper profitability improvements through cost savings and restructuring?</p>
          <p>And then lastly quickly in terms of strategy, if I look at the emerging market split that you mentioned, the top six markets have grown 23%, rest of world's growing 6% which is less than the U.S. What's the strategy for investments there? Are you holding back rest of world to see what happens with the economic uncertainties that you've mentioned, or are you really focusing on the top six and that's where you money has gone and we will continue to go for this year and also after?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me take the question on further productivity initiatives first. No, I cannot quantify that and I don't really want quantify that here. I mean, from a time horizon perspective what I say is that some of these initiatives will be ongoing for quite a while. It's not intended to be some one-time gains that we would realize through 2009 and then we would fall back to normal. But it's more a focus, a long-term focus on really making sure that the overall organization in all divisions actually, is focused on the real prime value drivers and these are customer contacts and not necessarily internal processes and geographies. So, I mean we would expect to see bottom-line and top line consequences of these initiatives but I'm not in a position to really quantify this yet.</p>
          <p>With regard to strategy, I mean, we will not change and have no intention to change our original strategy in terms of what we do, and what we invest in emerging markets. We believe that from a long-term perspective this is an area of the world that we will see continued growth in. And we believe it would be a mistake to actually follow an on-off strategy and now hold back and then in let's say 12 months, if the economic situation improves, accelerate again. We will continue in a very steady way, our investments and our focus on these markets. And as you know, Pharma is a long-term business and is long-term oriented and that's why we will continue with our strategy as planned. And with this, Jeff regarding Sandoz?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on Sandoz's profitability and the sustainability there, Michael, as you probably know Q1 is typically strong due to higher anti-infective sales, which are seasonal and come at a higher margin. I think also though, 17% Roth that we did versus the 11% in Q4 and 14% in 2008 does also have to do with better leverage from higher sales. We drove 4% in local currency as Joerg had mentioned versus you know, zero to 2% by quarter last year. The third aspect with respect to &#x2013; whether this is delaying say &#x2013; delaying cost and spending or true savings, a lot of it really is true savings.</p>
          <p>We've initiated, as I mentioned, Project Compete and so there we really are seeing good savings across procurement, development. If you look at our development spend for example, we have an opportunity to being more efficient while still pursuing high value important projects. Teva spends less than we do despite their larger size, so I think we can get more bang for our buck.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of marketing and sales and G&amp;A there are a number specific initiatives that we have, where we will continue to look to drive cost savings in the business. And I think the last thing I would say is that, a lot of this has to do with new talent that we've brought in; that can be focused on both growth in operating excellence at the same time and execute on both.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff. So, with this I would like to conclude our call. In short I hope that you see that we are very confident in our business going forward. So far it was a successful year for Novartis; Pharma is performing very strongly and the other businesses are well on track. And we are looking forward to the continuing challenges of 2009. Thank you very much.</p>
