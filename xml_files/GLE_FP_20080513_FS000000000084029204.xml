          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group First Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call. The presentation hosted by Mr. Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Oudea, Chief Executive Officer, will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this conference call. In a few moments, I am going to hand over to our new CFO, Didier Valet, who will present to you the results for the first quarter of 2008 and answer your questions with our colleagues of the Executive Committee. Before that, however, I would like to say a few words in my new position as the CEO.</p>
          <p>The financial market environment was very difficult in the first quarter, as you know, especially in the credit markets, and our financial statements are still feeling the effects of the financial crises, which were mitigated &#x2013; moderated I would say in Corporate and Investment Banking by non-recurring and volatile accounting items but basically my reading of these accounts is very positive, and I am confident on the state of our businesses. We have a very solid base, with very strong performances in our retail banking activities, both in France and outside France. Our Private Banking franchise remains intact. Our services to investors have very strong performances, and we have basically finished expanding the impact of the financial crises on our dynamic monetary market funds in Asset Management. Eventually, regarding CIB, we record a satisfactory commercial performance across all our activities in a very difficult market climate.</p>
          <p>The exceptional commitment and efforts of the group's personnel means that we have managed to bounce back very quickly and are now ready to continue our development, thanks to our solid financial structure. I would like, again, to take the opportunity to thank all our shareholders for massively supporting the capital increase and confirming their confidence in us. The reinforced general management team, which was announced today, and all my colleagues are totally committed to generating profitable growth and deliver the strategy that we've presented to the market so my mandate from that perspective is absolutely clear and simple &#x2013; deliver the results that we have presented to you.</p>
          <p>I just would like also to thank you all for your cooperation, your kind listening, during my five and a half years as the Group CFO, and I look forward seeing you again.</p>
          <p>Didier, over to you for the detailed comments on the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I will now present the result for the first quarter of 2008 and before, as mentioned by Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, answering any questions with members of the Executive Committee, which are sitting next to me.</p>
          <p>I will begin with a few comments on the financial climate over the quarter. First quarter of 2008 was marked by a deepening of the financial crises and also growing signs that the U.S. economy was slipping into recession. We also saw dislocation of the credit markets, which posed significant fluctuation in certain figure over the first quarter of '08 results as you would see. Nevertheless, in a very challenging environment, the group posted strong commercial performances which illustrate its capacity to bounce back. For example, our retail banking network in France, outside France, as well as the Financial Services had 7 million additional individual customers on a like-for-like basis including acquisitions, so you compare to last year, representing an 11.5% increase on a like-for-like basis. At the end of March, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group had 30 million individual customer worldwide.</p>
          <p>Regarding Corporate and Investment Banking, it posted sturdy commercial performance given the environment and so overall activity levels in the first quarter confirm the quality and the strength of our business franchises.</p>
          <p>As we already mentioned, in the first quarter the Group took control of Rosbank, the leading privately owned banking network in Russia, with around 600 branches. Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale since mid-February owns 50% plus one share of the capital of Rosbank. And as you know, we've launched a public offering to increase up to a maximum of 57.8% of the capital of Rosbank this quarter.</p>
          <p>Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric has already mentioned another important event in the first three months of this year, the successful capital increase for &#x20AC;5.5 billion, which has been let's say 1.8 times over-subscribed. The capital increase will enable the Group to continue its development in businesses and markets with potential and of course to strengthen its financial structure.</p>
          <p>In the wake of the exceptional fraud uncovered at the start of the year, the Group has also launched a plan to strengthen control procedures and the Special Committee put in place by the Board of Director will present its final report on the subject ahead of the AGM due on May 27th.</p>
          <p>Finally, technically, let's say, I would like to point out that the figures in the presentation have not been restated for the accounting consequences of the fictitious operation recorded in 2007 on unauthorized and concealed market activities. However, these restated figures are available in the supplementary data.</p>
          <p>If you move now to slide 5, which shows some graphs illustrating that there is a strong deterioration that we have seen in the credit spreads until mid-March. I would like to point out notably the deterioration, which has been seen on the American asset-backed securities was spread each peak or high across all vintages and ratings on both RMBS and CMBS.</p>
          <p>The financial crises also continued to spread to other asset classes, namely European asset-backed securities, we have that on the top right of the slide, which had previously been relatively unaffected compared to American asset-backed securities and also at the bottom of the slide on corporate counterparts, as well as financial institutions.</p>
          <p>In this extremely volatile climate, a disconnection was observed also between cash instruments and indices, which resulted in significant basis risk. Spreads widened significantly between 1st Jan and in March to levels which had been &#x2013; never been &#x2013; never seen since the start of the financial crisis. Also as the trading values of the hedge and on the underlying assets are not in perfect correlation the banks using indices to hedge their exposure to risk find themselves exposed to high basis risk, which had an impact on this quarter results.</p>
          <p>The bailout of Bear Stearns in mid-March and the massive intervention of the central banks dissipated fears of a systematic collapse, resulting in a trend reversal and certain spread tightening in the last few days of the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we now move to slide 6; in this backdrop and despite the crisis, the Group posted satisfactory results in the first quarter '08. Note that the results are being compared to high reference base for the first quarter of '07. I remind you that in the first quarter last year the Group enjoyed a very dynamic commercial performance across all businesses and also especially in the financial markets, which were very supportive.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out before dictating the main item of the P&amp;L that the result for the first quarter of '08 contained several non-recurring items that I will comment on during the presentation. Additional write-downs seen through the exposure to U.S. residential mortgage sector through monoline insurers, write-downs on certain portfolios and on the positive side, the impact of the change in fair value of financial liabilities, and the mark-to-market value of our credit default swap portfolios. All these items, let's say, are summarized in the slide, page 44, and in the press release page 25.</p>
          <p>If you look now to the main line of the P&amp;L; revenues at the Group stood at &#x20AC;5.7 billion, down 8.6% on a like-for-like basis. This decline would have been 17.7% adjusted for the change in fair value of financial liabilities, which amounted to &#x20AC;523 million. The increase in operating expense was limited, up 3.4% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting two different trends. On one side the ongoing investments that we continue to convert in business and regions with high potential and on the other side with high control on operating expense in the day-to-day business. The cost/income ratio came out at 68.8%, which is up compared to the low base of comparison of last year; last year the cost/income was 61.2%.</p>
          <p>On the cost of risk, the net allocation to provision rose to &#x20AC;598 million compared to 192 in the fiscal 2007. The major explanation of this increase comes from the Corporate and Investment Banking where we have to make provision of few debilitated accounts. Over the quarter, if we sum up the positive and negative non-recurring items, the total impact on the profit before tax amounts to 89 million euro positive and this includes &#x20AC;602 million pre-tax capital gain linked to the disposal of the Group of a 50% stake of Fimat due to the creation of Newedge. As we know, Newedge was established on the 2nd of Jan through the merger of Fimat and Caylon Financial. Note that this impact has a very limited impact on the Tier 1 of the Group because we have also to recognize in face of the &#x2013; in front of this capital gain, &#x20AC;420 million of additional goodwill. So overall, when we look at the bottom-line, the net income stood at &#x20AC;1,096 million, down 23% compared to last year. The return on equity after tax came out at 16.5% for the quarter compared to 24.4% last year.</p>
          <p>The increase in the risk-weighted assets under Basel I was at 15.8% on a like-for-like basis, resulting from sustained organic growth in retail businesses, the fact that the remediation launched by the Group in Asset Management has also some impact on the weighted assets and also the commitments of the Group to slow down the increase of the risk-weighted assets within the Corporate and Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>The Group financial structure is solid. Our Tier 1 stood at 7.9% at the end of March. So core Tier 1 excluding PEL/CEL 11:36) and hybrid reached 6.8% and the total Tier 1 &#x2013; total capital ratio reached 10.5% at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Page 7, more detail on the growth in revenues by businesses. As I mentioned, this &#x2013; the first quarter '08 was marked by solid commercial activity in a difficult environment. The Group revenues saw a decline by 8.6% and if we look more into detail, we have the French Networks, which posted a resilient performance with a 2% increase in revenues excluding PEL/CEL.</p>
          <p>Retail banking activities outside France posted a very strong performance with a 22% increase on a like-for-like basis. Revenues at Financial Services continued to grow, increasing by 12.4% versus last year. And then moving to Asset Management, we had some significant impact of the crisis, but with the end of the remediation of assets held by the dynamic money market funds and so as we expect, we had negative net banking income this quarter, which has weighted on the performance of GIMs overall.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, looking at Private Banking and Securities Services, they had strong performances with an increase of respectively 12.8% for the Private Banking and 28.8% for Securities Services.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Corporate and Investment Banking there was a solid client-driven activity in a difficult climate. Trading revenues have continued to be impacted by the financial crises and by additional write-downs. So, overall revenues fell by 16.6% and note that if we were to exclude the fair value of financial liabilities, so the 523 million euro already mentioned, revenues at CIB would have fall by 44.5% as compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Page 8; the Group cost/income ratio stood at 68.8% for the first quarter, versus, as I mentioned, a low level last year 61.2% where the market conditions were very supportive. On the one hand, there was deterioration of the cost/income ratios at the business lines affected by the crises, Asset Management, where as there is no revenues the cost/income is not relevant. CIB, where we've seen a cost/income ratio of 64% compared to 55.5% last year, mainly due to the fall in revenues.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the cost/income ratios of all other business line were kept under control. French Networks, retail banking outside France, Securities Services improved their cost/income ratio compared to last year. Financial Services and Private Banking managed to keep their cost/income ratio under control led by the ongoing investments that we are conducting in their developments.</p>
          <p>The cost of risk on page 9 came out at 71 basis points this quarter, up compared to last year, which is where it stood at 26 basis points. I would like to point out that the level of cost of risk for this quarter is not representative of trends that we could expect for the full year as it includes high allocation linked to a few high consolidated accounts in CIB in the first quarter that should not be reiterated in the coming quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking more into detail, the French Networks have a cost/income ratio which is slightly down compared to last year by 28 basis points of the risk weighted assets. The cost of risk of the International Retail Banking was 61 basis points of CWA compared to 54 basis points last year. This cost of risk is in line with the normal level we would expect in such a business given the current mix. I'll remind you that we have arranged for the cost of risk of the Retail Banking outside France between 60 to 80% and let's say, of course, this quarter we have seen the inclusion of Rosbank which has a cost of risk of around 115 basis point and if you were to exclude Rosbank to compare &#x2013; like-for-like basis compared to last year so cost of risk at Retail Banking outside France would have been 61 basis points.</p>
          <p>So an increase of 15 in the cost of risk of Financial Services to 105 bps compare to 91 bps last year due to the integration of recent acquisition, namely the two acquisition we've made in Brazil, Banco Pec&#xFA;nia and Banco Cacique as well as a small acquisition we made in Greece. And mechanically also, we have already communicated on that. The business mix is moving towards more consumer loans, in particular in emerging market, leading to an increase of the cost of risk. This shift, however, is positive globally as it provide us additional growth and the cost of risk is considerably covered by the banking margin in these regions.</p>
          <p>Lastly to comment on the CIB; I mentioned that we have &#x20AC;312 million net allocation linked to a few high derivative accounts, which are identified in appendices. These accounts represent &#x20AC;282 million of the 312 that we passed in the first quarter. As we mentioned, at this point of the cycle, we have not noticed any deterioration in credit risk of the whole portfolio but also, and it was mentioned in the previous quarter, we do no longer expect a reversal in the coming quarter.</p>
          <p>Before turning to business performance, let me provide you an update on Basel II reform at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. So this slide contains the figure &#x2013; initial figure regarding the application of the Basel II reform at the end of March for the Group as a whole. This is a complicated reform to analyze and so we plan to organize with you a meeting on the 25th of June to present in detail the consequences of the application of the Basel II reform on the Group and on its businesses, both in term of capital allocation, in term of profitability.</p>
          <p>So the scope of application of the Basel II reform at Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is based for the most parts on the use of internal methods. These are for credit risk while we are using internal ratings based advanced methodology, which cover 75% of our spending or for operational risk where we did use advanced measurement approach, which has an extensive coverage of the Group entities, almost 90%.</p>
          <p>The French Banking Commission validated these methods at the end of 2007 and launched an additional mission in March '08 on operational risk in order to examine the methods used by the SocGen Group to integrate the impact of Eastern situation into the fraud and assess its relevance.</p>
          <p>So at end of March '08, the reformer had resulted in a number of decline in the risk-weighted assets under Basel II compared to Basel I, despite taking into account the new regulation requirement with regard to operational risk, which integrates the impact of the fraud uncovered last January.</p>
          <p>So in total, we have a decrease of the risk-weighted assets by 5.3% at the end of March resulting entirely from the reduction that we have seen in credit risk which has declined by 18.3%. As a result the Tier 1 ratio under Basel II increased 11bps compared to the Basel I at 8.0%.</p>
          <p>The difference is that there is two impact, on one side let's say the decrease in risk-weighted assets leads to a positive impact on the Tier 1 of 43bps, and as you know on the other side, we have to deduct from the Tier 1 some elements, which were previously either not existing or been deducted from the Tier 1 Basel II, and this deduction had an impact of minus 32 bps at the end of March. So, again, I give you a meeting on the 25th of June to discuss the Basel II reform more into detail.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 13 on the businesses starting with the French Networks; the French Networks posted moderate business growth in a very difficult climate at the start of the year, which was marked on one side by the crises in central markets and of course by the growth posted by Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. The fraud and the intense media coverage attracted &#x2013; waited on the recruitments of new individual customers in Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Network; there has been no impact on business customer at this stage.</p>
          <p>However, it's important for us; there has been almost no effect on the customer attrition which remains stable for this quarter. We are regularly conducting surveys and we made &#x2013; we conducted one of these surveys in March and these surveys has illustrated that Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale image remains one of the best in France.</p>
          <p>Asking to non-clients which bank they would choose, should they have to change, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale is one of the most attractive banks, ranking fourth among all banks and number one among non-insurance banks with almost 50% of positive answers saying yes, or yes maybe. Also, the same survey conducted towards Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale customers show that 90% of our customers are confident in our strengths.</p>
          <p>If now we look at individual customers, the number of personal current accounts continues to grow, even if it was, as I mentioned already at a moderate pace &#x2013; at a more moderate pace than in the previous quarter, we would have 21,700 new net openings in the first three months of this year compared to 39,000 last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the change in savings, let's say we have seen that our customer &#x2013; our retail customers have this as a standard behavior when they face uncertainties that they're trying to move to products combining liquidity and very limited risk in term of retail. As a result, there was also a 4.8% increase in regulated savings deposits excluding PEL, which continue to see outflows and this was mainly driven by liquidity <mark type="inaudible" />. There was a modest increase in sight deposits by 2.6% compared to the first quarter, '07.</p>
          <p>On the life insurance side, inflows fell sharply as compared to last year, down by almost 28% at 2.1 billion and compared &#x2013; if we compare our performance with the banking insurance market, the decline for the G11 was minus 18%.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, what we have seen in March is that the gap in term of waiting settlements has almost disappeared as we have launched a campaign in March that will end in May, pushing let's say for attractive rates of an immunity contract with a certain portion of synergies in term of investments.</p>
          <p>In housing loans, the group continues to focus its pricing efforts on the most promising customer segments given the gradual lending of the property sector and ongoing high level of competition. Housing loans issuance of 3.8 billion in Q1 '08 was stable compared to last year, but we improved margins.</p>
          <p>If you turn to business customer, the markets post strong performances with a high number of relationships established with high quality SMEs, almost nine of which were new SMEs, were won this quarter. So a slight decrease compared to last year, but it was a two year peak. We have seen a 2.6% increase in the outstanding sight deposits compared to last year, and a 13% increase in term deposits.</p>
          <p>Regarding lending, that was also down in performance with a 15.5% increase in outstanding operating loans and a 14.7% increase in outstanding investment loans compared to the last year.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page 14, we have a breakdown of revenues. You can see that in the backdrop, revenues were up 2% excluding the impact of PEL/CEL provision. The PEL/CEL provision has different movements compared to last year as we have to allocate 5 million additional this quarter, while last year we recorded a reversal of &#x20AC;26 million. Splitting, let's say, these revenues between fees and net interest margin, there was a moderate growth of 1.3% in income from fees and commission compared to last year and finally due to the fall of financial commission by minus 7.3%. This decrease is linked to the decline in commission on both investments in mutual funds as well as life insurance products, and also with the reduction in market orders, given the weakness of the financial market.</p>
          <p>If you look at service commissions, the increase was 4.5% and we've seen a very good increase in the use of different banking services, specialty insurance, non-life insurance and payment services. This increase reflects the strengths and the developments of our customer base in both networks; Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and Cr&#xE9;dit du Nord.</p>
          <p>If you look at net interest income at the French Networks, increase was 2.6% excluding PEL/CEL compared to last year driven mainly by the increases seen in outstanding deposits and loans. The interest margin reached 2.41 &#x2013; 2% point 41 basis points, down 21 bps compared to last year and 5 bps compared to the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The effort of our one year due to on one side a continued shift in the balance sheet with an increase of loans, which is higher than deposit; it explains 14 bps of the total. And of course in this quarter, we've registered, let's say a 50bps increase in the regulating deposits after the 25 that we have seen in the 1st of August last year and this has an impact of minus 4 bps also on the margin.</p>
          <p>On page 15, if you look at the full P&amp;L of the network, we can say that the French Networks posted solid financial results this quarter. As we've seen net banking income increase by 2%, growth in operating expense remains under control at plus 1.4% compared to last year, and as a results the cost/income ratio fell by further 40 bps compared to the first quarter of '07, so 66.6% excluding PEL/CEL. I already commented on cost of risk which is slightly down compared to last year and so consequently the operating income rose by 1.8% compared to last year, excluding PEL/CEL. And return on equity after tax at the French Networks was 19.1% compared to 20.9% last year, excluding PEL/CEL.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we do expect growth which will be lower than what we have registered in 2007 mainly for two major reasons. On one side, uncertainties about economic growth as well as financial markets which you have seen has weighted on the financial condition evolution in the first quarter. And secondly because it is likely that due to inflation rise, which, let's say, is difficult for us to price in rates or fees. It's likely that we have a further 25 bps increase of the regulated savings deposits on the 1st of August &#x2013; on the next 1st of August.</p>
          <p>If we move now to International Retail Banking, of course already mentioned, retail banking outside France did record this quarter the integration of Rosbank, which brought 2.8 million additional individual customers.</p>
          <p>If you look at the performance, let's say, it was a very good first quarter in 2008 with a robust sales performance. The number of individual customers increased by 829,000 new individual customers over one year at constant structure, so almost 10.3% with strong performance registered in Romania, in Egypt, and in Morocco and Italy. You have the progression of customer deposits and loans, I will not comment on that, but it remains double-digit figure in line with what we had in mind for the trends in this division.</p>
          <p>In order to take advantage of growth opportunities in the modernized markets, this division continues to step up investments in organic growths. Thus the density of the network was further increased with 347 branches opened over one year at constant structure, with Romania accounting for 188 additional branches, but also we mentioned that we did open additional 61 branches in Mediterranean Basin. At the end of March '08, the total number of branches of retail banking outside France stood at 3,422, including Rosbank. We do expect this branch's opening pace to continue in '08.</p>
          <p>In terms of staff, the staff number increased by 3,140 at constant structure to keep pace with gross and accompanied development of the network.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned already in February 2008, there could be a chance of majority shareholder in Rosbank, and so we have launched an effort to the minority shareholder which ran until &#x2013; which was run until yesterday. And so, we will publish soon the final results of this offer.</p>
          <p>Rosbank sits pretty consolidating our accounts in January 1st of '08. So we have 100% of the revenues, 100% of the costs, 100% of the provisions. But the instruments that we have retained to calculate as a contribution to the Group profit is 35%, so 20% for one month and a half, and 50% for the rest of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving next page, let's say, putting the strategy of the Retail Banking division into perspective. As you know that our development model in this division combines targeted acquisition and organic investments and this has resulted in fast and profitable growth in recent years thereby concerning the status of this activity as a growth driver for the group.</p>
          <p>We have major phases of this accelerated growth, which has been first the acquisition of BRD in Romania in 1999, KB in Czech Republic in '01, MIBank to complement NSGB at the end of '07, in 2006 the Group bought Splitska Banka in Croatia, and so lastly we took the control in mid-February of Rosbank, and this is a major step for this activity.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned that in Russia, we're already active with BSGV and the tax audit, and the Rosbank operation, which announced a new stage in development in the spot market, even contributed a high economy growth, but where the use of banking services is still underdeveloped.</p>
          <p>Organic investment has also kept pace with these acquisitions and since 2003, as you can see on those slides, that we opened 1,120 additional branches. This is more than the number of branches that came from acquisitions during the period. Investment in Romania was one of the large contributor to this opening of new branches accounting for 640 of the total of 1,120.</p>
          <p>The application of this development strategy to regions with high growth potential for the banking industry and with economic potential has resulted in very strong commercial momentum, and as you can see, in 2003 outstanding deposits have increased by an average of almost 25% per year and outstanding loans are up by almost 35% per year, are doing so for the last four years. At the end of March 2008, International Retail Banking served 11.8 million individual customers compared to only 4.7 million at the end of 2003, so a multiplication by 2.5.</p>
          <p>In term of financial results, you can see also that the NBI of International Retail Banking rose by 19.3% per year on average between 2003 and 2007. And despite the significant organic investments which I have just mentioned, this business, nevertheless, managed to improve its cost/income ratio by 3.4 points between 2003 and 2007 resulting in an increase in the operating income at a faster pace, almost 26% per year during the period.</p>
          <p>Coming back to the first quarter results, International Retail Banking posted a sharp increase in their results. Revenues, as I mentioned, rose by 22.1% on the like-for-like basis driven mainly by strong performance achieved by Romania, Czech Republic and Egypt. The main structural effect has been, of course, the full consolidation of Rosbank. Rosbank revenues amounted to &#x20AC;183 million in the first quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increased by 14.7% compared to last year and this includes, as we mentioned on the quarterly basis, 6 percentage points, an increase by 6% linked to investment in the network development.</p>
          <p>As a result, the cost income ratio was lower at 58.2%. 57.2 if you exclude Rosbank, so a decline compared to the cost income ratio of last year. I already commented the cost of freight with and without Rosbank and so as a result the return on equity after tax remained high at 33.8% in the first quarter of '08 compared, but was stable compared to last year.</p>
          <p>If you move now to financial services on page 21 with the focus on the consumer credit business; consumer credit activities continued their strong development in the fiscal '08 driven by emerging countries. That was sustained at a 12.5% increase in new lending at &#x20AC;3 billion and as I said this was driven by strong performance that we seen in Russia, an increase by 59% of new business compared to last year. Poland, an increase by 95% and also Ukraine, an increase our notification by almost 2.6 times on the new business compared to last year.</p>
          <p>New lending in France, Italy and Germany was stable compared to the first quarter of '07. Also, even if they were already consolidating in the second half of '07 compared to last year, we have to mention that we have the consolidation of Banco Cacique and Banco Pecunia in Brazil. They accounted for a new business of approximately &#x20AC;118 million this quarter or 6% of total new business.</p>
          <p>Overall, the consumer credit outstanding were up by 15.4% compared to last year to &#x20AC;18.8 billion and this excludes the assets managed on behalf of the French retail networks, which amounted to &#x20AC;6.1 billion. The development strategy at the business side, which combines strong organic investments in emerging market and targeted acquisitions has stepped up since 2005, with the acquisition of Eurobank in Poland, Promek and SKT in Russia, and Banco Pecunia and Banco Cacique in Brazil.</p>
          <p>We have also continued to create greenfield operation ever since in Turkey and Vietnam at the end of '07, and we have launched at the start of 2008 a subsidiary in Serbia. The business now presents in 25 countries, with strong position in both Western and Central and in Eastern Europe. So development strategy have led to dynamic progression in the business time in the recent year and this trend has continued in the first quarter with a 33% increase in revenues compared to last year, 15.9% over like-for-like basis. And the gross that you can see on the pie chart was driven by the emerging markets which posted the sharp increase in their contribution, with NBI doubling in absolute terms compared to last year and spending that today at 46% of the total compared to 31% one year earlier.</p>
          <p>On page 22, moving to business finance and services, there was also in this division, this sub component of the financial services, a very good growth in leasing and also in fleet management. In leasing, I remind you that SG Equipment Finance is a leader in equipment finance in Continental Europe. And it posted an 11.3% increase in new lending to &#x20AC;2.2 billion compared to last year. The performance was driven by good activities in Northern and Central and Eastern Europe. At the end of March 2008, outstanding excluding factoring to that &#x20AC;17.6 billion up by 7.5% on a like-for-like basis over one year.</p>
          <p>SG Equipment Finance is present in 23 countries worldwide. Operational vehicle leasing and fleet management continued also a sustained development with a 6.9% increase in the fleet management over one year at constant structure to 742,000 vehicles at the end of March. ALD Automotive which is present in 39 countries thus strengthened its position as European number two in term of fleet management.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 23 on the financial results for financial services as a whole. The net income of financial services rose by 11.6% compared to last year at &#x20AC;154 million. Total net banking income at specialized financing increased by 12.5%. Operating expenses increased at a slightly slower pace, 12.1%, as a result of high level of global investment especially in consumer credit and to a certain extent in equipment finance.</p>
          <p>The cost income ratio remained under control at the low level of 59.4%. The increase in net allocation of provisions reflect the growing weight of consumer activities in the SFS and the growing presence of emerging countries in which the cost of risk is higher but as already mentioned, which is easily covered by the margin.</p>
          <p>If we have a focus on life insurance, the gross new setting influence in life insurance were down by 16.7% compare to last year to &#x20AC;2.3 billion in a challenging and very competitive financial environment. Against this backdrop, the share in unit-linked policies amounted to 15.5%, reflecting investor preference for our euro denominated contract. Mathematical provision rose by 3.9% on a like-for-like basis, of one year. Overall revenues in the insurance activity rose by 12.8% versus last year.</p>
          <p>I propose you now to move to Global Investment Management and Services division. The mix performances in this core business continued on from the trends in H207 with Asset Management suffering from the liquidity crisis, while Private Banking and Security Services, performing very well.</p>
          <p>I would like to start on page 25 and 26 with Asset Management. Asset Management continued to suffer the adverse effect of the liquidity crisis, which started last summer. So trend in outflows, which are started in the third quarter continued for both dynamic money market funds, which recorded outflows of 5.2 billion this quarter and CDOs managed by TCW, which recorded outflows of 4.8 billion this quarter.</p>
          <p>In CDOs the outflows stem from the unwinding of the last market values CDOs in the western world, which have started in the third quarter of last year. I remind you that the collateral manager in this typology of CDO liquidates in the event of the deterioration the value of the security used as collateral below certain levels and this is what took place on this categories of CDOs over the last three quarters.</p>
          <p>Note that the withdrawals of the CDOs does not have any impact let's say or in terms of losses of this revenue, but it is more let's say, a loss of opportunities of revenues on future commission in the future. We do estimate that the loss of revenues coming from management fees this quarter, amounted to approximately US$6 million for the CDOs.</p>
          <p>We should point out that the outflows of total &#x20AC;10 billion have been partially offset by subscription to regular money-markets funds, which amounted to approximately &#x20AC;5 billion this quarter.</p>
          <p>In total outflows, again in the first quarter amounted to minus &#x20AC;7.3 billion. On top of this outflows, market effects were negative for 23.5 billion and exchange rate affect negative for minus 7.7 billion. I remind you that this revenue which is of course in dollar represents 26% of the production under management at the end of March '08.</p>
          <p>The total assets under management have again stood at &#x20AC;319.2 billion of assets excluding of course the assets managed by Lyxor Asset Management, which is consolidated in the equity division of the CIB, and Lyxor Asset Management had 72.5 billion of asset under management at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Regarding dynamic money market assets, they amounted to 5.6 billion at the end of March compared to 11 billion at the end of December. And we should mention that these assets were made liquid for the most part with less than 10% of the assets invested in asset-backed securities.</p>
          <p>If we continue on page 26, let's say, we should mention that again the backdrop for the liquidity crisis, most of Asset Management companies have been safe since August 2007, with respect to these drawdown demands from their money market funds. And again -- was one of the leader from these market segments with a very high market share of approximately 20% before the start of the crisis.</p>
          <p>The Group has already announced in the fourth quarter that it has taken the decision to support the liquidity of certain mutual funds in the interest of its clients and in the respect equality between unit holders. To this end in the fourth quarter, it put in place liquidity buffers, rapid disposal means in the market and through SGAM bond I remind you that we mentioned that as SGAM bond had &#x20AC;4.4 billion of assets in the balance sheet at the end of December.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2008 there were further disposal, mainly to make to funds as liquid as possible given both the ongoing deterioration of the credit markets and also the risk of the spillover of the crisis as well as to be able to cope with withdrawals. The sales were carried out in the market to the Group both Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Corporate and Investment Banking and the corporate center, which purchased in particular the asset housed by SGAM bond at the end of the '07. The disposals were carried out at the price fixed by models integrating observational market prices, spread analysis, the rating and maturity of the securities, and each party, again the corporate center validated the prices.</p>
          <p>Overall assets purchased and held by the Group as part of managing the crisis amounted to at the most to 7.4 billion housed in the same portfolio at SG CIB and 3.8 billion at the corporate center, so a total 11.2 billion. The type of underlying assets in the portfolios are break down and the rating of these assets are covered by two slides that we'll find in appendices at the end of the presentation.</p>
          <p>As a result of these assets disposal from SGAM to other party of the Group, SGAM booked as a negative item in net banking income, minus &#x20AC;274 million coming mainly from losses, minus 270, and write-downs minus 4. On top of these losses, SGAM also booked minus &#x20AC;60 million linked to seed money which we also disclosed in the previous quarter. I do believe that at the end of March 2008, the measures taken to reduce the sensitivity of portfolios managed by SGAM for third parties are almost complete and that dynamic money market funds now are for the most part being managed.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 27, regarding Private Banking, we should mention that in the challenging environments and marked by the liquidity crisis, but also by the announcement of the Board of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Group, SG Private Banking generated very satisfactory documentaries with net new money of &#x20AC;0.4 billion this quarter compared to 2 billion last quarter &#x2013; in the first quarter of '07. So, training outflow that we've seen at the end of February was reversed during March with net inflows of &#x20AC;600 million in March reflecting the confidence of our clients and prospects after the success of the capital increase, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. The market impact and for any change impact for the quarter were unfavorable reflecting the minus &#x20AC;4.6 billion and minus 1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>We should also mention that this quarter SG Private Banking realized or consolidated Canadian Wealth Management, a small boutique in Private Banking, Calgary which contributed 0.4 billion of asset under management to the business line.</p>
          <p>As a result, asset under management of SG Private Banking stood at &#x20AC;71.7 billion compared to 76.9 at the end of 2007, as I mentioned mainly coming from the forex and negative market movement. These assets mentioned do not include, of course, the assets held by customers of the French network with investable assets of euro 150,000 which accounted for &#x20AC;112 billion at the end of March.</p>
          <p>If you look at the financial performance of SG Private Banking, the gross margin was very strong at 115 bps this quarter compared to 111 in the first quarter of 2007. This increase is due to the ongoing development of the credit activities as the credit activity was more cash positioned at &#x2013; in our customer base, and the treasury activities which all took advantage of the pressure on interest rates and spread widening as a result of the liquidity crisis.</p>
          <p>It is important to notice that the impact of the current economic condition has not altered the ambition of the business planned for 2010 that Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric mentioned in early February, i.e. positively doubling the return on &#x2013; the gross impact on income compared to its level in 2006. The division &#x2013; the business line will also continue to strengthen its sales force. We have increased by 145 different officer compared to last year, strengthened our continued targeted acquisitions and also continued to be one of the most dynamic franchise in Europe as well in international markets, mainly Asia.</p>
          <p>On page 28, I focus on the Securities Services, which is not there including the recent creation of Newedge. In the first quarter '08, Securities Services continued their dynamic development and maintained satisfactory commercial performances while the market was, as I mentioned already several times, difficult. For SG SS, assets under custody rose to &#x20AC;2,731 billion at the end of March, at 11.6% compared to last year. This includes the impact on one side of the acquisition of Capitalia securities activities in the last day of March as well as a successful migration of the Pioneer Funds in Luxembourg, it was the last stage of the acquisition we made18 months ago of Pec&#xFA;nia Banco, which <mark type="inaudible" />. So these two operations did contribute 150 billion to the assets under custody, so the underlying growth is approximately 5% over the quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of assets under administration, it reached &#x20AC;499 billion at the end of the quarter at 28% compared to last year and again, this includes 120 billion coming from Pioneer and Capitalia.</p>
          <p>Looking at Boursorama, we're seeing an environment where we are seeing a downturn in stock market indices. The number of executed orders at Boursorama fell by a little bit less 12% compared to last year. However, it is important to mention that the banking arm of Boursorama has been increasingly successful since its launch, with 5,700 new bank accounts opened over the quarter, which is almost double than the figure realized by Boursorama last year. And Boursorama had, at the end of March around 68,000 accounts for the banking operation.</p>
          <p>Moving to Newedge, so as I mentioned, which has been trading on the second of Jan, the new entities resulting from the merger of Fimat and Calyon has been achieving a sustained activity with 431 million executed transactions for the quarter, 462 million contracts cleared. And so in listed derivatives, it's undergoing the regular growth that's confirmed its position as one of the world leader in execution and clearing, and as you can see on the table, ranked number three per Futures Commission Merchants in terms of account deposit, published at the end of February.</p>
          <p>Page 29 has the P&amp;L of GIMS, like I said already there were mixed performance at GIMS with asset management significantly impacted by the liquidity crisis. So NBI of the division came out at &#x20AC;597 million down 42.4% on a like-for-like basis compared to last year. A negative growth of credit income which came mainly from the losses registered by SGAM; the other business is performing pretty well. I will not comment all the details; you have the figure under here.</p>
          <p>Moving to Corporate and Investment Banking, page 31, we told you that the revenues at Corporate and Investment Banking for the first quarter '08 were marked by impacts again of the credit market crisis. The total revenues of the SG CIB came out at &#x20AC;1,563 million, down 16.6% compared to last year, which again was a very high level of comparison. I remind that it was almost a record level for SG CIB in the first quarter of '08.</p>
          <p>In short and before determining each business line individually, I would like to point out that the equities, franchise registered very well over the quarter, as did financing and advisory arm despite the lack of activity in the market, and the fixed income division continue to suffer from the effect of the credit market crisis on the trading side, the client-driven activity performed pretty well.</p>
          <p>The 20% fall in the account driven revenues of the CIB versus last year to 971 million euro nevertheless reflected the strong resilience of our franchises in an unfavorable market environment.</p>
          <p>Trading activities, and I will comment on this point, made another negative contribution and there was, I say, three buckets of impact. The first one is a write-down linked to the crisis in the U.S. real estate residential markets, the second one comes from the credit market dislocation and this was partly offset or totally offset by the mark-to-market under CDS and financial liabilities.</p>
          <p>Starting with the first bucket, so the write-downs resulting from the crisis in the U.S. residential market, you can see that we have had additional &#x20AC;350 million write-downs on the portfolio of energy CDOs, I will comment on that later; additional &#x20AC;203 million for counterparty risks on monoline insurers, and also minus &#x20AC;43 million write-down from the RMBS portfolio.</p>
          <p>The second bucket comes from the dislocation of the credit markets and the extension of the crisis to new asset classes especially in Europe. And as you can see we have &#x2013; this has led us to book in SG CIB results in the first quarter '08, minus &#x20AC;166 million of write-downs on the European ABS portfolio sold by SGAM, and further &#x20AC;417 million in losses and write-downs, approximately two share losses and one share write-downs on our portfolio of exotic credit derivative.</p>
          <p>These items were almost entirely offset by significant positive movements including the positive impact of the mark-to-market value of CDS for &#x20AC;743 million, and as I already mentioned also, the positive item of &#x20AC;523 million coming from such additional on credit risk on financial liabilities revaluation at fair value during the quarter.</p>
          <p>As you can, as you have seen in the first slide, credit supply continued to erode in April. It is, it was important for us to mention that the mark-to-market on the CDS, which generates volatility in our revenues has almost been erased at the end of April post the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>On page 32, if we move to each business line, market conditions in the equities harming the first quarter remained very challenging with difficult market alignment and were marked also by very high volatility and short increase in correlation. Whether equity in the finance book is a very strong client-driven performance which proved that its franchise has remained intact. Q1 '08 was a transition period for the trading activities and I remind that we have voluntarily reduced some stress test limits and some volumes on competitive operation. And so we have also strengthened the controls post lien coverage of the whole.</p>
          <p>Again with backdrop, equities posted NBI of &#x20AC;734 million, down 3% compared to the fourth quarter and 31% compared to the first quarter last year which was a record level. If we do exclude the change in fair value of financial validity which represented &#x20AC;200 million impact, the net banking income came out at &#x20AC;534 million, down 48.5% on the like-for-like basis compared to last year.</p>
          <p>So account-driven investments which amounted to &#x20AC;367 million for the quarter, down 36% compared to Q1 and 15% compared to Q4, quite solid, and account for the solid contribution from flow products especially EPS in which mix arrangement in Europe with a market share of 27%. We should note it also that the performance in structured products was flat compared to what we have seen in the fourth quarter in terms of new business.</p>
          <p>Lyxor as I mentioned the outstanding of the asset management of Lyxor. Lyxor asset management posted also very high inflows of &#x20AC;6.3 billion during the quarter. On the trading side for the quarter, the revenues came out at &#x20AC;167 million, stable compared to the fourth quarter of '07 and done significantly on the very high level of first quarter '07.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned already, this reflects the group's deliberate decisions to produce track estimates and reduce non-productivity as well of course, as well as the less favorable market condition.</p>
          <p>If we move to Financing and Advisory, the division which is very well in low market volumes as the middle of the crisis. The total revenues amounted to &#x20AC;980 million for the quarter. It is important to notice that it benefited from the positive impact of the mark-to-market value of the Canadian footswap which accounted for &#x20AC;743 million during the quarter. The account driven revenues came out at &#x20AC;207 million compared to 359 last year, a decrease by 25%.</p>
          <p>This quarter revenues also included a &#x20AC;44 million write-down on the portfolio of investment great transaction in the right thing including a write-down of 24 million for the LBO portfolio. This write-down based on conservative assumption and we have some detail in the appendices, was booked on the portfolio of LBO and syndication which account for approximately &#x20AC;0.9 billion at the end of March compared to 1.2 billion at the end of '07 and we have applied a discount of approximately 8% on the book which was there before the crisis.</p>
          <p>Overall, note that the performance of the division were generated in a difficult environment with a general downturn volumes, which mainly affected primary issuance in euros, bonds and shares, syndication markets and of course LBO markets. Against this backdrop DCM business of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. We managed to complete several significant transactions which had always strengthened, as you can see on the slide, its market share in euro denominated bond issue on previous quarter with a market share of 5% and the top five positions, which is our aim in terms of market positioning. Just to give you example, SG CIB was a joint book runner in Boursorama, Texmart and the Kingdom of Spain.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the structure of finance activity also confirmed their strength in particular commodities and infrastructure financing. Several large operations were carried out throughout the quarter. For example SG CIB was the arranger for the organization of the coal pre-export facility for SUEK the leading Russian coal producer. This transaction also involved several of our business lines demonstrating the quality of our cross-selling model.</p>
          <p>If we move now to the fixed income currencies and commodities division, it posted a solid client driven activities level in very unfavorable market conditions. However, as already mentioned, trading was affected by further write-downs and losses.</p>
          <p>Total revenues of the business came out at minus &#x20AC;151 million and if we have to exclude the change in fair value of financial liabilities, which represented &#x20AC;323 million for hitch during the quarter, revenues came out at minus &#x20AC;474 million. As I already mentioned, the quarter was marked by good client-driven activity and negative contribution from credit.</p>
          <p>With regard to client-driven activities, activity level was solid with the record performance in flow products as you can see on the slide. Fixed income, currency, and credit flow business increased by 26% compared to the fourth quarter and 83% compared to the first quarter of '07. But of course, we have seen a slower activity in the structured rate product markets and an almost non-existent credit structure product markets. Overall client-driven activity came out at &#x20AC;327 million, down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of '07, but up almost 20% compared to the first quarter of '07.</p>
          <p>Trading activity posted a negative contribution with net banking income of minus &#x20AC;801 million due to the deterioration of market condition marked by the sharp widening of credit spreads and high volatility. I may not again detail elements I mentioned at the beginning. But you should &#x2013; I should mention that they account for &#x20AC;1,179 million negative.</p>
          <p>So you can see that apart from these items, which are also important, the business was able to benefit from a strong performance in further activity and also a strong progression in flow rates trading activities during the quarter.</p>
          <p>If we now move to let's say each bucket of write-offs that I mentioned at the beginning. On the un-hedged CDO portfolio in the U.S. residential mortgage sector, you can see on the table that the gross and net exposure of the AAA super senior tranches of CDOs totaled &#x20AC;4.4 billion at end of March compared to 4.9 billion at the end of '07.</p>
          <p>So foreign exposure is not only linked to the change in the euro-dollar exchange rate, but also to the start of the amortization of some of the managed CDOs. Also we should mention that due to an early repayment and also default on some underlying assets, attachment points can slightly compare to end of '07, but generally remain at the same level.</p>
          <p>With the change in the market environments, we have adjusted the assumption underpinning our valuation method by increasing income loss rate of 2005, 2006 and 2007 vintage to respectively 10% for 2005, about 9% at the end of '07, 25% income loss for the vintage 2006 it was previously 23% and 27% income loss for the vintage 2007, it was previously 25% at the end of '07.</p>
          <p>This corresponds to a scenario of global loss for the entire industry through the &#x2013; through the U.S. residential mortgage sector of U.S. $385 billion by the end of '07, the scenario was a global losses of U.S. $355 billion.</p>
          <p>The results of this simulations, the write-down levels sort of retain, remain superior to the level of ABX indices, which we can see at the end of March. To, let's say, adjust for the appreciation of this new scenario, this has led us to carry additional write-downs for &#x20AC;350 million for the quarter. On top of the 1,250 billion, which we already booked during 2007. As a result, our net exposure on the financial debt senior tranches of CDO came out at 2.9 billion at the end of March, this correspond to an average write-down rate of 34% of the nominal amount of this tranches compared 25% at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>Moving to the monoline on page 36, so the gross exposure to monoline insurers tends from the financial guarantees that we receive from the insurers to hedge certain assets. Given the change in interest rate spreads in the first quarter, the estimated amounts which could become due to the Group from monoline guarantees rose from 1.9 billion at the end of '07 to 2.4 billion at the end of March. I remind you that evaluation methods used for measuring the fund, especially for underlying assets into the U.S. residential mortgage sector, is the same as the one used for the unhedged CDOs.</p>
          <p>Net of this 2.4 billion exposure, we bought protection from banks, which are deductible from the gross exposure and this protection are stable at &#x20AC;0.6 billion at the end of March. Thus the net exposure of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale Group increased from 1.3 billion at the end of '07 to 1.8 billion at the end of March.</p>
          <p>While looking at the significant progress made in stabilizing certain monoline insurers over the quarter, we have chosen to maintain a cautious stance with a coverage rate of 60% of the exposure, which would approve our main uses. This is a very tough scenario, it is from one side the stress on underlying assets was actually realized and on the other side, in the event of the immediate and simultaneous default of all the monoline insurance company. So as a result, after the 900 million write-down in the fourth quarter '07 recorded by the group, we passed additional &#x20AC;203 million write-down which increased our coverage to a total of &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>On page 37 let me tell the exotic credit derivative exposure that we do carry. This exotic credit derivative activity is first of all account-driven activity, which is based on selling to clients securities index on the credits of an ABS portfolios. By purchasing this index securities, this is equivalent investor of selling the credit protection to Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale on tranches of ABS portfolio. And this is a term business and we don't want to retain the position, we have to hedge this position generically in our accounts. And so to do that we use several forms of interaction to limit our directional exposure to credit, we manage the position and double the hedge. So we do that through three ways; first of all by purchasing the portfolio from running ABS, second, by trading on the relevant indices, ABX, CMBX, also by adjusting the amount of protection sold to clients.</p>
          <p>So changes in credit spreads are nevertheless liable to change in delta of the position and consequently the hedge must be permanently adjusted, this is what we call the dynamic hedge management.</p>
          <p>As we stated at this top of the presentation, there where exceptionally large movements in U.S. and European credit spreads during the quarter and these movements affected the delta of the exhausted credibility position and also generated business risk, which will be entering assets held and the index hedges, I mentioned that the cash business will be exactly in the same magnitude than the indices during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The management of this position as a result and of the business position coming from these movements &#x2013; different movements from the indices and the cash resulted in losses of &#x20AC;470 million over the quarter. The net portfolio exposure at the end of March was short credit for 1.8 billion in equivalent five-year bonds. The slide also give you in footnotes the size of the portfolio of the underlying assets. As a conclusion to this activity, note that the directional position is limited, the exceptional spread movement in the first quarter '08 presenting an unprecedented base moment between cash and industry which explains a part of the losses, and lastly the quality of the underlying portfolio is not in doubt as it is 98% comprised of AAA rated businesses.</p>
          <p>If you move now to page 38 on the full P&amp;L of SG Corporate and Investment Banking, the results let's say reflect an extremely difficult market environment in page two on the trading side and as I have already explained, revenues were marked by substantial non-recurring items and I will not detail there again.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses were down by minus 4.2% compared to the first quarter of '07. We should mention that the ongoing increase in staff number in the first quarter '08, plus 12% compared to last year, which reflects first of all the investment we made on the franchise in H1 07 as well as also the strengthening of the control procedure that we have conducted since the un-coverage of the fraud. So this strengthening or increased investment was partially offset by the decline in performance-linked bonuses.</p>
          <p>The increase in the cost income also was slightly high at 64% compared to a low level of 55.5%, but this is entire due to the fall in revenues. I already commented the cost of risk over the quarter, which is in only two or three rigid accounts and the absence of reversal of old provisions. And so other results, net income was down 79%, &#x20AC;139 million corresponding to return on equity after tax at 9.4% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>The risk weighted assets of SG CIB increased by 10.3% over one year; I remind you that we've slowed down the growth of the risk weighted assets, which stood at 26% on a like-for-like basis at midyear last year.</p>
          <p>As a conclusion on page 40, revenues for the first quarter '08 as already mentioned by Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric, reflects the resilience of the group's franchises and its capacity to bounce back after an exceptionally serious incident. In a very difficult market environment the net income came out at &#x20AC;1,096 million, down by 23% compared to last year which was a high comparative base, especially in the Corporate and Investing Banking division.</p>
          <p>The contribution of the retail banking business in France and outside France as well as a financial services to net income was very satisfactory and was up on the first quarter '07. And so this is very strong positive side. The contribution from GIMS was very much impacted by the latest negative impact of the recondition of assets in dynamic money market funds, but as I already mentioned both private banking, custody, Newedge will do well in this environment.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Corporate and Investment Banking continue to be heavily impacted by the financial crisis, but its franchisees resisted well and in very difficult condition. The contribution of the corporate center was exceptionally high due of course to the capital gain on Fimat. So these results our strong sign and also the Group benefits from a base study financial situation as illustrated by Q1 ratio of 7.9% under Basel I, and 8.0% under Basel II.</p>
          <p>I was a little bit long, I now propose you to turn to the question. So I am listening to you and I would be there to answer with other members of the Executive Committee.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Can you hear me? Yes, hi. I have few questions, the first one is related to short correlation position, can you give me the gross mark-to-market that you took on the equity derivative correlation book ex provisions, excluding provisions that you might have taken against it? So second question is related to equity derivative structured-product volumes, how do you see that market develop in Asia versus Europe? We've seen a slowdown in numbers in terms of the markets in Europe, but I am quite interested how you see that part of the business developing. And thirdly, I am very interested to understand your corporate provisions within your CIB division. I think you mentioned it's related to certain corporates or counterparties, just trying to understand what kind of provision is this? What is it related to? And lastly, if you could just tell me what your year-end outstanding number of shares are? Thank you, sorry &#x2013; end of first quarter outstanding shares are? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Kian good afternoon. I propose that Jean-Pierre will answer the question on the equity derivative credit products as well as the provision in CIB and then I will take the question on the number of shares at the end of the quarter. Jean-Pierre?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Kian, well we don't disclose the detail of our profitability within our equity derivatives book it is fair to say it has been said that the correlation during the quarter specifically on Asia underlying was higher and that a certain number of banks, which were all involved in very similar transactions have suffered from the higher correlation, illiquidity of the market. We had an impact for us, which was not negligible, but which was well-managed basically and which we felt was not worth mentioning in specific detail. This being said, we feel that correlations today are at a quite high level and represent still, and maybe even more, quite an attractive asset.</p>
          <p>On your second question about the structured-products business and the outlook. First of all, we mentioned that our production of structured products has been relatively stable compared to the first quarter. That does not so translate into P&amp;L as part of our structured-product production has been down basically with transactions, which are impacted by the day-one IAS rule and for which we don't recognize immediately the P&amp;L. But in terms of economic figures if you want, we were stable last year's Q4, which we felt was a quite reasonable performance.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for structured product is actually less bearish than the one you have in your latest report. We feel that while on the retail side there could be some kind of slowdown in the current environment because clearly retail clients invest less into equity or equity-structured products when the environment is less favorable on the equity market. There is a stronger push from individual clients, which are not only hedge funds on one side, but more specifically pension fund and large asset managers with whom we have contracted non-negligible transaction; it's an understatement. And where we see a quite strong a potential. So in the short term, one can expect that the retail client business we will probably be slower, but that does not represent a major P&amp;L impact as most of the retail activity these days is done on the request for corporate basis, where you have extremely competitive costs, which are given in a small margin. And we feel it will be compensated, at least in our case, more than compensated by the additional business. So medium term, we feel as we said during our capital increase that the clients or business revenues and specifically on the equity-derivatives side could grow at a rate which we expect and specifically for structured product, if I give you a wide range to be safe between 5 to 15% equity with a 2010 horizon.</p>
          <p>On the third question as far as the corporate provisions are concerned, we never disclose, of course, for which client or which contracts we took provision, but we have said that for two or three specific files this quarter we took what we feel are quite prudent provision. But we feel these transactions are very specific, not linked to the current credit environment and as Didier mentioned, the outlook on our portfolio outside of this transaction is unchanged. And if we put aside this transaction we have no reason to change our current outlook in terms of overall medium-term cost of risk. For the last question I hand over back to Didier.</p>

          <p>Thank you Jean-Pierre. So this is one of the most difficult questions. You have for the EPS that says the average number on slide 71 for the end of the quarter our total number of share. We had 583 million share at the end of March, sorry. And if we deduct let's say the treasury share that we had in our book is a little over 553 million shares that we are using to get the book value at the end of March.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is coming from Christoffer Malmer of Goldman Sachs. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Hi, it's Chris Malmer from Goldman's. A few questions, if I could start on the investment bank. If I look at the fixed-income currency and commodity revenues and I look at the underlying -i.e., I take out the items that you classify as non-recurring, obviously I do take &#x2013; recognize I take the bad stuff, but nevertheless I end up with about &#x20AC;700 million of underlying revenues, which is by a long way the best you've had in that business line. So, I was just wondering if you can tell us anything about, was it difficult to talk about outlook, but anything you can tell us about that number to what extent you think it's been influenced by abnormal activity in certain business lines, which we shouldn't be using as the reference point going forward?</p>
          <p>Second question, staying within the investment bank, on slide 37, the exotic credit derivatives, if you can tell us in relation to those gross loan positions, should we assume that the majority of your gross loan positions are effectively cash, is that a fair assumption? You mentioned obviously there is various ways in which you manage this. And third question would be on Rosbank in Russia. If I take the 183 million of net-banking income for the quarter and annualize, it looks like a relatively low number compared to what Rosbank reported under IRFS in 2007. So, it looks as if there is relatively low run rate of growth in the revenues there. Anything you can say as to whether there is any marks or trading losses that we have seen in other Russian banks, possibly affecting Rosbank in the quarter? And final question just a clarification, just on the asset-management revenues, did you say there was a 60 million negative provision on mark on the seed funds if I got that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. Just to answer the last two questions and then I will hand over to Jean-Pierre. For the seed money it is 16, 16 not 60, so there is 16 million euro losses on the seed money again. Regarding Rosbank, the one is we &#x2013; I mentioned, let's say this is based on the normative equity, first of all, for the thing that Rosbank is not working let's say with the full benefit of its local capitalization, under our standard let's say we do allocate 50% of core Tier 1 of equity. So, I think there's not equity to calculate the revenues. And also for example Rosbank has part of its activity, which has been tabled in the custody business because of the activity just, you know, to take an example of the custodian business in retail banking outside France are now let's say under this provision of the custody business and with in jeans and so we have an analytical let's say breakdown of part of the revenues also to other businesses. So this is an explanation why that as the run rate you are effectively seeing that Rosbank appears to be slightly low compared to what you can see in its local reporting. I'll now hand over to Jean-Pierre on the question you had on the fixed-income revenues and as well as equity credit derivatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bonjour, Chris. So on the fixed-income side, if I am a little bit extreme in case that we take everything which is losing, we have only what is making money. So &#x2013; but your calculation is correct. If we take the exceptional item or at least what we characterize as exceptional item, the NBI for the quarter is around &#x20AC;705 million. So, part of these revenues are made of client revenues and the client revenues compared to the first quarter '07 are up 20%. So, that's the performance, which we feel is adequate in the environment, which was clearly overall a bit tough but as we said, we had quite a strong performance of our flow business. The flow business has increased by 83% versus Q1, '07, which is a business that we have developed for the past few years and the work which has been done by the team has brought quite a good result and the environment has been as such that there has been much less competition as well by banks and the spreads both on rates and credit were wider which was very supportive for the flow business which basically benefited from wider spreads in terms of market.</p>
          <p>The second item, which explain good performance of the activity was that the books where initially on the trading side, outside of the sales side, were initially positioned being loan protection at the end of the first &#x2013; at the last &#x2013; fourth quarter of 2007, which helped as well especially on the flow trading side. And finally on our treasury business, we had quite a good performance as well. We were up 37% versus Q1, '07 there on a steeper curve and more market opportunities as well. So net-net, a good performance but I would not characterize the underlying performance of the fixed-income business ex exceptional to remain at &#x20AC;700 million, far from that, for the other quarters and the run rate should be more the run rate we had last year plus a few percent basically.</p>
          <p>On your question on our structured-credit portfolio, your assumption is for a large extent correct. Most of the hedges we have detailed in the slide, on the slide 37, in the footnotes are for cash and we adjust our delta hedge for indices basically. So the initial hedges were made buying cash CMBS and we mentioned that we have 10.8 billion of CMBS, which are mostly U.S. CMBS. We have 4.5 billion of RMBS, breakdown that we &#x2013; we could give you that &#x2013; we have basically 1.4 billion of prime, we have 1 billion of subprime, and 2.2 billion of mid-prime. And as I mentioned on the U.S. ABS we have 98% of the cash assets, which are rated AAA basically. On the European ABS, we have 100% of assets which are rated AAA and we have 2.5 billion of those, 1.4 billion of European RMBS and outside of that roughly 590 million of UK RMBS and 280 million of Spanish RMBS. But as I said, all of those are AAA assets. That I think should answer your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. May I just follow up, while I've got you on the line, just &#x2013; we're hearing from some of your peers that when it comes to the basis risk, they are mostly concerned about the discrepancy between index and cash movements in the U.S. RMBS space and related securities and less so on the CMBS side. I was just wondering whether you would agree with that. And the second follow-up question would be, back to the asset-management division, if I then add back in the two negative one-offs in that division, so the 274 and the 16 million, it still seems as if the margin is down to a record low in asset management. I was just wondering whether there's anything there, obviously the composition seems to be improving with some of the money-market assets disappearing. So I was just wondering why the margin would be that low. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, the basis risk, I think that we have seen a basis movement. As I said, we have initially put up the hedges by using the cash market and we adjust our delta hedge by using the index market. And we are seeing a basis risk on the RMBS side, but also on the CMBS side, which has been overreacting on the widening of the spread basically reaching roughly 300 basis points on the index side and the cash moved less to a certain extent and afterwards, narrowing quite sharply &#x2013; in a very sharp short squeeze. And basically the &#x2013; we feel that the index market, derivative market has a higher volatility because it's more liquid and hence as the market tends to basically &#x2013; or the profitable players tend to hedge in the same way, it just pushes the derivative hedges hence creating this basis risk when we hedge our negative gamma or negative <mark type="inaudible" /> basically of the portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question on the gamma, I will let Philippe Collas answer. Very quickly I think this is also linked to the reduction that we booked in performance fees and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. It is mainly coming from performance fees &#x2013; we had less performance fees than last year and we think to the market effect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also as, I mentioned also, we do estimate that the outflows or the unwinding of the CDOs or so called <mark type="inaudible" /> in euros <mark type="inaudible" /> revenues this quarter and <mark type="inaudible" /> weighted on the margin.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. My question would be on the French retail. First you mentioned that you launched life insurance campaigns this March. Is it possible to have a feedback of how you are performing? Second element is regarding the strong performance of the loan side on the SMEs. Can you please quantify &#x2013; could you please give us some feeling of where this growth is coming from, which part is long-term investments, and because it's the second quarter, to which we have such a kind of growth on the SMEs. And if that's the case, is your new joint venture between the investment banking and the retail that you put in place two years ago, is giving you some really strong potentials? And if we can have also the &#x2013; an idea of the return on equity of the SMEs, that would be great.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maxence, I will let Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois answer to your two questions. I can already mention that on the return on equity on SMEs, we do not disclose this figure. So &#x2013; and this is the end of the <mark type="inaudible" /> of the question.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Regarding the campaign on insurance life starting 1st of March, we have good result as we have &#x2013; as the same result that in March <mark type="inaudible" />. Also, we have do better than the market in March. After &#x2013; we can say a very bad month in February, just after the Kerviel crisis. And so we are continuing in April. I don't know yet the results of our competitors but I think that we have performed quite well in April. But mainly, on the euro side and not in the fund units business. And regarding SMEs, the growth in the production of loans is driven quite 50-50 between short-term loans and medium-term loans. We have also good results in leasing, mainly a realistic leasing, but also as expected, short lease leasing in asset leasing. So we have a strong performance in terms of loans. I had &#x2013; to hand that probably we have performed better than our competitors because just after the Kerviel crisis we assumed it was very important to say that we were there, to lend money to our consumers and so it's what we have done in February and March.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, I just want to clarify the revenues of corporate and investment banking going into the second quarter. And I understand that you're basically saying that the 740 million of CDOs gain has reversed during the quarter. So does that mean that it's actually negative 740 in Q2? And also should we expect that the fair value adjustment on your own debt will also to a large extent have reversed in the quarter. So basically you could have a negative 1.2 billion in which case obviously, there would be a loss in SocGen CIB so I just wanted to clarify that. And also I listened to your comments on the cost in CIB, but I am not quite sure what we should basically expect in terms of sort of maybe not Q2, but medium term cost income in the corporate investment banking, because it does seem that the cost has sequentially been a bit too strong. So if you could just elaborate again on the cost that will be great? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guillaume, good afternoon. So I would take the first question and hand over to Jean-Pierre for the second one. On the first one, yes, the 743 million positive that we had in the first quarter has almost entirely melt down in April. So definitely your interpretation is correct, this means that we have the bulk of the same figure income of minus <mark type="inaudible" />. Regarding the spread on SG signature, you can assume that the spread on SG signature are less volatile and assume there and they widen also a little bit less in the previous quarter. So we should not expect let's say the same type of full, let's say, reversal in the second quarter. And as we mentioned because it is very important that a fair value adjustment on the signature of Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale has no impact on the Tier 1. So the positive items that we booked in the fourth quarter for a bit more than &#x20AC;200 million and the items that we booked in the first quarter did not fall into in to the Tier 1 capital ratio of the group. I now hand over to Jean-Pierre for the cost income of SG CIB on the medium term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Guillaume, basically on the cost income we stick to our forecast, which <mark type="inaudible" /> and that's far as our cost income targets are for 2009. So you are right to say that for the first quarter we had a decrease of 4% of our cost where basically the base effect if I may say or the carry over effect from the increase of staff we had last year, increased our cost of staff, which was slightly more than offset by the decrease of bonuses because we had lower performance. But net-net our staff head count we had a very low turnover actually in Q1, which was very, very small and actually a tenth of what we had last year, so a very stable head count. But we have basically increased our head count between Q4 and Q1 by 0.9%. So relatively stable head count, but between Q1 '07 and Q1 '08 basically the increase was higher was around 12%. So the staff increase of 12% clearly translates in cost income, which is partially compensated by the bonus side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up, did you have to give any guaranteed bonus for people not to leave in order to protect the firm size? And secondly sorry I forgot the third question a very small one, on domestic retail did you confirm the revenue growth guidance for the full year of roughly nominal GDP thanks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On guaranteed bonus side it's done through charismatic leadership, Guillaume so we have to give no more than last year in terms of guaranteed bonuses. So we are always very careful and we manage our guaranteed bonus outflow as small single digit components of our total bonus envelope. And on the retail side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah regarding the guidance I mentioned during the presentation that we do expect let's say revenues in French networks to grow at lower levels than last year and mainly on the back, let's say of the two items I did mention which already influenced, let's say the first quarter results on one side, uncertainty regarding the financial condition evolution in difficult market environment and also growing aversion for the risk by the retail customers. And on the other side, you know that we have only part of the impact of the 50 bps increase in the regulated deposit in the net interest margins this quarter. We will have the full impact in Q2, Q3 and Q4 and it is very likely looking at inflation level that we have seen over the last months in France, that there could be an additional 25 bps increase of the original rate on the first of August. And I remind you that 25 bps increase, for let's say five months for the original and four months for our passbook, is let's say discounting half a point on the growth of the revenues. So that's why we did not confirm the nominal GDP, which remains nevertheless our target for the medium term.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Kimon Kalamboussis, Citigroup. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, this is Kimon Kalamboussis from Citi. A question on life insurance first, please. You mentioned switches in euro products, in guaranteed product sorry, euro products, so would you know what the impact on capital would be if the current trends continue, please? Second question on CIB, is it worth sort of maintaining your target to reach &#x20AC;9 billion of revenues by 2010, if the current environment remains as it is, please? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kimon, good afternoon. Regarding your question on the life insurance. Well, you know that, well the capital charge burden in terms of capital is 4% of the mathematical provisions for the life insurance in euros and only 1% for the unit linked. Regarding our calculation in terms of capital allocation so this is booked in financial strategies and for the time being we are allocating at a 75% of the solvency margin requirements of the life insurance business, so the change in the -- will marginally, potentially increase the capital burden, but we believe, it does not change let's say the underlying profitability that we would have in this activity. I'll now pass to Jean-Pierre.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah on the 2010 target. To answer your question clearly the current environment remains the same and if every month between now and 2010 is the same as March 2008 you know we do not maintain our &#x20AC;9 billion target, but we feel that the environment will normalize after a while and we are &#x2013; as we said during our capital increase workshop a prospect in terms of growth for the economy on the worldwide basis of returning back to trend in the course of 2009 and being in quite a decent and quite a thriving environment by 2010. So when you look at the underlying dynamic of our business, we feel that the client side has been on the CIB side quite resilient in the first quarter and if I may say &#x2013; I don't think our client business on the CIB side has been impacted on a consolidated basis by the fraud as some certain we had on some activities have been more than compensated by a very strong performance, namely on the flow product side. So the impact on the first quarter has much more been down to the environment rather than the fraud effect.</p>
          <p>On the client side, we had underlying strength on the client side in the flow business on a consolidated basis in our flow business between the fixed income and the equity derivative side has reached record levels this quarter, which shows that the growth dynamic is there. We've seen on the structured product side that we said our projection in the GGS side and the equity derivative side was stable versus Q4. We feel that the environment and the equity market turning the growth there on the structured product will remain. And on the trading activity, we feel that in more normalized environment we have all the resources and ability to basically benefit from an improved market environment. So net-net, I speak firmly to the &#x20AC;9 billion of revenues by 2010, but within an economic assumption and an environment which is not the environment of the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And perhaps to follow on that, I guess, what is very important is that as Jean-Pierre mentioned, that retention was high, let's say there was no deposit in quarter in the beginning of April, which is a very strong sign, and also the performance of the customer base, let's say the confidence of the customer base have been also very strong in the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Phil Richards with Execution. I've got two questions please. The first one is on slide 26, on the 11.2 billion of money market funds now held by the group. Can you just give us an indication on what's going to happen to the assets going forward? Do you expect to sell them down, and if so, could there be any losses on those assets? And secondly, is on slide 37, on the 417 million of basis risk. Please just give us some indication there of the breakdown between the RMBS and the CMBS asset classes, and also what we've seen so far in the second quarter of 2008, do you expect a further basis risk loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with your question regarding the &#x20AC;11.2 billion of assets held by SG CIB on one side and Corporate Center on the other side. Regarding the 7.4 billion that are held by SG CIB they are booked in the trading portfolio of SG CIB. So, not let's say mentioning what will be the decisions of, Jean-Pierre will perhaps comment on that, so it is trading so it will be mark-to-market on a regular basis. Regarding the 3.8 billion that we have in the Corporate Center, these assets are classified under IFRS and healthy maturity, and so we believe that on these assets we have reviewed let's say the credit quality of the underlying assets, they are good credit rating assets, so we are more let say for time being considering to hold that in our book. Jean-Pierre on the second point, on the question regarding the equity credit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. On the 7.4 billion of assets we own in our portfolio coming from the SGAM side, you have breakdown on the values annexed on page 64 basically where we give the breakdown between the various assets and the split in terms of rating. You can see that the assets are of good quality between single A and above. We have 83% of the asset there. We have almost 100% of the assets which are investment grade. And the breakdown which is mentioned here shows that we have a balance between various ABS underlying. We have around &#x20AC;945 million of CMBS, almost all our European CMBS, with a very small proportion of UK and Spanish CMBS. On the RMBS side, we have &#x20AC;1.682 billion of RMBS. We have no US RMBS within the portfolio. They are for a very large part, 1.4 billion coming from European RMBS, with UK representing &#x20AC;550 million, and Spain 415, and we have there as well a large part, which is actually, a very large part, which is single A and above.</p>
          <p>On the other ABS, we have 570 million which are split between auto loan, consumer loan, leasing and others, a large part coming from Europe, almost the credit totality coming from Europe. We have 1 billion of CLO, 1.025 billion of CLO, 860 are made from European assets. It's mostly SMEs, CLO for 626 million. We have a small part coming from leverage loan and from investment grade CLO, from corporate CLO, for 140 million. We have 29 million of US CLOs coming from corporate investment grade corporate for a very large part. And we have 534 million of CDOs basically, which are comprised for a large part of single A and above. We have basically on the CDOs side a good split between the values region, and we have, it's mostly Europe and Asia, and literally no new US CLOs or assets coming from the US, only for &#x20AC;4 million. So the markdown on the portfolio on the EPS portfolio. So as we have as well 2.6 billion coming from banks, European banks, as well as corporate debt issue. The markdown on this portfolio for derivative side is 9% on average on nominal. And looking at the quality of the underlying, I think it's more mark-to-market impact, not any real credit impact that we could anticipate. I'm not saying that we are going to see the mark-to-market coming back in Q2, but I think in the medium term part of this mark-to-market should &#x2013; part of the totality of this mark-to-market come back.</p>
          <p>On your question about basically the existing credit derivative book, we gave and I commented about the breakdown of the portfolio. I think that the impact of the loss that we took in Q1 is coming from two things, it's the basis risk as I said that we have basically a cash position and we have as well some index position, which are mostly hedging our delta hedge basically. And so there is a basis risk, but better so, negative convexity of the portfolio. This portfolio in the way it is structured, when clients, sellers, protection on the underlying assets, if the spread is wide enough and be wide enough to levels which were quite high, it creates the margin negative convexity, and it's like gamma minus position in the traditional portfolio, but I am not going to go into detail about that, which mean that we have to have hedges, which, when the market is volatile, could incur some losses. And we had sharp tightening of the credit in April, which had some impact on our basically negative convexity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. If I could just follow up one other last question is on the corporate center. Obviously the numbers are quite lot weaker then we've seen them previously. I know some of that is down to unmet sales of equity assets. But can you just talk a bit further about that number and then the minus 123 million of gross operating income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in fact, the structure of the Corporate Center, looking at what we booked at the Corporate Center, the structurally that such type of corporate operating income as soon as we are not able realize, or not willing to realize, any capital gains. This is the run rate that you should take going forward.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Maimoon Tedi, MF Global. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions if I may. One is a follow-on a previous question about the exotic CDSs. If you say that you have a narrowing of the spread that means that you will see writebacks in the second quarter? And the other question is, on page 31, when you said that some impact mostly raised at the end of April for the equipped mark-to-market of credit derivative, I assume that you must have some writebacks on the other side in the assets as these hedges are working with the assets unless you still have some basis risk there. So I just would like to understand if we will see some writebacks on the losses that we have seen in the first quarter as the protection see some losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on your second question, we have hedges for our credit portfolio, which &#x2013; for our loans which are in the banking book. So basically, the loans are held to maturity and per se, they don't impact our top line or neither do they impact our first line. So, this asymmetric treatment basically coming from IS where we offer the loans in banking book. So, no impact on the P&amp;L. And the CDS which are basically on a mark-to-market basis and from a regulatory point of view those offset &#x2013; basically if you have a loan with the CDS which recovers exactly the loan there is a regulatory offset so basically there's a capital relief. But on an accounting point of view we have this asymmetry, which means that when the credit spreads widen up, the loans don't impact the P&amp;L, but the CDS show a gain.</p>
          <p>And as we said, our portfolio is made as of the end of March of around &#x20AC;50.6 billion of hedges. They do have the period one net sensitivity of &#x20AC;14.1 million per basis point evolution of the average index if you want and the other an average maturity which is 4.3 years at the end of March. So basically spreads widen up, you have P&amp;L has been tightened up, you have loss and the sensitivity &#x20AC;14.2 million per basis point. So as price tightens up quite strongly in April that creates loss which basically spreads at the end of April being not very far from the beginning of January. There has been basically, almost a total writeback of this as it shows at the end of March. It's part of, I guess, volatility of the accounts basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may &#x2013; Maimoon we should mention that this CDS portfolio has three aims. The first one is to cover the credit risk of some loans in the portfolio, sometimes. Second one is to manage the concentration of the portfolio. And the last one also is sometimes just to regulatory let's say arbitrage to use the consumption, in term...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...a specific situations, so it's not a trading position, it's just that we are actively managing the portfolio, and so this book is there to stay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we don't sell any credit protection within the portfolio; we are only  by way of credit protection. That's very clear. On your other question about, are we going to see writeback in April because the spreads have tightened up on our structure of the credit portfolio. As I said, the basis risk actually depending on the asset size not been necessarily moving in our favor, and the negative complexity of the book meaning that there is potentially some negative impact, we have showed in page 37 I think that we started the amount with loan protection. So showed credit of &#x20AC;1.8 billion in the market type and so there should be some losses coming from that. Not to the extent of what we saw in the first quarter, there should be some losses coming from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me understand; I mean if the purpose is to hedge your portfolio, then you should be getting at some point, some writebacks from the protection; if you don't have any writebacks from the protection, what's the point of having the hedges, apart from the fact that you're trying to manage your capital, but the main reason is to protect your portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, on the structured credit portfolio, we run a portfolio which is very similar in the way it is managed to a traditional upfront portfolio. I mean, the technology, the models are very different, but it's the same concept. Basically we buy or sell products from clients, it creates some exposure within our books that we hedge. And within the portfolio depending on where the credit spreads are, we could have sensitivity to our book in terms of the delta hedge or the first derivative or the gamma evolution, which is the evolution of the delta, which is the second derivative, which can be going one way or another.</p>
          <p>With the widening of the spread within our portfolio at the end of March and things are dynamically managed and could change, we have a book with a negative convexity. So basically when we have a negative convexity, if the market goes up, we have to buy, and if the market goes down we have to sell. So, you see, you go against the market, and with the sharp volatility of the underlying asset, it could create some losses as it happens when you manage a negative convexity book that option traders call a gamma negative book basically. The point of the hedge is to make sure that the sensitivity of the book is a first derivative sensitivity and not a sensitivity of the full nominal as we have disclosed. We have underlying assets, if you sum up the various underlying assets, which are of roughly &#x20AC;19 billion of assets. So, if we were not hedged we will have a sensitivity of &#x20AC;19 billion of assets by hedging we have a sensitivity which is a theoretically around zero, by this hedging, but which depends on what the traders are doing with their position and they started the quarter being effectively long credit protection.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So am I to understand that your client business in derivatives is a lot more risky than what you've been telling us in the past. That, that in situation like this you wouldn't be incurring losses that are larger than some of the revenues you generate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it's not more dangerous than what we have been telling you in the past. I think that you have to look back, for instance at the chart that we put at the beginning of the presentation. If you go back to one of the first slides basically of the presentation on page five, you can see the evolution of the spread basically, which varies around during the first quarter. You had for almost each asset class a very sharp widening and then a very sharp tightening of the credit spread. So basically the volatility during the first quarter, if you look at the credit market has been something, which has been never seen before. So it &#x2013; I wouldn't draw a parallel with an equity market where it's active.</p>
          <p>And there take my words with caution, but active equity indexes over the quarter moved on 50% and back up, which I would call it a very volatile quarter. We have that on the credit spread as you can see. And when we have such a volatility on the underlying credit spread, some of the position can show some losses, because of their overall structure. And on the structured credit side, we have decided to disclose our position, because the management of the position under such a volatile scenario showed a loss which was due to the very high volatility of the market. We were well beyond the stress test valuation that one could envisage, particularly in the management of this portfolio. In a normal market environment the underlying volatility of the portfolio in terms of revenues should be much, much lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then when I mentioned that in the &#x20AC;470 million that we have negative in the first quarter, two-thirds of that was losses, so it's technically one third is write down.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Good afternoon. I have two small questions. The first one is regarding life insurance. Because I would like to understand a bit better the dynamics of the revenue growth of 12.8% given that you have inflows down almost 17% and assets under management growing by only 3.9%. So where is the revenue growth coming from, is it because you &#x2013; I mean you reserved a bit better than you did in the first quarter of last year or can you shed some light on this? And the second question is regarding the spreads in &#x2013; not the margins, but the spreads in retail banking in France. Do you see any improvement in certain markets or would you say that competition is either fiercer or more equal to what it was in 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding the spreads within the French retail banking business, what we can say is that what we have seen this quarter is overall let's say a widening, but in certain category of loans, we have seen the spreads better let's say in terms of mortgage loans compared to last year, and also better mortgage investment funds and business loans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very clear in terms of mortgage, it's also clear in terms of SME loans, but we are putting in those increases which are very low, specifically in mortgage last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding your question on the life insurance, I propose perhaps to discuss that with investor relations team will provide you more detail on the evolution of the net inflows on one side, the evolution of mathematical provision. You know that there is always the technical results &#x2013; which &#x2013; in the financial results which are two elements important in assessing the performance of life insurance division.</p>

          <p>So regarding your first question on the split between mark-to-market on our own debt revaluation of our net and owned shares, in the fourth quarter owned shares had a plus &#x20AC;6 million impact and fair value on sustaining our own debt was plus 242. And in the first quarter owned shares were nil, and as I mentioned a change in fair value of AD was 523.</p>
          <p>On Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole I think we will not comment on that. Your second question was linked to the fiscal treatment of potential writebacks, I would say they are &#x2013; let's say writebacks are treated let's say in line with the tax position of the group overall, so it depends on where we also book this writeback whether it is in the U.S., London, Paris whatever. So we think into of the location. And lastly regarding the &#x2013; your question regarding the perhaps quarterly perspective of the French network let say, that was a relatively mute on the full year, we will not comment...</p>

          <p>The next question is from Jaap Meijer, Dresdner. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Jaap Meijer from Dresdner. Looking at your tier 1, this is pretty strong and you tier could &#x2013; sorry, tier 1 is not at home, but your core tier 1 is very high. So, do you have any plans to launch tier 1 securities considering the hybrid is only 14%? And in your core capital of 6.8%, are there any non-common equity elements included in this one? And the other one is that, you reported an EPS of &#x20AC;2.06 and the small net-off positive one-offs, do you think that about this could be a good run-rate not withstanding potential losses in the Q2 where you alluded to previously? And pretty helpful the exposures to the ABS through creditors this related to the delta hedge and also helpful on Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole Asset Management assets that have been to sold to CIB. But what kind of other investments do you have in ABS besides the subprime RMBS that we know of &#x2013; so they should be reported under let's say AFS investments or under loans, that will be quite helpful? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will let Jean-Pierre answer to the third question. Regarding let's say your question regarding the core tier 1, so to that 6.8% and you made the right calculation we are currently 14% of the hybrid capital, let's say in our total tier 1 ratio. I will get the point yes, we know that the maximum that we can have under French regulation is 25%. So we have no comments to make further than that. Regarding your question on the 2.06 euro per share quarterly EPS, let's say this is not the policy of the group to make any guidance on run-rate or whatever. So I'll disappoint you but I will not comment on that. And on the last questions I will pass quickly to Jean-Pierre but we have already an extensive disclosure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We clearly will give in our full disclosure in offering the recommendation of the financial stability form in our &#x2013; for Q2. But clearly looking at the disclosure gave for the exotic derivatives book the position we have &#x2013; in our ABS portfolio coming from the asset management side and we said that we had a small U.S. RMBS portfolio which was partially hedged and I think the nominal is on 500 million euro gross, which is hedged and the net sensitivity is around 40 million euro from memories.</p>
          <p>We have covered a very large part of our ABS portfolio. From memories because I've not being going for that into detail, we might have 2 or 3 billion more additional ABS, which are split between various geographies, not in the U.S. but in Europe and in Asia. But you have here in all &#x2013; the very large majority and between the exotic derivatives book, the RMBS book and the ABS of both from Scambia almost the credit totality of our ABS exposure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you have nothing besides the 3 billion you talked about, let say in AFS investments, perhaps in insurance or in the bank or let's say under loan and advances, I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the CIB side we disclose everything approves on the insurance side; it was in the book of insurance, it's another story and I'll let Didier comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the life insurance I'd say it is a third party investments or let's say we have an asset allocation which could invest in such underlyings but let's say this is done under very strict rules.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But no disclosure on that compared other bank assurers we've seen a lot more disclosures with split ups in all the categories; rating classes, insurers, credit enhancements whatsoever. And so you have improved your disclosure again with Q1, but now if you going to have surprises again in Q2, you may have to disclose even more, so just it would be better to disclose everything in full I guess?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I could just mention to you also that as you seen the press release other comprehensive income at the end of March excluding revaluation reserves result were positive for &#x20AC;500 million as you can see also. But contrary to some of our peers which perhaps have disclosed little bit more we have still a positive OCI at the end of March.</p>

          <p>We have the last question from Mr. John Raymond, Credit Suisse. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could you just explain please, the difference between the presentation of CDO exposure on slide 35 compared with slide 63 in the supplement. On slide 35, the growth exposure at the end of '07 of 4.9 and then write-downs of 1.6 which we've seen in the P&amp;L leaving a net of 3.3 if you add it up. But then on slide 63 it says the gross nominal is 5.9 write-downs of three and a net of 2.9?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, on the page 35, we have shown basically the breakdown of our unhedged portfolio and where we have basically the subordination basically as well for our portfolio. So when you look at these CDOs there is basically the underlying components of the CDOs are made of various assets, so that's what we call on page 63, the gross nominal basically. And we have &#x2013; we take all the assets, so the gross nominal and we have certain number of write-down depending on the category of assets, and you can see for instance that for the '06 and '07 vintages on the subprime side, we have written down our asset by 92%, 92% which is quite severe, write-down much more severe, that's what we have on the ABX.</p>
          <p>And so, basically the write-down of 3 billion, it does not mean that we have 3 billion impact on our P&amp;L, because we are protected on this asset by the subordination of our tranches, which are AAA. So ahead of us we have subordination, which is basically stocking from what we call the attachment point. So, as you can see on page 35, we have on portfolio one, a subordination of 28%, on portfolio two 15% and on portfolio three 35%. So, basically depending on the CDO with the write-down of the underlying asset, we started having losses when basically the write-down of asset goes beyond the subordination, so beyond the attachment point. And as the write-down recorded are basically for us write-down above the subordination while for the CDOs they are write-down on the overall total assets of the CDO. I hope I am clear in this explanation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Just one question on your Basel II disclosure. I was just wondering if you could tell us what is this 32 basis point negative capital deduction you are having, maybe some minority stakes or if you could give us more color please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there is four components let's say in this deduction. The most important one and say that deduction of the stake of more than 10% that we do have in either non-consolidated or equity accounted banks. And for example, I think it will be the case for our French peers, we have a stake in Cr&#xE9;dit Logement which is a mutual fund guarantee company in France, which is guaranteeing mortgages. That we have, I think, 16% of Cr&#xE9;dit Logement. And so, this is a relatively well-capitalized company and so we have to deduct 50% of the value of our stake in Cr&#xE9;dit Logement from the Tier-1 capital.</p>
          <p>The other elements that we have to deduct up to &#x2013; 50% from the core Tier-1 are eventually &#x2013; it's a difference between the expected loss from the &#x2013; on the performing loans compared to the portfolio based provisions that we have in our balance sheet. This is also the expected loss on the equity portfolio. And last but not least, it could be also the first lost some of the situation deal. But you should have in mind that the bulk of deductions are coming mainly from the stakes in the financial companies or subordinated liabilities that we do have on the balance sheet.</p>
