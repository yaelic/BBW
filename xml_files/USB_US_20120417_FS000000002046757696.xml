          <p>Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Following a review of the results by Richard Davis, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Cecere, U.S. Bancorp's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer there will be a formal question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time through Tuesday, April 24 at midnight Eastern Daylight Time.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the conference call over to Judy Murphy, Director of Investor Relations for U.S. Bancorp.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brooke, and good morning to everyone who has joined our call. Richard Davis, Andy Cecere, and Bill Parker are here with me today to review U.S. Bancorp's first quarter 2012 results, and to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Richard and Andy will be referencing a slide presentation during their prepared remarks. A copy of the slide presentation as well as our earnings release and supplemental analyst schedules are available on our website at usbank.com.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page 2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Richard.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Judy and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share our results with you today, and I'll begin with the highlights on page 3 of the presentation.</p>
          <p>U.S. Bank recorded net income of $1.3 billion for the first quarter of 2012, or $0.67 per diluted common share. Total net revenue was higher by 9.1% over the same quarter of 2011, driven by 7.3% growth in net interest income and 11.3% growth in fee revenue.</p>
          <p>Total average loans grew year-over-year and linked quarter by 6.4% and 1.5% respectively, and we are also experienced strong loan growth in total average deposits of 11.7% over the prior year, and 2.2% linked quarter. Credit quality continued to improve as net chargeoffs declined by 8.2% and nonperforming assets decreased in total by 8.5% from the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>We continue to generate significant capital each quarter. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.7% at March 31, or 8.4% using anticipated Basel III guidelines, while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at 10.9%. Capital actions this quarter included a 56% dividend increase, and we repurchased 16 million shares of common stock during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The five-quarter trends of our industry leading performance metrics are shown on the left-hand side of slide four. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.6%, our return on average common equity was 16.2%. We have stated that our company can achieve a normalized ROA in the range of 1.6% to 1.9%, and an ROE between 16% and 19%. Both performance ratios have now reached their respective ranges.</p>
          <p>Our net interest margin and efficiency ratio are shown in the graph on the right-hand side of slide four. This quarter's net interest margin of 3.6% was nine basis points lower than the same quarter of last year but equal to the prior quarter, and Andy will discuss the margin in more detail in just a couple of minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 51.9%, and consistent with our expectation this ratio will remain in the low 50s.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five. Our capital position remains strong and continues to grow. At March 31 our Tier 1 common equity ratio using anticipated Basel III guidelines was 8.4%. At 8.4% we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and above the level at which we believe we need to be.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide six. On March 13 after receiving the results of our 2012 comprehensive capital analysis and review from the Federal Reserve we announced a $0.28, or a 56% increase, in our annual dividend. In addition to the dividend increase the board authorized a new 100 million-share repurchase program. As we've indicated in the past, our long-term goal is to return between 60% and 80% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. During the first quarter we returned 66% of our earnings to our shareholders, 29% of which in the form of dividends and 37% in the form of share buybacks.</p>
          <p>Average total loans outstanding increased by $12.6 billion, or 6.6% year-over-year. As expected linked quarter loan growth and average total was loans was 1.5%. Significantly, new loan originations, excluding mortgage production, plus new and renewed commitments total over $36 billion this quarter. This represents a 4.5% year-over-year increase in new and renewed lending activity. Total revolving corporate and commercial commitments outstanding increased year-over-year by 25.7%, and 5.1% on a linked quarter basis, while utilization remained fairly consistent at approximately 25%. Total average deposits increased by $24 billion, or 11.7%, over the same quarter last year, while total average deposits grew by $5 billion on a linked quarter basis, or 2.2%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide eight, the company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.9 billion, an increase of 9.1% over the prior quarters &#x2013; year's quarter, but 3.4% less than previous quarter. Recall however that the fourth quarter included a $263 million litigation settlement gain. Excluding this gain linked quarter revenue growth was $88 million, or 1.8%. The company's revenue growth can be attributed to both our balance sheet and our fee businesses growing as we continue to benefit from our investments in growth initiatives over the past years.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide nine and credit quality. First quarter total net charge offs declined by 8.2% from the fourth quarter of 2011, while nonperforming assets decreased by 8.5%, or 5.9% excluding covered assets. The ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding was 1.09% improving from the 1.19% reported in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10. As the graph on the left illustrates early and late-stage delinquencies, excluding covered assets, improved this quarter. On the right-hand side of slide 10 you can see that the trend in criticized assets continues to show improvement. Both of these statistics provide us with confidence that net charge offs and nonperforming assets will trend lower in the second quarter of 2012, although net charge offs may show a more modest reduction than in recent quarters as the pace of improvement slows in the consumer categories.</p>
          <p>Given the first quarter's credit results and the expected improvement going forward we released $90 million of reserves, compared with $125 million in the fourth quarter and $50 million in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Andy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 gives you a view of our first quarter 2012  results versus comparable time periods. Diluted EPS of $0.67 was 28.8% higher than the first quarter of 2011, and 2.9% lower than the prior quarter. Recall that the fourth quarter EPS included $0.05 related to two notable items.</p>
          <p>Slide 12 lists the key drivers of the company's first quarter earnings. The 27.9% increase in net income year-over-year was the result of a 9.1% increase in net revenue, and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 10.6% increase in noninterest expense. Net income was slightly lower on a linked quarter basis. The unfavorable variance was the result of a 3.4% decline in net revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense, and a $16 million decrease in the provision for credit losses. Excluding the impact of the two notable items detailed on slide 13, net revenue increased by 1.8% quarter-over-quarter, and noninterest expense was flat.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 provides you more detail about the notable items that impacted the comparison of our first quarter to prior periods. In the fourth quarter of 2011, total noninterest income included a $263 million litigation settlement gain related to the termination of a merchant processing referral agreement. We also booked a $130 million expense accrual related to mortgage servicing and foreclosure related matters. On a net basis these two items increased fourth quarter net income by approximately $92 million, and EPS by $0.05. The first quarter of 2011 included a $46 million gain related to the acquisition of First Community bank of New Mexico from the FDIC. Also noted on the bottom of slide 13 are two revenue and expense classification changes that had an impact on comparisons to prior periods.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14. Net interest income increased year-over-year by $183 million, or 7.3%. The increase was largely driven by the $26.1 billion, or 9.5% increase in average earning assets, as well as the benefit from strong growth in low-cost deposits. The growth in average earning assets was driven by planned increases in the securities portfolio and growth in average total loans, partially offset by a lower cash position at the Federal Reserve. The net interest margin of 3.60% was nine basis points lower than the same quarter of last year, due primarily to the expected increase in lower yielding investment securities, partially offset by lower cash balances at the Fed, and the inclusion of a credit card balance transfer fee.</p>
          <p>On a linked quarter basis net interest income was higher by $17 million. Average earning assets grew by $4.9 billion, and net interest margin was flat to the prior quarter. Margin was slightly better than expected this quarter primarily due to the inclusion of balance transfer fees and lower cash balances at the Fed. Given the current rate environment we expect the net interest margin to be down a few basis points in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The investment securities portfolio at March 31 totaled $74.3 billion. The balances were higher than December 31 as we took the opportunity to manage down our cash balances and purchase investment securities. We expect to maintain the investment securities portfolio at or around this level for the next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 provides you with more detail behind the changes in average total loans outstanding. Average total loans grew by 6.4% year-over-year. Excluding covered loans, a runoff portfolio, average total loans increased by 8.7% year-over-year. As you can see on the chart, the increase in average total loans was principally due to strong growth in commercial loans and residential mortgages of 17.3% and 19.1% respectively. Commercial loan growth has continued to accelerate over the past five quarters while growth in consumer lending has been less robust. On a linked quarter basis the 1.5% increase in average total loans outstanding was also primarily driven by an increase in commercial loans, which grew by 3.4%, and residential real estate loans which grew by 4.3%.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 provides more detail on the growth in total deposits over the past five quarters. Average total deposits grew by $24 billion, or 11.7% year-over-year. On a linked quarter basis average deposits increased by $5 billion, or 2.2%. Importantly, average low cost deposits accounted for the majority of the increases on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 provides more details around the changes in noninterest income on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Noninterest income increased by 11.3% over the same quarter of 2011. Mortgage banking revenue was very strong this quarter, as production increased by 58% year-over-year and gain on sale margins improved. Offsetting a portion of the growth in origination and sales fee income were an unfavorable net change in MSR valuation and related hedging of approximately $32 million, and an increase in the repurchase reserve.</p>
          <p>In addition to mortgage banking, merchant processing services, deposit service charges, and commercial products revenue also posted solid increases year-over-year. These positive variances were partially offset by lower credit card and debit card fees due to legislative changes to debit card interchange, as well as the change in classification of balance transfer fees. Offsetting the impact of these two items were legislative related mitigation activity and higher transaction volumes. ATM services revenue was lower as the result of the change related to revenue pass-through to others. And finally, other income in the first quarter of 2011 included a $46 million gain related to the FDIC transaction.</p>
          <p>On a linked quarter basis noninterest income was lower by $192 million, or 7.9%. This favorable variance was primarily the result of the merchant settlement gain in the fourth quarter of 2011, seasonally lower payments related revenue, and the revenue classification changes partially offset by very strong mortgage banking activity.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 highlights noninterest expense which was higher year-over-year by $246 million, or 10.6%. The majority of the increase can be attributed to higher compensation and benefits expense, representing additional staffing in the branches, mortgage-related activities, and business expansion initiatives, an increase in professional services, primarily due to technology and foreclosure review projects, as well as marketing and business development expense and other expense related to regulatory and insurance related costs. These higher costs were partially offset by a decrease in net occupancy related to the change in ATM revenue passed through to others.</p>
          <p>On a linked quarter basis noninterest expense was lower by $136 million, or 5%, primarily due to the fourth quarter mortgage servicing accrual, occupancy expense, partially offset by seasonally higher employee benefits.</p>
          <p>The tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis was 30.9% in the first quarter of 2012, compared with 30.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011, and 29% in the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>Slide 19 provides updated detail on the company's mortgage purchase-related expense and the reserve for unexpected losses on repurchases and make-whole payments. For outstanding repurchases and make-whole request balances at March 31 was $134 million, compared with $105 million at December 31. The increase, in addition to recent changes in the GSE sampling method, specifically higher sampling sizes, caused us to increase our mortgage representation and warranties reserve to $202 million. We do however expect mortgage repurchase requests to remain fairly stable over the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>I'll now you turning the call back to Richard.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy.</p>
          <p>And to  conclude our formal remarks, I turn your attention to slide 20. "The momentum continues," words from the cover of our annual report that appropriately describe our 2011 accomplishments and performance, and our first quarter results demonstrate that the momentum we've built over the past several years continues to build into the new year.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we grew our balance sheet and our customer base, we grew our net revenue. We continue to invest in organic growth initiatives as well as small but important fill-in acquisitions, including the 10 branch banking franchise of BankEast in Knoxville Tennessee, the Indiana Corporate Trust business from UMB Bank, and an institutional trust business from Union Bank in California.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter our credit quality continued to improvement. Our capital liquidity positions remain strong, and we grew our earnings and achieved industry-leading performance metrics for the quarter. And we were able to return 66% of our earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from our investments and growth initiatives in innovation and in acquisitions. We continue to benefit from our prudent risk management and our diversified business model, and we benefit from our markets, both established and new.</p>
          <p>Today we'll be holding our annual meeting here in Minneapolis, our headquarter city. In addition to conducting the official business of the meeting, I'll be sharing our story of how we have managed this company through the downturn and we are continuing to capitalize on the momentum we've built. I'll also tell the shareholders how exceedingly proud I am of what we've accomplished, and of the 64,000 remarkable and engaged employees that have contributed to our success.</p>
          <p>I'll look forward to the coming year as we grow even stronger for the benefit of our customers, employees, communities and importantly our shareholders.</p>
          <p>That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. First of all I guess, just wonder if you can give some color commentary around loan demand? Trends through the quarter. Do you still see -- are there any particular pockets of strength, weakness, sector, either by sector or by geography?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. This is Richard. As we stated 90 days ago we thought that the trends would slow from quarter four, partly because of the seasonality of the new year, and we saw the ending of the quarter kind of slowing down and we turned out to be correct.</p>
          <p>In this case, we're starting to see what I expected was a slow but seasonal increase as we move into quarter two. Quarter one got stronger as it aged and quarter two's looking at least as good as quarter one, if not with slight biases on the positive side.</p>
          <p>It's across the board, Chris. Corporate banking, commercial banking, community banking, small business, consumer, credit card, they're all showing slight improvements in terms of volume and applications. All of them are showing -- all of them are showing improvement in credit quality, and except for commercial real estate where we see strengths on the coasts and the larger cities that kind of line the two oceans, we don't see any other distinct geography to note, except a nice, steady, kind of even increase across all business lines, across all states where we do business in all 50. So we're feeling quite positive about the year as it ages, and as spring has sprung we're looking at things &#x2013; looking at pretty nicely.</p>
          <p>I've got Bill Parker here with me to maybe bring a little more color to the quality and the application volume we're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so I'll highlight small business because we did see a pretty good uptick in our small business application volumes. It's been double-digit in all of our different areas, whether it's SBA or the branch-originated small business. So that bodes well to see some strength in the small business markets. And I'll just comment on, you know, the credit and commercial real estate, multi-family's the one area that's very strong and particularly on the coasts. And the other areas, you know, Class-A properties are highly valued. But if you get below Class-A in the other asset classes it's still &#x2013; it's still, I don't want to say weak, but it's not as strong, so. But overall, pretty &#x2013; pretty positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we won't &#x2013; we've said this before, we can compete on price, and we will to the right level, but we won't engage in price competition where it doesn't make sense for our company. And we won't get our loan volume on lower underwriting. We simply won't do that, and we haven't had to and we're got going to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the other thing I wanted to ask about was your mortgage servicing portfolio has started to grow significantly. And it had been flat the prior couple of quarters, and the last two quarters it's kind of grown significantly. I'm wondering, is that just a function of the strong production volume that we've had recently or is &#x2013; or do you see that as a particular strategic growth opportunity in that some of the larger players are probably constrained in how they can grow their servicing business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and yes. So it is a function of &#x2013; the latter informs the former, so we're having really nice market share improvement because we've stayed very active in this. We've added a lot of resources to continue to be relevant as a mortgage originator and a servicer, and because the market dynamics have changed we continue to enjoy even greater  growth maybe than we might have thought. We have no limits on the kind resources that we might pursue to this level because we see a market shift that you'd only get once in a lifetime, and we intend to enjoy it now, and come out of this as probably &#x2013; I don't know, in the top five for sure, of mortgage servicing and production, and we're seeing that come sooner than we thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And specifically that is &#x2013; is that something that you could imagine getting into the kind of stand alone mortgage company kind of business through acquisition, or do you want to maintain mortgage production primarily out of the branches?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know, we do it through the branches and through the correspondent networks, so that's not going to change, but like everything else we don't want to be a dominant in any one line of business. So no more than I want to be a credit card company with branches attached to it, I don't want to be a mortgage company with a credit card business. We really want to be a business that does the work for most of our customers, meet their needs where we know them firsthand, and where there's opportunity to extend that based on market share improvement we'll take that as well. But Chris, you'll see us continue that kind of balanced view of revenue achieved through spread and fee income on a basis of diversity of types of business as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Moshe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Could you maybe flesh out some of your comments on the capital front? I mean, obviously you're now kind of &#x2013; you're past the point where you would likely see, you know, any SIFI buffer or anything like that, and obviously, two-thirds of the capital is a nice capital return. But as you kind of look out are there acquisition opportunities that we should be thinking about? Or how could that evolve over the course of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Moshe, this is Andy. So our Tier 1 comment Basel III standard is at 8.4%, probably a little higher than we would plan to be at. And part of that is the volatility around that ratio as it relates to OCI and the available for-sale portfolio, as we enjoyed a bigger gain this quarter due to lower interest rates. So you'll see us somewhere in that 8.2% &#x2013; 8.4% range depending upon that gain.</p>
          <p>Our capital plan was approved. And as we've talked about, we have a target of that sort of 30% to 40% dividends, 30% to 40% buybacks, and we're within that range. That leaves us plenty of room for opportunities that present themselves in the marketplace for portfolio purchases or small deals, just like we've done in the past. And I think we're sort of in a normal, regular, ongoing capital distribution methodology as we sit today with some dividends, some buybacks and some return for internal investment.</p>

          <p>And Moshe, what we saw last quarter would be a great proxy for future quarters in terms of M&amp;A, branch opportunities where they come along, FDIC or otherwise, payments businesses, corporate trust opportunities. The stuff you've seen us do over the last four years, five years. We see a pipeline for that opportunity, and as Andy said we have plenty of room left within our retained capital to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up on the corporate trust. There have been some recent lawsuits looking at the questions around the trustees' responsibility as &#x2013; you know, in some of the subprime securitizations. Do you have kind of any thoughts on as to how that might shake out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. I'm glad you brought it up. And, as you know, it's not new, we've been dealing with this for as long as I've been here. One of the benefits of corporate trust is it's a really good business, particularly when the market is strong. It's a good relationship and fee business, and it provides &#x2013; it's pretty high cost of entry, so you're either in it and you're good or you're not in it at all. We've got the benefit of being in it and good.</p>
          <p>But with it comes the risk of confusion, and it's a reputation risk that we manage every single day. And it can be anything from foreclosed properties, where we are often cited as the owner of the property, or REO property where there's some problem with the quality of the structure and we're identified as the owner, and it turns out we're most often the trustee. And, in fact, that causes people to be confused, because that's still a complicated topic. When a company might file bankruptcy, and we're acting as trustee, it looks like we were the lender and put them into a bankruptcy. And in more times than not, as you're talking about now in some of these NBS and other kinds of structured deals, we're often hired in as the appropriate legal source and the broker between two parties, and often confused as the party in between. So we will deal with that confusion because the business is so good, and it has such a great upside potential, and we're so deep into it. We just recognize that it's something we have to manage, and each time we get a chance to clarify and educate, either trusts or civic leaders who are confused about, it we find an opportunity to do so. But it will take quite a while for people to understand what trustee looks like.</p>
          <p>I'll close and give you my pseudo legal point though that, as a trustee, we don't have the rights to reach in and touch the properties, or change the rules of the engagement on the escrow. It's our responsibility to execute as the law would have us, and to do that within the bounds of whatever the construct of the trustee relationship is. It's not ours to overreach or to step in and fix something we weren't asked to do despite the temptation by sometimes people who want us to do that.</p>
          <p>So we'll deal with the confusion, and the more times people give us a chance to clarify the more times we'll take it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You've obviously been outgrowing the industry on the loans, you've talked about some NIM pressure going forward. When you put it all together do you think you can still grow net interest income dollars from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the short answer to that, Matt, is yes. So our NIM pressure was principally related to our increase in our securities portfolio. That's true on a year-over-year as well as linked quarter basis. We took advantage of our long cash position this quarter to accelerate some of our purchases, but I think we're going to remain fairly stable in that securities portfolio going forward. And we have a good amount of debt and higher costs rolling off in the second half of the year, so that will create some stabilization. As I mentioned, I expect us to be down a few basis points in the second quarter but then I expect some stabilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also add, Matt, that I know this won't be the case for everybody, but as well as we're doing on loan growth we're doing even better in commitment growth. And while that doesn't show up in the balance sheet it shows up in the future. And I think you're all going to be very pleased that whenever the robust economy comes back, and it will, we're going to stand to enjoy a second round of I think comparative benefit, because the commitment growth is so significant and yet to be tapped, because utilization stays flat. We're actually quite optimistic that, to answer your question, with a strong yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separate topic, in terms of buybacks and just capital returns overall, not that I'm looking for a specific price in which you'd be buying back stock, but you have had some banks come out and say we'd be aggressive buyers up to here. And I'm just wondering conceptually, one) how you think about valuation, and then two) one could make the argument that maybe special dividends over time might make more sense. So how do you just think about balancing that over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Matt, this is Andy. As you know, the trade-off with the buyback is buying back the stock at times zero or the cash flow at times zero plus one and forward, and we do have a specific view on that. We look at that every month from the perspective of our company, and we have a very good view on the future. At this price we are still buying back our stock, and there is a price well above the level we are at today that we would, you know, have consideration about holding back a bit; but we're not to that level now.</p>
          <p>So we're very comfortable buying back at today's price. We're also comfortable with the balance between dividends and buybacks, because it gives us the opportunity to move, in terms of buybacks, up or down given other opportunities in the marketplace that we talked about before.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Erika Penala with BOA Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Erika.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My first question is on home equity classification on the credit side. I know this is a much smaller piece of your pie, but we saw from larger banks an increase in problem loans as they reclassified some of their seconds that are still paying as the first is in trouble. Did you stick to that class -- did you also stick to that same classification this quarter? Is that already reflected in your numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Erika, I'm going to have Bill answer the technical issue, but for us I just want to highlight it is very, very small. And the numbers that you've seen from some of the larger banks are significantly greater than. So for us we're talking $15 million to $30 million, well below the billion plus dollars that you've seen elsewhere. And so for us we believe that the classification that we have today is accurate and reflects appropriately, and we did do some actions last quarter that Bill can talk about.</p>
          <p>But I'll also say that if we discover that there's a prevailing view on how things should be handled, then we can do that. But if you look at our nonperforming loans they improved by almost 8% linked quarter. If we were taking that $15 million to $30 million they would have improved by 7%. So just to reiterate the immateriality of it, and the fact that it's not a big number is important for me to highlight. And Bill, you might talk a little deeper about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So it's our home equity portfolio, has two distinguishing features. One) a lot of it is, about $5 billion of it is actually lines that are in the first lien position, so there's not even another loan to look at. So obviously that's very high quality. And then, you know, those that we do service, about 30% of the portfolio, that's where that $15 million, $30 million, comes from. So it's just not a material number.</p>
          <p>The other part of what that reclassification was about was really on the reserving side. And that's, I'd argue, the more important side. And we'd implemented that some time last year. So we feel very comfortable with the adequacy of our reserves on the home equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to veer into another topic. Richard, could you give us a sense or an update on your ability to reprice the deposit product in 2012 on the retail side? I know a lot of banks had talked about mitigation efforts, sort of in this first half of last year in anticipation of debit interchange reform. And just wanted to get a sense on how some of the fee transfer to the consumer is paying out this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Erika. We've said that of the total loss of revenue that was derived by Card Act, REGI and Durbin that we would eventually get to 50% of that back, and I think we said we were at 30% last time. Our plan is to get to that 50% by year's end. And I've also said it won't be before year's end, because we're going to be very thoughtful about it this, but  I'm comfortable we can do it.</p>
          <p>In doing so, a couple things. One is, market share gain really helps a lot. You can improve your fee revenue by just having more customers who are paying the current fees that you offer, and feel good about that. With our Checking With Choice and some of the way we packaged our products people are seemingly happy to pay those fees and get the services we provide. Especially some of the things we're adding to the capabilities, like mobile and more technology.</p>
          <p>I would say, however, there will also be some increases in certain fee categories that we will continue to provide, because we need to do that to return to the shareholders what they've been waiting for. We have to be very thoughtful about market position. And you know, we are not one size fits all. We have basically business in every state. We have 25 states where our consumer business is located, and if we have to have 168 different solutions for that many different pricing markets, which is how many we have, we would do that. So we're going to be very careful and thoughtful and look at where the market competition will allow us to increase the current fees, and we're really going to go after it with some market share grab, and continue to have more customers that pay what we think is a fair assessment for the service we provide.</p>
          <p>Nothing magic. And what I did say is we will get to that 50%. We'll use the whole year to get there, I'm not rushing it. We've got a good momentum everywhere else, and I'm not going to mess up what's happening right now and the good momentum we have in the branches where they're getting more customers, deeper relationships, and not putting them through the fits and starts of having to decide what prices we change all the time, because we're very consistent, and I want to give them that benefit.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a broader question. You guys are executing well, your profitability ratios are within the targeted ranges. Kind of wondering where do you think you're still under earning, whether it's low-interest rates or mitigating some of the Reg reform, where are areas that you can improve the profitability over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know, the best part of the story, and I mean the best part of the story, is that we're just so not finished getting great at what we already do. So, hard as it is to talk about organic growth and pursuit of investments from prior periods, that's really what this story's all about. And, in fact, John, the reason quarter one 2012 is as good as it was because of the things we did in third quarter 2010. And the commitments we're making through employee engagement and technology.</p>
          <p>So I would tell you, we hit our peak in capital investment in 2010, but we'll have to continue to work that up. Our investments in the first five years, from 2001 to 2006, were 45% less than they were in the last five years of 2006 to 2011. So we've spent quite a bit of money, with your all's knowledge and permission to reinvest in the company, and that's starting to show up in capital. Acquisitions are all accretive, most of the time on day one, and I think those continue to show as beneficial. But this last part is organic growth, and I know it's so unexciting to talk about, but it's exactly what's happening here. And so from wealth management building out to become a national, first-class wealth manager, to adding our new Ascent ultra-high-net-worth business, which is only a couple of quarters old, to this amazing buildout you've seen us take to a national level on our corporate banking capabilities, and then adding our payment skills across the globe, and our consumer retail bank and small business now taking altogether new levels of performance, add it all up and that's what you get.</p>
          <p>So I think on top of that a stock market that's actually, you know, at best kind of flattish, and interest rates, which we all know are as low as they're going to be, we've got upside on every single cylinder. And if this is an eight cylinder car, we're running at about four and a half cylinders right now. So if you like what you see now, just wait till things start getting better. I think there's nothing but upward bias toward what we can do the old-fashioned organic way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks Richard, that's helpful. A question for Bill. Where are you on the kind of cycle of reserve release, and how do you see that playing out over the next couple quarters? And then also if you could just comment what drove the higher reserve build for the rep and warranty? Is that due to a high origination volume, or something else? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so the reserve release, I mean, we're in the point of the credit cycle where we'll continue to get credit improvement, you know, probably for another 18 months. We have commercial real estate assets that still need to be resolved, and that's going to take some time. And some of the residential mortgage portfolios are still stressed, so that's going to take time. But the improvement is slowing. I mean, some of our portfolios are performing at extremely good credit levels. Credit cards, autos, doing extremely well. So you're not going to see a lot more improvement in those areas. So I think of the reserve release as something that will &#x2013; it will continue, but at a lower level. It will continue to decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, this is Andy, regarding the mortgage question. You know, the principal reason for that was the recent changes from the GSEs in terms of increasing their sampling size. So I would not expect a significantly higher quarter-to-quarter loss rate, but perhaps a longer or more extended period, and that's why we have a higher reserve level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and Andy -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, let me just add, because God knows I've got to speak, if you guys <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:12). I want to remind you that as you saw our charge offs hit a level of 1.09%, we have said to all of you for a long time that over this cycle this is probably a 1% charge off bank, especially because of our credit card size. We're hitting that 1%, we're getting close to it, and I predict we'll go below it. And my goal is to do our best to make sure that our reserves, within accounting rules, stay to a place where we don't have to rebuild them all back later on. As an industry I'm arguing for that as well, because I think we've learned the lesson that we don't want to do that. But you have to appreciate that I think Bill and I both think the 1.09% goes to 1%, and probably falls under that for a little while, not as a goal necessarily, but over the time and term of our long history, we think that we'll be at 1%, and we're getting very close to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one just follow-up for Andy. To the extent there's a nuanced change in the GSE's sampling behavior, is that them looking at a wider range of images, Andy,  or putting &#x2013; trying to put back stuff that's been paying for longer. Any color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just, John, going deeper in the loans that we're looking at, and going back further. So it's deeper and further in terms of the sampling size, and you know there's going to be &#x2013; the more you look at the more you may find, and that's why we increased our reserve.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question's sort of asked, but maybe I'll ask in a slightly different way. So your 109 basis points on the charge off ratio this quarter and have given that long-term guidance of 1%. But Richard, you've said in prior calls you expect it dip below that 1% level, that sort of looks likely now for next year. Any thoughts as to how far you might dip below that level as you sort of, you know, continue to clean up credit, and we see this big decline that we're seeing now again this quarter in the delinquency trends. I mean, could we go down to 70 basis points or 80 basis points at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I don't know where we end up. When I say under 1% I jus want you all to know that it's probably going to be &#x2013; it's going to over perform for a little while there. It could be 90 basis points, it could be high 80s, I don't know. It's not going to be 50 basis points, or anything like that. We're still making loans, we're still taking calculated risk, and you want us to do that. But we're also not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:38) is we're not going to start reaching into riskier categories, we're not going to start underwriting more aggressively. We're not worried about protecting our position as one of the larger market share growers in credit. We're doing it the way we're doing it, and we're not going to change. So I'm also telegraphing to you we're not expecting it to get so pristine that you'd think we're missing opportunities. But I do think this is a high-quality book. The stress tests would have said so each time they do it, and I think you guys should be comfortable that if we fall below 1% it's not a goal, it happens to be an outcome. But our goal is to manage this company right around 1%, because that we think is the right level of risk and reward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then secondarily if I add back the repurchase provision on the mortgage side, I think I'm getting to a mortgage gain on sale, you know, sort of gross number of about 230 basis points on the production.</p>
          <p>First of all, is that about &#x2013; do you agree with that? And then second of all, what are your thoughts on how long that can last or, you know, the pace that that might decline over what timeframe, or &#x2013; we all know that's a very wide number, but I think we're all struggling with how quickly, and over what timeframe, that declines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ed, so you know, the production gain is based on net applications, net of projected fallout number, so it's closer to 200 basis points in terms of the math, and it is wider than I would expect if to continue in forward quarters, but we are enjoying a robust business in our mortgage group, as we've talked about, where we're taking share and we're expanding our capabilities. So I would expect it &#x2013; second quarter to have another strong quarter in mortgage, and it's hard for me to see beyond that right now because there's just too much uncertainty out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our pipelines continue to be strong. There might be some slowdown just given &#x2013; about 75% of our first quarter activity was refinance activity. I would expect that to slow somewhat given that rates have stabilized, but the pipeline continues to be strong.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Ken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everyone. Two quick questions on loans. Number one, commercial real estate, an area that's started to grow again a little bit for you guys, and I just want to understand how much of that is still moving over from the C and D book versus, you know, opportunities that you're starting to see in the marketplace? How is CRE looking as far as maybe in the next part of the loan book to pick up, and where are you guys in terms of your aggressiveness in that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. This is Bill. The -- it's not really moving over from the construction and development. That continues to decline. So the growth we've been picking up is more in stabilized properties, and they're going to be Class-A properties, a lot of them with our institutional investors. We have a pretty high-quality group of clientele that our commercial real estate group has enjoyed, you know, many years of performance with, and that's where we pick up the loan growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In fact, Ken, it's Richard, it's unremarkable in where it's coming from, it's remarkable it's coming from everywhere. And I think also the buildout of our corporate bank capabilities, as you've been hearing about the last couple years, make us more of a one-stop-shop for some of these larger real estate national companies that have used us now for higher positions, allowed us to be in the deals longer, have used us for capital market capabilities. So for us it's just like I said in the beginning, it's everywhere, it's a little bit of every category, and I think it's this flight to quality that we continue to enjoy, that I don't know how long that lasts, but every time we get to talk to you it's still there, and we'll enjoy it until it's not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And my second question just relates to just loan pricing. Obviously, yields came down a little bit in both C&amp;I and CRE. I just wondered if you had some anecdotes to share in terms of how you see loan pricing across the markets and across the commercial products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Andy. You know, we've talked about the fact the last few quarters that loan spreads have stabilized, and I would say that continues to be the case in the first quarter. There are pockets of increased competition, particularly in the commercial area, and maybe a little bit below that, but overall commercial wholesale loan spreads are stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. Thanks guys, appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. I had a quick follow-up question on the push backs. You talked about increased sample size from the GSE, a change in policy. Can you just add some more color to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know how else to define it other than they're looking at more loans, both with respect to both the depth of the categories as well as the timeframe. So if they were looking at 10 loans before, they're looking at 12 now, for whatever period, and that's it. So, you know, we applied a similar expectation on that increased sample size. It could be that the increased sample size will result in actually a lower loss expectation, we just don't know until we get through the data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And &#x2013; thanks a lot. And then, you know on the loan portfolio, which has grown very nicely for you guys, but one of the areas that has grown is residential, and I think part of that's probably because of your market share increase in the mortgage banking space. Is that mainly jumbo loans, or is any of that 30-year conforming product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there's &#x2013; there's definitely jumbos. That primarily comes through our private client channels, so we do book those jumbo loans that are not GSE-qualified. And then the other area of origination is out of our branches, and we have a -- it's a refi product only. The average loan size is less that $100,000, low loan-to-value, first mortgage refinance originations out of our branch, so those are the two main categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And those are likely to have a life of 10 years to 15 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're scheduled 10 years to 15 years versus 30 years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what type of yield?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The spreads on those are probably 50 basis points to 75 basis points above what you might expect from a GSA qualified.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question on HARP [Home Affordable Refinance Program]. I know there's been a lot of media reports, and we've been publishing a lot of stuff about how HARP is better than expectations, and as April 1, I believe, banks like you can start to pick at other servicing portfolios with somewhat limited reps and warrants. I just wonder, are you going to continue to try to take market share and maybe go after some of these loans and other portfolios?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first I'll just comment that our HARP volume has been pretty strong. We had about a 47% application increase quarter-over-quarter. So we have seen good HARP refi production. It's hard to say how aggressive we'll be on going after the other peoples' business. I mean, we've been very &#x2013; very active in our own portfolio, and we'll continue to be active in our own portfolio. That's our first priority.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay guys. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just to follow up on Ed's earlier question, so what -- if you're 200 basis point mortgage gain on sale now, what would be typical? And again, why is it greater than average? And it's not just you, it's the whole industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Typical Mike would be somewhere between 125 basis points and 1 1/4 basis points. It's higher right now because there's so much demand in the marketplace, and there's a fairly healthy pipeline, and the number of suppliers in the marketplace is down. So it's just a function of supply and demand in the current market, and that gives us some pricing opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did you mean 125 basis points to 150 basis points is normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And who are you getting share from in your pursuit to be the top five?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we're already there, actually. I was just being generous. We're taking it from the large -- some of the larger guys ahead of us. There's a couple of large banks that are backing down on that business and just not putting their energy into resources. And then, on the other side there are some smaller partners that are getting out of the business and looking like they're atritting. So it's exactly what you see Mike. I don't have to name names, but you know who is in it big and who's growing, and you know who's either backing down or not very present, and we're getting it from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then switching to your corporate banking buildout which you've talked a lot about. But when I look linked quarter, you know period end of commercial loans, without commercial leases are up 18% annualized. And we can look at average, and average is up 15% annualized. However you want to slice, that's a big number. And my question relates to how much of that growth is due to syndicated lending and how much of that growth is due to purchases of loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; in the large corporate space you're going to be active in the syndicated market, and you know, that complements our corporate bond issuance area, so that is a piece of it. But we're also active in the middle market. So our middle market group is included in those statistics. We have an ABL unit that's enjoyed nice growth. So it's really across the board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mike, we haven't found much to buy. We're not big acquirers of somebody else's loans. There have been a couple of deals we've looked at. We've passed on almost everything that you've seen in the public market. And if there's a deal, we'll cherry pick a loan or two. It'll have to mostly be a customer we already know, and just a position, a hold level we're willing to take. But it's not a growth strategy for us to go acquire portfolios. If they come along we'll look at everything, but we're not as hungry for some of those deals as some others are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, as you pointed out, your profitability ratios are within your targeted range, but are you leaving money on the table by not having a greater variety of capital market features to give your clients, especially with your corporate banking buildout?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OMG, no. And I say that because we like &#x2013; we only do what we understand, and that we can control. And as trite as it sounds I really like the consistent, predictable, repeatable business we've given you all.</p>
          <p>I thought you were going to ask if we were going to stop at 16 and 1.6, and that would be no way either, are you kidding. But we love what we are because I think you can count on it, and you can &#x2013; it's an annuity, and you can watch it grow, and you can watch it adjust, but you don't see any big surprises. And adding to some of those additional opportunities are not hurting us at all 'cause we've got all the ones we wanted to in the last few years by building out our  wholesale bank and capital markets. Nothing left we covet, there's nothing we don't have that we want, and there's nothing we have now that we don't want to keep. So what you see is what you're going to get for quite a while.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard, a question for you. We still are yet to find out about the <mark type="ph" /> GSFE (51:13), we kind of know what it is, but not really. Volcker is yet to come. Are there any other major regulatory pieces outside whatever the CFPB [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] may do that we're waiting for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know Nancy, this is Andy, the only one that I know we're all watching is the final LCR ratio. There's a definition out there today, I know there's some discussion occurring with Basel and the Fed in terms of potential adjustments to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've built a lot of liquidity on balance sheet, and whatever those final ratios are will guide us to whatever we finalize from the securities portfolio. But that would be the only other one I can think of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nancy, I was about to say, nope, I don't think so, and then I'm getting <mark type="ph" /> the eye cross from Andy like, I know one thing (51:57). But let me tell you what I would characterize. Between Volcker, Dodd-Frank, CFPB, as it relates to the financial impacts to our company and to shareholders, substantially most of that has already been seen by those other activities of Reg-E, and Durbin, and CARD Act, and things like that. Now, it'll change the course of how we run the company because we'll have to maybe dot our I's and cross our T's twice, we'll have to confirm certain behaviors. You know, we built our capital markets business knowing that the Volcker Rules were going to change. Dodd-Frank &#x2013; probably 65% of Dodd Frank will touch our company, and the big majority of it's going to be more paperwork transactions and managing the details but not the financials. And CFPB, I remain optimistic that it hasn't done anything I haven't seen yet to argue with, and we'll watch and see how they perform. But I think if their original true goal of being transparent, clear, and helping customers understand what they bought, we're going to be in great shape there. If they get into things like price-fixing and things like that, then we'll deal with that when we face it. And it will affect everybody, and as usual probably affect us less. But for now I think we're as a management team keeping our eye on so many things, but not sitting here worrying about the peril that it will create for the investment that you guys have in our company, and if it's <mark type="ph" /> a deal (53:13), we'll manage it like we have before and we'll find an offset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you think the regulatory regime as we see it right now is pretty much what we get going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think the details are &#x2013; yes  I've got the canvas, I see the paint on the side, but no one's painted it yet. I mean I don't think there's a hidden trap door of any significance that we can't at least predict or work within as the next couple years go forward. But as you know, I mean Dodd-Frank is only 25% to 33% done. Volcker has got a lot of TBDs, and CFPB is new. So I'm not saying it's at all known or done, but I'm saying I think its worst case scenarios are something we can manage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Richard, would you care to make an intrepid prediction about when you might get the ability to make &#x2013; or to decide capital actions without going through the CCAR [Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review] et cetera, et cetera? Are we at a point now over the next several years where capital actions are done once a year based upon the results of the CCAR, or is that going to change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Nancy, I really don't have any facts around it to offer, but I would say we're going to learn a couple of things this year because we know there are a couple of our peers that are seeking mid-year capital actions based on what they didn't get in the CCAR. And I think that will inform all of us, because we have no evidence that it will be anything less than an annual activity. And then I also am betting that it will take a few more years, few meaning more than one or two, for the global regulators to believe that banks can manage themselves without oversight. I think the stress test is an annual event that makes sense, and as long as the rules are understood and that we know how to participate in predicting our own outcome and make our own decisions that are hopefully approved, I don't think it becomes a burden at all, but one that we all just have an extra step than we had before. But I think in terms of annual nature I think we're about to learn that this year as some of our folks look for a mid-year correction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Just a quick question on the commitments. You called out the 5% Q on Q growth in CRE and C&amp;I. And I'm just wondering, you've been having nice commitment growth for a while now. How long does the commitments take to translate into outstandings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, currently, forever. I mean, really, our commitment levels, just to give you an idea, when I give you 25%, this is for the large corporate and middle market client, so it's not credit cards, it's not consumer, it's not even small business. Back in 2009, that was 37%. Right? So 37% of $65 <mark type="ph" /> million (56:00) was used as a line of credit. At last quarter we have 25% of $90 <mark type="ph" /> million (56:02). So while the growth &#x2013; the actual loans outstanding are virtually flat the increase in the outstandings open to buy is remarkable. So I've got to tell you, in a recession it really is &#x2013; I have no idea how long it will take. But what I know is when it happens it will be amazingly quick.</p>
          <p>And you guys can watch us like a Doppler radar. The first thing that happens when companies start getting ready to move is the cash balances get used, and then the line of credit gets used, and then new loans are made. And so we are still at record levels of deposit held based on companies being strong enough right now and kind of husbanding cash until they know what to do with it. And that's the first canary in the mine that says no one is actually taking any big steps at this point in time. But they are getting those lines of credit Betsy, and they're planning to use them, I suspect, because they're paying for them, and it gives them a lot of alternatives, and I think the country's business community is much stronger than people think it is because they are cash rich, they are line of credit capable, and they're ready to jump when something comes along. We just need that trigger event, and I don't see it on the near term, but surely it will happen, because it's a cycle.</p>

          <p>Okay. I see the macro numbers in your release, I just wondered if you, in tracking individual companies that you're, you know, extending commitments to, is that translating into loan growth at all over the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not yet. And it's a great question because &#x2013; I would tell you if that 25% was a few companies at 100% and the rest at 0%, that would be information, but it's not. It's the average company has a line of credit and uses a part of it, and then the rest they leave open to buy. And so for us it represents a behavior consistency but an absolute growth opportunity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Greg.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a couple of questions. One, of course commercial line growth has continued at a very impressive pace. Maybe some color &#x2013;  it looks like you would be gaining market share. Maybe some color on the strategies that you're undertaking to approach the wholesale or commercial lending business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, this is Richard. Warning, here comes something else that sounds not that exciting. We work on advocacy, and we've been training all of our lenders, many who have been doing this for 30 years, on a special training program that we created here in our company on customer advocacy. And that is, Greg, code word for building deeper relationships, and having the entire company available informationally to a customer when we meet with him. So we're not &#x2013;  we don't have the Relationship Manager now calling on a line of credit, talking about line of credit, praying for a line of credit, and coming back home. This Relationship Manager is working with an entire team, doing precall activities, bringing the right people out to the client, selling the entire company, if not now, later, and getting a lot of market from other places. So that the relationship depth we have is intensely higher than it was before. And to answer a question about 45 minutes ago, amazingly stealth; an infant in its growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>So what we're doing now is just getting started on a new way of taking market share. Our guys figured out that flight to quality is a real deal. It translates to new business. How telling the story better helps us do a better job. And so it's really training and making the entire company available to every Relationship Manager. See, I told you it wasn't going to sound exciting, but I'll tell you what, it's a big deal and it's a big change from where we were a few years ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. This has years of legs because it's got nothing but upside. And again, if you like what you see now just imagine what we can do when we really get good at it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And Andy, a question for you on the margin. On the liability side, what remaining opportunities do you have, such as maybe debt restructuring or elimination that may help support the margin for the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have some TGLP paper coming off here in the May-June timeframe, and then in total if you think about the second half of the year another $7 billion to $9 billion of higher cost debt rolling off, some of which will be replaced, some of which will be sort of resubstituted with deposit growth that we're enjoying. So that benefit will start to show in margin in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you'll see a cost come out of debt that will be replaced with lower cost funding sources?</p>

          <p>Our final question comes from Chris Gamaitoni with Compass Point.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. I just had two questions. One around deposits, non-interest bearing deposits looked like they declined about 5% quarter-over-quarter, and that looks to be mostly in these community bank, small community bank segment. Could you just give a little color around that? Is that people becoming more comfortable and willing to spend than thinking about, you know, their current position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I would attribute it &#x2013; more of it to seasonality. Typical seasonality related to tax activity, and just first quarter spend. So I don't think there's so much of a decline or a utilization as much as the seasonal impacts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the deposit service account charges. They were down 10%, 10.5%, quarter-over-quarter, it was attributed to seasonality. I haven't seen the same trends across other banks. Is there a geography issue, or a business change, that's impacting that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no geography issue. There are fewer days, business days, in the first quarter than the fourth quarter, and that's the principal reason for the decline, and the key driver of that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to clarify a statement. You talked about a significant increase in HARP volume. Was that HARP 1.0 or was that HARP 2.0.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We implemented 2.0 in the first quarter. So it would be some of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you so much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>As always, thank you guys for your continued support. The questions were great, and they helped us clarify what's on your mind. I'd also ask you to remain optimistic about this economy. It's starting to show some real signs of permanent but slow recovery, and we're going to be watching every step of it, and being engaged in part of it, and hopefully the banks in America will get a little more credit for the kind of good work we're going to do to help get America get back on its feet. So spread the good word; that's what I would say. And thanks for your interest in our company.</p>
