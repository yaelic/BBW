        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our 2012 second quarter results. I'm joined today by CEO, Asim Ghosh; CFO, Alister Cowan; and COO, Rob Peabody; as well as the heads of our Midstream and Downstream businesses, Terrance Kutryk and Bob Baird respectively. Today, we will provide an update on Husky's business strategy and an overview of results, followed by a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments do contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, Edgar and our website.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll turn the call over to Asim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's been another steady as she goes quarter. The results this quarter showed continued focus on executing against all of the elements of our plan. We've got two heavy oil projects online, Pikes Peak South and Paradise Hill which will ramp up to full production of around 11,000 barrels per day by the end of the year. We realized strong production and earnings results even with the two planned off-station programs. And of that, the SeaRose is now back home in Newfoundland after successful dry dock in Belfast is being reconnected and we're going to start up ramping up production this quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally, our focused integration strategy has once again proved its value in helping us, shield us from a volatile market and the high location discounts that we've been seeing in Canada.</p>
          <p>I turn to selection of operational highlights, and then Rob and Alister will amplify later today. In heavy oil as I just mentioned, we've been making good progress in transitioning our heavy oil portfolio towards more thermal production and horizontal drilling.</p>
          <p>We achieved first oil in the second quarter at both the Pikes Peak South and the Paradise Hill thermal projects ahead of schedule and product is now shipping up  &#x2013; shipping from both sites. To accelerate this program, we now sanctioned the Sandall thermal project and are looking at the early stages of examination at four additional thermal projects. We will be proving these &#x2013; developing these projects with our proven modular approach, which should give us cost and operational efficiencies.</p>
          <p>In Asia Pacific construction has finished on the shallow water jacket for the Liwan Project and installation is scheduled for the third quarter, a significant milestone as this jacket is the foundation for the central platform, which will develop from &#x2013; which will develop the Liwan field. I've told you before, it's a massive structure about 200 meters tall, and the topsides component of the platform is also coming together as planned. That's scheduled to be floated out over the jacket in the second quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>Just to remind you, this topside will be something like 28,000 metric tons when it's finished, and that's one of the biggest ever in Asia.</p>
          <p>So in summary, the Liwan Gas Project is also keeping pace for first production target late 2013, early 2014. On the Sunrise Energy Project, likewise, the building blocks are moving into place. Looking at the subsurface side, all 49 SAGD well pairs are finished. And most importantly, we've confirmed the quality of the reservoir. On the surface side, the biggest component is the Central Processing Facility, which is about 30% complete.  And construction of the other feeds facilities, including the pipelines, is about half complete. So Sunrise also is coming together as planned, with first production anticipated in 2014.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, it's been a steady quarter with progress against each of the elements of our business. And as I've said before, consistent execution of our business strategy is enabling us to deliver on the milestones we laid out at our last two Investor Days at the end of 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>On that note, let me turn over to Alister for the Q4 for the results overview.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Asim. As we all know, the global economic environment continues to be difficult, and that's resulted in significant volatility in commodity prices in the second quarter. However, the firm financial strategy we set and our ongoing financial discipline are enabling us to proceed with all of our planned projects through these volatile cycles. Our focused innovation strategy combined with a higher production in heavy oil and the high operational reliability at our downstream facilities have contributed to a solid first half of 2012, even with the FPSO offstation programs in the Atlantic region.</p>
          <p>Net earnings for the quarter were $471 million, or $0.43 diluted per share, compared to $669 million, or $0.71 diluted per share a year earlier. And that did include an after-tax gain of $55 million on an asset swap. The cash flow from operations was $1.15 billion, or $1.17 per diluted share and that compares to $1.51 billion or $1.67 per diluted share a year ago.</p>
          <p>On the production side, we averaged 283,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. And that included a temporary 34,000 BOEs per day reduction in the Atlantic region due to the offstations. This compares to 325 in BOEs in the first quarter and 311,600 a year ago. As I said, the production reflects the impact of both the SeaRose and the Terra Nova offstation programs, and we've said previously, these will reduce our annual production by approximately 16,000 barrels per day, which, as we said, has being factored into the annual guidance of 290,000 to 315,000 BOEs per day.</p>
          <p>We continue to benefit from a strong downstream operational performance and reliability, and these have partially helped offset lower commodity prices and refined product margins. The upgrader contributed $42 million to net earnings in the quarter compared to $48 million in the last quarter and $20 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>The U.S. refining operations contributed $84 million to net earnings, compared to $71 million in the first quarter and $165 million last year. As we did disclose in the MD&amp;A, we &#x2013; there was a FIFO first in first out after-tax loss of approximately $60 million in the quarter, as commodity prices declined.</p>
          <p>Just looking at pricing, the details are all in the MD&amp;A which is posted on the website for the detailed results, but I will touch on a few highlights. The average realized price for the company's production as a whole was $51.98 per boe in the quarter, compared to $66.33 per boe a year ago, and $65.26 per boe in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>The average realized crude oil pricing was $71.61 per barrel, down from $87.87 per barrel a year ago and $87.11 per barrel in the first quarter.  This reflects the impact of the Atlantic region offstations, lower commodity prices, and the wider product and location differentials. And further focused innovation strategy we've been able to minimize the volatility and capture a large portion of these wider location differentials and product differentials, and our upstream infrastructure and marketing and the downstream upgrading and refining operations. Natural gas remains depressed at $2.05 per mcf, compared to $4.02 per mcf a year ago and $2.64 per mcf in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Just looking at the next quarter, Toledo, Ohio, refinery is scheduled to have a turnaround to September and that will be a partial outage expected to last approximately 30 days. As Asim said, production from the White Rose and the satellite fields will ramp up gradually, with the recommissioning of the SeaRose FPSO as per schedule. And as I already said just production at the Pikes Peak South and Paradise Hill heavy oil thermal projects will ramp up to fill volumes by the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>From a financing perspective, we did as you know take action over the last 18 months with a financial plan designed to strengthen the balance sheet to ensure that we could execute on our deliverables. So this financial strength and discipline has stood us in good stead during periods of market volatility, it's given us the means to move forward with our medium to long-term advancements that will drive the future growth.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a bit of an update on our cash tax position for 2012. We've now completed our detailed review of the final tax legislation related to the taxation of partnerships. And we have identified that the major impacts will be effective for Husky in 2013 not 2012 as previously estimated. That now means that cash taxes for 2012, will be approximately $250 million lower at around $500 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. And as we indicated in the press release as a result of the progress on the major projects the strength of our balance sheet, we've agreed with the principal shareholders that they will revert to receiving dividends in cash not shares commencing with this dividend but just payable on October, 2012.</p>
          <p>Rob will now give us an operations update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Alister. As both Asim and Alister have mentioned the SeaRose offstation program is proceeding according to plan. We were really pleased with the safe and efficient manner in which the offstation work was carried out in Belfast. And we were able to get home a few days early. This is another demonstration of how safety and productivity go together. Looking first at our activities in Western Canada and the Western Canada business unit in the second quarter, we continue to invest in this foundation business with a greater focus on oil resource plays and liquids rich gas opportunities.</p>
          <p>In our oil resource portfolio, we drilled eight horizontal wells over the second quarter bringing our total number of horizontal wells this year to 34. We were active in the Redwater and Saskatchewan, Viking plays, the Lower Shaunavon and South Western Saskatchewan and the Oungre play in Southeast Saskatchewan.</p>
          <p>.At the Rainbow Muskwa play in Northwest Alberta, we drilled and cased two additional horizontal wells and brought one on to production. We're looking to complete four wells over the summer that were drilled earlier this year on the play, along with one carryover well from last year.</p>
          <p>In the Northwest Territories, planning is underway for a proposed winter program at our Slater River Project in late 2012 and into next year. Subject to regulatory approvals, we plan to construct an all weather road and further evaluate the two vertical wells that we drilled last winter. This work will help form the next stage of our evaluation program.</p>
          <p>Turning to our gas resource plays, we continue to focus on liquids rich gas opportunities. Drilling and completion activity at Ansell in west central Alberta was limited over the quarter due to spring breakup. A total of three wells were drilled, including one multi zone vertical well, one vertical Cardium well and one Wilrich horizontal well. The horizontal well was drilled to the intermediate casing point before the rig was laid down for a spring breakup.  We've now drilled a total of 12 wells in the first half of 2012 and completed 31 wells at Ansell.</p>
          <p>At Kaybob, one horizontal well was completed tied in and placed on production during the quarter and two other wells are scheduled for completion early in the third quarter. This brings to four of the total number of horizontal wells drilled to evaluate this liquids rich Duvernay play.</p>
          <p>Looking at heavy oil, Asim has already mentioned that we're making good progress in transitioning our heavy oil portfolio towards more production from thermal projects and horizontal drilling.</p>
          <p>Production from all of our thermal projects is now averaging about 24,000 barrels per day with about 4500 barrels per day coming from our new Pikes Peak South and Paradise Hill thermal projects. These projects the two of them were delivered in aggregate slightly under budget and in about 30 months and 15 months respectively, so a very good performance by the business unit there.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our growth pillars. Together with our partner CNOOC we're making great strides on the Liwan Gas project. As mentioned earlier, construction of the jacket finished on schedule and it is now been loaded out on a barge for placement at the shallow water location.</p>
          <p>All nine subsea production trees are now installed on wells in the Liwan 3-1 gas field, six upper completions have been installed and flow tested, which results as expected.  We remain on schedule for first production in the late 2013, early 2014 timeframe.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, we're moving forward with a planned six-plus well exploration program. We're working with our partner to advance the MDA and MBH fields towards production.</p>
          <p>We are anticipating first gas from the Madura Strait Block in 2014. We expect to award the contract for a leased FPSO this fall for the BD Field. Overall our Asia-Pacific strategy is on track to create a material oil and gas business of at least 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2015.</p>
          <p>In oil sands, you've already heard how the Sunrise Project is taking shape, so I won't add much other than to say the development work is progressing as planned for the next phase of the project, and FEED for this next phase is expected to finish up next year.</p>
          <p>In the Atlantic region, development drilling continued over the quarter at North Amethyst. At West White Rose, we commissioned a supporting water injection well in the quarter, and we also drilled an infill production well in the White Rose field during the offstation to support oil production following the reconnection of the SeaRose. Pre-FEED and FEED work has been awarded for the White Rose Extension Project and looking forward to the reminder of 2012, we'll participate in drilling two exploration wells offshore Newfoundland.</p>
          <p>We expect to spud the Searcher well in the southern Jeanne d'Arc Basin, which &#x2013; within the next couple of weeks. And the Harpoon prospect, which is operated by Statoil and is near the Mizzen discovery in the Flemish Pass is expected to spud later this year, and just to remind you, we hold a 35% interest in the &#x2013; in that well.</p>
          <p>Turning to the downstream, as Alister mentioned, we've seen good performance and reliability from this part of our business. A planned three week outage in April of the upgrader was successfully completed on time and under budget, subsequently, the upgrader set some significant milestones for record monthly production and shipments.</p>
          <p>In summary with increasing up times reliability and consistent execution, we continue to meet our operational targets.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn you over to the moderator for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the analyst question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from George Toriola of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning guys. And my question is around the heavy oil business. And so two parts here, the first is the &#x2013; what is the capital efficiency on the &#x2013; on this thermal projects, that you embarking on like Pikes Peak and such and what type of capital efficiency do you expect going forward. And secondly, how much scale would we see from these types of projects? How much of the &#x2013; I know, Rob has talked in the past about the substantial amount of resource that is still in place. So how much of that do these projects get at? That will be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, will you take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks George. Just on capital efficiency of these projects, these, the two projects we just did are &#x2013; were delivered between on average at about $33,000, $35,000 of flowing barrels, so very, very competitive overall in the portfolio. In terms of new resource, we will update more at the Investor Day in December, but you know as we said before, we got a sequence of these projects, to go forward on. And I think, it's fair to say that relative to the targets we've set at our Investor Day back, I think originally in 2010, that we're seeing more upside there than we initially thought, but as I say we'll come back to that at the Investor Day in December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks and so maybe just a quick follow-up. So the essence of your change in strategy from sort of moving away from CHOPS to the thermal projects. Is that pure economics, is that reserve recovery driven, what's the primary driver of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's quite simple really, first CHOPS has been a great driver of our production heavy oil over the years, but the quality at the margin of those wells is declining and meanwhile with the efficiencies we're seeing in executing the thermal projects, we're able to replicate the economics of the really good CHOPS wells now through thermal &#x2013; through thermal projects. So we &#x2013; and in essence what we see there is, whereas able to achieve the same operating cost with similar F&amp;D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Greg Pardy of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. So I got a few nitty questions for you. But, the one thing I think that stood out in the quarter was just the infrastructure contribution and I guess there is a $120 million there just in terms of marketing and other gains. Alister could you or Asim could you talk just a little bit about what's driving that number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Alister why don't you to take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg I mean that's simply the benefits of us realizing the way the product differentials from location differentials from Western Canada down into the U.S. with our infrastructure realizes to move our product, whether it would be crude oil or synthetic down to the pipes and selling it for basically instead of U.S. pricing, North Western Canada pricing, so that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...a benefit of our integration through that piece of infrastructure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I mean it's &#x2013; the numbers are pretty variable, but do you expect this to be like a significant ongoing contribution in through the balance of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think strategically you have to look upon this as a hedge, okay, so if the Canadian location discounts disappear, then the margin moves north of the border. And our &#x2013; the intention of our integration, we've called it focused integration before or targeted integration. It is not just integration for the sake of integration. It is because you recognize that Canada has got landlocked oil, and we in our particular case have got heavy oil and upcoming bitumen, which requires access to broader markets, and this basically gives us the access and shields us from differentials as they occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As the differentials go away then the volumes and the benefits come back upstream. I don't want to sound patronizing about it, but it's that simple.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's okay, no, no &#x2013; and it's all on your own pipe right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on our controlled pipe, so whether we own the pipe or whether we control it, its sort of &#x2013; it's basically we have &#x2013; we have capacity, we have controlled capacity. I mean, I'll remind you, I mean through Hardisty &#x2013; through the Hardisty system, we control about yeah, roughly a fifth to a quarter of all oil that leaves Western Canada and we see that as a very strategic part of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, this is Alister, the only other comment I would make was when we &#x2013; you recall we kind of restarted where we disclosed our information and the reason &#x2013; there's a reason why infrastructure and marketing methods, in the upstream segment because essentially it's the hedge against the differentials. Therefore if it's not making money you're going to make it in the exploration production section and upstream. So that's a combined &#x2013; you have to look at it on a combined basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay, no problem. Just curious second quarter, the gas volumes looked light, but was there just a heavy turnaround period in 2Q, and I don't really care too much about gas at $1.98, but was it a pretty heavy turnaround quarter for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg. Yeah it was &#x2013; it's really just the reflection of normal seasonal turnarounds, a little bit heavier than normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I'm almost done here, but just in terms of cash tax number, just to make sure I got the number right, $500 million for this year. Alister, is that the right one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; we have moved out the five-year payment period and that starts in 2013 &#x2013; no 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would add back the $250 million that we are not going to pay this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right; the last question then is just around the dividends paid in kind. Then should we assume then in the fourth quarter that your dividend payments are completely 100% cash?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the option to pay in kind continues. We didn't have a lot of people choose that option other than the principal shareholders. So theoretically not all, but to all intents and purposes, all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. And good morning guys. Two questions for you; one in the upstream and the downstream side. I guess the first thing is on the downstream. Obviously there is the strike going on at Lima. So I'm just wondering if you could provide any more information on that, specifically whether it could eventually have an impact on the operations there in Q3, Q4? And related to that, I'm just wondering if you can give just a little bit of insight on the unionization of your downstream assets in Canada. The second question...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I missed that word, immunization?</p>

          <p>Unionization.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unionization, I see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Unionization. And just the second question just on the upstream quickly, I am wondering if you can give a little bit of separation for the operating costs at Tucker. It looks like they are coming down and pretty positive. So I just wonder if you can break apart that $18.04 per barrel number? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah okay. Well, right now we don't see any issues in the operation. The refinery is operating with the staff and management in the facility, and they are operating it with equal safety and efficiency that we expect, and we continue to operate as well as we can. It's going really well, and we don't anticipate any issues in the third or fourth quarter. And as for the unionization of the other facilities in Canada, we do have our Asphalt Refinery and our Prince George Refinery are unionized facilities, and their unions are the CEP, Communication, Energy and Paper Workers.</p>

          <p>Okay. And your second question was on the op costs. If you look at our supplemental, the $18.04 of operating cost for oil sands, that's all Tucker.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's what I was wondering; could you maybe break down a fuel, non-fuel costs there?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just have a couple of questions. First of all, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the cost side of Sunrise and where you are and how you are tracking relative to your expectations. And then just on the Duvernay and Muskwa, given that you have drilled a few wells, completed a few wells, I was just wondering if you could &#x2013; if you can talk a little bit about some of the rates that you've gotten on those wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost side, I think we've said before that we expect by the end of the year to have substantial cost certainty as we convert, as we do the lump sum conversions. So far whatever has been completed has been on track, and there are no major surprises; there are some puts, there are some takes, and it all sort of coming out in the wash. But we don't have any &#x2013; we don't see any hemorrhaging, shall we say, okay. But it is really by the end of the year, that we will really get all the bits and pieces to come together because we really are in the midst of the audit and conversion process as we speak.</p>
          <p>The second question was about the Duvernay. Rob do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and just touching on, overall we are drilling about 400 wells in Western Canada this year, and about a third of those are into liquids rich gas resource plays, and we're looking at a number of plays including the Duvernay and the Muskwa. I kind of &#x2013; on the call I just spoke about the number of wells we are drilling there.</p>
          <p>I think, in summary, I'm not going to get into the results in a big way because, frankly, most of those wells have only been on production for, in some cases, a month or two, and, in some cases, a few weeks. And so, it's a little early to talk about them again. We will come back to that at the December investment day/ I mean the only thing I will say is that, in general, in most of these plays, we monitor competitor results as well, and we are very much in line with what we are seeing competitors doing. But as I say, it's very early days. Overall, enough encouragement there that we continue to move ahead with the development plans, particularly at the Duvernay play and the Muskwa play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>The next question is a follow-up question from George Toriola of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on two assets, the Northwest Territories and Saleski. Just maybe you can talk about what you've seen with Saleski at this time, and on the Northwest Territories, what are you, what's the game plan, and what's the sort of size of resource that you're looking for with drilling there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Saleski is now at very early stage. We gave you guidance last time about the resource evaluation that we did, which was massive. And we are advancing the early work of the pilot plant and the initial environmental monitoring, which will support regulatory application for the pilot plant development. But it's &#x2013; that's about all it is. We see this, we don't see this as a project that will make a difference to Husky in the five-year &#x2013; the first five-year timeframe. It's something that we will look at for the future. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. How about the Northwest Territories? Same timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, this is early days. It's &#x2013; we will have a better sense of this resource after we do our winter exploration plan this upcoming season. So in the short-term, as Rob said, we are advancing planning for the winter program subject to a lot of approvals that are required. Plans include an all-season access load, additional infrastructure, the two vertical wells will be re-evaluated. I'd be evaluating a &#x2013; over 200 kilometer 3D seismic. So it's a sequential process and the results are being assessed, but there is much work still to do. And in parallel, we are continuing consultations with community and officials.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, good morning. Several quick questions. First, Alister, should we assume that the 2012 CapEx is leaving unchanged despite the volatility in the oil market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul, as I said, I mean, we have a strong balance sheet, we've got our financial program that allows us to ride through the volatility. So our capital will be as we set out in &#x2013; for 2012 as we set out in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry Paul. As we pointed out, we have been, because of the unique place, but it's not unique, but compared to most companies the way we are positioned is we have been materially shielded from the volatilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's great. A similar, Alister, I know it's early, can you give us some idea that your 2013 preliminary budget going to be pretty similar to 2012, or you expect going to be up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Paul, as you said, it's very early to make any comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe then that for Rob. Rob, you are kind enough to give what is the development cause for the thermal heavy oil project. Do you have a cash operating cost and steam oil ratio on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; so in terms of a cash operating cost there, we are looking in the $16, $17 a barrel range, although, it's early days again, I think that these projects kind of line themselves out, there will be some opportunities there going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the steam oil ratio gain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steam oil ratio, it's a little early to say actually at the movement again, Paul. Although, we anticipate they are going to be sort of probably expect them to be under 3, but it's a little early to say at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you're target is under three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Rob, what is your NGL production in your portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we are just looking to see if we have the figure right around. I have one at the top off my mind, but I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 8,500?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>8,500. And that the new play that you're testing, are those mostly Brent oil or NGL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination. The Duvernay play consists of a significant condensate production and then NGLs and then things like the Rainbow Muskwa in the Northwest Territories there's a variety there including black oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Final question, I mean I believe you gentlemen to have one of the few very interesting large acreage in the company oil sand leases. Have you guys start to look at and have done any evaluation in that or that this is so far out that you guys is just at the back burner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Asim mentioned earlier, I mean we did actually disclose at the end of last year after we had an independent evaluation done, an outside reserves auditor went through the Saleski lease which is that carbonate position. And they recommended that we book 10 billion barrels of contingent recoverable reserves, which I remind you indicates, there is still work to be done in terms of proving up the commerciality of this fine, but a very large resource. And that was based on a significant valuation program where we drilled a number of evaluation wells over a long period of time. And I think Asim previously discussed sort of just the forward plan where we are in the very early stages of formulating a game plan around what type of pilot we might want to move forward within the future.</p>

          <p>Hi. I'm wondering if you can be a bit more specific on the restart of SeaRose. When do you actually expect to see oil coming on and what volumes will come on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've given an overall company guidance and production, I don't think we've given specific guidance on the SeaRose. But basically, it's undergoing reconnection exercises where each of the circuits has to be retested. And as I said earlier, we expect to start &#x2013; restart production this quarter, but I don't believe we've given guidance as to the specific ramp up.</p>

So just a quick wrap up, we continue to make progress against each of our business areas, the foundation and the growth areas. I'll remind you that our marketing and infrastructure and downstream businesses are creating value and sort of sheltering us in part from the buffeting of benchmark prices, and location discounts and differentials that we are seeing in the market. And where we are positioned as you know, we are focused on execution and we believe we are in a very good position to capitalize on the very substantial portfolio of opportunities that our company has.
