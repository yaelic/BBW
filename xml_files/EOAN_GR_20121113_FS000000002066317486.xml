          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, also from my side good afternoon and welcome to our nine months results analyst and investor call. Today, I have Johannes Teyssen and Marcus Schenck with me. As usual, Johannes will take the first part followed by Marcus. We're then available for your questions. Johannes, your turn, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, everyone, it is obviously definitely not a good day for E.ON or you as our investors. Before I hand later over to Marcus, we will as usual guide you through our Q3 results. I like to take the opportunity to comment on the key developments in our business. Many of you obviously &#x2013; all of you certainly have questions about the ad-hoc announcement that we sent out yesterday evening, thus I will start with this.</p>
          <p>During yesterday afternoon's management board meeting, we discussed the current status of our mid-term planning for the year 2013 to 2015. This planning process has not been finalized yet and this is why as of today we cannot and hence we will not talk about details; however, which has become very clear is that we will not be able to achieve the targets set out for 2013 and 2015 and we have therefore decided to put them under review.</p>
          <p>For those of you that are keeping a close eye on our company, hence that we have met on different road shows, the reasons for the shortfall in earnings and are no secret as such; the market environment in our sector is getting increasingly adverse and it is significantly worse since we set our targets back in 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me recap some of the key developments in our markets. First, both oil and gas demand is falling in most European countries. In Spain, industrial power demand fell by 7% year-on-year in September; and in Italy overall power demand fell by almost 10% year-on-year. Even if supposedly better off countries such as Germany or Sweden, power demand is contracting. Never as such large demand collapses occurs in such a short time across Europe, and this will be the fourth out of five years with lower power demand in this continent.</p>
          <p>And this is mostly the consequent of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, as one country after the other goes close to or into a new recession. In fact the crisis doesn't show any sign of abating, but rather of accelerating.</p>
          <p>Second point, we knew the capacity keeps growing rapidly even though some countries have reduced their support. In Germany once more, 6 gigabit of solar capacity has been installed in the first nine months only of this year. Despite cuts in support, subsidies remain generous in many cases, because they have not kept up as a rapid fall of the costs of renewable energy.</p>
          <p>As a result, renewables are increasing their share of power generation and this at the detriment of conventional generation.</p>
          <p>The impact on the overall market is becoming increasingly powerful. In Germany for example, the traditional afternoon peak and power demand has been replaced by an afternoon crunch due to solar energy production. The market for conventional generation had already become oversupplied since the crisis of 2008 and 2009. And with the further contraction of demand and the growth of renewables, it is not going to get any better. In fact, renewable technologies, we do not have to respond to market incentives or do not suffer on the market developments or severely damaging non-subsidized technologies anyway.</p>
          <p>In fact oversupplied markets, both the margins and the volumes of marginal plants must come under pressure. It is especially for other clean gas plants that are taking the hit for the time being. Spark spreads have collapsed from about &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour to less than &#x20AC;2 per megawatt hour here in Germany, load factors are falling heavily.</p>
          <p>Even a highly efficiencies <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:51) now being dispatched for barely 6,000 hours per year; last year it had been 4,000 hours, which was relatively normal for such a plant. Coal prices have come down from around &#x20AC;90 per tonne to about &#x20AC;75 a tonne. Coal exports from the U.S. are increasing as a shale gas evolution is sidelining local coal demand.</p>
          <p>In China, the weaker economy has led among others to recover and thus core demand. In addition, freight rates remained stuck at impressed levels due to persistent oversupply of shipping capacity. The crisis of 2008 had already led to an oversupply of CO2 allowances. The continued growth of renewables outside the ETS regime and the deepening of the euro crisis have further worsened the outlook.</p>
          <p>CO2 prices have fallen from around &#x20AC;13 per tonne to some &#x20AC;8 a tonne. Without <mark type="ph" /> a successful interventions (5:54) CO2 prices have no reason to recover. In this aspect, I reach the first decision of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:01) of yesterday to backlog 900 million tones, as a first necessary step, but further steps need to follow.</p>
          <p>Lower coal prices, lower CO2 prices that means lower power prices. Since August 2011, power prices have come down more strongly in the two markets where it matters most for us, namely Germany and the Nordic region. German power prices have fallen by about &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hours, Nordic power prices from lower levels by about a further &#x20AC;6 megawatt hour. Despite successful forward hedging, this will sooner or later negatively impact the earnings of our nuclear and hydro fleet.</p>
          <p>Many of these market developments have a structural character. We have to accept that this must be the new normal, and as if it was not enough already, we continue to see many adverse regulatory political interventions. Tax on coal in the Netherlands, tax on basically all generation technologies in Spain, the increase of hydro tax in Sweden, Robin Hood Tax in Italy and Hungary, the list is getting very long. Meanwhile, energy policy is standing still. The best example is the withering of European Emission Trading Scheme into factual relevance. In addition, more and more countries are formulating their energy policies without regard for any kind of European perspective.</p>
          <p>Is it not strange for example, that the support for solar energy has been cut most strongly in Southern Europe, where solar is most productive? What does it mean for us at E. ON? First, all this makes clear why we decided yesterday to put our targets under review. When we formulated our new strategy two years ago, we did not put rosy glasses on. We were already convinced that the sector environment in Germany and Europe would not improve.</p>
          <p>Our Cleaner and Better Energy strategy rests indeed on the basic idea that the European utility sector would go through a major transformation at little or no growth. This is why we decided to carry out a major effort to reduce control over costs and improved efficiency. But Marcus will show in a moment E.ON 2.0 is progressing faster than initially planned and will deliver its first tangible results already in 2012.</p>
          <p>This is also why we decided to refocus our European business portfolio and clean up our balance sheet. We will probably complete our disposal program ahead of schedule and we expect to even overachieve it. We have now already divested &#x20AC;13.2 billion out of our &#x20AC;15 billion target. Two weeks ago, we agreed to sell our 50% stake in Horizon Nuclear Power to Hitachi for around &#x20AC;430 million, about &#x20AC;100 million more than what we had invested into the project. We have also decided to exit Finland including the Fennovoima project to focus our operations in Nordic region, on Sweden and Denmark only.</p>
          <p>And in Germany, we will focus and concentrate our operations on our four largest regional distributors. Discussions to set all three other regional distributors are progressing in a constructive spirit. This is also why we decided to become extremely prudent with our capital and to get more value out of less capital. One example is the sale of a 50% stake in three U.S. wind parks to PensionDanmark soon after commissioning, a way to accelerate capital rotation and achieve higher returns. And this is also why we decided to expand our footprint predominantly outside Europe. Their growth perspectives are much stronger than in Europe. Indeed even though emerging markets are feeling some headwinds from the Euro crisis, economic growth is staying at relatively healthy levels.</p>
          <p>Through our joint venture with MPX, we have entered the Brazilian market in a format which ticks all the boxes. However, fact of the matter is, that the transformation of the European landscape is happening at much greater speed and to a much large extent could have been reasonably expected. The conclusion that we draw is that we do not need to change our strategy fundamentally, if anything we need to execute our strategy even faster and more resolutely. Even if we have already delivered quite a lot over the last two years, even if the core beliefs of our strategy remain valid, we need to ask ourselves a number of questions.</p>
          <p>First, what can and should we still afford? Second, can we and should we execute all the planned investment proposed by our operations, what can be skipped, what must be skipped. Third, is our portfolio sufficiently focused yet? Fourth, where should we do less and where should we do more? These are the questions that we will and have to answer. We are now focused on reviewing each and every of our businesses. We plan to share the final outcome with you in about two months' time.</p>
          <p>This concludes my initial remarks. Thank you for your attention. Marcus over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Johannes. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, investors and analysts. Whilst understandably everyone is focused on the outlook, I will first walk you through the Q3 results. Our third quarter 2012 results continued to show a positive developments compared to the prior year. The steep increase is borne by mostly two positives, which are both either fully or to a large extent one-off nature. Keeping this in mind, we have been able to improve EBITDA by 35% to now &#x20AC;8.8 billion. Underlying net income substantially improved by 155% to &#x20AC;4 billion. In contrast to the first six months results, the positive development in earnings is now also showing through in the operating cash flow; as a consequence, operating cash flow increased by over 170% compared to the half year stage.</p>
          <p>Together with a strong cash flow and also supported by disposals, our net debt position improved substantially since the half year stage by over &#x20AC;5 billion to now slightly below &#x20AC;36 billion. In light of these results, we are confirming our full year 2012 outlook for both EBITDA and underlying net income.</p>
          <p>So far so good, the program for today does however not stop here; as Johannes has stated, the environment in many of our markets is and remains extremely challenging, in particular in the European power generation markets, we do not see any sign of improvement at this stage. This is next to interest rate developments or some of the Southern European countries reflected in an impairment charge of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, which we record in our non-operating earnings.</p>
          <p>I'll give you some more background to this later. My task for today is a mixed one. As usual, I will update you on selected business developments, then explain the strong results for the first three quarters 2012. I will then turn to our outlook 2012 and will finally give you some more backgrounds to help you understand especially the impact of our disposal program on our earnings.</p>
          <p>On the business update, let us start with our renewables business. I would like to highlight the successful execution of one key building block of E.ON strategy, less capital, more value. We sold a 50% stake in three wind farms for around $500 million to PensionDanmark. These three wind farms are Papalote Creek I and II, as well as Stony Creek and have a total capacity of 433 megawatt. In light of the fact that we also received a cash grant for these wind farms and have some positive cash flows in-between, we've recycled already approximately 90% of the money invested including interest.</p>
          <p>Overall, we expect our renewables business to bring an additional capacity of 630 megawatts into operations during this year. This number does by the way not include London Array which will bring another 190 megawatt offshore capacity to our portfolio early next year. So you will continue to see us pursue similar deals as with PensionDanmark in order to reap the full value from our attractive pipeline of projects. We do this in partnership with investors that have a long-term financial interest in this asset class.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the current status of our E&amp;P business. As we reported earlier this year, we faced an unfortunate combination of operational issues in a number of our fields. While the overall reserve potential is unchanged, the production schedule will be delayed. On Elgin-Franklin, the field operated by Total, where after a leakage, a total shutdown and well cure has to be conducted; we expect a restart at the end of Q1, 2013 at initially reduced production level however.</p>
          <p>The second feat, I would like to comment on is Rita, here we have a damage to a subsea pipeline. The feat has not produced at all this year. This also contributes an $0.6 million Boe reduction compared to the first nine months 2011. We are currently planning a restart of the feat in the course of the second half of 2013.</p>
          <p>Regarding Skarv-Idun, we can confirm our communication from the half year reporting. We still expect production start to be in December. As already explained, this has a certain spillover into 2013 in terms of volumes due to the ramp up face for such a big field. Our estimate for the single effects compared to our previous planning is currently around 3 million to 4 million. This is the single biggest volume deviation of a feat. In total, we are currently volumes to be 7 million to 9 million Boe lower than in the planning underlying our old 2013 EBITDA target for E&amp;P of &#x20AC;1.7 billion to &#x20AC;2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>In our generation business, I would like to draw your attention to two issues. Firstly, we have some news on the Datteln project. Here we have received permission to continue producing power with our old plants started in I-III until early 2014. This is important for us to fulfill our contractual obligations towards Deutsche Bank and hence avoid litigation.</p>
          <p>Despite this being a reflection of the generally more positive public and political environment for the plants, our timing for the COD is delayed. We currently expect receiving all necessary permissions in 2014, while the time for completion depends on the extent of technical modifications. Therefore, an exact date for COD cannot be specified at this moment.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we have decided to put on hold our plants regarding the extension of our Waldeck pumped-storage plant. This is a clear reflection of the continuous build out of PV in Germany. The number of available high peak hours is reducing with every megawatt of additional PV installed. Next to the fact that the overall German market is still well supplied, we simply lack the confidence that the investment case for peak hydro in Germany is still there.</p>
          <p>This overall market issue brings me to the last point. We had to take impairments this quarter of around &#x20AC;1.2 billion net. On the one hand, these impairments are a reflection of the overall difficult market environment, which has led to an increase of capital cost assumptions for several markets and businesses. On the other hand, it is also to some extent the result of political intervention. That is to say one-third of the overall amount stands from write-downs we have to make on our adoption Spanish generation assets. In the Netherlands, we talk about the tax on coal generation and in Spain also renewable energy will be subject to a higher tax on electricity production.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to chart four, where we show you the major year-on-year delta effects influencing group EBITDA. There are two very substantial positive factors, which are both either fully or to a large extent one-off nature. Both of these are known to you. The first the nuclear exit effects is the absence of the huge prior year one-off charge. As you will remember, we booked &#x20AC;1.5 billion one-off in group EBITDA at the Q2 stage in 2011 after German government's decision to permanently shut down eight German nuclear plants in one go. Due to the fact that this was obviously not repeated this year, we recorded &#x20AC;1.5 billion positive delta.</p>
          <p>The second effect is also to a large extent a one-off. The &#x20AC;0.9 billion improvement in our gas wholesale business, mainly results from the settlement with our largest gas supplier Gazprom.</p>
          <p>The &#x20AC;1 billion from &#x2013; the around &#x20AC;1 billion from Gazprom booked in H1 contains a substantial proportion of compensation for prior year losses and will therefore not be repeated. The overall gas wholesale effect stood at &#x20AC;1.2 billion at the half year reporting stage. The change to this figure mainly results from the absence when you compare it to last year of optimization earnings, which we were able to generate in our gas trading business in the isolated Q3 of 2011.</p>
          <p>We had highlighted last year that this optimization opportunities, I think the words to remember here are time slots and optimizing winter/summer spreads was pretty unique. We were not able to repeat this in Q3 of 2012. For the year-end, we expect the gas wholesale business to improve year-on-year by a similar amount as shown at the half year stage, i.e., around &#x20AC;1.2 million.</p>
          <p>Also related to our old global gas business reported now in our segment optimization and trading, we recorded a one-off gain from the revaluation of participations. This was an effect which we spoke about in Q2 of this year.</p>
          <p>The region Germany improved substantially compared to the half year results and also compared to prior year level. More than half of the year-on-year improvement is driven by a necessary provision release in the third quarter. However, we are also seeing sustainable earnings improvement in the segments coming from the regulated activities.</p>
          <p>Next to an improved regulatory environment, we are seeing the first effects from our cost cutting initiatives. As we have indicated in our H1 conference call, E.ON 2.0 continues to be rolled out for implementation. I'm pleased to inform you that the tangible progress we reported upon now also starts to show in our accounts, slightly ahead of our initial expectations. Actually we see E.ON 2.0 contributing already &#x20AC;100 million to the nine months' EBITDA. This number should increase to &#x20AC;200 million for the full year. This is a reflection of the speed, at which we have been able to implement several of the initiatives. Finally, the Russian business continued its good performance of the prior quarters.</p>
          <p>Now to the negative factors, the largest negative impact was in our nuclear/power portfolio. As described in our earlier quarterly reporting, this effect has two main components. One is the loss of volume compared to last year from the shutdown of the nuclear plants, Unterweser and Isar-1. The other is related to lower achieved power prices in our outright portfolio, mainly in the Central European market area, but also to lower realized spreads from our flexible fleets, the results of lower extrinsic value.</p>
          <p>In terms of nuclear tax, we have paid &#x20AC;0.3 billion more than in the first nine months of 2011, but the year-on-year difference is not as large as it was at the half-year stage. We expect to end the year still with &#x20AC;0.2 billion increase of nuclear tax compared to 2011. The intra-year change of the delta effect is a result of the timing of the maintenance faults during which the fuel rods are exchanged. The exchange of the rods is deteriorating events for the tax payments. Last year faults were more geared towards the second half of the year. The tax spread for this year in total &#x20AC;700 million will be representative for future years.</p>
          <p>Finally, three effects contribute negatively with &#x20AC;0.1 billion each. Firstly on the E&amp;P side, as you know this business is suffering from production issues in several fields as I mentioned before. The year-on-year production volume, reductions from Njord, which is minus 1.3 million Boe and Elgin minus 1.5 billion Boe are the most prominent ones. I also mentioned Rita, which is not producing at all and again contributes a reduction of 0.6 million Boe.</p>
          <p>Within the segment E&amp;P, this is only partially compensated by better pricing for North Sea volumes and especially better prices for the volumes from our Russian field participation Yuzhno Russkoye. Secondly, we're seeing a downward pressure in our gas storage optimization. Similar to the power business, where flexibility is not getting much value in the currently well supplied markets we see a loss in value for gas sourcing flexibility. This development will build up to &#x20AC;0.2 billion effect for the full year and most likely stay with us for quite some time.</p>
          <p>Finally, there is the impact of the Open Grid Europe deconsolidation. As you know, we sold this business in May. On the slide six and seven, you see the reconciliation from EBITDA to net income. The lower depreciation is the result of basically three different factors; lower volumes in E&amp;P, deconsolidation of Open Grid Europe, as well as the asset impairments from last year.</p>
          <p>Our economic net debt &#x2013; sorry, our economic net interest expense has improved significantly by &#x20AC;330 million. The main positive factor for these developments is a release of provisions. This effect which is reflected in our current fiscal year 2012 outlook will be only slightly higher in the fourth quarter. It is of one-off nature, it is non-cash, and at the end of the year the positive impact will however be substantial.</p>
          <p>The book gains came down strongly compared to last year. In 2011, this position benefited mainly from the disposal of the remaining gas pump shares, as well as the disposal of Central Networks in the UK. Our restructuring costs came down compared to Q3 of 2011. I have already talked about the impairments and hence what is left is our reported tax rate which increased from very low levels. Remember, last year we were benefiting from a mix of effects due to the nuclear one-off we lost a considerable portion of taxable income when at the same time the book gain from the gas pump disposal was basically tax-free.</p>
          <p>This year on the operational side, the weakness of E&amp;P is reducing the tax expense. Adding go this, we have recorded a release of provision as was communicated with our half year results.</p>
          <p>On chart eight, you can see the reconciliation of EBITDA from underlying net income. The strong jump in EBITDA feeds fully through to the underlying net income. The increase of income taxes is smaller than the decrease of both depreciation and of economic interest expenses.</p>
          <p>Chart nine, shows you the reconciliation of the operating cash flow explaining the key effects responsible for the &#x20AC;2.3 billion increase, compared to the first nine months 2011. The first effect obviously is the incremental EBITDA of &#x20AC;2.3 billion compared to last year. This is &#x2013; offsets by two non-cash EBITDA assets, firstly the nuclear carve-out cost &#x20AC;1.5 billion and secondly maybe less prominence, there is a revaluation of infrastructure assets in our gas business in 2012, also a &#x20AC;200 million non-cash EBITDA effect.</p>
          <p>At the half-year stage, we still have to show another large negative &#x20AC;1 billion non-cash EBITDA effect related to the settlement with gas pump. The cash has now been collected, one important reason for the improvements of the operating cash flow picture. Now to the positive effects, the most prominent one originates from our gas storage business, where we have a higher net extraction in 2012. In UK, the effect is known from the half year results. We continued to reduce our coal inventories relative to the 2011 levels.</p>
          <p>In Russia and the Czech Republic, we had negative working capital effects last year caused by regulatory changes, which were not repeated. The UK pension funding effect also relates to last year, when we have to put additional cash into the funds. We've received back slightly less than half of the fine. We were sentenced to pay as part of the so-called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:04) case. The lower interest payments relate mostly to the early redemption fees, which we paid for the buyback of E.ON bonds last year.</p>
          <p>You might also notice, that there is another effect that was not showing any &#x2013; that we're not showing anymore, mainly the &#x20AC;1.6 billion withholding tax payments. As we told you, we have received this cash by now in Q3.</p>
          <p>Our net debt situation is described on chart 10. You might remember this chart still from the half year stage. Back then, we had highlighted that the shown net debt figure was significantly distorted. The Q3 picture confirms our statement from the first half year. We have brought down net debt by over &#x20AC;5 billion compared to the figure reported in August to now &#x20AC;35.6 billion.</p>
          <p>The biggest positive drivers were the operating cash flow and the divestments. The key facts are as follows: Because of the third quarter, we invested &#x20AC;1.5 billion bringing the overall figure to &#x20AC;4.2 billion. With this, we are still some &#x20AC;3 billion shy of the figure planned for the full year 2012.</p>
          <p>The single biggest share of total CapEx and also by far the largest contribution to year-on-year CapEx growth continues to be our renewables business. The &#x20AC;1.1 billion invested there account for 26% of group CapEx. Our overall dividend payments amounted to &#x20AC;2.1 billion. Our operating cash contributed a positive &#x20AC;6.8 billion, a very good figure, which obviously contains 100% EBITDA relevant one-off cash effect from the Gazprom settlements mainly, however, compensating for past losses.</p>
          <p>As announced at the half year stage, we booked the cash in from the Open Grid Europe disposal in Q3, bringing the overall proceeds from disposals to now &#x20AC;3.9 billion. Pension provisions increased by &#x20AC;2.2 billion, foreign benchmark bond yields has led to a further reduction in the discount rates to now three in the quarter for Germany, 50 basis points less than the half year stage and 4% in the UK. In the other position, we see a broad mix of effects all in the minus &#x20AC;200 million to minus &#x20AC;300 million range. Three ones, I'd like to mention, margining payments in the trading segments, change of the market value of ethics derivatives, and translation effects on our non-Euro denominated bonds.</p>
          <p>Let us now finally look forward at the full year 2012. As I highlighted, we can reiterate our outlook for the 2012 EBITDA and underlying net income for the year 2012. We also confirm our dividend for the year 2012. In light of the very strong Q3 numbers, you might even suspect that we should be able to surpass our earnings targets. Let me reassure you very clearly that we are still rather are in the middle of that EBITDA range. Johannes has already talked about our mid-term guidance which we have put under review.</p>
          <p>With regard to our 2013 guidance, a considerable adjustment will result from a true like-for-like view, i.e. taking into account dilution from our disposals. If you remember the old &#x20AC;11.6 billion to &#x20AC;12.3 billion EBITDA target only included dilution effects up to the achieved disposals as of August 2011. Those were &#x20AC;9 billion of disposals, with an EBITDA dilution effect of around &#x20AC;900 million. As of today, we are confident to achieve our disposal target during the next few months. In fact, we might even overachieve.</p>
          <p>To give you a better feeling for the impact of divestments subsequent to August 2011, we have to get a like-for-like view for our 2012 results. This means we have taken our 2012 outlook and removed the contributions from assets that we either have already sold, but that still had a contribution in 2012 EBITDA or that we are planning to dispose in the near future.</p>
          <p>Most of these disposal candidates will be known to you. There is also a group of other disposals, partially already completed, partially still to happen, which we will not detail further at this stage. Taking all disposals into account and starting from the mid range point of our current guidance i.e. $10.7 million. We arrive at a like-for-like EBITDA for 2012 of &#x20AC;9.6 billion. Our underlying net income this would translate into an impact of around negative &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>That concludes my remarks and let me now first hand back to Marc.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Marcus, and usually we have one final remark as Johannes has indicated, we plan to inform you about our mid-term spend and hence new targets set in early 2013.

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Mr. Vincent Gilles by Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions. The first one is on the impairment. I think we understand what's happening in the world of power in Europe but it would be interesting, do you have a bit more details on exactly where you've been impairing having which asset reserve is relating to you gave the regions, but maybe a bit more color would be helpful. The other one is, I think <mark type="indiscernible" /> (36:04) and I'm trying to calculate your chart page 11 each of the initial boxes and how much that could be, so here it is a task, but when you're talking about superior to &#x20AC;15 billion realized in planned transactions, I guess like everyone I'm wondering how superior to &#x20AC;15 billion this number could be, and obviously what I'm trying to achieve is the sort of dilution that you're hinting at, maybe it would be better if the numbers came from you and then fantasy work done in the corner of my desk. So if you could help that'd be very good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm not so sure I really understand the second question. I believe I mentioned that the overall impact of the dilution of assets sold post August 2011 or yet to be sold is in total &#x20AC;1.1 billion EBITDA, which is why when you pro forma 2012 for that effect and you start from the midpoint of our guided range which has been &#x20AC;10.7 million, you deduct &#x20AC;1.1 million you get to &#x20AC;9.6 million. I hope that's clear enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's more than &#x20AC;15 billion, I'm struggling a bit when &#x2013; if you can give us some form of abate here what the overall number could be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now I get it. The &#x2013; you mean whether it's &#x20AC;15 billion, &#x20AC;16 billion, &#x20AC;17 billion or &#x20AC;18 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was in simple terms, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we expect that we will rather be around &#x20AC;17 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Marcus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And on the impairments, let me give you some more color on that. It is a mix of effects we have let me mention sort of the big ones, we have a substantial asset impairment in Holland, which is caused by the introduction of a coal tax from next year onwards on our two existing blocks in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:12) and we do have also two impairment charges related to two plants &#x2013; power plants in Germany or projects rather. We have a coal project <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:27) into which the past five, six years money have been invested.</p>
          <p>We've taken a decision to no longer pursue this project implying that we have to write-off the investments that have been made there. And there's also a smaller impairment recorded for the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (38:45) project. We do have certain impact from changes to discount rates in particular in some of the eastern/southern &#x2013; eastern European countries that relates to our assets in Hungary and Slovakia. So there is a material impact there. We do have an impact in Spain, not in our conventional business, but in the &#x2013; on the wind part sides, I believe I mentioned that and those are based what I've now mentioned explained more than 90% of the effect.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Patrick Hummel by UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, limiting myself to two questions. First one, I am wondering what the deteriorated earnings outlook actually means in terms of your expectation for gearing and CapEx or growth CapEx in specific, because it sounds like the positive effects from the disposals will be offset by the worsening earnings outlook. So I am just wondering how we should think about that the growth in areas such as renewables, for example, or your outside Europe or call it emerging market strategy?</p>
          <p>And second question very obvious one, but one has to ask it, any thoughts in how we should think about the dividend going forward, I guess it's lower, it's clearly gone, but should we just extrapolate the 50% to 60% payout policy for the coming years whatever the underlying earnings number will be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Johannes, I take the second one. I think after consultation with our Chairman, we have taken all numbers under review. And at this point, we cannot give any indication to the new decisions we will take there. But the indication I can give you is that we will &#x2013; when we come back to you, we intend to come back with the call numbers of 2012, the final numbers and the then expectations for 2013 as early as possible. This will include our policy on the dividend for that year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On your first question, if I get it right, I think your question is do the &#x2013; does the increase in disposals does it give us sort of more leeway to invest into growth for &#x2013; is it rather....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, rather the opposite because I mean the earnings outlook is obviously worse than we all thought and therefore I would assume gearing...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was the second part of my sentence, or it's rather that we will be using it to work on the leverage. It is more the latter and we still see it meaningful to invest into the gradual transformation of our portfolio. But clearly everything is under review and that also means that's a CapEx in all of our activities is under review more to that we will be communicating then when the plan is ready. But in principle it &#x2013; I think that the direction is that we will rather look at using the disposal proceeds for further deleveraging.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Alexander Karnick by Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. I had actually two; one is a slide follow-up on cash flow and CapEx. Could you indicate the flexibility on CapEx for the future years maybe that's sort of I got feeling that you can give us sort of &#x2013; and the magnitude of leeway that you have there. The second question would be, when considering the worsened earnings outlook, possible cut in dividend et cetera, would you be free cash flow or would your free cash flow cover the dividend, is there anything that you could indicate what you would like to see?</p>
          <p>And my last question would be on the sales and supply business. I think there's been some &#x2013; a little bit of expectation management, towards more of a breakeven result from a previous sort of communication of say &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;300 million EBITDA. Could you give us an idea of what's going on there? Is it just a lesser renegotiation success with Gazprom, or in between the changes and the spreads although they have gone quite the opposite, so I can't quite reconcile that? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would, Johannes, I would take the third question to the sales and supply side. I think you rightly interpreted that, as being more an issue on let's say the market side than the procurement side. On the procurement, as we always indicated, we've made very significant &#x2013; some smaller contracts are still under our renegotiation, but we are very certain and comfortable that we will set, as the value has to be created on the market side, and that is also the principle of the contract. And there with the well supplied market, the lower value of flexibility as you indicate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:39) goes to breakeven then the hopeful of &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;300 million which we still would believe possible in normalized market. But at this time, at this point in time with such an amount of oversupply and the demand destruction of gas to power, which doesn't seem possible in the near future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your first two questions, flexibility on CapEx. Just a preliminary assessment on this, because as you can imagine; this is one of the key items that we are working through as part of the ongoing planning process. But I would say for the, very early years, meaning 2013 and to some extent also 2014, there's probably just some 20% to 30% of flex in that that number increases probably to around 50% when you go further out. Always bear in mind that in particular our grids &#x2013; in our grid businesses, there is a substantial regulatory requirements for investment and partially our investment program is part of say five year plans that have been agreed with the regulators where we then entered into commitments that need to be honored. One of the reasons, by the way, why we last year saw central networks because that was the business which we expected to be cash flow negative until the end of the decade.</p>
          <p>So there is going forward at some stage of course flex, but we are just not in a business where you can decide we will stop investing in many of our businesses, it means you can do that, but then you lose the concession which is not exactly what makes sense. And I believe your second question was, when do we think will operating cash flow cover CapEx and dividends if I got the question right. Look, I prefer to not yet comment on that. This is certainly something that is crucial for us in terms of managing that at that metric. But before I speculate here this is also something where we need to &#x2013; we need to first explore our plan and on that basis then we can make statements by when we expect free cash flow to then be positive.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Bobby Chada by Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. My first question was about hedging. You've helpfully as usual showed your outright hedge position in the back-up slides. You've effectively fully hedged for 2013 and 2014. Can you give us some idea of what your overall clean dark spread and clean spark spread hedge position looks like even if it's just in broad terms across your portfolio?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the E&amp;P outlook for next year, there are lots of moving parts, it's not clear to me whether that's actually deteriorated versus the message you gave us in August or whether it's kind of in line with the same message that you gave in August, perhaps if you could give us some feel for production profile for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me start with your second question on E&amp;P. I hope this is actually not different to what we said, because I would say this is mainly the numbers are unchanged there and we &#x2013; as I mentioned before, we do expect for the overall production next year relative to what we have anticipated a year ago. So I think this is one important data point to understand also some of the deviation relative to the guidance we have &#x2013; we had out so far. We do expect a drop in production between 7 million and 9 million Boe in our non-Yuzhno Russkoye assets.</p>
          <p>Yuzhno Russkoye, this year is at a level of around 38 million Boe and this is a level that also going forward plus or minus one, I would say is realistic. The European portfolio in 2012 for the full year will come out around 6 million plus in terms of production. We expect that to increase to and I rather give you a range here to something like 20 million to 25 million Boe. The biggest single driver here, of course is Skarv, which we expect to be north of 10 million next year, and with only very, very de minimis contribution from a few weeks in December of this year.</p>
          <p>So those would be the main metrics that hopefully helped a bit. I think your first question related to the spread hedge ratios, I mean that's always a tricky number, because in essence the percentage we're giving is relative to the economic generation and economic generation, the 100% depends on where the spreads are, which is why this is a modestly meaningful metric 2012 fully hedged 2013 probably north of 60% in 2014, around 40% as it relates to the spreads we prefer to not communicate those numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me Bobby add two things on this. First of all the numbers that Marcus mentioned, I mean referring as he said to a radically low economic generation particularly with regard to the spark spreads. And secondly there are also considerable differences as you certainly will know by market. So in Germany, the liquidity two, three years out is much higher than the southern Europe's. So in Germany and UK for example, there is more opportunity to hedge all, for example dark spreads more time in advance whereas in Southern Europe typically the market that'll not allow you to hedge out much more than one year in advance.</p>
          <p>So you also need to differentiate them market by market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. But the 60, roughly 60 and 40 that you quoted are for your overall portfolio rather than just your Central European generation portfolio. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, excluding Russia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon to everybody. The first question relates to the dividend. Just wonder if you could explain your thinking around maintaining the promise on the 2012 dividend yet putting everything up in the air the 2013 onwards it seems to me that given the magnitude of the potential impact on your 2013 guidance to pay 1.1 in 2013 will take you well above the top end of the 60% range, and as a consequence why didn't you move to cut the 2012 dividend? And then the second question is hopefully an easy one, and that could you just give some indication of the overall magnitude of the coal tax in the Netherlands that you've been referring to? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question, if you look on our outlook for 2012 for net income, underlying net income, we see a payout of 110. We are fully in the original indicated range of 50 to 60 and rather to the lower end. And there is no reason whatsoever why we should then not honor our obligations there. And we always had indicated that we saw the one event that was very meaningful for us was the renegotiation of the big contracts with Statoil and Gazprom. That forced us to have a very higher payout ratio in 2011, and there is no reason after receiving that why we should not share that with our investors and therefore there is no question whatsoever with our Chairman, our Board that we will not honor that. For 2013 onwards and the question is, since this is let's say a normalized year almost, disposals would have been predominantly completed, renegotiations will have happened. We will see the reality of the markets then and then we have to readjust all our numbers and decide forward moving the appropriate policies, but for 2012 there is no reason to expect any worries for that, and the Dutch number <mark type="ph" /> Marcus (55:02).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Two more comments on first coal tax around &#x20AC;50 million and then I need to go back to the previous question that Bobby asked just to because I said this is related to our entire European portfolio. The numbers I gave you are related to the UK, Benelux and Germany in total. So it excludes the markets that Marc mentioned such as Italy and Spain with much lower the liquidity just to make sure that is not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just quickly follow-up on the answer to the first question and I totally understand what you're saying there. But you obviously had a bad news day yesterday evening, clearly now with this dividend potentially being <mark type="ph" /> up (55:54) in the air, you're running a risk of another bad news day potentially a few months down the line and I just wondered why we didn't move to try and get all that bad news out of the way in one fell swoop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, we decided that we fitted appropriate within a year of underlying net income in the range we reported and doesn't give any reasons to lower the dividend payment for that year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can add one more thought here. Our previous intention on the &#x20AC;1.10 was as I think we've always made that clear also driven by the consideration that we thought &#x20AC;1.10 is long-term or medium-term a number that can also be achieved within our 50% to 60% payout ratio range. We see that at risk and we need to reflect on the overall picture before then putting out something for 2013. So also the years there after will have an influence on how we think about it as was the case last time.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions from me. Firstly, you have a sense for when you might actually sort of reach for bottom in terms of the profitability of your spread generation business in Europe? I mean is it going to be in 2013, or will we have to wait until sort of 2015 for that to stop deteriorating? So I'll be interested in your views there. And then secondly could you give us some comments on the outlook for gas storage profitability in Germany please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is a difficult one, because it feels a little bit like we had thought we have reached the bottom in the past and we still haven't. There was a thought that less PV would be built this year in Germany given that subsidies have been reduced, in fact the opposite seems to be true. So it's in &#x2013; the train doesn't stop, it even seems to accelerate and that is obviously eating not only into the spreads, but it's also in particular eating into the number of hours the plants are producing which is why I'm a little bit shy to actually come up with a firm view as to when the bottom of the spread generation has been reached. I think what we observed is that on &#x2013; as it relates to CCGTs all across Europe, many of them are not producing. I would almost dare to say none of them is earning its cost of capital.</p>
          <p>Can it get worse? I think one lesson learnt from the last several years, never say that that cannot be the case, because that might happen. And it's difficult to see how more negative to clean spark spreads can get, because I think the markets where we see the highest is still only &#x20AC;2, &#x20AC;3 and it dropping further, as I mean at some stage, if it's all at zero where there will be no production. So I would say at least &#x20AC;12, &#x20AC;13, we are very close to the bottom. But I would not dare to say more.</p>
          <p>On the gas storage, what we mentioned here is that we see this year basically a lower value from the flexibility of these assets which is maybe to some extent driven by the overall weaker economic activity in Europe. But also driven by there being more flexibility in the overall gas system, be that in the long-term contracts, that the various markets participants have, be it with the existing, by now existing gas, re-gas capacity, all of that is providing flexibility to the system. And hence the flexibility value of storage we have seen to come down the impact we're seeing this year, as I mentioned for the full year can be sort of around &#x20AC;200 million, maybe a little bit less.</p>
          <p>And as long as the overall market circumstances stay as they are today and quite frankly we at least don't think that the European economy next year will grow by 3% to 5%, but rather a much lower number. So we would expect this negative development to also spillover into at least in the near future meaning the next one or two years. What the work will look like thereafter, I think we will very much be driven by how the overall economy is going to perform.</p>

          <p>May I add for, for example, gas-fired power plants that we will take two substantial, two big ones off the market, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:01:15) and Germany. One of those for example has produced only nine days this year for 87 hours, that was it, and before we announced the closure of the plants, we were approached by the TSO, as opposed by the regulator and that they will take these plants in for a limited period. We will still declare them off the market, as they will never return to the market, and they will only be left to the TSO for emergency purposes on their costs. That's in the first step I would say, it's roughly 1,000 megawatt of tonnes that will leave the markets now. But costs will be reimbursed by the regulator and the TSO.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. First question, a bit outside, can you perhaps quantify the likely <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:23) of the nuclear provision at the end of the year with potentially a lower discount rates given that I assume that you revise that once a year. The second thing, do you still view the three times debt factor at the right level given your new assessment of your business risk profile. Is three times &#x2013; is the level to be reached for your debt factor? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the analysis will have to be done whether that we look at long-term, an average long-term interest rates. So the impact of the current environment, I mean, there is some but its limited. We will have to do the analysis whether that will have an impact or not. Also please always bear in mind that we have also then to look at the cost sides of the nuclear provisions. So it's too early to say whether there is going to be an impact. What I dare to say is if there is one, this will not impact our ability to come out in the overall EBITDA guidance. So if that is any concern to you that I think I can take away.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the debt factor targets, we still believe that long-term three times is the right leverage. We now need to see how quickly we can get to that number. This is also something which will be then driven by the outcome of our planning activities in the coming weeks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. It's &#x2013; well related to the last question in a way. Looking at that leverage factor, it would appear that on rough numbers that from 2013, it will be in a similar position to 2012, but sort of high 3s and do you think that therefore you can get back to three times purely through measures such as CapEx and the additional disposals that you've mentioned and can you therefore roll out any additional capital measures whether they'd be hybrids or rise issues?</p>
          <p>And then secondly again related, given the capital constraints that you're talking about and wanting to do less capital more value. How do you judge your expansion internationally today versus when you made that decision a year or so ago, so I'm talking here about LATAM, India et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the LATAM one, I think it's exactly an example where we are definitely more careful of how much we lend our balance sheet. For example in the Brazilian exercise, a significant part of all investments have being funded by the BNDS sort of public bank. And then we share 50% and 50% of the remaining equity. So the exposure is limited and giving us access to a very significant pipeline and we can almost manage that according to our needs. And such more careful exercise you should expect for any step you would take, that we don't look on outright exposure, but rather would restrict our exposure in an intelligent manner so we can grow the position, enjoy the pipeline harvest from the capabilities but not over leverage our balance sheet. And to the other question Marcus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As I said long-term three times is to the number that we think we should be targeting. We've pointed out in the past months that we've seen the rating agencies take a harder stance on this sector as such in terms of the business risk profile they attribute to the sector, which is why we also need to think through whether we will always immediately follow of what they are saying or whether and understand what the impact and on our businesses if were to do so, or whether we would just take some more time to achieve those targets. That is part of the exercise that we are doing right now.</p>
          <p>Our focus here is as I believe we mentioned before to work on the CapEx side and to make sure that we get the operating cash flow rights. Those are two main levers next to the completion of the disposal program that we see as our means to take down the indebtedness of the company.</p>
          <p>Again, when you look at what we've done so far on the debt sides, it mean just a few years ago looking at the net financial debt of our company. We have twice the number that we have today. So we are &#x2013; I think so far we've shown that we managed to bring down the debts, I admit at the same time we've seen a substantial earnings deterioration given the market circumstances that Johannes spoke about. But over the medium-term we are still convinced that we will be able to get our metrics into the target zone related to our rating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would almost support &#x2013; like to support that if you look, we have &#x20AC;30 billion net financial debt and we are now first time below &#x20AC;15 net financial debt, that the pension obligations get readjusted every quarter with spot index rate is two and is influencing our numbers, but here then the quality of the debt and the tenure of the debt is different to financial debt. Therefore, we believe we have made significant progress on that part. As Marcus said, we'll continue to manage that position proactively.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A technical comments on the pensions. When you've seen that the interest rate has come down very materially, that I believe is the case for almost all European companies, but they all don't necessarily apply the same logic there. The standard that we're applying is we're looking at a portfolio of AA rated corporate, that basket, that portfolio is actually coming down in the sense of number of players within that portfolio quite dramatically.</p>
          <p>And I think there are reasons to argue why the overall rating category needs to be looked at in a different way. There is initiative driven all across Europe from large corporates that the accounting standard here needs to be revisited, and we need to see whether there is going to be an impact or not on our provisions. Going forward, I actually would expect and I think that would be a more appropriate reflection of the nature of this debt that there will be some relief in the foreseeable future on that specific component, i.e., provisions to come down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I also have two questions. First on disposals, the revised target of &#x20AC;17 billion implies &#x20AC;4 billion more of proceeds and &#x20AC;800 million EBITDA impact would seem a very low sort of multiple for the targeted proceeds, less than five times versus your run rate which is around 10 times. Can you help us understand why the targeted proceeds are so low for those remaining assets? And then possibly on a post disposal base, can you give us a feel for what the maintenance CapEx would be of E.ON?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, what the &#x2013; on a post disposal basis, what would the maintenance CapEx be, so without growth? I'm not asking for a CapEx forecast, I'm just asking for what would maintenance CapEx be as a group on a post disposal basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I mean first on the overall &#x2013; on the disposal, I think what we said was we will likely be around &#x20AC;17 billion and the overall dilution effect on the EBITDA from that in total will be around &#x20AC;2 billion. I would say <mark type="ph" /> this is &#x2013; first observation, this is (1:12:03) extremely in line with what we communicated in November of 2010. And I think that also is in particular reflecting on the pricing environment in the last two years and the current pricing environment, this is not such an overall &#x2013; this is not such a bad outcome.</p>
          <p>When we look at further disposals, please also bear in mind that in particular when you look at the German regional distribution companies, there is always a large share of minorities in those and that has an impact on the metrics here. So, we deconsolidate the full EBITDA, but when we partially actually sell 53% in the company, so that is &#x2013; that has a material impact on the metrics here.</p>
          <p>Maintenance CapEx going forward post those disposals, again, we are in the process of kicking every number here, but it is probably somewhere around &#x20AC;500 million to &#x20AC;600 million for the group.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. The first question is on cost cutting, you're a little bit ahead of schedule for 2012 with &#x20AC;200 million, I think you're guiding to zero. Does that mean that the &#x20AC;600 million you've suggested in the past for 2013 is now conservative and maybe the &#x20AC;1.5 billion for 2015 also conservative. I mean could you be launching E.ON 3.0 as a result of what's happening in the market? That's first question.</p>
          <p>And secondly on thermal plants, can you give us a very rough idea of what the fixed costs could be for those plants which currently are out of the money and which might still remain open in 2013 basically to try to understand what the potential upsize could be from closure? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can already answer the second question. That number, I don't have readily available here, sorry. On EON 2.0, I don't know. Johannes, do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think with all the bad news, I still would take the credit that we are the most aggressive in the sector to cut costs, and significant amount of people already have left the company by now much earlier than expected and the progress is a bit ahead of schedule. But it's much too premature to believe that the target will be higher than initially seen. We will strive for receiving it as early as possible, but we stick to the guidance that we already handed out. We will challenge that in the course of the process now until we come back to you, but if we can beat it a bit, we would always try to beat it a bit, but I don't think &#x2013; it's much too premature to speculate on a new program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. So I have to make one correction. The &#x2013; my answer to the question that Deborah asked was &#x20AC;600 for maintenance CapEx going forward. It didn't include all our businesses, the number will be higher. It's more around &#x20AC;1 billion. Sorry for that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Firstly, on the impairments you have carried out and detailed already, does that mean that that is the full process which you had to do for the new medium-term planning, and that from that perspective, it is unlikely that anything else is going to come between now and January?</p>
          <p>And secondly, when you talked about the plant reviews, I think, Johannes said that two gas plants are now leaving the market. I think that initially you were targeting three, and apart from that, you have said earlier this year that you basically constantly have all plants under review. So, the overall 1 gigawatt for the moment in the current environment might be just a starting point, anything you can comment there? And finally, sorry to come back on that with the maintenance CapEx, is that then correct that the &#x20AC;1 billion now compares to what has been in earlier times roughly &#x20AC;2.1 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, the 1,000 megawatts that I've talked about is not the full program we are pursuing. We have announced plant closures in addition to that in France. We've announced plant closures in the U.K. And we are challenging further stations in Germany. So this is not the end of any story. This is &#x2013; these stations that we would have closed now and that were booked by the TSO and all costs plus all risks being financed now by the TSO, <mark type="ph" /> there is only the (1:17:57) specifics of that, and actually we were never targeting much more than that to be taken up by the TSOs.</p>
          <p>So that is the number close to the number we expected. There is no other plant that we see at this point that would go under special regime or other plants we are free to close if we deem it necessary, and obviously the TSO doesn't also see any need for any other plant to stay open, anything else is in the pure discretion of the management and will be decided whenever we see a loss-making situation occurring.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your maintenance CapEx question, I mean the pure maintenance to the best of my knowledge we've never said would be north of &#x20AC;2 billion. It was always around &#x20AC;1.3 billion to &#x20AC;1.5 billion, and that is what you need to &#x2013; need it to compare to &#x2013; what you need to compare it to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean impairment, this is the announcements that we now have done. What has not yet happened is &#x2013; what is still outstanding is the goodwill impairment test which is being conducted in Q4. I don't have the expectation that that will have a material impact. What can always happen is that when you sell an asset, that today may not necessarily always then be aligned with all the value attributed to that asset, because there's partly some old goodwill that has been allocated also to some of our existing assets, and that we will then see if and when we announce the transaction and then we will expend it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions, clarifying Marcus what you answered to Deborah about the slightly misleading EBITDA multiples for the remaining disposals. It looks like your minority interest expense this year is approaching &#x20AC;400 million. Can you give us an idea of how much of that refers to the German <mark type="ph" /> discourse (1:20:19) you are planning to sell?</p>
          <p>And the second question for your Johannes, you said 2013 looks more or less like a steady state earnings year with a few pluses and minuses maybe, and I wondered whether you still see the need of coming up with a 2015 guidance when you do your medium-term planning? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is too early to answer. We will look into that, if that is appropriate and it fits to the market. 2013 is obviously not burdened anymore by a specific situation like the Gazprom type of situation. I would not yet call the E&amp;P situation as normal business. The significant delays of production that we see there &#x2013; Marcus, I think has made very clear that we'd have no doubt that the gas and oil fields that we own have the potential to deliver the number that we originally thought for, but not in 2013. So, there will be some special burdening of the normal processes in 2013 in the E&amp;P side, but there is no specific hangover situation like with gas renegotiations.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon. On your cost guidance, you're ahead apparently on your E.ON 2.0 program, which implies at least some additional benefit to 2012 that you didn't expect earlier. Also you're 35% ahead year-over-year, but you still thought you expect 2012 rather to be in the middle of the range instead of what might imply by strong nine months performance at the upper end. Is it because you're expecting a further weakening in the business trends already this year impacting numbers or is it because you are possibly overachieving on disposals and you take the scope effect into account here as already?</p>
          <p>Second question would be on your disposal program, could you maybe elaborate on the general level of interest you have in those assets and maybe differentiate for interest in Germany and abroad?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the level of interest, Marcus, is not too bad. There are some assets that sometimes almost has a unique buyer. For example, our regional distributors we co-own with groups of communal and municipal shareholders, those are the initial partners to talk to and we have a process going on with them that appears to be very fair and balanced.</p>
          <p>Of other assets, we have shown for example, OGE, we have a very, very nice interest and a very constructive competitive process. So, all the assets where we are expecting open process, we see significant and sufficient interest. And the German regionals I would say are unique and specific, but that doesn't mean that we sell them below value.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The fourth quarter, Ingo, please bear in mind OGE is no longer contributing as we have said basically from Q1 onwards, we will see a bit of a weird development in our UK sales business, which had a spectacular Q4 in last year. It had a spectacular Q1 this year and we will have an extremely weak Q4 this year. That's mainly driven by this regulatory obligations to invest into energy efficiency and clean energy, and then also the very poor or not so great result on the E&amp;P side is the &#x2013; is another factor that is explaining why Q4 we do expect to be fairly weak.</p>

          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon everyone. Just a quick follow-up question in terms of the leeway at your disposal to get the debt factor down. Even a question was asked whether you would consider hybrid bonds at all thinking the positive you saw, the market wasn't big enough for them to make a difference for a company the size of your balance sheet, I just wondered if you could just give us a follow-up on your view on that particular asset class? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Look, this is not the time to speculate about a specific financial instrument. I would &#x2013; and honestly speaking, hybrid is not going to swing the needle for us here. Our focus has to be on those items that have an immediate impact on our debt situation, which repeating myself is CapEx and is operating cash flow and those are the two that we're focused on.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I mean, we've talked around the subject quite a lot, but I just wanted to check in when you're undertaking your review, that you still will be aiming to keep a single A rating. I know some of your competitors are now <mark type="ph" /> in the height for B space (1:26:37) and you have been pushing down your debt for a number of years. I'm just wondering whether you are happy to carry on trying to do that or you might move your goal on the credit side? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I have no reasons to target a lower rating. I mean we target to maintain our rating. There is no change to that, full stop.</p>
