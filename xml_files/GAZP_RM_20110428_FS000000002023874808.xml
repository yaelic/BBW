          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. We are happy to welcome you at another teleconference dedicated to the disclosure of the consolidated financial reports by Gazprom during 2010 and prepared in compliance with IFRS.</p>
          <p>My name is Andrey Kruglov. I am the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and the Head of the Financial and Economics Department. And please allow me to introduce our participants here. Today with me, and we have the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and the Senior Accountant of the Company, Elena Vasilieva; as well as the representatives of the Departments of Economic Appraisal and Pricing; the Accounting Department; External; the Economic Relations; Marketing; and Gas Processing and Liquid Hydrocarbons; Financial and Economics Department; Gazprom Exports; and Gazprom Energoholding.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind us that for the purpose of this teleconference we have prepared a presentation which is available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, our interaction will be organized in the following way: I will first comment on the main operational results, particularly I will dedicate time to the results of the Gas business and the Group. And the second part of our presentation, our Senior Accountant, Elena Vasilieva, will elaborate upon our financial results as well as other results in our report. In conclusion, I will just say a few words about the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>So let us move over to the financials, please. In 2010, the net profit, which is attributable to the shareholders of the Company Group are 24%, up to RR 969 billion. The net cash flow amounted to about RR 420 billion, having grown four times compared to 2009. During Q4 of 2010, the net cash flow remains positive and amounts to RR 47 billion.</p>
          <p>The cash from operational activities grew by 64% in 2010 and amounted to RR 1.1 trillion. The net debt grew down by 57% by the end of 2010 compared to the beginning of the year and the relationship between net debt and adjusted EBITDA went down from 1.26 by the end of 2009 to 0.64 by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Now, let's move over to the next slide. Comparing to the valuation on 31st of December 2010 and the proven and probable reserves of the hydrocarbons in the Group grew by 3.7 barrels of oil equivalent, primarily because of inclusion into the appraisal on the PRMS standards. Of these, total reserves of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:06) Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we are maintaining growth of reserves as a result of exploration work in a number of fields which are currently undergoing international audits. As is viewed in slide number 5, changes in the production of gas quarter-on-quarter overall complied with an excess of demand in the main market. Growth of the production of gas in Q4, 2010 amounted to 38% which can be explained by seasonal factors, the results of the output of oil and gas condensate quarter-on-quarter changed insignificantly.</p>
          <p>In slide number 6, you can see the balance of work <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:51) gas transportation system that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (03:53) in the chart of the physical movement of gas through the trunk pipeline system rather than commercial operation of the Group and I will have to underscore that specifically.</p>
          <p>In 2010, the amount of gas which had been transported through the gas transportation system grew as a result of the growing</p>

          <p>...which could not because of our fault, but nevertheless, I am hopeful that no technical problems will be in the way for us to continue this meeting and the exchange of views. Clearly something understandable is happening with communication lines because we're getting calls from our investors, from our counterparts and the analysts who are not able to get connected, but I do hope that in the course of today's meeting, we will have an opportunity to still be in touch so as to be able to answer all your questions.</p>
          <p>Now, let me resume, please. So we're going back to slide number 6. In 2010, the demand of transported gas grew, which was supported by the gas transportation system as a result of the growing demand in Russia and the former CIS former Soviet Union countries. The growing demand was driven primarily because of the growing production of Russian gas in Q4, 2010 compared to the similar period in 2009. There occurred a substantial growth of revenue from the sale of gas in all markets: in the Russian market by 12%; in the former Soviet Union countries by 90%; in Europe and other markets by 16%.</p>
          <p>The growth of revenue in Europe and in the Russian market happened because of the growing prices, whereas the volumes slightly went down in Q4 of 2010 compared to Q4 of '09. The biggest growth of revenue from sale of gas into these former Soviet Union countries happened because of the growing prices by 50% and the growing sales by 15%.</p>
          <p>Please move over to slide number 8. The commentary that I want to say about the structure of the gas deliveries, the shipments in the reporting year remained in the structure of consumption of gas inside Russia. In 2010, the biggest of shares still is with the power sector, which is about 29%; whereas in 2009, it was 39%. Households, 19%; in 2009, 16%. Utilities, 15%; in 2009, that share was 12% with utilities. The industrial consumers and primarily the households are mostly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:02). The biggest share in the structure of the consumption of gas in the former Soviet Union markets like previously is Ukraine 52%, and Belarus 31%.</p>
          <p>In the structure of consumption of gas in European markets, Germany remains the biggest share; the share of Poland grew, the share of France remained, while the share of UK, Turkey <mark type="ph" /> indiscernible (10:22) slightly went down by that 1% to 2% because of a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:27) of some of the volumes they could pay to later periods. Based on the results of INTERCONNECTOR, it can be seen that the so-called problematic markets of the former Soviet Union countries grew their acquisitions, traditional importers in Europe, practically remained acquisitions intact.</p>
          <p>And with that I would like to complete the first part of my presentation and pass the microphone over to Elena Vasilieva, Senior Accountant of Gazprom. Please, Elena.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Continuing to consider the results of activity of Gazprom Group in 2009, we should take a look at the structure of the revenue growth on sales and the basic factors driving the sales growth in slide number 9. The factor that's changing there in terms of sale of gas already has been considered in the presentation by Andrey Kruglov. So let us review sales in other segments.</p>
          <p>The revenue from the sale of gas and oil processing production grew by RR 169 billion or by 31%. Changes in this result was driven by the price growth for the gas and oil-refined products and the growing demands of sales as well as the <mark type="ph" /> fact (11:41) derived from the acquisition by Gazprom neft Group</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> (11:44).</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience. Please do not disconnect your line. Your conference will continue shortly.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> (12:01).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let us resume from slide number 10 and consider changes on some of the line items of operation expenses. The operational expenses to 2010 compared to last year grew by RR 348 million. The biggest relative changes occurred in the line items are the exchange rate differences from operations activities of which grew by 129%. Changes of exchange rates and the recalculation of the receivables denominated in hard currency led to the fact that during the reporting, the Group has earned the revenue in this particular line item as opposed to that being expansion in '09. As far as the cost per heating and electricity, this growth was 39%. This growth was driven by the growing consumption of electricity by the main producing entrance <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:43) into Gazprom Group as well as the growing <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:47) for electricity.</p>
          <p>The line items of goods for reselling including the gas and oil-refined products grew by 34%, which is first of all related to the growing oil prices and growing prices of refined products. The line items in wage payments grew by 34%. However, it should be noted that the main factor in because of this line item came from the reconsideration of the pension obligations of Gazprom Group because of the revaluation of the actuary assumptions as well as certain other liabilities growing from the collective labor agreements. Besides the wage growth came from the inclusion of TGC-1 into the consolidation perimeter and a certain growth of the average wage in various authorizing entities in the Group.</p>
          <p>On the next slide which is number 11, you may see that similar like in 2009 as well as in the reporting here, the Gazprom Group results were considerably affected by the results of the one-off transactions. In the reporting here that is with the revenue because of a divestiture from the share in Novatek company, and in '09, the profit because of the asset swap with Ruhrgas AG. Also considerable positive influence over the profit positions and was demonstrated by the associated companies. In the net profit, the figures in terms of the associated and jointly controlled companies, the biggest share falls upon such companies as Sakhalin Energy Investments Company Ltd. and the Gazprom <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:43) Group.</p>
          <p>Please allow me to conclude my part of the presentation and give the floor to Andrey Kruglov.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you now to switch over to slide number 12 where you can see the comparison of Gazprom Group with the 10 biggest oil and gas companies in terms of market capitalization. On revenue side, the results of the Group demonstrated that Gazprom is one of the global leaders in terms of absolute revenue and EBITDA, and net profit as well as in the growth of this figure during the past few years.</p>
          <p>Now, let's go over to the debt of Gazprom. The Company is maintaining the basic debt ratios at an acceptable level throughout the past few years which is evident on slide number 13. Production of the non-service total borrowing enabled to reduce our overall debt down to RR 1,300 million as of the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>At the same time, net debt didn't exceed RR 1 trillion. Changes in terms of reflecting of the banking assets of the Gazprom Group positively affected the level of debt. The ratio of the overall debt-to-EBITDA went down to 1, considering the results of 2010 the average in rate in terms of all of our borrowings was 6.8%.</p>
          <p>As one can see through the slide, in 2010 we were reducing our share of short-term debt by maintaining at the same time the share of the long-term borrowings which led to the increase of the mid-term debt positions up to 65% including the liabilities in terms of more obligations <mark type="ph" /> amounting to (19:25) two years. In terms of the currency structure, 89% are with the foreign borrowings and 11% with borrowings in rubles by the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide number 14 is where you can see the structure of our cash flow. In 2010 comparing our sales to 2009, the share of financial investments went down, the expenses for servicing debt went down, and dividend payment grew the ratio in terms of the cash flow from operation activities to capital expenses in 2010. As you can <mark type="inaudible" /> note on the slide, we're at a high level, which (19:57), enabled us in 2010 to create positive net cash flow.</p>
          <p>I'd like to say a few words about the situation in the gas market in Q1, 2011. Slide number 15 represents the dynamics of the amounts of production and sales of gas marked by market to the average figures of that particular event during the past few years. And you can see during the first three months of 2011, the production actually didn't change. It went down by 1% and continues to remain a little bit higher than the average figure of that particular nature during the past four years. However, I'd like to also note that during Q1 2011, they amounted to 142 billion cubic meters of gas, and the average for the last four years, 140 cubic meters.</p>
          <p>Very strong positive dynamics have been demonstrated by the volumes of the sales of gas for the former Soviet Union countries, and we noted them to be a little bit higher than the averages. For example, during Q1 2011, that figure was 29 billion cubic meters of gas while the average there in four years was 19 billion cubic meters. In Q1 2011, the amount of sales into Europe also grew by 12% compared to the similar period last year.</p>
          <p>The volumes of sales of gas in Russia changed not only comparing to the first quarter 2010. <mark type="ph" /> About 58 (21:24) of that, there was a reduction by 1% from 104 billion cubic meters in Q1 in 2010, up to 103 billion cubic meters in Q1 2011, but also it continues to remain a little bit higher than the average because the average we had in four years was 101 billion cubic meters.</p>
          <p>In summarizing this presentation, I would like to note the point saying that during 2010, we've observed an improvement of the economic environment in our key markets, which produced a positive effect of revenue from the sale of hydrocarbons.</p>
          <p>The profitability of sales in the Russian market also continues to become better. A considerable contribution into the improvement of this overall revenue came from the sale of oil and refinery products. Our power business also demonstrated good growth of revenue, which once again confirms the importance of diversifying the business operations.</p>
          <p>The concerns with respect to the possible includes from not traditional gas, gas <mark type="indiscernible" /> (22:18) natural gas upon the changing structure of the consumption in the European market turned out to be exaggerated. Control of operational expenses as well as increasing the net profit from associated entities enabled us to improve and increase our net profit, which is attributable to Gazprom shareholders, very strict work in terms of managing debt portfolio enabled us to further reduce our debt. The Company continues to generate considerable positive net cash flow.</p>
          <p>And summarizing the above mentioned, I'd like to say that in 2010, we've had quite a favorable situation and weakened new developing Gazprom. Also, the current market environment enabled us to state that in 2011, the EBITDA of the Company would grow by about some 20%.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention here. Let's jump in once again, I would like to open my apologies for technical problems. They happened not because of Gazprom's fault, but nevertheless, we feel that we should take some fault.</p>
          <p>So we're now ready to answer your questions. The time for questions and answers is 45 minutes. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Ron Smith calling here from Moscow at Citi. The question actually is a bit away from the actual fourth quarter looking into the &#x2013; what's going on right now. We had headlines today on negotiations with the Chinese, that you're still $100 apart. I was wondering if you could give us any insight into that.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The answers come from the Head of the Foreign and Economic Relations, foreign activities at present. We are currently in the state of negotiations with the Chinese counterparts in terms of the expected supplies of gas contract. In this particular point is about the delivery of gas through the western corridor. In April, there took place another round of commercial negotiations between two companies, and we are happy to note the progress achieved in &#x2013; on many items and we're about to converge our positions.</p>
          <p>I would similarly like to mention that in September of last year, we achieved considerable successes in being able to come closer to our understanding when the basic terms of the contract were discussed and expanded. And I believe that both sides are interested in completing the intergovernmental agreements and achieve the signing of the contract within the timeframe specified so as to start with supplies of gas to China. We are of the view that indeed there is a possibility to find a converging position in terms of pricing and we definitely foresee progress to be achieved on this issue. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The first question about the transaction with the Novatek shares, could you please say which part of the profit specifically was derived from the divested share from those particular shares in the Gazprom involvement? Which part was derived from the other accounting adjustments and are you going to evaluate that every quarter, or every year, so what will be the situation with that?</p>
          <p>The second question, as far as the write-off of the RUB30 billion was concerned, what is included in this particular line item and why every fourth quarter we note this particular write-off?</p>
          <p>And the third question about CapEx, what is going to be CapEx 2011 in terms of the operational revenue possibly in terms of the domestic market revenue will be, you know, adjusted accordingly. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] This particular topic was defined as the amount of fair value and would mean &#x2013; of the remaining 9.99% of this share on the date of the closing of the deal, which was RR104 billion plus the money which was received for the 9.99% of the share divested from which was RR57 billion minus the book value of 19.39% and the share in the equity of Novatek on the date of divestiture considering the accrued profit and the remaining from the consolidation of Novatek as an associated entity previously deemed as part of the consolidated profit which was RR84 billion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If &#x2013; one is to consider this particular transaction, it is necessary nevertheless to pay attention to the fact that for the purposes of reporting, that was a comprehensive transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a consequence we divested from the share which led to the fact that the company was no longer possible to consider any considerable influence in favor of NOVATEK and had to reclassify investments into this company from investments into associated entities into other long term investments which are available for subsequent divestiture.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so in this way changes in classification right now will require changes in our valuation approaches, whereas in the past we evaluated based on the historic value and on the basis of the historic grows now we'll have to evaluate based on the market value.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as your other question was concerned in terms of the loss of value in our reserves and the payments that traditionally Gazprom, in terms of that cost line item in Q4 were higher than during the previous one, which can be explained by fact that the majority of reserves are being created as a result of the inventory which is being done by the end of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also this year we run some very detailed tests with our auditors trying to confirm the re-pricing of our investments in terms of the cost into the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:25) which are reflected on the books of the company and because of that we have registered a loss, and also registered the impairment because of the investments in the Beltransgaz because of the changes in the market economics in the Belarus, and sooner that we have crated reserves for the receivables where, let's say, we thought that we didn't have a very good financial standing in our counterparties in the former Soviet Union countries such as Moldova and some parts of the southern regions of Russia.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as far as the third question is concerned in terms of the reconsideration of our CapEx program we are adjusting our budget and usually that takes place following the results of half year period because in the beginning of the year we are planning one type of scenario conditions and in the course of life they may change, therefore and certainly any budget, as an instrument of operational management, requires adjustments.</p>
          <p>The 2011 is not going to be an exception. We are planning &#x2013; considering the results of H1 to introduce certain adjustments into the budget still. However, in terms of what they will turn out to be, it is premature, and I'll say before they are approved, but one may definitely note that an increase of capital expenditure program for 2011 is not ruled out.</p>
          <p>And because of that, I would like to remind us that the 2012, as well as 2013, considering our plans of development for Gazprom, are going to be our peak years in terms of the amount of new commissioning and the capital investment volumes as far as our projects are concerned in the east of the country and as far as the development of the Yamal Peninsula is concerned and also as far as our new transportation projects are concerned. Therefore the possibility of reconsidering our capital spending towards increasing it is quite possible.</p>

          <p>Hi, hello. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:12) from BNP Paribas. First thank you for this presentation. My question is concerning the dividend policy. I saw you changed it a few months ago at the end of 2010 and I saw the main point was to increase the visibility in fact by stopping &#x2013; by taking into account investment regulation.</p>
          <p>So I would like to know why you decided to take into account a negative investment or reevaluation in your dividend amounts this year again and if you are not afraid that you will send a wrong signal to investors especially when you have so strong cash flows this year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So yes, indeed as far as dividend policy of Gazprom is concerned, we introduced certain changes into our dividend policy and this change was endorsed by the Board of directors and we at present are basically existing and working and living within the framework of this newly established dividend policy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the proposed amount of dividend payout is concerned, it does not at all contradict the dividend policy which Gazprom has had because that was the Management and the Board's decision.</p>
          <p>It complies with the declaration which the company has announced and I would like to say just to any possible signals in terms of absolute figures of payments which are going to be made and certainly if the shareholders accept the proposal about the specific size of the dividend payout, this dividend payments will become the biggest one throughout the whole history of the dividend payment back up from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:21) share, meaning to say that in our statements made previously that every year we will be planning these dividends out to our shareholders, this is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:32) definitely be trying to maintain.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:53) Thanks for the presentation. I have two questions, one is your &#x2013; on your renegotiation or the renegotiation the European utilities are willing to get from Gazprom. So where are you and where do you think this is going to finish? Is there any arbitration ongoing? And my question is on the European side but also on the Turkish side. I know you put everything together <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:21), but I like to split between the European companies on one side and Botash on the other side, if possible. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language] [indiscernible] (46:12) are continuing negotiating with a number of our European counterparts and simply because this is not an easy process and this is an ongoing process in which we are trying to do our best to take into account the interests of our partners as well as trying to stand up to our own interests. It is yet difficult to give you a precise indication as to what kind of pricing policy ultimately Gazprom will resort to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Still, we'd like to go back to the question of dividends. There are a couple of questions also about Nord Gas there and first of all, in terms of dividends, it is not yet clear when last year you were calculating the dividends and making adjustments, in terms of revaluation of profit from them. You have reduced your dividend calculation. In 2010, it looks like you did not adjust by &#x2013; the loss from revaluation so why is there such inconsistency? That is the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is about Nord Gas and specifically with respect to the fact that Novatek, being an entity interested in the requisition of this asset, but at the same time you did not use the possibility of the rights to buy it out as was originally proposed. Are you eventually intending to sell this asset and in what way? First of all, what are you being guided by in reselling the core asset, considering the fact that your production has continued to be declining.</p>
          <p>And the third question, could you be specific, we are seeing that the exports to Europe is growing but at the same time the production is declining, and constantly the volumes of the acquired gas are growing. So considering your forecasts for the exports into Europe at the amount of 150 billion cubic meters, what is the volume of gas that you are intending to acquire from independent producers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]. I will answer the first part of the question, I will have Mr. [ph] Sirotkin (53:04) take the microphone for the second. First of all, I'd like to say that [indiscernible] (53:09) proposed by the management board does not contradict the company's dividend policy and stays strictly within its framework.</p>
          <p>As far as the consistency or inconsistency is concerned in our accounting operations, we may definitely go back to what exactly the formulations and wordings are saying, and they interpret in different ways, but it says that the company will adjust this particular value. As far as specifics are concerned, the size of the dividend is the proposition. Once again I shall reiterate; coming from the management of the company to agree or disagree <mark type="indiscernible" /> (53:53) shareholder's meeting is a different matter because this particular value or figure hasn't yet been approved.</p>
          <p>The final amount of dividend is to be endorsed by the shareholders during the shareholders' meeting. Now the rationale and the justification for this dividend level proposed by the management board was that to the net profit and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:18) for the dividend payment as well as for the implementation of our investment program as well as our capital investment program, and which as I said, for 2012 and 2013 is expected to up a considerably bigger amount in terms of commissioning of new facilities.</p>
          <p>So, because of that, the management board suggested that this particular part of the profit should be dedicated to the dividend payment and for the balance of it to be reutilized for the capital expenditure program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] and now [indiscernible] (58:04) can give you answer to your two questions. The first one is about the Northgas shares, while the second question was about the balance of shipments of gas coming from the independent and from the exports [indiscernible] (58:18) and the expectations which we may formulate considering the results of Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>So first about Northgas. Here, we are dealing with the two issues. The perpetual right is something that Gazprom does have to buy Northgas shares. But in fact, we were offered a different asset. We were offered to buy the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:40) company and you should agree that this is a slightly different kind of an offering in terms of subject matter <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:48). This is first thing.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we naturally undertook the valuation of the price, which the owner of the 49% share of stock <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:59) and we came up to a concerted decision that at the price offered, this particular transaction, as far as Gazprom is concerned, is not effective. And I would like to underscore yet again that in this particular case, we were not talking about using the right of first refusal that Gazprom has to buy the Northgas shares but rather about the proposition to spend RR 1.5 billion to buy the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (59:28) company.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the exports are concerned and the share of the independent producers of gas in Russia something that we are seeing in 2011, yes indeed, we must say that we are planning to have some very good growth in our export volumes through 2011 compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>And first of all, the growth in these deliveries is going to be driven by Gazprom's gas and particularly by the Russian-produced gas. It is no secret to anyone that the part of our export, we are able to deliver by using the gas which we acquire from the Middle Asian countries.</p>
          <p>And as far as the gas coming from the independents is concerned, the production by the independent producers has also been growing during the past few years, and we are observing the trend of a more active actors on the part of the independent producers to the Russian market with direct shipments of gas to the consumers in the Russian market.</p>
          <p>But this is a general policy, which is pursued by the government with respect to the development of the gas industry and the development of competitive environment in terms of the deliveries of gas to the consumers in Russia. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language]. The question comes from Barclays Capital. Thank you very much for the presentation and I have two questions if I may. The first one, are you expecting any increase in your drilling cost in 2011 because of the divestiture from Purgas Company? And the second question, have you noted any speeding increase of prices for all services overall during the first quarter because of the growing prices for oil and gas, and what kind of measures you are planning in order to mitigate this growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] [indiscernible] (63:35) try and answer this question. The first one was &#x2013; I would cover two aspects as far as the first question is concerned. We are not planning to reduce our expenditures for exploration drilling which we are currently pursuing, I mean, the Gazprom Company or Gazprom Corporation in 2011 compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>And as far as the average costs are concerned in drilling, we calculated per one meter of drilling, yes indeed, we are undertaking some serious efforts in order to be able to drive this average cost down. But they are rather related to our organizational and economic activities rather than the sale of the drilling company which is acting as our contractor. So, that is the answer to the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And [indiscernible] (65:30) representing Finance and Economics Department answering the second part of the question. As to the second question, I would simply like to know that as of January 1 almost all the works and services are subject to tenders which is a well-proven and transparent procedure which is defined both by the terms and conditions written into the project which we prepare in advance as well as the market environment and various offers and the availability of competition as far as all kinds of all services are concerned. We, as a result, already have set all proposals and the winning bidders which...</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Inaudible" /> (66:10).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for your patience. Please, do not disconnect your line, your conference will continue shortly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize again for the disconnection which again occurred, so we would want to resume our Q&amp;A session by repeating the last answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] [indiscernible] (68:17) from Finance and Economics Department is saying that as of January 1 effective all of the works and services are being tendered. And this is a well proven and transparent procedure which is being defined by both the terms and conditions which are written into the contracts and projects as well as the market environment and various offerings and proposals and the availability of competition and as far as all kinds of &#x2013; all services are concerned. So as a result, we really have a set our proposals and an ability to select a winning bidder which in majority of cases is chosen based on pricing. So in this case, these are the results of the tenders which already have been run which do identify the improvement in terms of the pricing positions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Yeah, ladies and gentlemen, considering the fact that we have been cut short by some technical problems, we have time remaining for two concluding questions. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Karen Kostanian [Merrill Lynch Securities (Moscow Office)]. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] The question is what is the Middle Asian suppliers' share in the export volumes in Q1 as well as the RosUkrEnergo share in that? And what is the outlook you may have in terms of what this share will be throughout the whole of 2011?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about Ukraine, in terms of how the negotiations are progressing with regard to JV and will there be any additional negotiations about the gas price for Ukraine this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] So in terms of this first question, the share of the middle Asian gas in our export, principally speaking, will remain in 2011 at the level of 2010. And in terms of the specific figure is going be about 35 [ph] million (71:42) cubic meters.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as the second question is concerned about the share of RosUkrEnergo in accordance with the Stockholm Arbitration ruling is going to be [ph] 12 million, 12,000,100 (72:10) to be exact.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And this is the figure representing the return of gas by RosUkrEnergo.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as negotiations on setting up the JV is concerned, they are currently underway, and basically no specific results or final agreements have been achieved. And currently we have signed a memorandum to establish another joint venture which will be dedicated to the production of the coal-bed methane in the territory of Ukraine.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language] And as far as pricing negotiations are concerned principally that basically is equivalent to the common relationship between the buyer and the seller because the buyer believes that the price is too dear while the seller that it is too low. The media, every now and then, mentions some kind of figures but we, at Gazprom, haven't yet received any specific request from the Ukrainians past to reconsider the price for our shipments of gas to Ukraine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Thank you very much and now the final question please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Foreign Language] Go back to the comments stated in the beginning, stated you were able to reduce your debt burden and simultaneously improve your cash flow positions compared to what it was last year. So in this view what kind of plans the company is entertaining with respect to the &#x2013; in your cash flow in terms of what share will be dedicated to the capital investment or the capital expenditure purposes and what kind of plans the company is having in terms of anything that it may do in the borrowings in the market?</p>
          <p>Another question is about 2011, what are your expectations in terms of <mark type="ph" /> prices? What may happen do you believe (76:35) in the forthcoming period in the European market as far as the gas price is concerned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> As far as the utilization of cash is concerned that would be allocated to &#x2013; in some parts of the operational activities, meaning the capital investment are core activities which is production, transportation and the storage of gas as well as for our core activities with respect to the capital maintenance testing and diagnostics for which purposes we are well allocate and a part of the cash which we have.</p>
          <p>With respect to the level of debt our goal. Our strategic goal is inability to maintain the level of the correlation between debt and adjusted EBITDA. It's not more than the 1.5. And we can see that we were able to considerably improve this figure lowering it down to 0.6 at least in our immediate plans as far as our ability to maintain this ratio at the level of which I mentioned we would say would not go over one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question &#x2013; the final answer comes from Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> giving us a brief answer there. Before the end of the current year, we are expecting the prices to grow both in terms of the spot as well as the oil prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And additionally, I would like to remind that this is development from the investment <mark type="inaudible" /> department, our Chairman gave us a guideline which was quite a precise one meaning to say that the price by December of this year may perhaps go $500 for gas.</p>

          <p>Dear ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for attending this telephone conference. Once again I would very much like to offer to you our apologies for the technical problems, which occurred while we were trying to stay on the air. We were being helped by a U.K telephone operator. I won't put the name of this telephone company because I'm sure that everyone in the U.K is preparing themselves for the royal wedding and maybe part of the reason is to why these technical problems happened. And so tomorrow &#x2013; and that will be over, but that may improve, <mark type="indiscernible" /> work relation you on this forthcoming festivity.</p>

But traditionally, I should state that in case there are questions remaining you may forward them to us over here by sending an e-mail or by making a telephone call connecting to the International Markets department. And with that, we would be more than willing to give you the expected answers so once again thank you very much for your participation and we hope to continue meeting each other on the air.
