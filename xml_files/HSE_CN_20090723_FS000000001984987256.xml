          <p>Hello. This is the conference operator. Welcome to the Husky Energy Second Quarter 2009 Conference Call and Webcast. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Patrick Aherne, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brad. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our 2009 second quarter results. With us today are Mr. John Lau, President and Chief Executive Officer; Alister Cowan, Chief Financial Officer; Rob Peabody, Chief Operating Officer, Operations and Refining; and Terrance Kutryk, Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products.</p>
          <p>In today's call, John will discuss the financial results and give an overview of the operational highlights. Terrance Kutryk will provide an update on the Midstream and Downstream divisions. And John will then conclude at which time we'll open the call up for questions, starting with analysts, followed by the media.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick. Good afternoon to everyone. Lower commodity prices and crack spreads in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2008 impacted Husky's year-over-year earnings and cash flow.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, sales and operating revenues were 3.92 billion, compared with 7.2 billion in the second quarter of 2008. Earnings were 430 million, or $0.51 per share, down from 1.36 billion or $1.60 per share in the second quarter of 2008. Adjusted net earnings for the second quarter were 471 million, or $0.55 per share, compared to 1.4 billion or $1.62 per share in the same quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations of 833 million, or $0.98 per share, was down from 2.08 billion or $2.45 per share in the same quarter of 2008. Cash flow in the second quarter of 2009 was reduced by 252 million due to cash tax installments related to year 2008 earnings.</p>
          <p>The Upstream financial result was affected by lower realized commodity prices. The benchmark WTI oil price this quarter was down 52% from the same quarter in 2008, and the benchmark NYMEX gas price this quarter was down 68% from the same quarter of the prior year.</p>
          <p>In the first six months of 2009, Husky's sales and operating revenues were 7.57 billion, earnings were 758 million or $0.89 per share and cash flow from operations was 1.4 billion or $1.64 per share. On an adjusted basis, net earnings for the first six months were 816 million or $0.96 per share.</p>
          <p>Husky's production in the second quarter averaged 317,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with 2008 second quarter production of 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Total crude oil and natural gas liquids production was 225,000 barrels of oil per day in the quarter compared to 256,000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2008. Oil production was lower mainly due to Canada's East Coast subsea operational issues, general facility maintenance and reservoir decline.</p>
          <p>Natural gas production for the quarter averaged 552 million cubic feet per day, down from 618 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Total production for 2009 is expected to be within our production guidance range of 310 to 345,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Natural gas production for the year will be slightly lower than the bottom end of the guided range due to restrictions and reductions in capital expenditure on drilling and tie-ins.</p>
          <p>The company remains in a strong financial position. Total debt at the end of the quarter, net of cash and cash equivalents, was 2.35 billion compared with 1.04 billion at the end of 2008. Debt to cash flow and debt to capital employed ratios at June 30, 2009, were 1 time and 19.8% respectively.</p>
          <p>We are pleased to advise that Husky's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable on October 1, 2009 to shareholders of record on August 21, 2009.</p>
          <p>I would now like to highlight a few of the major projects that Husky advanced in the second quarter. Work continues on the development of the Sunrise Oil Sands Project. The Energy Resources Conservation Board, ERCB, has approved the Sunrise Oil Sands Project and approved project amendments on January 13, 2009. Sunrise is in an optimization stage to simplify the project's scope and to obtain proposals for major procurement and services in this current market environment.</p>
          <p>The enhanced oil recovery project at Gull Lake, Saskatchewan using alkyline surfactant polymer, ASP technology is being commissioned and commercial operation is expected in the third quarter. Husky has participated in several successful gas well tests in the Bullmoose &#x2013; Sukunka region of the North West &#x2013; of North East British Columbia. The Bullmoose d-64-B well and the Burnt River C-A61-A well, where Husky holds a 100% and 55% working interest respectively, have expected initial production rates in excess of 30 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.</p>
          <p>In Eastern Canada, development of the North Amethyst satellite tie-back is continuing on schedule. Specialized lift and installation vessels arrived at the North Amethyst location to begin the subsea installation work.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, the SeaRose FPSO, Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel, will undergo a 28-day shutdown for maintenance and modifications. In conjunction with the shutdown, the Southern Drill Centre field will be down for another 40 days for the North Amethyst tie-back project.</p>
          <p>The White Rose field satellite tie-back development remains on schedule for production in late 2009/early 2010 depending on the iceberg conditions. For the offshore China development, the West Hercules deep water drilling rig drilled and tested the Liwan 3-1-3, the second appraisal well on the Liwan discovery. The well tested at an equipment restricted rate of 55 million cubic feet per day with indications that well future deliverability could exceed 150 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>The West Hercules rig is currently drilling the third appraisal well, Liwan 3-1-4. Front end engineering and design work for the Liwan development is underway and first production is expected to be in the year 2012 to 2013 timeframe.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, the Transocean Adriatic XI shallow water rig has started drilling the first of two exploration wells on the East Bawean II Block.</p>
          <p>Terrance will now talk about the Midstream and Downstream divisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. Midstream infrastructure and marketing earnings totaled $53 million, compared to $86 million in the second quarter of 2008, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and natural gas trading contracts and lower pipeline blending differentials and brokering margins.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, we commissioned two new 300,000 barrel storage tanks at our Hardisty terminal, bringing Husky's total liquid storage capacity at Hardisty to over 2 million barrels. We are also nearing completion at the Hardisty terminal of the tie-ins and associated facilities for connection to the new Keystone Pipeline.</p>
          <p>While Husky's heavy oil production benefited from the very low light to heavy oil price differential in the quarter, Upgrader earnings in the quarter, at $2 million, were significantly impacted. The WTI to Lloydminster Crude Blend heavy oil price differential averaged U.S. $7.72 per barrel in the second quarter, down 65% from U.S. $21.95 per barrel in the same period in 2008. Lower Upgrading margins were partially offset by stronger Upgrading throughput and lower operating costs.</p>
          <p>Husky's U.S. refining segment generated $134 million in earnings in the second quarter, compared to $159 million in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The Lima refinery will undergo a planned maintenance turnaround in the fourth quarter of 2009. The refinery is in the last year of a five-year turnaround cycle. Our Canadian refined products division contributed $42 million of net earnings in the second quarter, up from $35 million in 2008. Asphalt sales were strong at $48 million despite lower production from the Lloydminster asphalt refinery, which underwent a scheduled 32-day turnaround in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call back to John for his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Terrance. Despite the weak economic environment, Husky did perform well in the second quarter due to its integrated operation. The company has a very healthy balance sheet and its financial position remains strong. For the remaining part of the year, Husky will continue to focus on safe and reliable operations and the development of its strategic capital projects.</p>
          <p>Back to you, Patrick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. That concludes the formal part of the call and we will be pleased to answer any questions that you might have. I will now turn it back to the conference operator.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question today comes from Harry Mateer of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. John, question for you first on the M&amp;A front, your comments in the past that Husky would be interested in potentially seeking out acquisitions and obviously the market has weakened over the past year or so and capital markets have been volatile. But with things seeming to be stabilize I'm curious if you could just give us a sense for what you're seeing right now in terms of M&amp;A market, whether is there anything interesting out there, sectors of market you might be interested in and also whether buyers and sellers are getting closer to a meeting point on transaction prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, for the &#x2013; Harry for the M&amp;A market it is about time actually some of the good deal come through and Husky is actually continuing to look at opportunity. We have identified some targets company. We feel that buying and selling side will come to a neutral point and so far I see the market is progressively getting a bit more stable. So I think within these few years that price will, everybody speculated they're going back up. So in the near term I am confident that Husky with some opportunity wait until these few months, we could decide <mark type="inaudible" /> order, we'd see whether we will continue to normalize this opportunity. Buying and selling actually depend on both sides, so is no use to be too cheap and the buyer, of course, will like to be much lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then in terms of cost, particularly with respect to oil sands, what are you guys seeing right now with Sunrise both in terms of material cost which I assume are coming down but also labor cost? We've heard from some &#x2013; from some other companies that labor costs are still sticky, just trying to get sense for what you guys are seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well for the Sunrise project we are pursuing options to reduce the cost under the current environment. There are minor modifications from the approved plan by the government. We are looking at further way to trim down the cost in terms of the equipment, labor and other associated facilities. I can add &#x2013; I shouldn't be anticipate or project any cost saving but since I indicate sometime in the annual report we are still looking at some cost differential between couple of years ago to today by about 35 to 40% reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Terry Peters of Canaccord Adams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. I've got two questions. One on the Downstream and one on the Upstream and I just wonder with the way the &#x2013; I think you made some passing comments in your release with regards to how refining margins were in the quarter being weaker yet your earnings were stronger in the refining and marketing and obviously that has something to do with FIFO inventory gains and some of your competitors isolate that. I am just wondering if you could give us an order of magnitude, is it 50 million or 100 million as to what that impact might be on your quarter or first half earnings in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Terrance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Terry, it's Terrance. With respect to the quarter, certainly what we've seen is crude prices increasing throughout the period. As you know, there is still significant volatility there as well. Also our accounting is on a FIFO basis which is consistent with IFRS and accordingly we don't separate the two out. There have also been changes in the Canadian, U.S. exchange rate over that period that also tend to impact those kinds of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So other than directionally we don't have an idea on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not something right now that we're disclosing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question then is on the Upstream. Two parts. First of all, just an update on Tucker as to whether that's producing. And that I know you mentioned that you're reviewing some plans and if under your review, you decide is there possibility or is it one of the possible outcomes that you shut that project down and write it off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. As far as we are concerned, Tucker actually is one of the best project. If you look at completion of the engine work and the whole facility is only $16,000 per production throughput. Today Tucker is producing in the range about 3 to 5,000 barrel per day. We had no intention to push it up yet because of volatility in the price, but definitely we will keep our option open. We expect for the whole year, we are still in at something around 5 to 6,000 barrels for the exit volume. The reason for that is during the capital allocation program, we slowed down all the capital expenditure or drilling activities for Tucker. So it is a good project. We like to look at the market before we continue to do more drilling in <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up on that, just two other questions on the Upstream is, do you have an idea for how the shutdown at White Rose is going to impact your Q3 production, is it straddle Q3, Q4, can you give any guidance on that? And then finally, I just want to have a question about Sukunka, Bullmoose as to what kind of planned capacity is available to you when you might actually be able to bring those gas wells on stream?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And Rob you want to answer the first or second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, thanks. Starting with Sunrise, just to give you a good sense of that, that we are shutting down the FPSO and the &#x2013; and all of the production on July 21st. On the 19th of August, we'll start up the &#x2013; we'll start up Central Drill Centre in the FPSO. And then on the 23rd of September, we'll start up the Southern Drill Centre. So it'll be back up on full production on the 23rd of September. And for the period between the 19th of august and the 23rd of September, we're going to be at sort of half rates with one of the drill centres down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. That's good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Sukunka, Bullmoose production, I mean we've got wells up there as was stated in the press release that can produce about 30 million a day, a 100% and 155% in another, 20% in another. And those wells we can tie in but there are facility, there's pipeline restrictions in terms of being able to develop &#x2013; produce them all on any given day. So the exact rate at which those will contribute to production is going to be dependent on facility limitations in third party pipelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. <mark type="Inaudible" /> your question asked about the production forecast for the White Rose, whether it will impact us or not. We already build that in, in our production guidance, that's why in the end-year announcement we say for the year production we're still within the production guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from William Lacey of FirstEnergy Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, William.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John, couple of question is for you. First of all, do you have anymore color on Liwan in terms of your thoughts on the value of maximization process since the last time you talked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Liwan field is doing very well for the appraisal. We will confirm our expectation and you can see <mark type="inaudible" /> we separate announce on the Liwan field. Liwan 3-1-2 and 3-1-3 are doing exceptionally well. And then the next one we are drilling another appraisal well. The result should come over in say, 30 days. So, we will quantify the resource base for this region. Of course, in that same time we expect to do another three to four exploration well in this year 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, what about the whole process that you're talking about that's potentially spinning this out of there, is this advanced at all since the last time you spoke?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And we are progressing review by various consultants and advisory especial on the tax side. The timetable haven't changed. We say we will be looking at that by the end of this year, the decision will confirm or not confirm subject to what assumption in the middle of next year. So, far this seem to be very receptive by every party and all the stake holders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. On the downstream slide, can you just talk a little bit more about Liwan, what you're going to be doing for the turnaround here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Liwan turnaround is a scheduled turnaround. The turnaround planning is well advanced and we're anticipating anything beyond the kind of scheduled timing that we talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was 30 days you said?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Correct.</p>
