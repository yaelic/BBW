        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon, and good afternoon and welcome everybody.  I believe our fourth quarter results are a clear indication of DIRECTV's strategy of focusing on delivering the best television experience with the highest quality and most valued subscribers is truly working well for us.  Our leadership in content, service and the key technologies that are dominating the television industry essentially HD and DVR which I clearly think are at the forefront of what is driving our business today, drove our fourth quarter results to an eight-year low in monthly churn of 1.42%, 275,000 net subscriber additions and an ARPU growth exceeding 8%.</p>
          <p>Our brand has never been stronger and we're making good progress in tackling some of our key challenges.  Pat will take you through the quarterly results in more detail in a couple minutes, so I just want to spend a few moments highlighting a couple things.  First, our quarterly subscriber growth was about more than just strength in a challenging and competitive marketplace.  We grew with quality subscribers, clearly one of the key factors driving the quality subscriber growth was demand for HD and DVRs which was -- which represented comfortably over 50% of our gross Q4 gross adds versus about a third of our gross adds a year ago.</p>
          <p>Another increasingly important factor was our direct sales force which is really becoming better and better at targeting the right customers and the right local market opportunities.  This direct sales channel generated well above 40% of our Q4 sales, and is quickly moving towards generating half of our new subscribers.</p>
          <p>Our 8-year low in churn was a particularly noteworthy accomplishment.  Our focus on advanced products and quality subscribers was again certainly important to our churn reduction.  However, equally important were our initiatives to limit risky customers through stricter policies.  We do recognize these policies cost us some subscribers, but it's a tradeoff we're more than willing to make.</p>
          <p>On the cost side of the business, I want to spend a minute on SAC [Subscriber Acquisition Cost] and upgrade spending.  SAC has obviously increased.  One of the forces driving SAC is the demand for advanced product overall and more specifically the HD DVR within that category.  It should be noted that up front revenue we receive to offset the cost of an HD DVR goes to revenue not as an offset to SAC, so I do think in some ways if you look at SAC on a net basis, it would present a different picture.</p>
          <p>The second factor in our increase in SAC is higher sales costs that have come with our goal of targeting the right customers.  The sales tools we use to target customers have a higher customer cost, but they more than payoff in the quality of customers generated.  We will continue to exploit opportunities to manage these pressures on SAC through hardware cost reductions and other efficiency moves, but the bottom line is that we feel our SAC is in the right place and we're investing intelligently in the right customer as I think our ARPU and churn numbers show.</p>
          <p>Regarding upgrade spending, we have seen upgrade spending exceed our expectations for quite a few prior quarters, largely due to demand for advanced products and once again within that category in particular demand for HD DVRs.  Demand for advanced products continued in Q4, although for the first time in a while we began to see these costs stabilize.  Q4 spending was below Q3 '07, which has really not been the case at least since I got here in '04, and furthermore, if you offset upgrade costs with up front revenue we receive at the time of upgrade, our 2007 Q4 upgrade spending was below our 2006 Q4 upgrade spend.  We do continue to view upgrade spending as primarily a revenue generating investment in quality subscribers, but we also believe we're beginning to get on top of the amount we're spending here.</p>
          <p>Other key costs were largely in line with expectations essentially headed in the right direction though not necessarily where we want them to be yet.</p>
          <p>The final area I want to highlight is Latin America where we had another really strong quarter.  Net subscriber additions more than doubled from a year ago to about 200,000 while maintaining an excellent 1.35% monthly churn.  ARPU grew 18% with revenue up over 40%.  Equally important to the financial result is that the success is not just a one country story of Brazil emerging from the merger but really across the board strength in countries like Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela.</p>
          <p>I might also add that these results in Latin America do not include our 41% ownership in Mexico which we do not consolidate where we continue to generate solid growth in subs, revenue and OPBDA [Operating Profit Before Depreciation and Amortization].</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Pat and come back to make a few months before closing out for questions.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chase.</p>
          <p>As you saw in our release, the rapid growth in consumer demand for HD and DVR services is having a material impact on both our top line and bottom line results.  Consistent with our results from recent quarter, we're attaining favorable financial benefits from customers purchasing advanced services, and this translates into better subscriber growth, ARPU, margin, and churn.</p>
          <p>Looking first at the top line, DIRECTV U.S. revenues were up 14% to 4.4 billion in the quarter.  Much of this increase was due to our second consecutive quarter of ARPU growth over 8% bringing ARPU to $87.40 in the fourth quarter.  In addition to the benefit we get from annual price increases, we're continuing to see strong growth in HD and DVR equipment and service revenues.  As we saw in the third quarter, we again added over 600,000 new HD and or DVR subscribers, bringing our total advanced service penetration to over 40% compared to just under 30% a year ago.</p>
          <p>If you recall, last quarter we mentioned that we started booking revenues on an older satellite that is being leased to Telesat.  Excluding those revenues in the fourth quarter, ARPU growth would have been a little bit under 8%.</p>
          <p>Turning to subscribers, the highlight in the quarter was the 8-year low churn rate.  We are particularly pleased with this number considering the increasingly competitive marketplace and slowing economy.  Most of the churn improvement was due to lower involuntary churn and this is attributable to our continued focus on higher quality subscribers.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter was the first full quarter where we saw the impact from two recent changes designed to further improve the credit quality of new subscribers, namely mandatory credit cards and the increase in minimum commitment for new customers from 12 months to 18 months.  It's clear that these changes impacted gross additions, which were slightly lower than the prior year, but as you heard Chase say, this is a tradeoff we're happy to make as we prioritize quality over quantity.</p>
          <p>Another indication that these changes are working is that the percentage of higher quality gross additions was at an all-time high in the fourth quarter as the average income levels for new customers continued to rise.</p>
          <p>It's also worth mentioning that our direct sales channel again posted extremely strong results, reaching a record in the mid 40% range of our total gross adds or 15% more subscriber additions than a year ago and since this channel generally attains higher quality subscribers, this helps explain why new customers purchasing HD and or DVR services jumped from a little over 30% of gross additions last year to well over 50% this year.</p>
          <p>Moving on, operating profit before depreciation and amortization was up 14% to approximately 1 billion.  OPBDA margin of about 23% was flat versus the prior year, as significant margin gains in subscriber services and G&amp;A were offset by the increased cost related to both new and existing subscribers purchasing HD and DVR services.</p>
          <p>In terms of our subscriber and G&amp;A costs, we are pleased to see that we're starting to capture some of the efficiencies that we had previously targeted.  Our SAC and upgrade costs increased in the quarter mostly due to higher installation and dish costs related to the increase in advanced subscribers as well as higher direct marketing expenses for new subscribers and SAC.</p>
          <p>However, perhaps the most important trend to highlight is that our capitalized set top box costs were actually lower both sequentially and compared to the prior year.  This is particularly impressive when you consider that we activated nearly 50% more advanced boxes compared to a year ago including more than twice as many HD-DVR boxes.  Obviously we have been successful in driving down the set top box cost including a large step down in costs in the fourth quarter on many of our advanced boxes.</p>
          <p>As a point of reference, we reduced the cost of our HD and HD-DVR boxes last year by roughly 30%, and we are targeting another 30% or so this year.  With these cost reductions, we will continue to aggressively pursue HD and DVR customers while generating financial returns that are generally twice those of a basic subscriber.  Also in the quarter we had higher upgrade costs of $60 million for MPEG-2-4 swaps compared to the only $33 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>Before moving on to our balance sheet I'd like to quickly mention that our programming margin in the quarter was relatively flat, which is consistent with our expectations going forward. We have been working hard to control programming costs and reverse the margin erosion we have seen in recent years.  We believe the fourth quarter marks the beginning of a trend toward more stable programming margins.</p>
          <p>In terms of our cash and balance sheet, The DIRECTV Group generated a bit over $500 million in cash before interest and taxes in the quarter, bringing the full-year total to 1.48 billion or 13% more than in the prior year.</p>
          <p>We also purchased about 19 million shares in the quarter for 479 million.  Since we began our share repurchase programs about two years ago, we have purchased about 270 million shares for roughly 5 billion while reducing our shares outstanding by about 19%.  As a reminder, our board authorized another $1 billion buyback program last month, so we have just begun purchasing shares through this program.  Mostly due to share repurchases, we ended the year with net debt at the corporate level of about 2.3 billion, up from 900 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the call back to Chase for some closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks, Pat.  Before turning it to questions, I thought I'd spend a minute recapping 2007 and looking forward to 2008.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of 2007, we outlined our objectives for the year, and while it's clear we didn't bat 1,000, I do believe we did pretty well.  We said the core of our strategy was to provide the best television experience defined by leadership in content, technology and service.  From a content perspective I think we have never been stronger.  We're a clear leader in HD, our sports content added depth and breadth, and we continue to bring new features, channels and choices to our customers, and our content is only going to get richer in coming months as we add or expand new dimensions to content like our VOD [Video on Demand] offering.</p>
          <p>Technology wise our advanced products continue to drive our business and stand out from our competitors.  We're adding new capabilities like remote booking and are making real progress in developing a true whole home solution for our customers.</p>
          <p>The service side of our business took real strides forward in 2007 but frankly it's an area we still have is a ways to go in 2008.  We clearly improved in 2007, and continue to lead our industry, but this is case of more to come.</p>
          <p>2007 was also about moving forward in an array of other key ways.  We wanted to continue to build our brands, and I believe our marketing truly distinguished this year probably more than ever.  The key theme for sales was to become both more targeted and opportunistic and we achieved both.  We got on top of the third party programming costs and began to bring them into line with our targets outlined a few years ago without compromising our position as the leader in program choice and quality.  We built new tools like our website to improve the quality of our customer experience and were more efficient vehicles for sales and service.</p>
          <p>With regard to the $10,000 question about competing with the bundle, we feel we're positioned pretty well.  All along we said our goal was to ensure the customer had broadband and telephony choices compatible with DIRECTV.  It's clear from our growth that customers are finding these choices.  We also said broadband was a tough space with risks of commoditization and price competition that also seemed true.  That we want to be careful and that has seemed equally prudent.  Our options are as plentiful as ever and we will continue to focus on helping customers find the right solutions without making a difficult investment unless there is a really good case for it.</p>
          <p>From a financial perspective we laid out a view of 2007 that we met or beat on most levels.  Our growth metrics like revenue, subscribers and ARPU all exceeded expectations.  Churn was another area where, as we said before, we made real progress.  We achieved our goals in key cost areas like programming and overhead as well as CapEx.</p>
          <p>Two factors we did not fully anticipate were the demand for advanced product and the sales costs associated with targeting subscribers which led to SAC exceeding our 650 to $700 range by year-end and upgrade spending as I said earlier above our expectation.  Nonetheless, OPBDA was at the high end of our 15 to 20% growth range.  Cash before interest and taxes was up in 2007, but we did not quite get to our targets again because of the advanced product demands.  But overall, we feel pretty good about our year in 2007.</p>
          <p>With that being said, in many ways we feel even better in terms of positioning for 2008.  We have some areas that we have real strength and momentum like content and HD where we'll continue to build on that strength, and some other areas like service where we're on track for real improvements in both quality and efficiency.  I'm not going to say too much about 2008 right now as we have our investor day in two weeks, but I do want to highlight a few themes that will be at the top of the page for us in the coming year or in this year.</p>
          <p>First, this will be a year where we expect major improvements in our margin and key costs enabling us to take our cash flow before taxes and interest to a whole new level.</p>
          <p>Second, we will continue to have strong top line growth with double digit revenue growth.  This will be attributable to both ARPU and sub growth, although we expect sub growth to be done a bit in 2008 particularly with the transition from BellSouth.</p>
          <p>Third advanced product will continue to be strong.  This will be -- this will lead to SAC that may be a bit above our historical target range.  On the other hand, we continue to generate great reduction in box costs to keep SAC around the 700 and change level.  For example, our HD DVR will cost in the low $200 range by late 2008 versus well over $400 a year ago.  At the same time, we expect our 2008 upgrade spending to be below 2007 as we benefit from efficiencies and our leasing program kicks in.</p>
          <p>Fourth CapEx excluding boxes will be down a couple hundred million dollars although we are still finishing off satellites and HD ground infrastructure in 2008.</p>
          <p>And fifth, Latin America will continue to build on success you have seen this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, as has been already publicly disclosed, we expect the Liberty transaction to close in the next couple weeks.  There is not a whole lot more I can say about that transaction or related items like our balance sheet, but the close of that transaction will enable us to properly address them in the short term.</p>
          <p>We're a very excited about 2008 and look forward to giving you a better sense of our plans in a few weeks.  With that I'll turn it back to Jon.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  I guess two questions, but I'll make one real quick.  On the balance sheet have you explored at all the tax implications of a one-time dividend?  Not that you would commit to one, but have you explored it at all?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, since you just mentioned BellSouth, there remains a pretty persistent investor concern regarding that shift where you lose co-marketing starting in the second quarter.  Can you talk more about what you see as the impact of losing that co-marketing starting in the second quarter?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  In terms of the balance sheet and I guess the specifics of the question is the tax implication of a one-time dividend; I guess what I would really say about all of it and really probably pretty consistent with what we've tried to say in the past; we have certainly evaluated and looked at an array of options that exist.  We're really not moving to a place until we get the transaction closed and have the long-term ownership structure in place, our longer term board in place to make those decisions.  So certainly in terms of doing the ground work and the leg work, to be prepared to move forward, we have done that.  In terms of taking these decisions to a board to discuss it, they are still things that we will do in the short term once we close the Liberty transaction.</p>
          <p>You know, in terms of BellSouth, I mean I think again as we said before, if you look at BellSouth, I think in the fourth quarter was about 7% of our gross adds or so, so that's -- and again clearly some of it is incremental and some of it is not.  We'll take steps to mitigate for it.  Probably the most complicated point I think we'll be okay.  We have done a lot of planning for it.  We think we're ready for it.  We'll have some resources to redeploy because we invest resources into the BellSouth relationship today.  There will obviously be a transition window in sort of end of March, April to get through it, but we think it will have -- I think I have said before on the service we look at it and say, it will have an impact on subs.  We don't think it will be a meaningful or dramatic overall impact.</p>
          <p>Again, if you think the 7% and assume we can mitigate a portion and recapture assume half of it &#x2013; some percentage is incremental and we can recapture part of the ones that are aren't incremental, it will hit us, but I think there is no perfect science to it.  It's a number on an annual basis that probably is a 50 to 100,000 sub type number.  And we'll see how effective we can be at closing that gap and finding other tools and venues to recapture that.  There will probably be a little more friction right at the moment where we transition through it, but we feel very good about 2008.  We feel good about sub growth.  It's an issue that we have to deal with, but I think we're taking steps to deal with it.  So again I expect there will be some impact to our sub growth on -- and those numbers I gave were an annualized number not a quarterly number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.  Couple of quick questions if I could.  First the pattern that you got here of very low churn and maybe slightly lower gross adds would look to be consistent with just the broader slowdown in the housing market and slower housing velocity.  I'm wondering if you're seeing the same thing with the movers program.  Are you just seeing reduced activity, and if so would that suggest a tailwind for margins in '08?</p>
          <p>My second question is about Massachusetts specifically, because the Department of Cable and Telecommunications in Massachusetts just released some interesting data about FiOS.  It's hard to square the circle with what happened in the puts and takes of subscriber losses, and I'm just wondering if you can share any specific color about that market and what your experience was in the FiOS markets in Massachusetts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll I guess touch on the first which had a couple.  Again, the satellite question, there is a comment and a question I guess.  Is there an economic &#x2013; you read something into the dynamic between gross adds and churn that relates to the economy.  I don't think so.  I mean, again, I guess I reiterate what I've said before.  I really don't -- I think we continue to really not see an impact on our business from any broader economic subprime issues.  I'm not saying there are none, but certainly not an impact, and again I think our -- I think our -- we're down a touch on gross adds.  Again, I think that is by and large focusing on discipline and the tradeoff as we said was sort of going after the customers we want and in some ways creating higher hurdles for the customers we don't want, and we think it's the right place to be, and we feel good about it, and I think the churn is a result of those efforts and initiatives as well as quality of our underlying sub base and the array of things that go with that.  So I don't think there's an economic issue.</p>
          <p>In terms of movers, likewise.  I think movers is down a touch, but I'm not sure.  It's probably -- it's never a number that has sort of got a very tight consistency quarter to quarter, it ebbs and flows a little bit, and I'd say it's within the range.  I think it is down a bit, but I'm not sure it's outside the range of the ebb and flowing quarterly that I would have seen over the last couple years.</p>
          <p>In terms of FiOS, I'm not sure kind of the Massachusetts specific.  I can probably comment on FiOS a little more generally.  I think where FiOS exists -- and I guess  --Verizon's number would say they've rolled it out to cover about 6 million homes add another 3. Where FiOS exists, it has been there and adds a competitive dynamic to the market, and I think that's true, and having a third player there that really they're competing as a cable company adds a competitor in the market.  I think we're doing okay.  Each market varies a little bit, and Massachusetts actually wouldn't have been.  If I was going to look at the various FiOS markets, we track each of them.  Massachusetts actually would have been one that &#x2013; again wherever FiOS is there's a bit of an impact, but it certainly would not have been in the top couple of markets where I'd say there is a particularly dynamic competition.</p>
          <p>In many ways the competition is half as much how does the cable guy respond to the phone guy or to Verizon's FiOS, so it's not just FiOS going in.  In many ways it's what does the cable guy do back and then how do we play.  And to some degree again we're not approaching this as a one size fits all.  We're competing in different FiOS markets in different ways and in each market we're trying to be smart about how do we approach it, but Massachusetts is certainly they're in there with a bit of FiOS, but I wouldn't have picked that as a market where I would say there is a particularly meaningful FiOS impact, although there is some.  Again, anyplace FiOS goes in it has some impact on the market.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Thanks for taking the question.  I have two quick questions, first of all I think you had talked about in the past of achieving a churn rate in any given year of 1.5%, and given the fairly large reductions you've been able to do over the last two quarters, do you have a new goal in terms of churn?</p>
          <p>And then my second question is about the NFL Sunday Ticket exclusivity.  I think that exclusivity comes up in 2010.  How important is that to you to keep that exclusivity, and what kind of weapons do you have in your arsenal to prevent one of the telcos from taking it away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of churn, you know, we do &#x2013; I'm really not going to say a whole lot because it's sort of looking forward and I think we're trying to &#x2013; we have a day set aside to talk about 2008 and beyond in a couple weeks.  So we still expect improvement in churn, and I expect &#x2013; I think we made real strides in 2007.  I think we talked in the past about being frustrated with the churn not getting to where it is, and we pursued an array of initiatives and finally have made the type of headway we expected to make.  So that being said, I expect churn to be down a bit in '08 from '07.  So we still think the churn is an area that we expect improvement.</p>
          <p>In terms of Sunday Ticket, you know, it's awful early.  I mean, it really is the '11 season is the first one we're not licensed, so you're practically 3.5 years out.  You're pretty far ahead of the curve.  Sunday Ticket has been a great property for us and there's no two ways about it.  It comes at a big price.  You've got to pre-negotiate where you get to it.  I think probably in many ways it is &#x2013; what is it?  What are our greatest strengths?  I think we have done a great job with it.</p>
          <p>I think the NFL values what we have done with it.  I think the NFL has made a decision that the way they distribute Sunday Ticket goes hand in hand with being unique in the sports world of keeping their major events predominantly on broadcast television and not having it merge into the pay per view VOD and keep it a more limited distribution product that maintains that event status of broadcast television on Sunday afternoon and Sunday nights and Monday nights for every American household.  And I think that's a mix that works well for them, but they're in a lot of dynamics between now and 2011 when it's available.</p>
          <p>And I think we'll have to see where those come out, and would we like to keep it?  Yes.  Is there a price at which it doesn't work? Yes, but I think we have a very good relationship with the NFL.  I think they tremendously value and respect what we have done with the franchise, adding super fan package, continuing to enhance it, the HD components, I think we have -- I think we have really been -- and I think they second it very much a part of making the NFL clearly unique in the television sports world, and a power inside that, and we will continue to do so, and we'll deal with the issues that come up, and we had a great year with Sunday Ticket.  We hit our targets, and we had great growth, and I think we continue to build that franchise.  So we're very proud of it, and but we'll make those judgments and we'll work with the NFL as the years go along and it gets closer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Chase, do you see acquiring content as a potential direction that you would take DIRECTV in the future.  Is there a rationale for DIRECTV actually owning content and do you think under any circumstances you might advocate moving more in that direction over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think it's probably -- I do believe -- I'm not going to get too far into hypotheticals.  I do think content and distribution still have a synergistic value between them and the about that one enhances the other and the back and forth, but I think you've got to have the right content and there's a lot out there.  I think we feel very good about DIRECTV as a business.  It certainly does not need to add anything to it.  I think we believe we have got a lot of room to grow the business, a lot of room to expand the business.  I think that being said we will always sort of try and make sure we look at the world with an open mind and are in touch with whatever is out there, and if there are opportunities to make sure to evaluate them, but our core focus is truly to grow this business and grow this business to everything it can be.  And we've got a lot of room left to expand and build the business, but the content, I do think content and distribution have a -- you know, there's a value that comes from having &#x2013; being able to work together with it, and obviously content players value us.  We've gotten some &#x2013; they haven't been operating.  We've gotten some channels in the last couple years, equity positions in some of the emerging content players, and I think that reflects the value we bring to it, and clearly content's a part of our mix, but bottom line is our focus is on building and driving DIRECTV.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.  It's James Ratcliffe for Vijay.  I had two questions:  First of all on customer quality, how do you measure that from a demographic perspective?  Can you give us some idea what the average customer looks like in terms of income, education, so on, versus the U.S. population and also what portion of customers are under a contract versus month to month?</p>
          <p>And secondly regarding the Latin American operations, any thoughts regarding the two that aren't wholly owned, Mexico and Brazil of either consolidating those in or potentially divesting your stake in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of customer quality, I mean, there are array of tools.  Certainly one of the ones you look at is income.  It's not the only, but that would probably be near the top of the list, but you get age, homeownership, education, an array of dynamics of metrics we use to evaluate those customers.  And that I think would probably be &#x2013; I'm not going to &#x2013; we ultimately have a model to value them.</p>
          <p>We've gotten &#x2013; we developed in the last couple years a much more sophisticated customer segmentation set of tools that are unique to us, so I'm not going to put them out there, but they enable us to take our customers and based on an array of dynamics to categorize them into &#x2013; to put them into various segments.  We can value them and determine what the appropriate resources to deploy whether it is going out to them or other decisions we make in sort of managing that customer relationship.  But I think it's probably the metrics you'd expect to be there that most people would have in terms of demographic measures and other types of measures you have in that basis.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; what was the second question?  Latin America, I wouldn't say &#x2013; I mean at the end of the day, we have got partners there.  I guess we &#x2013; I don't think it would be &#x2013; I don't think I would be assuming particularly I guess in Mexico that Televisa would be &#x2013; we have a very good relationship with Televisa. We're very happy with the relationship with Televisa and I think they have a good relationship with us.  If somebody wanted to change, we'd be happy to talk.  I don't have any indications that there's something there.  Globo had it. It has from where they were a few years ago gone down to a smaller organization.  Again, the business has gone well and I think Globo would end up in the same way being pleased with the progress we have made in Brazil, but I think in some ways it would &#x2013; I think both partners are pretty happy with where they are, but if they wanted to talk, we'd talk.  We like both businesses, but there are no indications that there is anything that either one would be open to engaging on, and again, they're healthy businesses going well, so our focus is on building them.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chase, your thoughts on potentially being able to win back that AT&amp;T relationship in the fall?</p>
          <p>And then how much of the ultra low churn that you are seeing on advanced set top boxes can be attributed to fact that you're often requiring consumers to pay for the box and is there any concern as you drop the price on the box people will have less skin in the game and be more prone to churn?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of AT&amp;T, I'm not sure I have a lot more color than what they said.  I think they said it's a decision they'll make and I guess they have the opportunity to make in the fall.  I think they -- we continue to talk to them as I'm sure EchoStar does, and I think they recognize there are an array of unique things that we bring to them in terms of our content &#x2013; bring in a lot of things and I guess I talked early on in the earlier part of the call here, you know, that distinguish us.</p>
          <p>I think on the EchoStar side, probably first and foremost they have a relationship that is up and working.  And so I think we have &#x2013; we have assets and virtues and values that we bring to them that distinguish us from EchoStar, but I think there are obviously other things that they have, and I think it's tough to tell where it measures out.  It's also tough to tell who is &#x2013; how aggressive either one of us are in pursuing it.  Again, I think we value the telco relationships, particularly if they're good relationships and they're the right relationships.  But we can compete okay without them.  That's not saying that we don't &#x2013; we wouldn't look to have the right relationship with a telco like AT&amp;T.</p>
          <p>We have had good relationships, we've had one with BellSouth, we had one with Verizon and Qwest today, but there are ways we can effectively compete as we do and have done in the last few years in the AT&amp;T region and we compete quite effectively when we don't have a telco relationship, so I think there are a lot of dynamics around, and I think as with any sort of negotiation about call it a deal, you'll have to see how much EchoStar does, how much we value it, and how AT&amp;T measures the various dynamics here, and I couldn't handicap it other than I think they're seriously engaged with both of us and I think both of us are seriously engaged with them, but we'll see where it goes.</p>
          <p>In terms of...?</p>

          <p>The relationship to upfront fees on products and churn...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh!  I think it's a factor.  I don't think it's a huge -- I mean, look it always helps to have skin in the game.  We'd rather have skin in the game, and does it help?  Sure.  So I think as you go along in time, I think that probably becomes sort of a &#x2013; it goes from front of mind to back of the mind issue as you go along year, two years, three years.  So I think it's more economic than skin in the game.  I think particularly we have contracts in the advanced products that are two-year contracts, so by the time to get out of the two-year contract and if someone is there with an alternative box that is -- they don't have any charge for &#x2013; that they don't have an upfront charge for, I don't think the fact that you paid us something a couple years earlier is &#x2013; it's a help, but I don't think it's a huge deterrent, so I actually think as we go down, I'd rather keep it.  I'd rather we live in a competitive world.  We'd rather be able to continue to charge something up front, but I think the reality of where the marketplace has moved with all these products I think is fairly clear.  But I think it's more of an economic decision, though again I'm not saying there isn't value in having a customer have skin in the game and having taken our box, but I don't think it's a huge factor in driving the churn.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thank you very much.  My first question, Chase, is on the 700 megahertz auction.  Can you perhaps provide some thoughts on that, and is your decision not to participate related to perhaps the issue of the Liberty deal?  And related to that, how does this affect your wireless strategy?</p>
          <p>Separately, on WildBlue given Liberty Media's controlling interest in that, WildBlue, should the deal with Liberty close, do you expect WildBlue to feature prominently in your strategy going forward, and how does your current relationship with WildBlue change or not change as a result of Liberty's current stake?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 700 megahertz, I guess obviously as you said, we're not in it, and the reason has nothing to do with Liberty.  I think our view and what I said about broadband earlier, I think it's a tough place.  Clearly going in and building an entirely new technology, we have continued to kick around WiMax and these technologies for a long time.  Look, it's a tough go.  The spectrum was going to go for a lot of money.  We knew it.  And right now I think we feel we're positioned -- we were never sort of here saying our goal was to get into the broadband business.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to find and make sure there are ways a consumer can find broadband and telephony options that are compatible with us.  They're continuing to find it, people are going to build it and in many ways I'd rather have others build it and us be a partner that can align with them and provide distribution muscle and the type of relationships we have with an array of parties today to build it out.  I think the practical reality &#x2013; the belief that we're going to go in and go toe to toe with the existing broadband guys with billions spent on spectrum and then billions spent to build it out is just -- that's tough going for in a business like broadband that I think is one that is going to continue to be challenged with commoditization and price competition.</p>
          <p>So nothing to do with Liberty.  I think it had a do with A) the price of the spectrum and what we thought that was going to go for, and that leads into B) the price that it was going to cost on top of it to ultimately build this out on top of the risks of building out a new broadband entry.  We'd like to see it happen if we can be helpful in it happening but we're going to be prudent and smart.  We're not going to sort of just jump into this fray for the type of costs and the like that exists particularly when our business is continuing to grow and we're finding solutions don't require us to take those things on.</p>
          <p>WildBlue: again, WildBlue likewise won't change on Liberty's ownership of WildBlue, our position on WildBlue &#x2013; we have a good relationship with WildBlue today, and in early stages.  WildBlue is -- again, WildBlue is in satellite broadband is largely a rural product where others don't exist.  We think it's a good option to have for consumers who probably don't have the wired cable or telephony broadband options, but we really think it's a more of a niche product for those markets and that's a reasonable size and it means WildBlue could be a nice business, but we're going to move forward with WildBlue to find ways we can work with WildBlue to provide it as an option to those customers that don't have those options, but really that's the approach we'd be taking with or without Liberty's ownership, so I think WildBlue is largely a &#x2013; I guess you'd call it a rural product for the customers who don't have the telephony or cable broadband options.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Good afternoon guys.  Maybe just a question on the satellite fleet and the free cash flow ramp from here, Chase.  At least my numbers it's roughly doubling in '08 versus '07.  Some of that has to do with capital on the satellite launches and infrastructure declining which you referenced in your opening remarks.  I know you have D 11 to go up this year, I think you're spending some money on D 12, but I don't know if you've officially announced if you were going to launch that and if so when.  What is the average remaining life on the fleet after that is all done?  I'm trying to get a sense for when replacement birds &#x2013; spending on replacement satellites would kick in?</p>
          <p>And does Kevin Martin's suggestion of HD must-carry or digital must-carry for satellite change that outlook?</p>
          <p>And then just a quick question for Pat on the taxes: you guys are still it looks like paying about half your provision out in cash taxes in '07.  Does that &#x2013; any guidance on when that rolls off?  Is it all over the next couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; we are &#x2013; we do have D 11 and D 12 spending.  Again, it's true with the CapEx, and CapEx has sort of continued to extend out longer than we initially planned.  I think we had talked about a window, and it has taken longer.  So we have D 11 and D 12.  We haven't really made a final decision on the D 12 launch plans, so we don't have those finalized yet.  In terms of the age of the satellites, once those are done, I think the average life is over 10 years.  I mean, I think it's 10 or 11 years, and I think actually the short one in it is still way up there.  It's probably not a whole lot under ten, so it's a pretty fresh fleet.</p>
          <p>Again, who knows what comes?  Clearly the HD must-carry stuff really just in the last few days, it sort of came a bit out of the blue.  Not that we didn't know it sort of generally was out there, but all of a sudden be put out there in a more formal way came up pretty quickly.  And clearly it's an issue for us.  HD must-carry or those things have implications to satellite.  Again I think we haven't seen enough.  It came out quite quickly, and trying to understand all the things around it, you know, I think it would be premature at this point with it having just come up, but certainly it's an issue.  It's an issue for us, and we'll have to look at it and talk to them about what and what are the specifics underneath it.  So I think probably at this point it probably is premature to say what does it mean and what do we do.</p>
          <p>I do think we've got a robust HD fleet.  We have invested significantly in it.  We've got multiple birds up there, it's basically birds that give us flexibility, but flexibility is not infinite, so I think we'll have to see where this more specific thing comes out and we're working with the FCC to try to get a better handle and better understanding of sort of where this should be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on taxes, I mean, yes, we have kind of clearly come out of the period where we have used up our net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards, so in 2008 we will be a full taxpayer. Having said that, we still have some advantages of like the accelerated depreciation on our CapEx, so we expect it to be below our provision for 2008, but it will be higher than the 2007 tax payments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Three questions.  Chase, you said in the earnings release that you're going to generate significant free cash flow in '08 and I think we all have that in our models and you clearly are underleveraged, so I was wondering if you could update us on your current comfort level with leverage, and you know, can you go back -- can you give us your bias in terms of dividends, continued buybacks, and on the acquisition question that was already asked on programming, is there anything else that you would consider like for example other international assets?</p>
          <p>The second question is could you talk about your marketing plans for the digital transition in February of '09?</p>
          <p>And then the final one is what was advertising revenue in the quarter and how much did it grow year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got to go back to the top.  Free cash flow &#x2013; what was the question related to free cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Use of free cash flow, your comfort level with the leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With leverage, yeah, again, realistically we have not as I said &#x2013; I guess in the question on &#x2013; I can't remember what was the question related to &#x2013; we've not gone actively into &#x2013; we're underleveraged and there is no two ways about it.  I know historically what the view would have been from the credit markets.  We have not really engaged with them intensively enough to sort of determine where -- what would be the guidance today, historically, we had gotten sort of again that 3.5 terms and sort of said if that was with our credit rating where you could get to on EBITDA, you wouldn't go to the max, but sort of 2.5 would leave you room.</p>
          <p>I think what we will do again, as this Liberty transaction finally comes to a close would obviously be as we lay out all these options that include the balance sheet, we'll get a more refined view of what the markets would be telling us and what we think is prudent.  And I think as, what I'd say with dividends and buybacks, I'm not going to get in front of a discussion with the board.  I haven't had those discussions.  These are things that we're prepared to have.</p>
          <p>It's difficult to keep getting prepared.  I thought this deal was going to close in June.  So we could have gotten prepared to have the discussion in June, then have the discussion in September, then have the discussion in November, and now we're going to have the discussion in February, so at some point we can &#x2013; we'd drive ourselves nuts trying to continually be ready to deal with it.  So I think we know the right questions, we know the right options, and I think we can quickly bring them to the forefront once we get to a place where we have got long-term ownership and board in place to make those decisions and I guess the same answer would apply to dividends buybacks.</p>
          <p>And I guess in terms of acquisitions, again I think at its core, our focus continues to be build DIRECTV.  That being said, I think you always want to be opportunistic.  I don't think there's a per se sort of -- certainly there is not a weakness or a need we have.  Are there opportunities, you know, that one would want to look at?  I think that as is always the case will be what is there and when.  And that probably again likewise falls into the category of trying to get through this transition place to have an intelligent and thoughtful longer looking view at that business.  But at its core, I think our focus will continue to be and where we have tremendous opportunity first and foremost is really taking DIRECTV to the next level, and as you said, we think a lot of that you'll see -- you'll obviously see it over time, but we expect a lot of it you'll see in '08.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the digital, we are going to -- I'm not sure there is any magic to it.  We have the benefit -- clearly one of the benefits that we and EchoStar have is having a national reach, and therefore -- there are ways we'll go at it.  I'm not sure I'd put it all on the mat because some of it is competitive, but there are clearly segments that have been well identified that people would say would probably disproportionately be represented here and elderly and therefore there are vehicles and ways you can sort of contact an elderly population, an ethnic population.  Again, there are probably ways and vehicles that are more, better equipped to go after an ethnic population.  We have our own subscribers to the degree they may in their house have still a third or fourth set that is an antenna based set.  Make sure we educate our own, but we are moving forward.  We actually have plans that will be out in the coming couple of months.  We'll start to sort of go out and engage with both ours and outside customers through various vehicles to go after it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question.  I just have one question.  I wanted to go back to ARPU growth, Chase, which has been pretty strong the last two quarters and I know the advanced services have been driving some of that.  So I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how sustainable you think this level of ARPU growth is given that penetration of advanced services is getting pretty high. And if you could maybe talk a little bit about where you think penetration of these services can go maybe over the next 12 months or what you think the long-run penetration opportunity is?  That would be great.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would not -- certainly we had, what was the year 7, close to 7%, a touch under -- or 8%.  I think our ARPU start up growth will be healthy.  I'm not certainly sitting here saying we expect that growth in '08.  I think I expect our growth &#x2013; and again I don't want to get too far in front of things we'll talk about in a couple weeks.  I expect us to have healthy ARPU growth, certainly north of 5% ARPU growth, but we'll probably get a bit better picture, but I think we're continuing to see very significant growth in penetration of those devices, and good growth in an array of areas in ARPU, and certainly we see some continued growth and would expect to see good healthy continued growth in that in '08.</p>
          <p>And in terms of advanced products, I mean, generally again what we sort of talked through is an overall 10% a year penetration.  I think we beat that, and I think we probably would end up saying it is continuing to seem to grow a bit ahead of what expectations were, and as you get out in time, so certainly if you look out over the next 12 months, I think we have talked about 10% a year, and I think it's probably continuing to trend if anything a bit above that.  Longer term, where does it go?  I mean, look, I'm a big believer that these, particularly the DVR and HD have a momentum behind them that are making them sort of mainstream products to American households in the way that over time DVDs and VCRs and other various things became.  I think the DVR is ahead of HD on that curve, but they've both got a lot of momentum.</p>
          <p>Trying to put timeframes to that, I don't have probably a good enough crystal ball.  We have our own assumptions, but to date it's probably running ahead of what would have been my expectations, certainly for us it's running ahead of &#x2013; a bit ahead of what would have been my expectations, but I think there's a lot of room because I do think these &#x2013; I don't think these are products that are sort of maturing out at 40 or 50% of American households.  I think they're ones that will become much more mainstream foundations in the television experience.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Chase, or afternoon.  In terms of advanced services, clearly the HD and DVR have made a lot of progress.  Can you give us any indications of other things we might be seeing coming and particularly opportunities for integrating IP video into any offerings particularly given since you're broadband agnostic?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It is -- again you're probably into some of the things that we're going to talk more about in a couple weeks, but I think VOD will clearly be something -- we have launched to customers and we'll continue to roll it out.  It's really more sort of launched in a limited basis now, and will roll out.  I don't think VOD to date has gotten &#x2013; clearly I think HD and DVR are the driving forces.  VOD is there.  VOD I think will though continue to be a part of the experience, so I think from us that will be there.</p>
          <p>I touched on the whole home, and I think the ability to have consumers share things around the home on multiple sets store and replace used I think will be part of the experience that you want to bring to people, and will open up stuff.  And clearly broadband connectivity, clearly has complications with it, but it's something we will very much engage in how do we tie in, in the right way, on the right basis, the content available on broadband into the experience on the television.</p>
          <p>But we have to be -- we have to be smart about that.  I think somebody said it the other day that -- there's a lot of things on broadband, and we want to make sure we're not opening up ways to find people to -- to trade down to other ways to access product that are not as attractive to us or not additive to our experience. So I think we need to find ways that we're continuing to enrich that experience, provide solutions to the customer, but do it in an intelligent way that builds on top of the business we have with them.  I think we have an opportunity to be a real leader here, but I think we have to be smart about how we deal with content from broadband &#x2013; broadband-based content.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question.  I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on how much of the increased in ARPU came from price increases?</p>
          <p>And then just with ARPU being where it is and the market getting more competitive, how easy it's going to be to continue pushing price increases into the market?</p>
          <p>And then I'm wondering if I can follow-up with just asking for a little bit of color on how you're expecting to be able to control programming costs where the stabilization of programming margins is going to come from more specifically?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of price increases, obviously in this quarter would have been the price increase we put through in the beginning of the year.  I think that was sort of overall a 3.5 to 4% price increase, so generally -- now probably offsetting a price increase I would say, and I think we've talked about it before, you do see a level of competition already in the market, and I think it shows up more in offers, so while you'll have a stated price increase, probably what we're putting into consumer offers into the market is offsets to some degree that 4% price increase, so I don't know that you'd end up saying it's the 4% is part of that, because against the 4, you really have a structural increase that is not 4%, but offset a bit by more aggressive consumer offers.</p>
          <p>And I think we said before, that's really where we see the price competition today manifesting itself.  I think most people are still and we're going through the cycle now, most of us: cable, ourselves put through the price increases in the early part of the calendar year.  Most are putting them through, so I don't think -- I think you're seeing those price increases continue to be put into the marketplace, the place you are seeing price competition emerge is probably more on the offer side of it, so again I do think that dynamic is there.  But again, we're pretty well into sort of it for '08.  Is there a risk of price competition?  Look, it's always there.  Right now, it has not certainly seemed like -- I think most of the major players have announced their price increases for the next 12 months, and a couple of them did it in a little bit more of a probably confusing way to try to hide the price increase, but I think the reality is everybody put through a degree of price increases in the last 12 months.  So I think by and large, what you have seen and what you're going to see for '08 is largely what you saw for '07 with probably a bit of an increase on a bit of an increase on the offer side.</p>
          <p>Probably the only dynamic that I think we have to keep an eye on is clearly a number of players have struggled a bit and are sort of that perception and do they increase the offers as a way to compete, and I think we will have to continue to be savvy.  We feel pretty good about where we are today, but the competitive marketplace is fluid, and we will continue to monitor that, but I guess in terms of pricing power, again, I'd say as you look at it, you can look right now into '08 or at least on the stated price increases, it's okay.  But it's a fluid marketplace, and we'll have to continue to see do people react by using price more aggressively than they have.  Although I think if they did it would be mostly on the offer side.</p>
