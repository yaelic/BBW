          <p>Good morning and welcome to the Kraft Foods' Fourth Quarter 2007 and Year-end Earnings Conference Call.  Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Kraft Foods' Management and the question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations for Kraft.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us on our conference call.  I'm Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations.  With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Tim McLevish, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Our earnings release was sent out earlier today and is available on our website, kraft.com.  Also available on our website are slides that we will refer to during our prepared comments.  As you know, during this call we may make forward-looking statements about the company's performance.  These statements are based on how we see things today so they contain an element of uncertainty.  Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.  So please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Some of today's prepared remarks will exclude those items that affect comparability.  These excluded items are captured in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our news release and they are also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today's agenda is as follows, we'll begin the call with Irene providing her perspective on our 2007 results and the outlook for 2008.  Then Tim will highlight our financials then review the results for each of our business segments.  After that we will take your questions.  With that, I will hand it off to Irene.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone.  If you turn to slide 4, you saw on our press release 2007 represented a solid start to our three-year plan and more importantly established good momentum for 2008.  Our organic revenue growth of 6% in Q4 and 5% for the full year was even better than we had expected and it was quality growth.  We had solid gains from product mix throughout the year and volume growth improved as the year progressed.  That reflects the payback from the investments we made in the course of the year.  Where we have improved quality, invested in day spend support and or innovated we've seen good results, and so I remain confident that our plan will return Kraft to reliable growth.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 5, we continue to see this model at work in the Wave 1 investment areas I discussed in September.  In our mac and cheese business we invested in quality upgrades to our base products and rolled out Easy Mac Cups.  The result, we posted double-digit organic growth and gained a half point of market share in 2007.  This followed three years of essentially no growth and more than one point of share loss.</p>
          <p>Our Pizza business finished the year absolutely on fire.  It posted double-digit volume growth and gained over four market share points in the fourth quarter, and our back to basics approach in the EU focused on our two iconic brands, Jacobs Coffee and Milka Chocolate delivered our fourth quarter consecutive quarter of solid organic revenue growth.  For a business that has been flat to down for the past four years the 3.5% organic growth in 2007 is no small feat.  I am also encouraged by the early results in three core categories where our programming hit late last year.  Coffee, where we are adding to our success in the premium segment by beginning to stem our long-standing decline in mainstream coffee, the reason? Our recent relaunch of Maxwell House with quality upgrades in product and packaging.</p>
          <p>In Biscuits, where our market share performance improved in the fourth quarter from several new product platforms and in Cheese where despite record high dairy costs in the second half of 2007, we increased our marketing more than 50% in processed slices and introduced Singles Select.  That helped to reverse our share declines in processed cheese from the first half of the year.  We also delivered double-digit growth and market share gains in snacking cheese and our new LiveActive cheeses are proving to be highly incremental both to Kraft and to the category.  There is still much more to be done in Cheese, but I feel we are off to a good start.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide six.  More broadly across North America as our investments hit the market, our market share trends have begun to improve.  On a trailing 52-week basis, we finished the year with businesses representing 47% of our revenue gaining or holding share.  Not yet where we want to be, but that's up from only 38% three months earlier.  And in the fourth quarter, we gained or held share in businesses representing 50% of our revenue.  Over the course of 2008, we will continue to improve on that trend.  We are finally on our way to our longer-term goal of growing share in at least two-thirds of our revenue base.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide seven.  Also in 2007, we put strong new leadership in place.  Four of the nine members of my executive team are new to the Company or to their jobs and we've replaced half of our key business leaders around the world.  We changed our incentive systems to more directly tie executive rewards to shareholder value creation and we're now executing reorganization to give more accountability to our business leaders while significantly reducing overhead costs.</p>
          <p>We've also strengthened our portfolio.  We're exiting businesses that don't pay our long-term growth plan like Fruit2O and Post Cereals, and we're enhancing our future growth prospects, profitability and international footprint with the acquisition of the Danone Biscuit business.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'm pleased to say we delivered at the high end of our increased EPS guidance.  Yes, we did benefit from a lower tax rate but this was on top of better top line momentum from our investments in brand equity.  At the same time, higher than expected input cost negatively impacted our margins and put pressure on the bottom line and so in response we took more aggressive actions to reduce our overhead costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 8, as you saw in our press release this morning, in 2008 we'll spend less and save more on our restructuring program than originally anticipated.  We now expect $200 million more in savings and our cost to deliver those savings will be $200 million less.  Our spending on the program will end in 2008 but incremental savings will continue beyond that.  Clearly, we made significant progress on many fronts in 2007.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 9, however, not everything went our way.  The biggest surprise was the unprecedented high dairy cost and the fact that they remained at these high levels through year-end.  As you can see from this chart the 2007 price curve broke significantly from historical norms.  As a matter of practice given historical cyclicality, we typically price to the expected average not the peak dairy cost in any given year.  As a result when cheese costs stayed high late into the year our pricing actions did not keep pace with costs.  Therefore, we are taking additional pricing actions now.  We do expect some moderation in average cheese cost later this year.  Nevertheless, as you can see we are likely to face difficult cost comparisons through the first half of the year, which brings me to our 2008 guidance.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 10.  Since this is the second year of a three-year plan let me start with the expectations I laid out last February at CAGNY.  At that time I said in 2008, our operational turnaround will continue to gain momentum as we get growing again on both the top and bottom lines.  Our top line will grow 3 to 4% organically and operating income growth will exceed revenue growth.  I said we continue to invest a portion of our growth back into the business as we launched the next wave of trajectory changing initiatives.  And we further accelerate our advertising and consumer spending toward our long-term target of 8 to 9% of net revenue.  I also said that by 2009 we hit our stride.  We fully realized our financial benefits of our investments and deliver our long-term targets of at least 4% organic net revenue growth and 7 to 9% EPS growth.</p>
          <p>So how do I feel about those statements today, turn to slide 11.  I stand firmly behind them.  I feel good about our momentum and I am even more bullish as we enter year two of our three-year plan.  Looking at the numbers our top line will grow faster than we had expected at least 4% organically.  And remember that's before the addition of approximately 2.8 billion in revenue, from the Danone Biscuit acquisition.  In 2007, although pricing was higher than in the past, it represented less than one-third of our organic revenue growth.  In 2008, it's likely that pricing will be a much more significant factor as we offset higher input costs.</p>
          <p>The investments we've made, and will continue to make are strengthening our brand equity and enabling improved pricing power.  As a result, we are far better able to recover input cost increases through pricing and productivity.  However, we do expect that near term category volumes will be negatively impacted as consumers adjust to new price levels.  Through it all I remain confident that our continued investments in marketing and innovation will drive further share gains across more of our portfolio, despite our pricing actions.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at operating income.  Our Danone will have a modest dampening effect on margins in its first year; we expect that operating income ex-items will grow faster than revenue in 2008.  We also expect that Q4 2007 represented the low point in our margins.  And they will progressively improve as 2008 unfolds.  We will continue to invest in the next wave of trajectory changing initiatives.  And will further accelerate our advertising and consumer spending toward our long-term target of 8 to 9% of revenue.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings per share, ex-items our EPS guidance is at least $1.90.  This reflects a three-point headwind to earnings growth, from the increase in our effective tax rate from 31.2% in 2007, to 33.5% in 2008, as we become a fully independent tax filer.  If we were to normalize for taxes our EPS guidance would represent an increase of almost 8% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 12, to summarize we had a solid start to our plan to restore Kraft to reliable growth.  We continued to invest in our growth initiatives.  They are paying dividends and at the same time they are strengthening our brand equity and pricing power in the face of unprecedented input cost.  We successfully reducing costs and overheads to provide additional funding for investment and our strategic actions are strengthening our portfolio and future growth prospects.  I remain confident that by 2009, we will be well positioned to reliably deliver our long-term targets of at least 4% organic net revenue growth and 7 to 9% EPS growth.</p>
          <p>And now I will turn the call over to Tim.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Irene and good morning, please turn to slide 13.  I will begin my comments by providing some perspective on our financials both for 2007 and how we see 2008 unfolding.  Before I begin, please keep in mind that unless otherwise noted, my comments would exclude the items affecting comparability that were highlighted in our press release <mark type="audio gap" /> and 2% for the second consecutive quarter that's up from 3.9% organic growth in the first half of the year.  Volume and mix accounted for about two-thirds of Q4 growth as our Wave 1 investments in quality, innovation and marketing hit the market.  Net pricing was up 2 percentage points versus 1% in the first six months of the year as we begin to see the realization of price increases taken during the year.</p>
          <p>Overall we have steady improvement and established a solid momentum on the top line in 2007.  As Irene mentioned in 2008, we expect pricing to make a greater contribution to top line growth as a result of improved price realization.  At the same time, our first quarter and first half volume comparisons will be difficult as we implement the significant pricing necessary to offset cost inflation.  Nonetheless, during this time of unprecedented price increases we expect to build market share over the course of the year, which is a testament to the improving strength of our brands.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 15.  And turning to operating income, our Q4 results were significantly impacted by input costs, particularly dairy.  Our lower price realization improved in Q4.  Our gross margin was down 410 basis points versus Q4 last year.  This is primarily due to higher dairy costs.  Our pricing and productivity gains were simply overwhelmed by higher input costs and by our investments in product quality.  For the year, our input costs were up about $1.3 billion over 2006.  At the same time, our cost reduction programs drove a reduction in overhead cost as a percentage of sales.  This enabled us to fund a double-digit increase in marketing.  And, as a result, operating income margin was down less than gross margin.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we anticipate that margins will get progressively better as the year unfolds from the low point in the fourth quarter of 2007.  We will continue to spend on our growth investments.  We spent $375 million in 2007 and we will spend incrementally on top of that base in 2008.  As a result of our planned investments, together with the addition of the Danone Biscuit business, we expect ANC as a percent of net revenue to be in the mid 7% range in 2008.  That said, first half margins and earnings comparison with the prior year will be difficult.  Difficult for two reasons, first is the fact that the full effect of our price increases will lag higher input costs at the beginning of the year.  And second, is our expectation that input cost comparisons should ease as the year progresses.</p>
          <p>I think it's instructive if we turn to slide 16.  I think it is instructive to take a minute to look at the magnitude of input cost increases we face coming into 2008.  This chart shows commodity prices in each year versus the 10-year average price for each of our 11 largest commodity inputs.  With the exception of almonds and lean hogs we are starting the year at record cost levels and in the cases of cocoa, wheat and soybean oil, we are starting 2008 at significantly higher levels than the average 2007 cost.  Because of this, we have taken and are taking pricing actions as well as focusing on overhead cost to ensure the expansion of operating margins in 2008.</p>
          <p>Now if you will turn to slide 17.  Turning to earnings per share.  We've discussed operating results already, so let's look at what happened below the line.  In the fourth quarter, higher interest expense cost us roughly $0.04 of earnings versus the prior year.  This is partially offset by $0.02 from lower shares outstanding.  We invested another $500 million in our stock repurchase plan during the quarter and in the first nine months since the spin-off we repurchased $3.5 billion or 6.5% of our shares outstanding at an average price of $33.13 per share.  Looking forward, we expect interest expense to be between 1.2 and $1.3 billion in 2008.  This is primarily the result of higher debt levels related to our acquisition of the Danone Biscuit business and activity under our share repurchase program.  And finally as I already mentioned our effective tax rate excluding items will increase from 31.2% in 2007 to 33.5% in 2008.</p>
          <p>I will take a few minutes now to share some highlights of our business segment results, if you turn to slide 18.  We will start with North American beverages, where organic net revenues grew 6.7%.  Volume and mix were up strongly from new better-for-you offerings in powdered and ready to drink beverages.  In fact, Crystal Light with functional benefits extended the success of our stick platform.  It drove double-digit powdered beverage growth in the quarter.  In Coffee, we saw continued strong growth in premium coffee from both Starbucks and Tassimo.</p>
          <p>I'd also note here that since the November introduction, Starbucks T DISCS for a Tassimo machine are the most successful T DISCS launch ever with three times historical customer demand.  In mainstream coffee, Maxwell House trends are improving.  As Irene mentioned earlier, we've had an excellent consumer reaction to both preferred plastic packaging and the new 100% Arabica blend.  While it will take time to reverse years of decline, we expect to see further improvement in the months ahead.  At the profit line Beverage's operating income doubled and margin increased 480 basis points.  This upside was delivered by the strong growth of higher margin powdered beverages and premium coffee as well as our more targeted marketing strategy for Tassimo.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 19.  In North America, Cheese and Foodservice results were significantly impacted by persistently high barrel cheese prices.  Organic net revenues were up 8.4% almost entirely due to price increases in response to higher dairy costs.  While there was some volume growth in the quarter, this was primarily due to buying ahead of our price increases and this will adversely affect Q1 volumes.  It is important to note, however, that where we have invested we are seeing results, for instance, our efforts to revitalize processed cheese slices with better marketing and the introduction of Singles Select helped to reverse our share declines in that segment.  We delivered double-digit revenue growth and share gains in snacking cheeses in the quarter and our sales of LiveActive Cottage Cheese are proving to be over 80% incremental to Kraft and about 35% incremental to the category.  It is not enough, but it is a start to what will be a big focused area for us in 2008.</p>
          <p>Turn to operating income margin.  It fell 9.9 percentage points as dairy costs rose over 40% well above our pricing.  Despite that we continue to fund our growth initiatives to stage this critical business for the future.  Our 2008 outlook calls for significant margin improvement from our Q4 performance as we recover higher input costs through pricing.  We'll also continue to bring more innovation to market and make further investments in building our brand equity for the long-term.  As a result we expect to show successive improvement in operating margins and share from Q4 levels as the year unfolds.</p>
          <p>Now if you turn to slide 20, moving on to North American Convenient Meals.  The investments we've been making in quality, base marketing support for new products drove 6.8% organic revenue growth almost entirely due to volume and mix gains and our market share is up in categories representing 90% of the segments revenues.  This growth was driven by such investments as Ultimate Pizza, Mac n' Cheese, Deli Creations sandwiches and Deli Fresh Meats.  The benefits of volume leverage, favorable product mix and cost savings led to a 100 basis point increase in operating income margin and that was despite higher input costs.  The success we've seen here in 2007 has provided solid momentum going into 2008 including further benefits from volume growth and favorable mix as well as price increases taken in December to cover higher input costs.</p>
          <p>Now turn to slide 21 and on to North American Grocery.  Organic net revenues were down 3.5%.  Our investments in contemporized Jell-O are driving solid revenue and market share growth in Desserts.  However, this was offset by continuing weakness in Salad Dressings.  As we've mentioned before reversing many years of decline in our pourable salad dressings business is a priority for the grocery management team in 2008.  We've upgraded the quality of the packaging and product and by the end of the first quarter we'll be fully national with incremental marketing support.  Some of the costs associated with these upgrades impacted our Q4 grocery margins and together with our inability to aggressively price into the weak brand equity our margin was down 3.7 percentage points for the quarter.  Going forward while Grocery margins in Q1 will be under pressure from the stepped up level in investment in pourable salad dressings we expect margin trends to progressively improve over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 22, looking at North American Snacks and Cereals.  Organic net revenues were up 4.7% in Q4 behind strong gains from new product platforms.  100 Calorie Packs were up strong double-digit again in the quarter and ended the year with $230 million in revenue.  Cakesters after only a half year has captured over 5% of the $1 billion snack cake market and is on its way to becoming a $100 million product.  Our bars business was again up double-digits and Garden Harvest chips helped further fuel the growth of our toasted chip platform.</p>
          <p>Marketing investments during the quarter led to improved performance in crackers and snack nuts and we expect to see continued strength in 2008.  And finally, solid ready-to-eat cereal growth was driven by Honey Bunches of Oats and a continued recovery in our kids' cereal business.  Operating income margins were up 50 basis points.  Solid volume growth and productivity offset higher input costs and spending behind our growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>Going forward we'll continue to invest in the growth of this business with more innovation and base brand support.  And despite rising grain costs these investments will enable improved net price realization and lead to market share gains.  Finally the divestiture of our Post Cereal business continues to be on track for a mid-2008 closing.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 23 and I'll turn to our International Business.  It continued to post solid organic growth as we focused our investments on our core brands.  In the EU this resulted in a 4.4% organic revenue growth and a fourth consecutive quarter of solid volume and mix gains.  Growth from Milka Chocolates, Jacobs and Tassimo Coffee and Philadelphia Cheese were partially offset by continued declines in local categories.</p>
          <p>EU operating income margins declined 170 points; the reason, top line momentum and productivity were insufficient to recover higher input costs primarily dairy and cocoa.  With dairy and cocoa costs now on the rise in Europe, input cost pressure is expected to worsen in the near term.  In response, we are increasing prices across almost half of the portfolio in Q1.  As a result, we expect to see difficult near term year-over-year volume and margin comparisons.  At the same time, the integration of the Danone Biscuit business is on schedule.  It will enhance both our growth prospects and our margin in the EU over the course of 2008 and well into the future.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 24 and finally lets look at Developing Markets.  Here again our focus on core categories and brands delivered another quarter of double-digit organic net revenue growth.  Q4 growth was driven by Jacobs Coffee and Milka Chocolates in our EMEA region and Oreo and Tang in both Latin America and Asia Pacific.  At the operating income line margin was down 4.5 percentage points.  This resulted from a combination of investments in marketing and distribution infrastructure and higher input costs ahead of pricing.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, Q1 will see soft volumes and a lower profit margin versus a year ago, this is because of significant price increases related to input costs and a one-time volume reduction in 2008 due to a shift to local sourcing with the opening of the new cheese and powdered soft drink plant in Bahrain.  However, we expect both these actions together with the integration of the Danone Biscuit business to improve our developing market results as the year unfolds.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 25 and just a few notes on cash flow before we go to questions.  Our full year discretionary cash flow was $2.3 billion down approximately $200 million from 2006.  The entire decrease is due to the decline in operating income with some offsetting changes in the balance sheet.  Capital expenditures were flat versus 2006 at $1.2 billion, but I would note that we continue to aggressively manage our working capital after adjusting for the Danone Biscuit acquisition, we reduced our cash conversion cycle by 4 days from 51 days last year to 47 days this year.  We had solid improvement in inventory and payables, but we see further opportunities going forward.</p>
          <p>So, to summarize on page 26, I would echo Irene's earlier comments.  We have had a solid start to our three-year plan to return Kraft to profitable, to reliable growth.  We remain confident that our investments and cost reductions will maintain our operating momentum and deliver at least $1.90 of EPS ex-items in 2008.  Our strategic actions are strengthening our portfolio and future growth prospects and by 2009, we will be well positioned to reliably deliver our long-term targets of at least 4% organic net revenue growth and 7 to 9% EPS growth.</p>
          <p>That's it for our prepared comments, now we'd be happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I will keep it to one question.  I guess it sounds like you were anticipating in 2008, some moderation in input cost, particularly in the second half and I guess, I am wondering one, kind of how prudent is that in this type of volatile market? Or is that really a function of dairy with the other inputs kind of still expected to be up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Eric I think as Tim said, we certainly expect to see input cost up at about the same rate as we saw in 2007.  The reality, though, it would be a mirror image of what we saw in 2007.  So the moderation comes from the fact that we'll be lapping the spike year ago, but we do expect to see input costs up at about the same rate.  The good news though is that our brands are strengthening and we are able to recover those input costs as a result.</p>

          <p>I had a couple of questions for you and Tim, I guess this probably falls in your camp.  Jim Dollive had previously indicated it was important for Kraft to maintain its Tier 2 commercial paper rating and I was wanting to know if you can tell us if your CP rating continues to be a guidepost in your financial policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me talk a little bit more broadly about capital structure and as we see it today.  As you know, we first became independent we were under utilizing our balance sheet.  Over the course of this past year, we repurchased about $3.5 billion of stock and borrowed $7 billion to buy Danone Biscuit.  Today, I would say the leverage on our balance sheet is pretty appropriate. I think the leverage metrics are currently in pretty good position, which supports our BBB credit profile.  I do believe that Kraft is well served to maintain investment grade and I think access to CP markets provides operating flexibility that is of value to us.  Our focus; there may be some mix changes in our leverage structure, maybe we switch some between fixed and floating, maybe move the maturity schedules and put in the right currencies and so forth.  But, overall, the levels are pretty appropriate for us.  Our focus now is expanding our capacity by improving our cash flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good and just one follow-up question on that.  You have already termed out a portion of the debt related to the Danone acquisition, can you tell us anything about the timing and the markets that you are considering to term out the remainder?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I am just -- continue to wonder about the baseline level of earnings, you always talk about comparability but really the best level of comparability is the GAAP earnings and others in the sector have gone to looking at GAAP.  These charges have been with us since you became public.  Why do we continue to think that they are non-recurring?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, we laid out a restructuring plan in 2004 that we then updated in 2006.  We are finishing up that restructuring plan and we expect to end that as we exit 2008.  Our plans then, as we go forward and we hit our stride in 2009, will be to report on a GAAP basis and we've made that commitment and we are underscoring it again today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.  Just want to follow-up on the dairy side.  So, you've indicated that I think that the front half will be the tough part on dairy comparison, but Irene, I really like you to talk to us a little a bit more about the strategy on how you repair the cheese margins and why the price increases haven't come at a much faster rate and been much more significant? A 53.8% decline in operating profit is just an absolutely astounding number.  And, I would think that a commoditized category or one that has much more of a commodity feel to it would be much more receptive to prices that were predicated on the underlying commodity.  Also in your answer could you just overlay this with your, the mix improvements from some of the new products that you've launched within that particular business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  First of all, David I think the issue of recovering the input cost has everything to do with our brand equity and our pricing power.  So, although we actually took some very significant actions on our cheese business, our pricing realization was not as strong as we would like it to be because we don't yet have suitable brand equity.  As I mentioned, we're starting to see some encouragement on our Singles business as we have made investments in base marketing as well as in new products like Singles Select.  But the key to our future in cheese as it is in so many of our businesses is continuing to insure that we have invested appropriately in quality, in marketing support and in innovation to be able to realize those price opportunities.  Having said that I think if you look at our results for 2007, you can see that there is already more pricing power, we already have more pricing power across the portfolio than we've had in quite some time and our plan in 2008 is to be able to recover more of those costs, but has everything to do with our ability to build our brand equity and to build our innovation pipeline and we still have some work to do on cheese, but I think we are &#x2013; at least we've made a good start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you would say the key here is watching market shares and that would be the lynchpin before you would want to go much more aggressively on price to prevent margin declines like we saw in the quarter.  Is that a fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, let me just talk a little bit about 2007 fourth quarter and what happened with raw cheese prices.  Traditionally, we see a spike before the holidays in barrel cheese prices and we tend to price to an average and don't hit the peak.  In 2007, which was very uncharacteristic, barrel cheese prices stayed up at that peak level for a prolonged period.  They've started to come down now but they stayed up at that level.  We didn't price to the peak, we priced to what we'd expected to be an average and we kind of got caught.  By the time we realized that it was too late to price as we had already put in place our holiday promotions and so forth.  So as we go forward we are going to revisit our pricing paradigm and look at being more precise to raw material input cost as opposed to kind of anticipating what historical patterns have been.  So we will more closely price with the barrel cheese prices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess also in that vein, I guess Irene you said you didn't get the realization I guess because you took some pricing in cheese and foodservice but didn't &#x2013; could you talk about the mechanics of that?  I mean what would be &#x2013; I guess, let me ask you this way but what would be the downside to taking more aggressive, much more aggressive price increases and perhaps not protecting some of your holiday promotions and suffering the volume penalty and in answering that if you wouldn't mind to commenting, I don't know Tim if you rather do that about private label price gaps because it's clear to me in this category and a lot of others that some of these store brand and deli cheese manufacturers are much more under the gun than you are to take pricing and so I guess if you maintain those price gaps I would think that you'd be looking at a much softer sort of landing here in terms of operating profit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Tim's comment helped to understand the impact on the fourth quarter which was simply that the curve stayed up and we were priced to a lower level and we did not react fast enough because historically we would have expected that curve to come down in the back half of the year.  Going forward we will be pricing much more aggressively and we will in some cases be sacrificing and at least in the early months as the consumers adjust to new higher price point we will sacrifice some volume.  We believe though that it will be an industry phenomenon and we will be able to continue to grow share in the face of those pricing actions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I ask about marketing spending and where things stand at the moment, there was obviously the big step up in overall investment in the business in 2007 and I understand that a lot of that was focused on the fourth quarter.  Can you tell us how much that step up was in the fourth quarter?  And perhaps more importantly for the whole of 2007, did the consumer marketing as a percent of sales hit that sort of 7 maybe slightly higher than 7% level and where do you anticipate it being during the course of 2008?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Already, as you'll see on a year our aggregate spending hit about 6.9%.  So, we are making some good progress as we exited 2007 and made the necessary investments in our Wave 1 initiatives.  As I mentioned in 2008 we are going to continue to make progress toward our longer-term target of 8 to 9% revenue and we expect that the aggregate spending including Danone will be in the mid 7% range.</p>

So, I won't talk about any specific ones today, but I assure you that productivity is a critical piece of our program in 2008 as it has been historically.</p>

          <p>Going back to Cheese Irene, I understand your comments there about why it will be a second half phenomenon there, that's kind of what we are looking at with cheese prices as well.  But I'm wondering if it could be a really good second half under the following scenario; if you know some of your innovation indeed allows you to kind of keep more pricing than you might ordinarily have maybe a better comp contribution from mix as pricing begins to fall, what would prevent the second half from being significantly better?  Would it be private label competition since that seems to be kind of stubborn even at the high price levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I don't want to get into hypotheticals on our guidance.  We are starting the second year of our three-year plan.  If, in fact, we start to see that the market reacts better than we expect to the pricing action, we will continue to invest in our franchises.  So, I hope the optimistic forecasts are accurate, I think we are planning prudently, but if in fact we do see some upside and in fact the volume impact recovers, the volume recovers faster than anticipated, we will be able to continue to make some investments in our franchises.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Irene, this question on innovation at CAGNY I remember we talked about the innovation pipeline, which needed some serious rebuilding.  And so far this year you've had some market share traction in some categories and you've had some hits but I am wondering given the changes you have been making in management incentives and the organizational changes that you think might help you become more of a focused organization per division on innovation, I am wondering if you could give us a sense about, maybe the real inflection point on your innovation effectiveness, when that might happen in '08 perhaps and what the innovation cover really looks like today?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, I feel much better about our innovation pipeline today than I did a year ago.  We are going to share a lot of &#x2013; give you a lot more visibility of that at CAGNY but just a couple of the items that I talked about are not just new items that we launched in 2007, they are platforms.  So Oreo Cakesters, for example, is our entry into a $1 billion snack cake category.  We've got a whole pipeline that comes behind that.  Ultimate Pizza is our entry into the upper mainstream pizza segment and you will see some new items coming in there.  LiveActive Cheeses is our entry into the $500 million pre and probiotic category.  You will see some additional items there.  So as you look across the portfolio, in addition to some of the actions we are taking on core businesses like our Maxwell House Coffee, 100% Arabica product as well as our pourables items which have been significantly upgraded, I think you will see a much more robust pipeline than we had a year ago and that's what gives me the confidence that we can maintain our top line momentum even as we are taking the pricing that we've indicated.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Irene, it's been interesting to see the industry and the way they are going about pricing and obviously the whole industry has been playing catch-up because no one expected the cost to rise as quickly as they did.  But I am wondering if some of the pricing initiatives you are taking now, do you feel good enough about sort of the quality initiatives and where your portfolio is across the board?  That you can take pricing now that is more anticipatory of what may or may not, but could happen from an input cost standpoint as we go through the year and even into '09 and beyond.  Will '08 be another year where hopefully you are kind of still catching up but maybe getting closer or is there a potential to really be ahead of it, based on what you are trying to do with pricing like in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I think there is no question that our pricing power has improved.  If you look at the 5% revenue growth that we turned in, in 2007, we've got two points of pricing in that growth together with three points of all mix, which I think is a stronger performance than you have seen from us in quite some time.  2008, we're going to get a lot closer to recovering input cost given the high levels, though, I am not expecting we're go much ahead of that but I think, as Tim said, particularly as we look at markets like dairy we are looking to get much closer to the marketplace so that we don't find ourselves caught behind.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just have two questions for you.  The first one, I am just curious relative to your developing markets business, are there ongoing investments there that will continue to kind of constrain the operating margin progress in that division given the strong revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're going to continue to make investment Chris, in the developing markets.  We've seen double-digit growth from that geography and we expect that that will continue going forward.  As we look ahead though we will continue to take aggressive pricing actions as part of that.  So I think we will continue to see improvement in our overall margins.  There is &#x2013; in some of our individual markets, there are some one-times in the base that might mask that a little bit.  But in aggregate, we are looking for improved margin expansion from our developing markets as we are from the EU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And my second question just relative to North America.  You have obviously spent a lot of money on sort of the quality upgrades, some marketing in the R&amp;D, the new products.  And throughout the year we saw product mix weakening &#x2013; product mix benefit to the company weakening from North America itself.  Is that, given &#x2013; is that due to a certain category, usually beverages can kind of shift there or is that just related to the new products, we're not seeing -- seeing less of an incremental benefit there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually I think it was just a mathematical impact to the fact that volume started to become a bigger part of the equation.  So I think you are going to continue to see, in 2008 as I mentioned, pricing will play a bigger part in our overall revenue growth and mix will continue to be important.  As we look at the new items in our pipeline, they are generally higher margin than their base counterparts and we expect that trend to continue, as well as the impact that we are seeing on our base business as we migrate some of our base products like Ultimate Pizza, like Jacobs' Symphony to the upper mainstream end.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Irene, I guess I am very focused on profit margin expansion and I want to go back to the question, in the past 2002 year margins were 21% at the consolidated level, this year around 14%.  I know you said you cannot go back to 21%, but in that long-term growth algorithm of 7 to 9% EPS growth.  What are you thinking about margin expansion, and if I can and that's really a question, but I want to expand a little bit on your point here, if I am not wrong your marketing expense was 6.9% at CAGNY, that's what you said in 2006, so as a percentage of sales it did not increase.  So, I'm trying to think is that good or bad, in a way maybe it is good, because we have seen your volume grow, we've seen your mix, your innovation, but on the other hand I am thinking you are going to go from 6.9 to 8 to 10% that's going to be a drag on margins for a while.  So help me think through that and combined with that, of course, you know, maybe the long-term upside on profit margins?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me see if I can help you through that Pablo, our 2006 marketing A&amp;C investment was about 6.8% and we took it up to 6.9%.  So, we now we thought 10 basis point increase, but more importantly within the face of these unprecedented commodity costs and I feel very good about that.  So, as we enter 2008 as I mentioned, we are targeting to be more in the mid seven range with the addition of Danone and we'll continue to be making some investments, but not quite at the same rate as we were making in the past.</p>
          <p>The question with respect to margin expansion let me see if I can help you through that.  Clearly, our strategy is working and we will continue to execute that strategy in 2008.  We will see margin expansion as Tim and I said, but it will not come quite as rapidly as we had hoped because of the fact that higher costs are going to necessitate price increases and we will see some dampening impact in the near-term on volume as the market adjust.  The good news is, we clearly are seeing brand strength, our brand strengthening as a result of the investments that we have made, and so we expect that over time we will continue to be able to benefit.  We will be able to benefit from the operating leverage that we've laid out in our growth algorithm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just follow-up there if I may, you know Europe, your operating margins are 10%.  I mean Heinz and Kellogg. maybe different markets, different products.  They have 17, 18% margins, there is a huge gap there.  I mean what's, are we looking at you know 20-30 basis points a year only?  Where did your comps in North America, and Europe, your margins are way below peers and I don't know is that an issue you think with your products, your markets or is there room for faster margin expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pablo, there's no question that our EU margins need to expand and we are in the process of taking a number of actions there.  We had a very strong performance this past year on the top line in the EU after many years of decline and I think we've got our base business moving in the right direction.  Our focus in 2008 will be to begin to expand margins and we've got a number of initiatives in place to allow us to do that over the next few years.  So, we're not satisfied with our margins in the EU but again I believe that the investments that we have made in our core brands like Jacobs and like Milka will serve us well as we move forward and we start to recover more of the input cost.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You indicated that European commodity costs have now started to increase.  The question I have around that is why the delay relative to the US?  What has changed and is your pricing ability in Europe better or worse than that in the US?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say there is a couple of differences.  Europe we tend to use more powdered dairy input products and that has lagged a little bit general dairy in North America.  The other thing is, we're much more cocoa is a much more important input cost in Europe as for our chocolate business.  So, that's the lag and I would say again as we continue to execute our strategy in Europe as we do globally to build our brands we think it will give us more pricing power, we'll be better able to withstand the input cost increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the consumer in Europe more willing to take on the price increase than the US or different is there any &#x2013; can you just talk about the consumer acceptance of higher prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think consumers ever like to have higher prices, but I think that there is a general recognition that across all categories the consumer is going to be facing, globally, increasing prices as a result of the run up in commodities.  So we'll just keep having to push at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  My question is, you know consumer staple investors have more and more been looking at companies with high exposure internationally thinking that North America is under a lot of pressure from a top-line perspective and their growth is international.  In your forecast for '08 I thought I heard some negative outlook on commodity costs in the EU and volume in emerging markets.  Are you expecting profit growth, specifically profit growth to lag internationally compared to the rest of your portfolio and would you even think that despite maybe an 8% benefit here from currency that profits could actually be flat internationally in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually Robert, we're looking for margin expansion across the portfolio.  As I mentioned before the first half will be a little more challenging because of the higher input costs relative to a year ago, but we expect to see margin expansion across the portfolio and around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so do you, if you look at international and North America, where do you think more of the profit growth is coming in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no question in the near term more of the profit growth will come from North America and of course that's almost 80% of our portfolio.  So that makes you feel pretty good.  In the EU, we will continue to build on our base momentum while we expand margins and it will take us a little bit longer to get there.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on, the last several years &#x2013; let me start here.  It seems like your guidance and your plan for this year assumes kind of a run rate of commodity cost going forward and that hasn't been the case at the start of each of the last several years.  In other words, commodity prices have continued to increase.  What's the risk if that happens again this year and what can you do about it beyond just looking for further price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue to focus on productivity, reduction of overhead certainly and though we can't &#x2013; we aren't forecasting what will happen to commodities.  Obviously, we have taken a view to reflect our earnings guidance, but we are expecting that we will continue to see pressure in commodities, particularly in the first half of the year and particularly because we have the year-on-year comparison where they were at a lower level and we saw most of the increase in most of the commodities coming in the second half.  But we will continue to invest back to build our brands.  We think we've gotten good traction there.  We think we have better pricing power, but of course we are going to be continuing to focus on productivity and overhead reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Your next question is from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the follow-up.  I guess the first question, just more of a technical question, is there -- given the changes and I guess better performance on the restructuring, I had assumed that there was roughly 500, 550 million or so of cash cost from the restructuring in '08.  Is that still accurate or should that be less given the changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the cash cost will be about the same.  It may drop a little bit commensurately with a reduction in the overall program but I would say directionally that number is pretty good,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  And then as a follow-up, I just &#x2013; I mean I am just not clear exactly Irene, on the -- kind of how all this flows and that I think Danone you said would be initially dilutive to margins.  The Post deal roughly $0.07 to $0.13 annualized dilution and margin dilutive once that hits, how does all that square at the end of the day with margins still being up and input costs being up?  I just &#x2013; maybe it's because I already include the divestiture of Post in our numbers as I think most analysts have already done.  Help me kind of bridge this gap?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually very simple.  Eric, our margins will be up.  They will be up a little less than they would have been on our base business because of the addition of Danone.  They have got a very attractive margin but as you know international margins are a little bit lower than the Kraft average.  So it's just simple math but the net of it is that the guidance that we've given you assumes margin expansion as a consequence of the pricing actions that we are taking together with our productivity and our overhead leverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that doesn't include any impact at the Post divestiture?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that Post divestiture still, are those numbers the 7 to $0.13 is that still a reasonable number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with a step back.  The guidance that we have given assumes that Post is in for the full year.  We don't know when that will take place and therefore to try to anticipate an additional variable about when it may take place and what actual impact it will have for the year, we chose to keep it in there and when we get close to that happening we can better define a date, we will update you on what impact it would have, and it is still, you know, we are generally looking at a mid-year type timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Your final question is from Virginia Chambless with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Actually a question on the divestiture of Post, I think when you initially announced that, you indicated that you are intending for about 950 million of sort of debt transfer debt assumption by Ralcorp.  Is that still the intention so that net debt will be reduced by 950 million as part of that transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's what we are intending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then another question on the short-term debt balances, I mean clearly pretty large at around 8 billion at the end of the year and part of that is the Danone bridge, but can you sort of give us some guidance on how much commercial paper you are comfortable sort of operating the business with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the level of commercial paper is obviously at a peak.  We did try to go to market with more of the Danone bonds late last year and the markets were not conducive to going forward.  We clearly want to bring the paper, commercial paper down to more normal levels.  We do have $4.5 billion worth of backup standby credit line and so that puts some limitations on our CP ability.  The part of that obviously is that we had a bridge loan on funding but that's not drawing in commercial paper.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, our AB2 ratings are quite important to us.  So we are maintaining our leverage consistent with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would a more normalized level of CP been, maybe the $2 billion range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to keep an active program and on an ongoing basis that's probably directionally correct.</p>
