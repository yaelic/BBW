        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and welcome to this webcast presentation of Syngenta's first half results. I'm joined today by John Ramsay, CFO; John Atkin, COO of Crop Protection; and Davor Pisk, COO of Seeds.</p>
          <p>Also here with us is David Lawrence, Head of R&amp;D, and we will all be happy to take your questions by email or phone at the conclusion of the presentation.</p>
          <p>I like to first start with the highlights of the first half of 2008, which is shaping up to be another great year for Syngenta. Once again, we have seen substantial growth across all our product lines and all regions.</p>
          <p>In emerging markets, our sales were up 36%, which is a considerable achievement and a clear indication of the role we are playing in improving agricultural productivity there. Acres under cultivation have increased over the last 12 months. But the main driver of our sales growth has been usage intensity, with growers increasing their application of crop protection products in order to  take advantage of higher crop prices.</p>
          <p>Our performance in crop protection has been simply outstanding.  Since we last spoke to you in April, our confidence in our ability to sustain price increases has further risen, and we're seeing what we believe to be a durable expansion of demand for all our products.  In seeds, our field crops business has shown record growth in Europe, while in the US, we passed a major milestone with the launch this year of our triple stacked corn.</p>
          <p>Strong performance of our business overall is reflected in the first half earnings per share growth of 36%, and our confidence in the future is underpinned by a portfolio adapted to the needs of growers worldwide at a time when the spotlight is on the ability of agriculture to meet the challenge the world faces today.</p>
          <p>I would like to now briefly remind you of that challenge. In seven out of the last eight years, agricultural production has not kept pace with demand. This is a result of a number of factors &#x2013; low incentive for growers, inadequate government policies, and a general failure to recognize that dwindling stocks to use ratios would inevitably lead to rising prices for key commodity grains.</p>
          <p>Population growth, economic prosperity in emerging markets, and to some extent bio fuels, are driving this demand which we expect to increase by an annual average of 2% over the next five years. And yet stocks to use ratios are already at a low level, which this year's global average increase has done little to alleviate. The onus therefore is on yield, as you can see now on this next chart.</p>
          <p>Over the past decade, yields have increased on average by just over 1% a year, as you see in the green bar on the left of this chart. The blue bars show you the rates of yield increase necessary to return to a stocks to use ratio of 20% by 2013, which is widely regarded as a necessary safety level. If acreage continues to expand at the average rate of the past decade, just 3.3 million hectares a year, then the average rate of yield growth must increase from 1% to 1.7%, and without any acreage growth at all, yield growth would need to more than double.</p>
          <p>It is therefore clear that yield increases must not only continue, they must accelerate if demand is to be met. And this is where our business will make a key contribution. A contribution which is already apparent in the results we're presenting to you today, and which underpins the strategic decisions we are now making.</p>
          <p>John Atkin and Davor Pisk will provide more details shortly but first let me hand you over to John Ramsay for a review of the financial results. John?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mike. Good morning. I should like to start with the financial highlights of what was a very strong first half performance. Sales reached $7.3 billion, which represents a 20% increase at constant exchange rates.  This rose EBITDA up to $2.3 billion, a 21% increase. Earnings per share rose 36% to $16.53, driven by higher operating income. This is an increase of 41%, excluding the receipt from Delta &amp; Pine Land in 2007.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, at $240 million, was higher than the underlying rate in 2007, driven by improved profit performance of the business and a lower rate of working capital absorption.  Our strong cash flow once again enabled us return significant sums to our shareholders.  In the first half we returned $800 million in the form of dividend and share repurchase.</p>
          <p>Turning now to sales performance.  Reported sales rose 28% from a base of $5.69 billion in 2007.  The weakness of the US dollar meant that currency had a favorable impact of $453 million or 8% of sales. The bulk of the positive impact came from outstanding volume growth in crop protection with seeds also achieving strong growth.  Price contributed $184 million, with increases across the business. I will say more about price in a moment. Sales at constant exchange rates therefore rose 20% to reach $7.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Turning now to crop protection performance.  Sales at $5.55 billion were 21% higher, driven by an 18% contribution from volume. Consistent with the outlook we gave at the first quarter, price was up 3%. In the second half, and going into 2009, I expect a higher level of price increase than that achieved in the year to date.</p>
          <p>Volume growth was achieved in all product lines and regions, and was primarily driven by a significant increase in usage intensity as growers sought to maximize yield in a high crop price environment.  John Atkin will explain this in greater detail.</p>
          <p>EBITDA at $.2.02 billion was 25% higher at constant currency, and the margin, again at constant currency, reached 36.1%, an increase of over one percentage.  This increase was driven by volume and also a $150 million price increase.  Over half of this increase was for products other than glyphosate, which more than offset higher raw material costs of $30 million, again excluding glyphosate. Together with cost savings from our operational efficiency program, this allowed us to make additional investment behind growth projects of $80 million.</p>
          <p>Seed sales at $1.74 billion, rose 15% with volume the main driver, adding 13% with 2% contribution from price.  As in crop protection, growth was widespread, with notably strong performances in the emerging markets. EBITDA at $272 million was 21% higher.  The EBITDA margin improved in constant currency by 60 basis points to 14.9% driven by good growth in high margin businesses such as vegetables and diverse field crops.  And, although US corn acres were down, the margin was helped by an increase &#x2013; increased proportion of proprietary US corn products.  The improved margin allowed this to continue to increase expenditure in R&amp;D and marketing.</p>
          <p>Operating income was just over $2 billion, and as you can see on the right of the chart, with a margin of 28.3%.  This was primarily driven by business performance with a further $94 million delivered from our ongoing cost saving program.  The rise in the cost of oil has been offset by hedging in the first half, therefore I anticipate an overall increase in raw material costs for the full year, excluding glyphosate, and still limited to around $60 million despite a further increase in the cost of oil.  Increased marketing and R&amp;D expenditure amounted to $114 million in the half, representing investment in significant growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, despite achieving significant sales and profit growth in strong market conditions, we have not taken our focus away from cost efficiency.  Here you can see the projected savings from the current program and the annual cash outflows. We have adapted the program to meet the higher demand that we have seeing, notably in the crop protection market, and just now target $290 million in peak savings in 2011, compared with our original target of $350 million.</p>
          <p>Our production facilities are currently working at maximum capacity and it is critical that we maintain our ability to meet market demand and also expand for the future. We're in very different environment to that which we faced only one year ago.  As you would expect, the costs of achieving these savings are also now lower and we target a total cash out flow of $550 million compared to $700 million previously.</p>
          <p>Our focus for the remainder of the program is on development and G&amp;A expenses, and these targets remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Now looking at net income, net income at $1.58 million rose 33% or 37% excluding the non-recurring income in 2007. The increase was driven primarily by a $352 million increase in operating income. Tax paid was higher than in 2007, and represents a rate of 22%. I expect that we will be able to maintain a tax rate in the low to mid 20s over the medium term. Overall, the result was an increase in net income of some $400 million.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, free cash flow of $240 million represents an improvement on 2007, as the prior year benefited from one-off receipts totaling $196 million.</p>
          <p>The cash flow was driven mainly by higher EBITDA and an excellent working capital performance, with average trade working capital as a percentage of sales down to 36%, compared to 41% in 2007. In a strong demand environment, we are seeing good receivables collection and low inventories.</p>
          <p>Our continued strong performance and cash generation allowed us to return some $800 million in the first half. On the 25th of April, we paid a dividend totaling $450 million and during the half, supplemented that with share repurchases amounting to $349 million.</p>
          <p>We thus are well on track to meet our target of returning up to $1 billion in 2008 as a whole. This means that in the years from 2004, we have returned some $3.7 billion to shareholders and on that positive note, I will now hand over to Davor for a review of the seeds business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. Good morning. As Mike said in his introduction, market growth does not depend on acreage expansion but is driven primarily by the adoption of technology. Advances in seeds have accelerated through marker-assisted breeding, and in addition GM seeds continue to gain in importance with global GM acreage up 12% last year.</p>
          <p>The US has led this expansion and is now moving rapidly towards stacked products. These developments lie behind the forecast substantial increase in market value from around $24 billion in 2007 to 30 billion or more in 2013, and over 40 billion in 2020. Growth will come from a range of crops and Syngenta has a broad crop portfolio that is positioned to take full advantage of these trends.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008, our sales rose by 15% at constant exchange rates, to $1.7 billion. Our corn and soybean sales were up 7% despite the US corn acreage decline and advanced sales in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our US corn portfolio is in the middle of a transformation as we move towards a fully traited offer but we expect to have held share. Our corn business in all other regions is growing strongly.</p>
          <p>Soybean sales showed excellent growth in the US and we will continue the expansion of this business in the coming season in Brazil. Sales of diverse field crops, comprising mainly sunflower, oil seed rape and sugar beet, increased by 27% with outstanding growth particularly in Eastern Europe. Vegetables continue to perform strongly throughout Europe, reflecting our focus on high value crops and the consolidation of Zeraim Gedera. Flowers growth reflected the consolidation of Fischer in Germany, acquired in September last year.</p>
          <p>Now let me go into more detail on each of the key product lines. Starting with our progress in corn and soybean in the US, where we're on track with the upgrade of our corn offer and our strengthening in opposition in soybean. Market dynamics in the first half favored soybean, with acres up 17% against a 7% decline in corn. Against this backdrop, initial indications are that the floods in parts of the corn belt will mean some decline in harvested acreage compared with growers original intentions.</p>
          <p>As a result we expect strong demand for corn in 2009. Although corn acres were lower, demand for technology continue to grow, and we successfully launched our proprietary triple stack under the Agrisure brand. We covered the targeted 600,000 acres and met with excellent grower uptake.</p>
          <p>We have shown you before the pace at which we will ramp up our traited offer with introduction of multi stacks from 2010, and more traits bringing more value per bag. That value is enhanced by the combination of traits with our elite germplasm. Over the last three years we've been selecting the best hybrids from our three brands and these already account for 40% of our offer.</p>
          <p>Corn and soybean markets outside the US are becoming more important and our sales of corn and soybean there have grown by an average of 14% a year. Growth accelerated in the first half of 2008, as with early prediction of lower US corn areas, growers in other regions responded by increasing acreage.</p>
          <p>We have capitalized on this opportunity with our improving germplasm offer, which has led to combined sales growth of 38% in the emerging market regions of Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>While GM corn at present plays a very limited role outside of the US, there is increasing readiness to pay more for improved hybrids, which can significantly enhance yield. Across Europe, we have launched a number of new products which have broadened our presence across maturities.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, the approval of our Bt-11 trait in Brazil will enable us to play a leading role in the introduction of new corn technology there. In Argentina, we already sell both Bt-11 and our glyphosate-tolerant corn, GA21, for which we recently received <mark type="audio gap" /> EU import approval.</p>
          <p>Our corn trait pipeline contains an exciting range of projects spanning input and agronomic traits, as well as enzymes targeted at improving the efficiency of biofuel production.</p>
          <p>So to touch on some of the highlights. Next year we plan to launch our second generation traits for broad spectrum insect control, VIP/broad lep, with a new mode of action which represents an important new tool in the management of insect resistance. VIP/broad lep will form part of our multi stack offer. The decision of DuPont Pioneer to license this technology is a clear indication of its importance to the market.  In biofuels, corn amylase is at an advanced stage and is awaiting US FDA approval. And we have highly competitive timeline for the launch of drought tolerance.</p>
          <p>Looking now at other businesses. We saw exceptional growth in our diverse fuel crop business in the first half, reflecting both technology expansion and share gain. We believe that these drivers will sustain strong growth in the future.</p>
          <p>In the US, we launched glyphosate-tolerant sugar beet, which demonstrates the benefits of a broad crop portfolio in exploiting a technology offer. The launch has brought a 25% increase in sales and a market share of some 35%. Our sunflower business in Eastern Europe registered growth of over 60%, as we leveraged our strong position in the region, including a 50% market share in Hungary to take full advantage of increasing acreage and investment. Oilseed rape is also growing rapidly in Eastern Europe with a sharp rise in the level of hybridization.</p>
          <p>We continue to drive our vegetables business through the introduction of innovative products meeting both consumer and grower needs. The example shown here is of a new mini cluster tomato which is reinforcing our leadership position in this crop, with an excellent consumer response due to its taste, appearance and texture.  Over many years we have developed an understanding of consumer taste which is enabling us to meet very different regional preferences.</p>
          <p>We do so through out leading marker platform, which draws on a global germplasm base.  This is enabling us to create more value in the market.  The mini cluster tomato for example sells at 2.5 time the price of an average tomato.</p>
          <p>China represents a huge opportunity for our vegetable business.  The world's largest market with some 20 million hectares under vegetable cultivation.  Sales have almost doubled this year in response to the introduction of a new business model promoting our products directly to growers.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets have risen dramatically in importance for our seeds business and in the first half of this year alone, sales totaled over $5,000 million or 29% of the total.  The move to higher value seeds is accelerating in these markets, with a general expansion in corn and I've already mentioned the growth of oil seeds in Easter Europe and vegetables in Asia.  In Latin America we look forward to the continued roll-out of our glyphosate tolerant V MAX soybean in Brazil in the coming season.  Growers have responded enthusiastically to this variety as its early maturity allows a second corn crop after the soybean is harvested.</p>
          <p>Underpinning our success in all these businesses is a steadily increasing level of seeds R&amp;D investment. We're accompanying this with capital investment in key areas including corn and soybean production facilities in the US, in order to keep pace with expansion of our offer. China is increasingly recognizing the benefit of GM technology in food and feed.</p>
          <p>As announced in April we will participate in this opportunity with the establishment of a research center in Beijing for the early evaluation of GM and native traits in key crops. And we are starting to maximize the value of our proprietary technology through licensing agreements with DuPont and Monsanto.</p>
          <p>In summary, the importance of GM technology in modern agriculture is clear. With around 80% of US corn and over 90% of US soybean now genetically modified with herbicide-tolerant or insect control traits. And the number of companies with a serious presence in this technology is small by virtue of the complexity of the science and the time it takes to bring traits to market.</p>
          <p>While we are still in the process of building up our corn offer in terms of quantity, we are more confident than ever in the value of our technology and the role it will play in the future development of the market. By increasing our R&amp;D investments in seeds, we've also been able to advance our vegetables and diverse field crop businesses, which already deliver excellent margins.</p>
          <p>And across all our product lines we're building on our leading position in emerging markets, rapidly expanding sales as growers move to improve the quality of the seed they plant. Over the next three years our business will continue to show robust growth.  And with the rollout of the proprietary corn traits  it is firmly on track to deliver an EBITDA margin of 15% in 2011.</p>
          <p>And now let me hand you over to John Atkin for a review of the for the Crop Protection business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Davor. Hello everybody. Before I start to go through the slides, I'd like to comment on the importance of crop protection in the context of today's food crisis. You've probably heard it before &#x2013; without crop protection products, world food production would be 40% below its current level. An alarming thought with today's low stocks but we should also look at crop protection in a wider context. At a time when growers are paying more for fertilizer, for energy, and for seeds and when water resources are becoming increasingly scarce in many areas, basic crop protection enables growers to safeguard their investment in these inputs.  But more importantly, with current food costs and shortages, the optimum use of the best crop protection technology enables yield to be increased well beyond average levels, thereby maximizing land productivity.</p>
          <p>Our strategy therefore is aimed at bringing the best technology to growers throughout the world. It has proved its worth through three years of market share gain and now the fact that growers are investing more in their crops to drive yield means that our peak sales targets are well ahead of earlier estimates. This lies behind our decision to expand manufacturing capacity over the next two years in a way that will exemplify our strategy of being the lowest cost producer for all our products.</p>
          <p>And I'll be telling you more about the main products concerned in a moment. But first let's delve a little deeper into usage intensity, which is the key driver for our crop protection business. Western European markets have for many years been flat or declining as a consequence of reduced EU support for productivity and low commodity prices, but 2008 saw a big change. Take the example of France.  The elimination of set aside by the EU had some impact, but the main driver was high prices for wheat and barley. This led already relatively sophisticated growers to invest more in their crop. 25% of acreage received an additional application, compared with last year. Dosage was increased on 27% of acres. 60% of growers increased their fungicides spend and data we just received estimate that the fungicides market is up 19%. Finally, the graph shows what growers know. Increased investment in fungicides produces higher yields.</p>
          <p>Now take a look at the impact technology investment has already had on wheat in key European markets where average yields approach 8 tons per hectare. China and India are well behind, partly for agronomic reasons, but Russia and the Ukraine are lowest still. There is no reason why these countries cannot achieve yields closer to the Western European level.  All it takes is investment in the technology and know how available today. It's a similar picture for corn. The US is the world's largest corn producer and also the leader by far in terms of productivity. Recent advances in GM technology and crop protection have driven yields close to 10 tons per hectare. In China, the second largest producer, yields are only 60% of that and in Brazil they lag further behind still. This gap between developed and emerging market productivity is a major opportunity for our business.</p>
          <p>Let me now show you how we're making the most of it. In the first half, emerging markets accounted for more than 30% of our sales, up from under 20% five years ago. The growth rates are stunning, even in the context of an exceptional environment, for example, sales are up 80% in Argentina, 65% in the Ukraine and 50% in India. We are rapidly increasing the number of products available in these markets with over 80 new product launches for this year alone. And we've taken on some 650 new employees to expand the business further.</p>
          <p>Turning to our portfolio performance in the first half. Growth was broad-based across regions and across product lines. The products you see here played a key role and form a major part of our future strategy. In selective herbicides, the expanding cereals market, and the excellent performance of AXIAL resulted in sales almost doubling, while the expansion of Callisto outside the United States continued.</p>
          <p>An exceptional performance in non-selective herbicides reflected unprecedented demand for TOUCHDOWN in response to higher glyphosate-tolerant acres in the US and Latin America. GRAMOXONE, our other non-selective, also showed significant growth as growers using minimum tillage systems exploited its fast activity to accelerate crop rotation.</p>
          <p>Almost 30% growth was recorded in fungicides, indicating that we are strengthening our leading position in this product line. The star performer was the Amistar range, which I'll be telling you more about in moment.</p>
          <p>Insecticide sales were higher in all regions, but particularly strong in Latin America and Asia where Actara is playing a leading role. Globally, sales of Actara were up by a third. We are showing you seed care as a separate product line for the first time, so you can fully appreciate the scale and performance of this business. Sales were up in all regions driven in particular by CRUISER, which took full advantage of higher soybean acres in the Americas, and a new registration in France.</p>
          <p>Now adding a little more color to this picture. The launch of the Callisto family took place at a difficult time with corn prices drifting towards $2 per bushel, and yet, sales grew dramatically even in the lean years. Further, this was against the backdrop of GM penetration, which changed grower practice and made the herbicide market much more competitive.</p>
          <p>Now this is because mixture products such as Lexar and LUMAX gave growers a clear yield on convenience advantage, helping them to counteract the low crop price. Now, despite the reduction in US corn acreage, Callisto growth continues, particularly in Europe. And new launches are planned, including in Asia for rice, where we had first sales in South Korea this year.</p>
          <p>The Amistar range is redefining the definition of a blockbuster in the fungicide business, with sales approaching $600 million in the first half of the year alone, it is now sold on 120 crops in 100 countries.</p>
          <p>Amistar has a proven yield-boosting effect in addition to excellent disease control. This is a story of mixtures with 12 products in the Amistar family. Each brings specific performance and convenience benefits. Market leading examples are illustrated here. They all have further growth potential, and there are additional mixtures in the pipeline. Amistar is consequently a major component of our capacity expansion program.</p>
          <p>One of the most important products in the Amistar range is Quilt. Launched last year in the US in response to increasing disease pressure. Growers discovered that they obtained a significant return on their investment in Quilt with yields plus five to 10% or more.</p>
          <p>You can see why in this interesting photograph, which clearly shows a larger cob with more grains, 16 rows in the treated versus 13 for the untreated. In launching Quilt, we have exploited our strong position in the US corn market, including an industry-leading field force, and are set to take a significant share of a market that could reach $500 million with a further growth opportunity in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Turning to our leading insecticide, thiamethoxam, the second major component of our capacity expansion program. It's exceptionally versatile. It is used in both &#x2013; as both a soil and foliar insecticide under the name Actara and as CRUISER seed treatment.</p>
          <p>Success is illustrated by the growth rate of 23%. New broad spectrum Actara mixtures are particularly strong in Latin America and Asia, where they are replacing older inferior technology. CRUISER is expanding globally on number of crops, most recently rice, where the need to boost yields has become critical. It has been the key driver of our seed care business, which you can see on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Our record in seed care speaks for itself, and the outlook is particularly positive. More growers are using Seed Care to protect their investment in high quality seed, including GM. The leading contributor, CRUISER, will expand further following an agreement with DuPont under which Pioneer will use the products on their North American corn seed. AVICTA, the first Seed Care product, for nematode control will also play an important role. It has proved its performance on cotton in the US and will be launched in Brazil this year and then on corn in the US for 2009.</p>
          <p>And, now to TOUCHDOWN, Syngenta's glyphosate, which enables us to participate fully in the expansion of the GM market. We have a differentiated offer by virtue of our broad portfolio, with convenient mixtures and programs that deal with the growing problem of glyphosate-resistant weeds. The latest addition is Halex GT, launched this year, a unique combination of glyphosate, mesotrione and S-metolachlor, for post emergence use in corn.</p>
          <p>TOUCHDOWN is focused on the Americas and we have consistently gained share over the last three years. In the first half our sales are up by 90%, of which half was price increases offsetting higher product costs. To mitigate these costs and enable further growth, we have now signed additional fixed term supply agreements with two Chinese producers.</p>
          <p>Moving on to new products. To better reflect the pace of innovation at Syngenta, we now define new products as those launched since 2006. Their combined potential is over $1 billion. The chart shows you data for each, with raised estimates for durivo, REVUS and AVICTA. We had the first launch in the durivo range in Indonesia this year on rice. The results in the field were spectacular and sales were more than five fold the original plan.  Several other territory launches will come in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The fungicide REVUS, launched last year, is now registered in 26 countries and showed rapid growth in the first half. I already talked about AVICTA and AXIAL.  The point to note here is the outstanding growth potential for both products.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline has a peak sale potential of over $2 billion. Since I showed you this chart in February, we have made further progress. Examples include 520 where fuel and safety testing is at an advanced stage and we recently approved initial plans for investment in production capacity.</p>
          <p>We've also added Cyazypyr to the portfolio, which we have developed jointly with DuPont. Cyazypyr is a second generation <mark type="inaudible" /> for broad-spectrum insect control. It will complement durivo,the range we are currently launching. The collaboration agreement will lead to greater development speed and a broader product choice for the grower.</p>
          <p>So, in conclusion the world needs more food, feed and fuel, and without greater crop protection usage agriculture cannot provide it. That is the simple reason why we are positive on the market outlook. The momentum of our sales performance over the last 18 months clearly demonstrates that Syngenta is going to continue playing a leading role in this positive environment, not least because of our strength in emerging markets where the growth dynamic is most compelling.</p>
          <p>In all four major food and feed crops, there is strong demand for further yield enhancement through the use of the best technology. Our portfolio comprises many of the best products in the industry and they are already playing a leading role. The capacity expansion program we have announced today is founded on our confidence in the most important of these products, the Amistar range and Actara CRUISER, which we estimate to have a combined peak sales potential of $3.5 billion compared with 1.2 billion achieved in 2007.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the expansion program will be consistent with our strategy of being the lowest cost producer of all our products.</p>
          <p>Now with that let me hand you back to John Ramsay, for more detail on the program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. John has taken you though the exciting prospects behind our capacity expansion, which equates to $600 million over the period 2008 to 2010. The bulk of the investment will be in expanded capacity for thiamethoxam, the active ingredient in the blockbuster products Actara and CRUISER and for azoxystrobin, which is marketed as Amistar. The major part of the investment will be focused at our established plants at Monthey in Switzerland and at Grangemouth in the UK, which therefore provides us with the fastest and lowest cost option. This expansion will allow us to meet significantly higher demand for these proven products as was described by John. We expect a fast payback of under four years with initial benefits to be seen already in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the next slide you can see the shape of the projected capital expenditure with the bulk occurring in 2009. For our combined crop protection and seeds business, around $350 million of recurring core expenditure is required for ongoing sustenance and range expansion. As well as supporting the growth of azoxystrobin and thiamethoxam, the expansion program will also enable us to expand capacity for a range of other products enabling us to capitalize on the broad-based increase in market demand.</p>
          <p>Some 75% of the crop protection expansion relates to <mark type="audio gap" /> including investment in raw material capacity. Whilst crop protection represents the vast majority of the investment in expansion we will also be making further investments behind our corn and soybeans seeds business. In addition, in 2009, I anticipate a total investment in intangibles of about $150 million, which includes securing important supply contracts for glyphosate.</p>
          <p>As the next slide shows, our strong balance sheet allows us to make these investments to meet the strong demand whilst at the same time allowing scope to make further acquisitions and continue to return cash to shareholders.</p>
          <p>We have comfortably achieved our ROIC target of 20% after tax and we are maintaining this target for the future. In addition the strength of our financial position is evidenced in 2007 by an interest cover of nearly 15 times and gearing at 23%.  In 2008, I anticipate a continued high interest cover and a year end gearing around 25%.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, the strong market outlook, the particular strength of our portfolio and business model, enhanced by targeted short payback investments, lead me to confidence in future cash flows. This will enable us to continue with our policy of a strong balance sheet and progressive dividend, whilst retaining the flexibility for acquisitions and share repurchase, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in this regard in February.</p>
          <p>With that I will hand over to Mike for his concluding comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John. As I said earlier, 2008 is set to be another outstanding year for Syngenta. The strong first half performance has enabled us to raise our target for full year growth in earnings per share to over 35%, compared with a target announcement in April of over 20%. We're also raising the target for 2009 to high teens growth against double digit announced previously.  And this of course, taking into account the higher base for 2008.</p>
          <p>This is a clear indication of our confidence in the market and our business. The capacity expansion program for Amistar and Actara CRUISER will be earnings-accretive from 2010. As you've heard, these compounds have huge growth potential with estimated peak sales up $3.5 billion. And they will be instrumental in our drive for continued market share gain.  And this in the context of a larger market, which we estimate will grow over the medium term at mid single digits.</p>
          <p>So, to conclude, demand for food and feed will continue to grow at around 2% a year. Food security is moving up national agendas as governments recognize that hunger and malnutrition are set to increase unless there is a step up in production. Rapid acreage expansion is neither practical nor desirable.</p>
          <p>The immediate and sustainable solution is to improve productivity. The rate of yield growth globally must accelerate by 50% or more, and there needs to be an intense focus on emerging markets, so that growers there can start to match the levels of the productivity already achieved in developed countries.</p>
          <p>In crop-protection we are already tackling the challenge through unique compounds, which because of our board portfolio, we can leverage in multiple firms to meet growers' needs across the world. In seeds, our trait offer's expanding and our broad and global germplasm base is well adapted to the increasing focus on high value seeds.</p>
          <p>We are investing in the future of agriculture, both through our sustained R&amp;D spend, some $900 million a year, and through the major investment in new capacity announced today. Our strategy is aimed at bringing the best technology to growers throughout the world. And in so doing, making an essential contribution to food and feed production.</p>
          <p>So, thank you for that and now I am ready to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Of course we will take questions by e-mail as well. I see we've got a question from Michael Eastwood at Morgan Stanley. Good morning Michael.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks I wonder if could ask a few. I am interested in the visibility of your price increases in 2009.  It's unusual I think for you to give a year ahead price increases. So, are those price increases that you have already managed to start passing?  Are you starting discussions? Could you give us some anecdotal evidence of what you're doing with your distributors and within your network and how you're coming up with 4 to 6%. Again, is that based on discussions already started.</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on the acquisitions in seeds that I think you've been &#x2013; discussed on Reuters this morning. Can you us an idea of size that you might be prepared to spend up to, bearing in mind, John's comments on your balance sheet. And then thirdly, looking at China, two questions there. I believe there are regulations which are going to prevent transport or sale of chemicals around Beijing for the third quarter. Do you expect that has any impact and what percentage of the glyphosate that you're going to be supplied by Chinese producers, what will that be as a percentage of your total glyphosate raw materials supply? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you, Michael. There's really two broad themes there and maybe John Ramsay, if I could ask you to address our balance sheet flexibility to take on additional acquisitions in 2009 and beyond.  Maybe say a bit about the glyphosate increase that we expect in 2009.  And John Atkin, of course has been hard at work already in 2008, but we've had some price realization in crop protection and is getting geared up for the 2009 season and John can address your questions on pricing. But first, John Ramsay on acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In acquisitions, our strategy hasn't really changed, Michael.  We're continuously on the lookout for acquisitions as you know appropriate for adding to our existing business and that continues. I think it will all depend on the size of the candidates that come forward I think the point about the balance sheet is that we do have some flexibility, but &#x2013; and really is no change in the strategy at the moment and we're continuously on the look out for targets as they come available, particularly in the add-on opportunities in seeds in the technology area and perhaps in the professional products. So, the strategies remains the same.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do I recall hearing of 40% as being the ceiling or am I wrong there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're not going to get tied down I think to a specific gearing level, I think the important point is to ensure that we maintain the existing credit rating. And that of course can &#x2013; is measured by a number for factors around the balance sheet and the cash flow. So very keen to operate within the context of maintaining the existing gearing. And having said that, as you can work out, that does provide us with some flexibility given the current balance sheet of cash flows that we see. So far as glyphosate is concerned, I think the recent additions in terms of securing contracts are supplementing our overall glyphosate position. And we have sourcing from a number of sources now and are fully covered in that respect, in respect of the demand that we see into the foreseeable future. So we are well covered on the glyphosate front.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We &#x2013; the Chinese Olympics &#x2013; Beijing Olympics, Michael, won't impact our supply position in any way in China. The visibility of price increases &#x2013; well, first of all as you'll appreciate, every country and every territory's different in terms of when price lists go out and when the season is. Let me give you a concrete example. In Latin America, Brazil in particular, as we go into the season, which is just ahead of us, our prices are already becoming very visible and it is our broad objective to be exercising price leadership wherever we can. I mean we are leaders in many of these markets and we intend to be first out with our prices. Latin America is our first example and we'll be following that trend throughout the world, but as you'll appreciate, it's all different and many countries have yet to get into their stride for the season ahead of us. But the assumptions we've made are in this 4 to 6% range as you've pointed out, although our target is much higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask when you are passing those price increases, how much you are using raw materials as a lever and how much you are using your new products, how much you are using for overall demand. What is the main driver of these vertices as you market them to your customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, for our customers of course, the fact that we have significant &#x2013; the industry &#x2013; I am talking about fertilizers and a whole range of inputs have had significant rises because of costs. I mean we talk a lot about the cost base to them. We also talk about, and they appreciate, the value of our technology particularly the newer technology, and that's a factor as well as making sure in some cases that customers in their minds, they have enough product to meet their need. So all of those factors play some role, but of course the cost increases and potential cost increases are a factor.</p>

          <p>So we've got <mark type="inaudible" /> from Credit Suisse on the line. Good morning, Ryan</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, good morning, I've got couple of questions as well. The first one is on seed margins. You are maintaining your guidance of flat seed margins year-on-year. Obviously you had a little bit of a kick up in the first half, partly currency related, partly underlying. You've also got strong growth in emerging markets, which should reduce your loss in the second half.  Are you planning increased R&amp;D and marketing spend in the second half over the first half? Is that the reason behind your flat guidance? The second question is on US corn acreage. You say you held share, now all your competitors are saying the same thing although they increased share. Can you talk us through a little bit through your competitive situation in the US? And finally, can you talk us through VIP/broad lep and how you see the competitive position of that versus some of your American peers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, if we can start &#x2013; if John Ramsay can take the question on margin and then Davor Pisk and I'll look to the extent that we can at this time of the year on the market share for corn. I am sorry, Ryan, the third question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the VIP/broad lep and how you see that related to <mark type="inaudible" />, obviously you are launching a little bit earlier now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, The broad lep. Okay good. And Davor will take that as well. John, the margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the seeds margins are concerned, you're absolutely correct.  There's an up-lift in the gross margin in seeds in the first half of about 100 basis points and I anticipate that probably to be a bit higher by the full year. But that really is in line with what we were expecting because what is happening of course, as we grow the higher margin business of vegetables and diverse field crops and also get more proprietary corn into the portfolio, we are going to see an increase in the gross margin and that will continue into 2009, 2010, but at the same time we are investing in line with our plan in additional marketing and research. So, for the 2008 here, that increase is consumed by additional expenditure, hence you get the same, a flat bottom line EBITDA margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you believe that the marketing and R&amp;D spend will be significantly more in the second half than it will be &#x2013; than it was in the first half or will it be more or less comparable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The level of increase in that spend in the first half, compared to the first half 2007 will be mirrored in the second half. So you'll see a &#x2013; sort of &#x2013; the rate of spend will be similar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Davor, the market share evolution and broad lep in our seeds business in US corn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's still &#x2013; we're still waiting for data on the market as a whole in terms of competitor performance, but we do know what our sales performance is, and obviously what the corn acreage is, and as best that we can judge at the moment, we believe we've held share. The important thing to recognize though is that we don't see 2008 for us necessarily being around our market share position. The important thing this year has been getting our triple stack established in the marketplace, that's gone extremely well for us. We've also seen very good share increase in our soybean portfolio as well. So that gives us confidence for the future. In terms of the broad lep, this is novel technology. We're very excited about it. It will bring a new mode of action to the market. Obviously, the interest from other players in the market to access this technology is an important indication of just how highly it's valued. So we're very excited about it. We're still waiting for; obviously, the regulatory approval and we'll be able to update you more in terms of the competitive positioning of that product once we get the registration through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just like add that, as we described to you then last year, the addition of Bt-11 with our broad lep product, we regard as being the best in the business. So where there is a pest pressure, a broad spectrum insect pressure, we think we're going to have an extremely competitive technology that will be marketed. Let's go to Jean de Watteville from Lehman Brothers.  Good morning, Jean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning, Jean Watteville, Lehman. First of all, a clarification on crop protection pricing. I'm not sure I entirely understood the 4 to 6% price increase guidance, is that for the second half of '08 or is that for 2009. And related to these question, I think you recently, Mike, said in an interview that assuming further inflation of the oil price you would expect to go beyond 10% price increases.  I would appreciate if you can describe the link you're building with you're &#x2013; the retail chain between your raw material prices and the price inflation. The second question is regarding the corn feed's technology. Monsanto makes a strong case on the  smart stacks the combination of the various trait allows potentially reduce the refuge. Can you elaborate if that is also a possibility with your multi trait technology and if that's not the case can you describe how do you believe it will be possible to maintain your market share against smart stacks? The last question is on the 3.5 billion guidance you have on the Actara and the CRUISER and Amistar families &#x2013; product families. It's quite a strong growth you're guiding. Can you give a timing for that? Can you tell us if there is any price inflation you expect? Or can you just give any color that could help to build a bridge between the 1.2 billion and 3.5 billion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So we've got a seeds question around smart stacks and then there's two on crop protection, one the guidance on the new products and of course trying to square the 10% price increase on the back of oil hikes with the mid single digits that we just talked about. I can assure you that the 4 to 6% that John just mentioned is for 2009, but John, the 10% price hike versus the 4 to 6?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean the &#x2013; we expect to go into 2009 as Mike's hinting with increases at the higher end of that mid single digit range, and obviously as high as we can possibly get. We're targeting higher increases and I am sure you'll appreciate there's a difference between an assumption and a target. And those targets will be worked through and are being worked through by product, by territory and by customer, and of course we'll do the best we can in order to fully compensate for raw material increases and to pay for our investment program and of course to return money to compensate &#x2013; to our shareholders, I mean, these are the three objectives. And that's what we are attempting to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the new product's 3.5 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah. Okay, well, first of all, let me give you a couple of pointers. We will go to 3.5 billion over the next few years and we will probably see that around 2012. We will of course show a quite a significant increase on the 1.2 by the end of this year already. There will be a price component of that. You could take the mid single digits we've talked about as a component. I mean we are not looking beyond 2009 in terms of price. And I think it's worth stressing that if I can just say that the Amistar family, we're looking at two or three areas which will bring additional value for the future. Expansion of corn fungicides, we talked about.  The expansion of wheat fungicides I think we illustrated to you on those charts on wheat and corn just how much of a gap there is between yields in markets which don't use much fungicide compared with those which do. So that's one of the major drivers and then in CRUISER and Actara, there's a whole range of new uses.  We have CRUISER rice, the launch of AVICTA which also incorporates thiamethoxam, and the expansion of CRUISER itself through the Pioneer deals. So there are lot of components of these and these products &#x2013; many variants across many territories. I hope that gives you a little bit more color on the programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Davor.  Smart stacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the important thing to remember here is the grower is looking ultimately at yield and convenience of growing his crop and the answer isn't simply in any one particular offer, and what Syngenta has is broad technology, whether it be in the form of excellent germplasm, GM traits, our Seed Care portfolio, as well as our crop protection chemicals. So what &#x2013; how we are positioning our offer opposite the grower is a complete solution of inputs, which help him maximize his yields, get maximum value, and with extra convenience. It's also worth noting that in terms of our portfolio you've already seen on the chart earlier, we've got new technology that we're planning to launch over the next few years, both with our VIP/broad lep, but also with our second generation rootworm control product, which we expect to launch in around 2012. So, all of these things, I think will strengthen our particular portfolio.</p>
          <p>On the refuge, it's important I think to remember that the EPA haven't decided exactly what the policy will be, whether they will change their existing refuge strategy. We're certainly working with the industry and the EPA to make sure that any changes are for the good of growers and for the industry as a whole so that we don't take any risks with any change in strategy there opposite so potential resistance problems. So, we are confidant that we've got the technology and that will allow us to compete whatever the new refuge strategy turns out to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically just to understand it, if Monsanto gets the approval from the EPA for refuge reduction, you would start &#x2013; you would ask for the same privilege to the EPA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just to be clear, the refuge reduction request is right now is pending in the US South to go from 50 to 20. So, growers are still going to be involved in refuge management and what the &#x2013; Davor just mentioned is critically important which is, does Syngenta have the technology to be able to offer yield improvement for the insect pressure that's there and between our Bt-11, the 62 that's coming out as well as the new insect below the ground technology. We've got &#x2013; we're going to have a competitive offer, and again that is an evolving story and we think we've got when we need to do to have a complete solution.</p>

          <p>So, we've got an email from <mark type="inaudible" />. Why not raise the EBITDA margin target this year after strong business mix impact and also gross margin improvements in corn and soybean? John Ramsay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, we are raising our EPS Patrick, targets. I think basically in terms of EBITDA, we are going to see an improvement in EBITDA which is commensurate with that. I'm not sure if your question is relating specifically to seeds, in which case I think we are very much, in terms of seeds, on track as <mark type="inaudible" /> describing in answer to earlier question. We're seeing a gross margin improvement coming through in seeds that was planned and we're putting additional investment into research and into marketing, so we are not increasing the EBITDA target for 2008 in seeds. But coming back to the overall business, we are seeing an overall improvement in operating leverage, we are seeing 100 basis points improvement in the margins &#x2013; EBITDA margins for the overall group at the half year and that will continue into the second half. We are putting more money into growth in the year, probably more than $200 million into growth investments in the full year, which is going to fuel growth going into 2009 and 2010, and with the levels of growth that we're predicting, we'll see very substantial operating leverage on the bottom line as we go into 2009, 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Andrew Benson from Citigroup. Good morning Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for that. Can you just explain the &#x2013; your oil hedging policy and the impact that's going to have this year &#x2013; and the &#x2013; what you think may happen in 2009 as well? You said that you've got EU approval for the import from Brazil of the Bt-11, when are you actually shipping or will this be first year that you actually can ship stuff to Europe and has that caused a problem or do you think that should be okay? Amylase corn &#x2013; if we can have an update on that given you plan to launch it next year.  How does it crack out? On the sugar beet, the GT sugar beet, is that your technology, in licensed technology, and what's the potential of that? And then can you talk about the potential of Callisto in rice. I just want to confirm &#x2013; it does look like the CapEx is going to go to 900 million in 2009 and then fall fairly sharply thereafter. just wanted to confirm that that's the case. Does that mean you're likely to put your share buyback program on hold in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll just handle quickly you had three straight questions. First on Bt-11 in Brazil, Bt-11 is already approved for cultivation &#x2013; for importation, rather, in Europe. So &#x2013; and we have been breeding that into our corn now these past couple of years. So we are already in the process then of shipping corn for commercial use in Brazil.  On sugar beet...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Sorry. Is any stuff from &#x2013; that has been grown in Brazil, actually been shipped into Europe yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bt-11 is just now being sown, is being planted in Brazil. But if it were shipped to Brazil &#x2013; from Brazil to Europe it of course would have all the regulatory clearances that it needs to be imported into Europe.</p>
          <p>With respect to sugar beet, the sugar beet technology &#x2013; sugar beet germplasm &#x2013; the seeds business known as hillashow very, very strong brand and we've been very pleased with the launch of Roundup Ready beets in the US this year and that technology has Monsanto technology in it and it also has some proprietary Syngenta technology. So we are marketing it under the hillashow brand in the US and it's been again a great success this year so far. Corn amylase is on the &#x2013; is right now with the USDA. We can't know precisely when it will be approved. When it is we're looking forward to beginning a process of commercializing that in these big corn ethanol plants.  We're &#x2013; on the basis of some of the trials we've done already we're very encouraged by what we've seen. In terms of improving the yield of corn into those ethanol plants a number of different value benefits and so we are looking forward to that registration. In the mean time we continue to plan for scaling up trials in 2008 later on this year. Callisto in rice, John?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I mean Callisto is a very important product for us as you know, with sales of over $400 million. The rice extension is going to bring something in the 5 to 10% range in additional sales. I mean it's very early, we've just launched in Korea. It's new technology and we're very optimistic about it. But it will be something of that order. Important but less important than expanding further in corn as we've shown that we've been doing over the last couple of years particularly in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, Andrew, you asked the impact of our crop protection capacity expansion on the share buyback. John Ramsay, you want to say something about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. I suppose the short answer to your question is that the CapEx expansion, it &#x2013; does not affect the policy on share repurchase.  As you know we take a view on share repurchase in February each year, when we've got visibility of the previous year's full year cash flows and perhaps more of a view of what acquisitions we're likely to be engaged in. Our policy's not changed, we have a strong balance sheet and we want to retain that and give us the flexibility for a commitment to a progressive dividend, flexibility around acquisitions and share repurchase, and that's the reason why we leave it until February to take a final view particularly trying to get some more visibility on acquisitions. As you can see from the figures I put up in the presentation, combination of the cash flow and the balance sheet positions shows that if anything our strength is improving and with a gearing probably around the 25% at the end of 2008. Then, I think, we're retaining the flexibility that we require, but I will update you again in February as to exactly what we decide in respect of share repurchase.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the oil price &#x2013; the oil hedging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the oil price yes. We take hedges which basically protect us for a period on the oil price and with these levels of increases, you can see in the presentation that we do have hedge gains which are offsetting the impact of oil.  Take the year as a whole, 2008, you can largely say that there's a relatively small impact from oil in context of the total cost of goods including other cost increases, we're seeing something like about $60 million of raw material cost increases to do with oil and other factors and that's after the offset for hedging. Going into 2009, we do have some hedges in place but there will be an increase in the costs associated with oil that are coming through above the hedge level and consequently why we are putting some emphasis on price increases, which will more than offset what we anticipated to be the effect of oil and other raw material costs at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2008, it's more like about $40 million for the full year. Depends on how &#x2013; where we end on the price of course. I think I'm right in saying the half-year is about $30 million or something like that. But the important point about hedges of course is that they only offset the cost increase for a period.  At the end of the day, they run out and you're exposed to what the market prices are?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" /> from Deutsche Bank. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning. Thank you very much. I've got a few questions, first of follow-up question on seeds. I'm just trying to better understand your seed margins potential in particular for next year. Let's say you guided to what &#x2013; I think 50 million annual increase in seed R&amp;D expenses.  Could you please confirm whether this is still the case and also what are your estimates for marketing expenses increase? On the US acreage, could you please give us your estimate of the corn versus the soy acreage next year in light of the <mark type="inaudible" /> this year and also the shortfall expected especially in corn? And also could you please try and quantify the benefit in 2009 from the cessation of royalty payments on Bt-11 to Monsanto. And all in all, would doubling of the operating margins be reasonable in 2009 versus 2008?</p>
          <p>My second question is on fungicides.  I understand you saw sales growth of 29%, could you please give some overall numbers on the market growth and also explaining where you've been gaining market share, region- and product-wise? Another question on your forecast, your base forecast of cereal planting acreage in Europe in 2009, and if you expect to see any residual effect from the set aside abolishment that we saw this year. That's it for now. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, so two broad questions. First, John Atkin, if you can address the sales growth overall and where we think we've gained market share this year and some &#x2013; we've got some thoughts about the 2009 market acreage for cereals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I can give you a couple of pointers on that. I did mention that in France the data we have on the market suggest that it's up 19%. You'll appreciate, the season's not finished in the sense of collecting all the information. So that's what we have so far, and I can tell you that in Latin America, overall, we do know that we have gained share. I am talking about Brazil, so in Brazil overall we do know that we have gained share because the data there is through. Elsewhere it's too early to comment on market share. Plantings, we &#x2013; the real opportunity here I think &#x2013; I hope we've illustrated to you is increasing yield through better land productivity through the use of fungicides and insecticides, herbicides to improve productivity and that's where the performance increases will come from.  The planting for 2009, we do not know, it may be up slightly. But I don't think we'll see a big increase in Europe at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you John, And turning to the seeds question, I'll ask Davor to comment on the estimate for the acreage expansion for corn and soybean in 2009 and perhaps comment on the Monsanto agreement.</p>
          <p>But there is a need to front end of it was you had a question about Seeds R&amp;D expenses and the evolution of our margin between 2008 and 2011. And if you were to look at the chart that we had, I can't recall the page exactly, but it shows that we are basically on track for the evolution of our portfolio in our US corn and soybean business &#x2013; our US corn business rather, to progress it from what is really a single traited offer to a multi trait offer by 2011, and so our margin is going to progress over those years in some &#x2013; in a very familiar shape to that curve that you see there. Remember though, our margin expansion in seeds is not just driven by US corn. It's driven by a lot of other factors.  We're growing across our field crops businesses globally, we're making a lot of progress in our soybean business,  we grew soybean share in 2008 as near as we can tell. We've introduced new varieties of soybeans with much success in Brazil.  Our field crops business in Asia Pacific, particularly Eastern Europe, is growing broadly.  Of course many year-on-year success stories with vegetable seeds. So, all of that growth is going to be part of driving our margin expansion from 5% this year, the target that we continue to maintain, to 15% by 2011, and we look forward to that migration. And you ask about R&amp;D expenses in seeds, we said another $50 million this year. We're still on track to do that as we indicated and there may still be some more in 2009, but we feel very good with the progress of our R&amp;D effort there as evidenced by the new traits that have come out. Davor did you want to comment then, on the Monsanto agreement and how we see the market acreage for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, first of all on Monsanto, I think the important thing to emphasize is this was a complex fraud settlement.  A number of different elements and we wouldn't want to split out anyone individual item. But what it does do is it really reinforces, underpin our confidence in delivering the margin improvement which Mike has just talked about. So we're firmly on track to achieve an EBITDA margin in 2011 of 15%.  This just gives us more confidence in doing that. So it's very positive for us. In terms of the acreage, the USDA have recently come out with some early estimates for next year which put corn up at 94.5 million acres and soybeans at about 70 million acres. At this point in time we have don't have any reason to take a different view. I think those seem a very fair reasonable expectations, but it's' obviously still very early, but sensible for planning purposes I think.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike. Yes, thank you for taking the questions.  Couple of things.  Firstly, just wondering, if you could run through perhaps in more detail, what exactly you expect to get out of the CapEx. So there's obviously the three products, could you tell me what the incremental revenue is for your $600 million expansion? And the second question is drought tolerance. I think. Davor. you mentioned that you feel you've got a fairly competitive timetable in place. Could you remind me of the timetable both for the crop protection side of the portfolio and for the seed side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well our drought tolerance offering of course has both a genetically modified version and one that is native trait and we've made an announcement earlier this year on Invincia in our crop protection business, John Atkin could we start with Invincia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Invincia is going great.  We continue as before. Everything is &#x2013; everything is on track and we feel very optimistic about &#x2013; we've some great data coming out of the field just in the last few weeks. So we are confident.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think, we've got a couple of things &#x2013; this is developments so whenever you do development you need to &#x2013; and this is the first time we've had such a broad development program with this technology. So we target &#x2013; our very first launch is next year and we think we can achieve it. But we've still got a quite a bit of work to do before that point, and we will keep you updated as we go.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And Davor, on the drought tolerance corn offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have seen some really good trial results from our native trait program and so we're gaining confidence in what that's program is going to able to deliver growers and we're still on track for a launch of that native trait program in 2011. The GM trait's a little bit behind that, and we are currently targeting &#x2013; I think you would have seen from the slide that I showed earlier on, a launch in the 2014 period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, John Ramsay, question around a little bit more understanding around the revenues underneath our expansion CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay thanks for the question, and I think just try and put a bit of &#x2013; some color around the overall CapEx program, which I think is behind your question in terms of the revenue. This is in respect of the two products which John has described the market opportunity we're opening up for.  There's azoxystrobin range, the Amistar, thiamethoxam, Actara, and CRUISER.  75% of the 600 million is actually directed to those two products and it is in respect of market opportunities which are already opening up. Hence why we're confident of identifying peak sales for these products of 3.5 billion.  Now, clearly, the capital expenditure and the production capacity that will be yielded from that will enable us to significantly &#x2013; to contribute to achievement of that 3.5 million. This is proven technology, it's been put up with at plants with its proven engineering. The products themselves have above average gross margins and &#x2013; the sales level with those average &#x2013; above average gross margins, there is high level of confidence in actually achieving the less than four year's pay back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you remind me of the patent situation on both of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the patent situation is fine, I mean there's a range of patents going out into the middle to the next decade broadly. So the patent issue is not an issue.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we have time for one more question from Thomas Gilbert at UBS. Good morning, Thomas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike. I have got a few questions as well, four of them. I will be quick. Currency. $169 million tailwind at EBITDA level in first half. Would you mind I had a lower number clearly, would you mind breaking it down into translational transaction and hedging benefits if possible and give guidance going forward? Then just a clarification question on the presentation slide 50, the CapEx numbers that you are showing in the graph.  Are those just tangible fixed assets or are they including the 100 and then 150 million on intangible assets that you mentioned, John. And then two general questions.  How much of your breeding of your seeds do you outsource to contractual breeders and can you just &#x2013; what is the relationship to <mark type="inaudible" /> commodity price on those costs, and how sensitive to commodity price is actually the gross margin in seeds. Is it an important driver of your earnings &#x2013; the breeding costs or not? And then the last question, just again very na&#xEF;ve probably on pricing in crop protection, is it actually that you are going out and promising here is the yield benefit versus an inferior treatment, let's say 5%.  We're sharing the benefit 50-50 with you, the farmer, and that's how we price it, or is it just based on supply and demand and oil based costs? Is there a value pricing approach like in seeds or it there none? Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, so I'll ask John to address how we do the value pricing with John Atkin &#x2013; the value pricing for crop protection.  I'll knock off your third question quickly, Thomas, which is do we outsource breeding and I am not sure whether you mean the production of hybrid seeds or whether you quite literally mean the breeding of it. We do all of our breeding in house ourselves and when we get our parent seed then in order to make hybrids, we do outsource with growers the production of our corn. So to the extent that corn commodity prices are up, of course we would have to pay growers more money to produce that, but we have long term grower contracts and &#x2013; but nevertheless there is an element of that and John Ramsay would be able to tell you a bit about how we manage some of that within the context of hedges.  But then you have got broadly a currency question and a clarification question on the tangibles. John, you want to take those next two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just maybe just adding to Mike's answer on the breeding contracts, we have a very established program of hedging opposite grower contracts. It's been running for a number of years and it's very much associated with defined risk levels associated with the potential price movement of those crops. And basically what we do is when we enter into a grower contract, we take a hedge on it and so, we offset the exposure at the time of entering the contract. So, as far as currency is concerned, yes, you are right, you probably do have a lower number and probably to be fair, Thomas, I think what probably is changing in the profile of Syngenta's currency exposure over the last couple of years is the emerging markets impact. And a large &#x2013; there is a significant part of that which we don't necessarily hedge and we can find that with the movement in the dollar that you can get a significant impact as a consequence of that. Going into 2009, we have hedges in place for most of the major &#x2013; all the major currencies and a large part of the emerging market currency, but it's the emerging market part that is changing in the profile. So far as the CapEx is concerned, the graph in the presentation is entirely tangible fixed assets, so when I mentioned the 150 million, the 150 million related specifically as a number for 2009 is what we are anticipating &#x2013; able to &#x2013; intangibles for intangibles are always a big more difficult to predict because of the sort of acquisitive nature of it. It includes things like acquisition of technologies, the investment in purchase contracts and specifically in 2009 it includes purchase contracts for glyphosate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, can I just &#x2013; sorry to interrupt, ask you for the second half, how much of the benefit currently are going to unwind in the second half and how much of the un-hedged exposure is still going to help or not help you in the second half? Just want to try to understand how much of the 169 million is going to be there for the full year?</p>

          <p>I suspect &#x2013; it's impossible to predict what happens on currency rates and as I've say, as we go into to the second half, we'll have a large part of it covered in hedging as we go into 2009, but you're looking at forward rates at the present time, unlike 2008, where we did see an additional currency benefit in the second half. This year I think we'll see some erosion in that 169 million number and probably approach something like closer to 100, I suspect as we go into the second half of 2008.</p>

          <p>If we can just wrap up then with our value pricing for crop protection, John.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>With pleasure. Yeah. We do do the value pricing, we do it all over the world, we do it with different crops and of course different products and what we assess are the benefits of our technology versus its price and in comparison with the competition. What's particularly interesting right now is that the farmers' return on investment is in advance of 3 to 1, and in some cases well ahead of that. We know that farmers are interested to use our technology down to return of investment of 2 to 1 or even less and of course this is one of the factors which gives us confidence in all that you've heard this morning. I think the third point that I would make is that we actually set prices with distributors, two distributors and it is they who set the final price to the end users. So just the give you a bit more information on the mechanics of how it works. But everything is anchored in the value proposition.</p>

          <p>Okay. And again, I'm sorry that we weren't able to take all of your questions, but if you have them I'm sure you'll be able to call Jennifer Gough, in our Investor Relations department. And with that, thank you for joining us. Great deal. Good-bye.</p>
