      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today will review of our third quarter performance and share some reflections about the business environment heading into 2011.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we continued the positive themes, fundamental execution, innovation and the momentum from the first half of 2010. This year is shaping up as one of our most well-rounded performances based on the breadth of advances and the level of new activities underway across the enterprise and we believe the underpinnings of this steady performance advancement are sustainable. They include; ever stronger and more consistent execution in the fundamentals of our businesses, strengthening clinical and operating cost management disciplines, continuing practical innovation efforts market by market, broader business diversity and expansion efforts and steady capital discipline.</p>
          <p>We believe these aspects are differentiating us in the marketplace, they translate into value for our customers and into growth, including stronger than expected revenue and earnings this quarter.</p>
          <p>On $23.7 billion of third quarter revenues we earned $1.14 per share, third quarter cash flow from operations of 2.9 billion brought year-to-date cash flows of 4.8 billion. We expect our full-year 2010 revenue will be almost $94 billion. This is an increase of roughly $1 billion from our last update with you and up significantly from the forecast at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Despite the weak U.S. economic environment, we are driving to a full-year revenue increase of 8%. And once again this quarter four of our businesses each had year-over-year revenue growth above 10%.</p>
          <p>We expect 2010 full year net earnings in a range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share, led by this strong revenue growth and a resolute focus on cost management across the enterprise.</p>
          <p>Let's break this quarter down along the lines of our distinct Health Benefits and Health Services business groups. Health Benefits reported the third quarter revenues of $22 billion, an increase of 8.8% year-over-year. Health Benefit earnings from operations advanced to $1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>We are unifying the branding of our Health Benefit businesses using the strong UnitedHealthcare brand. As we communicated to you previously and as you can see from this morning's materials, the branding integration first and foremost is designed to simplify our overall relationships with the people we serve, we want them to know that UnitedHealthcare can meet their changing healthcare needs throughout their lives, regardless of which life stage or market segment they may be in.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our four health benefit businesses continue to focus on and serve their unique markets, as sovereign business units. Across these businesses, we are serving 1 million more people than we served 12 months ago, including growth of 210,000 people this quarter.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, the strongest growth came from the commercial risk and Medicaid offerings. Year-to-date, the growth leaders are Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, Part D and fee-based commercial. This broad based advance of 1 million people in the last year is driven by the diversity of our offerings, including innovative, consumer-oriented products at lower price points and by our focus on simple, highly responsive service for our customers and for care providers.</p>
          <p>Looking at performance by product category, our Medicare Advantage program is leading the market with 270,000 new members this calendar year. Our benefits are very competitive and our distribution channel management, sales execution and member support are strong and consistent.</p>
          <p>Marketing for 2011 began on October 1 and the initial response in the marketplace has been positive. Consistent with our approach in prior years, we are emphasizing stable, predictable benefits at affordable prices and we hope to grow share in Medicare Advantage again in 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Part D program has seen a net increase in 2010 of more than one-half million seniors served, including those who buy their Medicare drug coverage through MAPD products. We continue to position the nation's leading individual Part D plan, the AARP MedicareRx Preferred plan, for growth in 2011.</p>
          <p>Due to regulatory limits on the number of basic Part D plan offerings permitted, we have consolidated our Part D Saver plans into our Preferred plan in 2011. As a result, we expect a reduction in the number of subsidized and other Saver plan participants in 2011, but we expect this decrease in standalone plans will be largely offset by new growth for 2011.</p>
          <p>Our Medicaid business continues to grow strongly, increasing 335,000 people this year. There's a steady pipeline of state program procurements across our current product categories between now and 2014, when reform-driven growth should expand the Medicaid market.</p>
          <p>We intend to be active in those intervening years as we have been for the last several years. This includes selectively responding to proposals in the growing aged, blind and disabled private Medicaid market where we can apply our deep experience in directly caring for this population</p>
          <p>In Commercial Benefits, we again grew our risk-based business this quarter with an increase of 95,000 people, bringing our growth to 190,000 people over the past six months despite continued pressure in the employment market.</p>
          <p>The key to this success is responsive and simpler service, intensive cost stewardship for customers and our focus on innovative, local market products that provide affordable health coverage, all of which combine to improve retention.</p>
          <p>The commercial market renewal rights agreement in the Northeast with HealthNet has worked well for both us and HealthNet and we are encouraged by the next opportunity we have from a similar arrangement with Principal Financial Group. Overall, we feel positive about the expanding opportunities in the health benefits market going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Health Services business groups, we believe the service market space is critical to the long term performance and cost the American health system overall, yet the service market itself is still formative at this early stage. Our company is working in partnership with others who are part of this broad healthcare constituency, focusing on helping improve healthcare as a system, making it more modern, connected, informed, transparent and simpler.</p>
          <p>Our Health Service businesses align with this strategy, offering enabling technology and an array of scalable resources and practical tools and capabilities in information, analytics, consumer engagement, compliance and risk management.</p>
          <p>We're focused on doing our part to help find more complete solutions to the challenges the overall healthcare system is facing over the next 10 years or more. These include; basic connectivity and interoperability, deeper coordination of care centered around the physician and patient relationship, informed consumer engagement and the broad application of evidenced-based medical care by primary and specialist physicians. A common theme is helping to enable higher levels of care system performance, working locally to help this nation's system improve outcomes, cost and patient satisfaction and optimal resource use.</p>
          <p>Our Health Service businesses continued their growth this quarter with combined revenues of $6.2 billion, an increase of 14.1% year-over-year. Combined earnings from operations of $352 million again paced ahead of our original 2010 outlook. We are investing for continued growth, including absorbing about $75 million this year in new market start-up and development costs in Health Services.</p>
          <p>And this past quarter we strengthened our Ingenix business through the acquisition of several leading companies in their respective market spaces, enhancing our capabilities in connectivity, informed clinical work flow and revenue cycle and clinical protocol compliance.</p>
          <p>Ingenix third quarter revenues increased by $111 million or 23.1% year-over-year, led by growth in serving the government and care provider market. Operating earnings increased 9.4% year-over-year and 16.7% from the second quarter, overcoming pressure in the clinical research market and the cost of start-up and development activities.</p>
          <p>The estimated revenue backlog for Ingenix increased by $1 billion or 48% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, with about 2.5 billion of that expected to be realized by the end of 2011. Year-to-date, total contract value on new sales increased more than 20% year-over-year for each of the customer segments of care providers, payers, government and pharma.</p>
          <p>OptumHealth grew revenue 3.8% year-over-year led by public sector contract awards and third party market growth which has been the pattern for the past couple of years. Expansion in the integrated care market and growth in financial services have contributed to OptumHealth's top line performance.</p>
          <p>OptumHealth's operating margin and earnings from operations of $143 million exceeded our original expectation, due to better growth, better operating cost performance and more moderate health system utilization overall.</p>
          <p>Due to new market start-up and development costs, costs related to the implementation of Mental Health Parity legislation and an overall decline in the commercial risk-based membership served by OptumHealth customers, earnings from operations decreased sequentially in year-over-year as we had expected.</p>
          <p>Prescription Solutions continued to grow its top line with a 17% year-over-year revenue increase in the quarter with normal PBM margin levels, in contrast to the higher margins earned in 2009. Overall, our Health Services revenues and earnings continue to perform ahead of our original 2010 forecast.</p>
          <p>UnitedHealth Group's consolidated results reflect the strong underlying performance of both the Health Benefits and Health Services businesses. Third quarter revenues at 23.7 billion increased 9.1% year-over-year, driven by strong organic growth in virtually all of our businesses. Acquisitions contributed less than 1.5% of this total.</p>
          <p>Medical cost and quality performance remains strong. Our clinical and care engagement work continues to advance and is producing positive results for customers. 2010 will likely be the fourth consecutive year of flat to down hospital in-patient usage per member in our commercial business.</p>
          <p>Clinical program success has also characterized our senior business this year. Performance improvements in hospital in-patient and readmission management, ancillary services such as radiology and payment accuracy have built an improved medical cost position as we enter 2011, as we had hoped. This will help counter the continuing rate pressures across the Medicare market.</p>
          <p>Our pharmaceutical management program continued to outperform market norms in the commercial and senior businesses. Our drug trends are consistently favorable to the market, led by the combination of aligned purchasing, science-based formulary management and market leadership in the effective use of generic alternatives.</p>
          <p>The third quarter consolidated medical care ratio of 80.1% reflects the combination of these efforts. It also includes $230 million in favorable reserve development as compared to $190 million in last year's third quarter. We expect consumer usage of the health system to rebound in coming quarters, resuming its upward growth pattern from the recent moderation in utilization growth.</p>
          <p>We will work to manage medical cost trends through affordable network relationships, pay-for-performance reimbursement programs for care providers and targeted clinical initiatives around improving quality and affordability. Health Benefit businesses will set rates and benefits in light of these likely forward trends.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated third quarter operating cost ratio of 15% was higher than we expected. We increased our commitment to new business development and to a national corporate reputation effort called Health in Numbers, which hopefully many of you have seen, and we funded increases in employee head count and compensation expenses including those related to acquisitions, the growing mix of higher margin fee-based Health Services businesses increases this operating cost metric on a consolidated basis as well. Collectively, these added approximately 60 basis points this quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>On the policy front, last week our Center for Health Reform and Modernization published a new report detailing practical options for reducing the U.S. budget deficit by $3.5 trillion over the next 25 years. This report documents, analyzes and applies data from actual scaled experiences. This research suggests that significant savings can be achieved through further Medicare and Medicaid modernization, including bringing many of the programs already deployed for large self-insured employers for many years to Medicare fee for service.</p>
          <p>The research also discusses extending to all dual eligible Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries many of the care management and coordination techniques we have pioneered in these markets. These proposals could all now be tested and deployed at scale using the demonstration, piloting and commissioning authority available to CMS under current law. We shared this report with policymakers in Washington and our hope is that the federal deficit commission will encourage the use of some of these ideas.</p>
          <p>And lastly, in December, through our UnitedHealth Foundation, we will issue the 21st Annual Edition of our Community Call to Action through our America's Health Ranking.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we plan to provide our 2011 financial outlook when we have the information needed to offer a responsible and informed view. We would typically offer that initial look in this market update, but the significant pending provisions related to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not make that possible at this time.</p>
          <p>Our early perspectives on the 2011 environment take into account a number of pressure points. They include continued high unemployment with no significant recovery in sight, tight state and city budgets that are already starting to force government job layoffs, state budget pressures also cloud the near term state Medicaid reimbursement environment, given the scheduled phase-down of a portion of federal assistance for the states by June of 2011, pressures related to ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act and Mental Health Parity legislation, there is further decrease in federal Medicare rates in 2011. This is comparatively less dramatic than the reduction of 2010 but nonetheless a negative item to be addressed.</p>
          <p>The sales season for Medicare Advantage products, as you all know, has been meaningfully shortened; and the low interest rate environment continued to affect the earnings contribution from cash and investments.</p>
          <p>Health plans will have increasing expenses to prepare for compliance with federally-mandated regulations, including ICD-10 coding and HIPAA 50/10 standards, to name a few of the larger ones. And within our company our 2010 results have been benefited from meaningful prior period developments. We recognize there will be an unfavorable earnings impact from minimum medical care ratio regulations for our commercial business in 2011, but we must await guidance from the Department of Health and Human Service to quantify that impact.</p>
          <p>Given this external environment and its uncertainty combined with our performance trends, our tone as we enter 2011 is appropriately measured. We anticipate some level of year-over-year reduction in our operating earnings and net earnings per share next year, as compared to strong 2010 results, but we simply can't quantify the extent until regulations are released and can be thoroughly analyzed and quantified at the individual market level.</p>
          <p>We are committed to making 2011 performance as strong as possible. And at this distance, we expect to build a clear path to net earnings per share growth in 2012. We're positive about what the future holds, we're committed to working constructively to make health reform a reality and helping states make practical implementation plans for the new reform measures. We are motivated by the large market opportunities before us and we are optimistic and confident we will emerge in coming years as a market leader and a high performance growth company.</p>
          <p>We're interested in your questions this morning. We'll hold to one question per person so we can speak with as many of you as possible in the limited time we have available. We will have an opportunity to discuss our strategy and our evolving businesses in greater detail at our Investor Day, which will be in New York on Tuesday, November 30.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn this call back to the moderator for questions, and thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Christine Arnold with Cowan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey there. Could you talk about some of your acquisitions and the strategy behind those recent acquisitions? I think you spent about $2 billion. And if there's any way you could quantify how much revenue and earnings you acquired, that also would be great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll have Andy Slavitt address that more specifically, but those acquisitions relate to some of the themes I commented in the prepared comments around advancing an agenda of contributing to the improvements in the maturity of the overall health system, and really plays to themes that we think have been long-standing areas of strength and competence, using information, using enabling technology and using care management, along themes of activity for one instance, around compliance in another, but basically to those common themes that we've actually been talking about for several years. Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Thank you, Christine. So we began to look several years ago at how information and analytics could be brought into the care setting in order to make technology more useful to caregivers and help improve decision-making and cost and quality outcomes, so we began that journey a couple of years ago when we acquired and subsequently we developed Ingenix CareTracker to become one of the first completely cloud computing based electronic health records and practice management systems.</p>
          <p>So this summer based on some of the important trends that Steve just mentioned, the need for better connectivity, better compliance and better clinical outcomes to support health reform, we made a couple of important acquisitions that further that strategy. We've been extending our strategy so that in addition to primary care, we can now provide electronic medical record and operating software in high acuity areas of the hospital.</p>
          <p>As Steve mentioned, we've become a more significant provider of connectivity, we're in a strong position to provide full interoperability to the healthcare system needs. And one other area that we are extending our solution offering is into compliance. Our view is that essentially all the pages of health reform will end up boiling down to a number of compliance rules that health reform will need to adopt &#x2013; the health system will need to adopt, excuse me. So we're building large information libraries and experts to help get that done real-time. In each of these cases, you see us extending our strategy to marry information and analytics with the point of care for the business process.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'd just add that none of this would be possible if we weren't privileged to be a trusted source for data security and privacy that we are. More entities, states, federal government agencies, health systems and payers are entrusting us to manage their information than anyone. So all of this capability I believe ends up at the heart of helping healthcare communities deliver on their promise for higher quality and more accountability, and we expect it to be a significant contributor to our strong revenue and earnings growth in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and in terms of size, these transactions were not that large and they came in over the quarter, so there's really no significant impact to the quarter, and we'll likely get into greater detail with respect to the individual properties, perhaps at the Investor Day. So really just not significant to the quarter at all. Next question.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Sheryl Skolnick with CRT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my question, and a lovely job across the board. I'm curious about some of your commentary about the strategic initiatives in the Health Services business. I mean, in particular you've talked about market by market solutions, I think I understood you to say something that &#x2013; correct me if I'm wrong here, but that the nature and relationships with providers of the actual structure of the healthcare delivery system are things that you're actually looking at and might we perhaps see United step outside of its historic diversified business activities and move more directly into directly affecting healthcare decision-making, spending, provider relationships through contracting or outright acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is a mouthful of a question but it's very astute to pick up on the issue of market by market. Obviously healthcare is local and how it's approached does vary meaningfully on a market by market basis. This is really an area we have actually been in for some time. Our care management initiatives have gotten increasingly more integrated into the delivery community broadly. We have had initiatives like Evercare for many years, which are clearly direct care initiatives, and areas that we've worked with in recent years in terms of Southwest Medical Clinics and so forth.</p>
          <p>So we think, and picking up some of the themes that Andy mentioned, that we can be helpful and contribute to making care more effective on an integrated fashion, enabling it with technology, using information more effectively, and continue to move in that direction. So I think that that has been consistent with what we've talked about in the past, and it will play out differently market by market because of the circumstances of each of those markets. So I don't know what I can tell you beyond that. We continue to see if we can be helpful across the broad system and in some instances, that takes us into deeper relationships in the primary and specialty care areas and we'll continue to probe that, we find it to be productive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciate the commentary about some of the headwinds facing you in 2011. I guess is there anything that you would highlight on the other side of the equation, anything that you look for as a real opportunity into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I think the momentum that we have across our business, the performance -- I could ask Gail Boudreaux to talk a little bit about how the market is responding in terms of our commercial offerings and so forth. I think those are very positive signs and actually if you take a look across all of our businesses. the total expanse of it, I don't think we've ever had a year that really had performance across as many levels as we have had at this enterprise. And our service continues to strengthen, our responsiveness to the market continues to strengthen and our efforts around innovation and so forth are really just picking up. So I'll ask Gail to talk a little bit about the commercial market space, but I think all those things play into positives for 2011 and going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Steve. Good morning, Kevin. In terms of the commercial marketplace, I think we feel, as Steve mentioned in his opening comments, positive about the momentum that we're building. A few things as we think about what's going to be required for employers and what's resonating in the marketplace today. The first is really a focus on total cost management. As we look at the growth that we saw over the last two quarters, particularly in the risk business, those are really based on affordable consumer products and we are seeing nice uptick in each of our markets around that. Many of our markets are growing &#x2013; about two-thirds &#x2013; so we see that as an opportunity right now.</p>
          <p>And then employers, really three things again there, that focus on affordability. The second, focus on consumer engagement. Many of the tools that we're putting into the marketplace around transparency and an ability for employers to help employees live healthier lives, improve their health and wellness have had a nice resonance in the market. And the last is around consumer engagement, and you see that in many of the tools that Optum puts out in the marketplace and again that's contributing to our growth on the fee-based large employers as well. So as we think about the opportunities to manage cost, that's where the momentum is coming from and our opportunity to do that in our local markets where we've repositioned ourselves over the last couple of years.</p>

          <p>Okay. And if I could just maybe follow up on that cost question there. I mean, I guess we've been kind of expecting an increase in MLR as the year went on and yet we saw it down sequentially. I mean, can you give some thoughts about what's happening there? Is it a change in benefit design? Is it that consumers are not responding the way we would have thought? Maybe the deductibles are still maybe too high? Maybe we won't see a snap back in volumes the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you could reframe that. I'm not sure I was keeping up with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So the &#x2013; I guess we've been thinking that given the change of benefit design over the last couple years, that we would be seeing low MLR at the beginning of the year and it would increase as the year went on. And in Q3 we didn't really see the sequential increase we might have expected. I guess are we reaching a point where the change of benefit design has been so great that people -- or the economy is just so weak that people are looking at this deductible as just maybe so high that they really won't use the healthcare system the way that we thought they would or maybe &#x2013; I'm really kind of wondering whether we're facing a situation where -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think it's &#x2013; I actually think people are more engaged &#x2013; our data would suggest people are more engaged with their healthcare, are becoming more informed consumers, that the consumer designs are increasingly &#x2013; enable them to use the healthcare system in a more intelligent, informed way. So I think those things are factors. If you're really talking about the totality of how trend has played out through the course of the year, there's just several major factors that have played into that. The economy could clearly be one of them and we're also not clear that that add is sustainable at all. Mike?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Kevin, it's Mike. I would separate the issue between the deductible that you mentioned and that Steve commented on from the sequential medical loss ratio. As we've seen the year play out, we've seen continued moderation of utilization and continued favorable development that have contributed to a lower loss ratio, and we're seeing that really across all the businesses. And so I wouldn't try to connect the deductible wear-off, per se, to the reported BCR. We are going to see and we have seen increased utilization, albeit on a lower baseline this year as a result &#x2013; as the deductibles start to wear off. So I would make sure you're not connecting the two, per se.</p>

          <p>Yeah. The only thing to answer your question specifically about deductibles, we have not seen an acceleration in deductible year-over-year. It's been increasing about 10% a year, so in total that isn't accelerating this year relative to the economy.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks. I'm trying to get a handle on commercial cost trend for next year. Can you quantify how much commercial or consumer utilization you expect to rebound next year? You talked about it rebounding, but can you say how much? And then can you quantify the effect of COBRA membership declines this quarter and next year on MLR? And lastly, do you think there's any ability for the lawsuit against the Michigan Blue to help your pricing with hospitals? Or does it perhaps hurt your pricing with hospitals if you have similar type contracts?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Peter. With respect to the commercial trend, as we look into 2011, we do expect our trend to increase, and it's really on a combination of a couple of factors. Certainly we do expect more normal utilization in 2011. We also expect the impact of the coverage expansions from federal reform as well as Mental Health Parity to push up our trend in 2011. In terms of quantifying at this point, we'll look to expand on that in our Investor Day conversation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wanted to understand how your pricing business for 2011 that's most impacted by reform, so are you just assuming normal situation and not thinking about reform until the final regulations come out, at which point you'll make a change, or have you done something preemptive? And then also what are you seeing from competitors along those same lines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Carl. A few things, one, I think we've talked about it the last several calls, our pricing discipline has stayed pretty consistent around our forward view of cost. Included in that obviously is some pressure relative to the reform provisions, Mental Health Parity, we do think, as we've talked about, we're going to see an increase in utilization from the lower levels that we experience today, so we're building that into our forward view of pricing.</p>
          <p>In terms of the competitive marketplace, it remains a very competitive marketplace, particularly in the lower end. It's been rational, we've seen some actions in particular market segments in states, but that has not been a trend. So from this point, I think it's been pretty consistent what we talked about in the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can rephrase. If you've got a product in a geography where you know you're going to pay a giant rebate next year, is your strategy to cut the price to try to make the product more attractive to consumers, or do you intend to sort of maintain pricing where it is and just pay the rebate out once the run-out finishes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think again, we're balancing &#x2013; we're always balancing what we think the right cost structure is by product, by market segment and volume. So our fundamental discipline on that hasn't changed at all. And remember, we are in many markets today where we have a minimum MLR requirement and we have been very successful managing those markets. So our strategy has stayed very consistent to what we think the right cost structure approach is for the marketplace to balance both growth and profit.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. The question is about your SG&amp;A uptick and could you give us any color on how that impacts your goal of the 1 billion plus in savings and over what time period that is? And then the second question is related to that, but more on the selling side of it. You and your competition seem to have alerted brokers on a reduction in commissions. Are you still likely to follow through on that for 2011 and is that varying by segment in commercial?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are two parts. I would offer that many of the factors that influence our SG&amp;A costs in the third quarter and will influence them in the fourth quarter relate to specific programs that we've initiated, investments we're taking, and some of it the timing of when we put resources in place, which we think is thoughtful. I don't think it affects our underlying cost and productivity initiatives at all, but I'll have Dave Wichmann speak to that, then Gail will answer the next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Ana. It's Dave. Just to reiterate for those on the call. We're planning to reduce our cost structure by about $1 billion over the course of five years, as we laid out in our last investor conference and we expected to pace that at about $200 million per year over the timeframe. Those reductions come from four principal areas, improving our quality, which I think you've seen, not only in terms of our cost structure but also reputationally for the company. We are driving higher automation, those are consistent with Working Paper number 2 if you can draw yourself back to July of last year where we released that, all around EDI exchange and driving higher levels of automation.</p>
          <p>The third area is really around advancing our integrations, which we are very far along on today, as well as driving a much more simpler modern processing environment. And the last is really around improving our procurement and sourcing. Right now, we plan &#x2013; we are on track to meet or exceed these commitments for 2010, and we got a nice pipeline for 2011 as well. So we're very confident in our ability to achieve the estimates that we put forth for you in the investor conference.</p>

          <p>Ana, on the commission side, we've been particularly focused in the individual markets. And as we, I think, noted on the last call, we had notified our brokers that depending on what happens in the marketplace, we wanted to retain our flexibility there. We still don't know the ultimate rules and regulations around that so we're going to make our final determination once that becomes clearer based on how that market is dealt with, whether there's phase-in at the state level, et cetera. So at this stage, we have not made our final determination there.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, at this stage, until we know what the final rules are, I think we're going to remain flexible because that could change based on each of the states and how that rolls out in the market.</p>

          <p>Hi, Sarah. As Steve said, this is Tom Paul. I'll first comment on the special election period that's resulting from the disruption in the marketplace. We'll give you more details about our growth expectations at the investor conference at the end of November, but at this time we are seeing positive outcomes from our product introductions and our distribution and marketing efforts in regard to the migration of individuals out of private fee for service or other disrupted markets into our network based plans. And so at this point, it's been very positive from a growth perspective. Your second question again was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was surrounding the impact on the market dynamics from the Humana Walmart low cost pricing strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, ultimately what I'd probably do is first focus on the competitive positioning of our own products and then how we see that as potentially impacted by the Humana Walmart offering. As Steve has said, we consolidated two of our basic plans, the Saver plan and the Preferred plan and ultimately that consolidation, whereas it did disrupt our Saver lives, made our Preferred plan much more competitive. So we, on average, dropped our premium in that plan for &#x2013; which is the bulk of our membership by $5 per month.</p>
          <p>As well as we're able to retain a national no deductible plan, which would be the only national product without a deductible. And our consumer experience and our consumer surveys would tell us that that is a very important feature that we were able to retain this year. And again, we are the only national plan that will do that in 2011.</p>
          <p>We do think that, again, anytime that there's a low cost plan that comes out into the marketplace it will cause consumers to explore and look but again, that plan will have a full $310 deductible in it. And as a result, we do expect that we'll be able to retain and continue to grow that product.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. First question just on your 2011 outlook, the discussion of down operating income and EPS, clearly you've discussed a little bit of certainly a number of the headwinds, some of the positive factors you might be able to put in place like commission cuts. I'm just wondering on those positive factors whether it's cost cutting or commission reductions, are you building in a full-year impact of whatever you expect to do there? Or would that benefit phase in over time and potentially help fuel the 2012 premiums growth that you talked about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a &#x2013; first of all, we really didn't give an outlook, we kind of offered basic themes that we are looking at as we look at 2011. Obviously we work on a number of things in our business, and we really look out into the future so a number of our initiatives, just like Dave Wichmann's commentary around operating costs, for example, are multi-year initiatives. The initiatives around the competitiveness of our Medicare Advantage offerings and so forth are four and five-year kinds of initiatives, so they all have run-in impacts, and so forth, so there will be some run-in to 2011 that will be positive, but I expect we'll also be accelerating throughout 2011.</p>
          <p>So I think it will be a mix of those kinds of things. I don't think there will be &#x2013; it is not like in 2011 we'll begin to initiate a whole series of actions. We have been pretty much working on these things for some time. I don't know if that answers your question, but that's the best way I could frame a response.</p>

And how should we think about the opportunity for top-line growth from states moving more lives into managed care offset by, potentially offset by margin pressure as a result of state budget shortfalls? Are you trying to paint in that positive story for us of growth or highlight a risk of margin contraction in that business, in other words?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, as the reality of the marketplace, Charles, it's a little bit of both, and that is, it really is a robust marketplace. States are challenged. They have seen the merits of progressive managed care approaches to these markets, and so we think the opportunities there are strong. There are like others, there are countervailing pressures in the state budget environment and the rate environment that, that creates is one of those countervailing pressures, but that has actually existed for years. We have operated very effectively through those.</p>
          <p>I think they increasingly see the value of these programs, so all we're really suggesting is perhaps nothing that is all that more dramatic than we have in the past, that there's always pressure in the rate process of states as they try to make their budgets. We'd just point out that the budget environment across the country is understandably perhaps appears as tight as it's ever been. Jack, do you have anything to add to that?</p>

          <p>I would. Hi, Charles.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jack.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take on the expectations of growth in the Medicaid marketplace and ask Simon to speak to the Working Paper comments on the benefit of suggestions we've made around duals, perhaps I'd address those. I think as you pointed out, the level of procurement activity that's in the marketplace today both confirmed and rumored, is really unprecedented. It is across all product types and all geographies. It includes membership that is currently under managed care and the really exciting part is additional populations that have been previously in the fee for service relationship, we believe will also be opened up to managed care participation.</p>
          <p>As Steve said, we're going to participate in those RFP's, as we have done in the past, and really our strategy there is to participate where we can be successful given the kinds of assets that we have and can build, but also certainly keeping an eye on how Medicaid expansion will play out in 2014.</p>
          <p>With respect to state budgets, it's not new news that state budgets have been tight. We have worked in that environment for the past several years. I think we had given some guidance about low single-digit types of rate increases. That's about where we ended up for the current year.</p>
          <p>I know we'll have more to say on this, but, we're likely to be looking at base rates at about that level or perhaps just a bit lower next year. And I think where we excel as a company is certainly working in that very tight base rate environment, but also being successful in getting some of the additional amounts available on top for quality purposes and performance-based incentives.</p>
          <p>So I guess the punch line there is we expect to grow. We think we understand how to work in a fairly tight rate environment, and as you can tell from Steve, we're quite bullish on Medicaid.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'd say that's pretty much true across the board. While we're very good at suggesting what the headwinds are, we're very positive about our business, and I think we have been successful over the years working through those kinds of things and continuing to grow, and we don't change that view at all. Next question?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning. A question just around the outlook and I guess the inability to provide an outlook. It sounds like that's based on your view that the MLR requirements are &#x2013; need to be set. So I guess, I'm just curious as to, is there an expectation, then, that we're going to see a meaningful deviation from what the NAIC has sort of provided at this point? Or is it just simply let's wait until it's signed before we can opine on the impact?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Josh, I think it's simply the latter. I mean, the reality is that those are significant matters that are pending. They are &#x2013; clearly play directly to our business, and we actually think it would not be responsible to offer guidance right now with something like that pending. It does not reflect a view one way or the other about how we expect those to be considered and determined. It really just reflects the fact that they are still out there, and we don't think it's responsible to offer guidance while they're pending. There will be a period we have to understand them, analyze them and really assess them on a market by market basis. So it will take a little bit of time before we can really give what we think is a thoughtful response -</p>

          <p>Is it fair to say that excluding the MLR minimums for 2011, you feel differently about that operating earnings and EPS trend that you talked about for 2011?</p>

What we tried to offer is some themes, and I would tell you we are very positive about our business, but there are some items that are out there that are significant, they're pending, and we are merely suggesting that as a responsible enterprise, we'll formulate an outlook on 2011 when we have the information to do it and really no more drama to it than that.</p>

          <p>Hey, good morning. A lot of commentary today on utilization, I want to just pick at that a little more. As we go into flu season again, can you maybe give us some sense of how you're approaching flu season this year? Anything different than prior years given our unusual data point from last year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say there isn't anything that is unusual. Flu is not a predictable kind of event. You can't predict the extent of it. You can't predict the timing of it. It is a pretty regular factor on the landscape. But you really just don't know when and to what extent it will affect you. So I don't think we've changed our view of that at all, and we don't actually incorporate anything that is specific about flu one way or the other as we develop these outlooks on trend. There are so many other factors that are part of it. Anything else to &#x2013; so I think that would be our response.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, Matthew. It's been an active season in national accounts, but your question around the theme of the trend is absolutely consistent, which is incumbency over the last several years. More than half of the accounts that went out to the market this year stayed with their current carrier. What I would say, however, is in terms of our positive momentum, of those accounts that are moving, we have done very well. I think back to Steve's comments at the beginning of the session, that I think our strong service, our value proposition in the market, we're doing very well on those accounts and are winning a majority of those accounts that are moving. So we think that's a positive piece of momentum for us in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>And then secondarily, we had less of our accounts out to the market this year and are retaining more of those. So those are both, I think data points that are important from our momentum and what we've been able to accomplish in the national account marketplace.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, could you just &#x2013; it's obviously a couple years out, but could you talk about how you're thinking about sort of the Fortune 1000 community and what they may wind up doing with benefits coverage? I mean, can we look at sort of what happened from the 70s to today on the pension side, going from a defined benefit to a defined contribution model? Is that a reasonable path to look at for the large employers? Could we see them letting go of coverage and pushing people onto the exchange? And what are you hearing from the larger accounts post reform passage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just react to this, at kind of the highest level there is &#x2013; obviously they're very smart companies, they're looking at all of their options and doing appropriate analysis. That doesn't mean that they're inclined to take any action, and there's also no uniform pattern or trend out there. They see some of these things to be a little bit of a long way off relative to some of their initiatives. And our reaction is that they believe that the reform will shape itself and it's not necessarily in its final form at this point in time. And so they're withholding judgment.</p>
          <p>And I would also offer that these are responsible companies with significant sense of responsibility about their employees, that their benefits are an important element of their relationships with their employees. And so they're being very measured and very thoughtful about how they consider that relationship. And that's why I think it is a multi &#x2013; it is many years off. And I would say that many of them will be very circumspect with respect to what steps they take, so if anything that would move, it would move, I think, in a very measured way, very slow.</p>
