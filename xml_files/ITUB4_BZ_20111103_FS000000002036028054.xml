        <plist>
          <p>Good morning for those who are in U.S.; good afternoon for those who are in Europe. We are glad to be back to talk about our third quarter results. For those who are following through the Internet, we are starting on page 2, the highlights. The first one is with the result of the bank. We have a recurrent net income of BRL3.9 billion which are now annualized ROE of 23.5% and an increase of 18.8% when we compare to the second quarter of this year. The net income was BRL3.8 billion when we reduce the extraordinary gains in this quarter.</p>
          <p>The second point is the loan portfolio growth. The growth in the quarter was 6.1% when we compare to the third quarter of 2010 and the number was 22.8%. We have to note here, due to devaluation of the real against the dollar, our dollar portfolio increased in reais. So, if we offset this impact, the growth of the loan portfolio have been 3.5%, so in line with the growth of the credit portfolio of the financial system in Brazil. So, it was a good quarter in terms of portfolio growth.</p>
          <p>The third point is the financial margin with the clients. The financial margin with clients achieved BRL11.8 billion, that means an increase of 5.3% from the second quarter. This growth in the credit portfolio, so we were able to increase a little bit the financial margin with the clients in this environment that we are operating especially in credits when we are going into lower risk segment.</p>
          <p>Also is a financial margin, we see the financial margin with the market BRL1.1 billion in the quarter with a growth of BRL446 million when we compare to the second quarter. It is important to notice that there, of course, the market was much better for the treasury. And in this quarter, ours was released by <mark type="ph" /> SELIC (04:58). We sold part of stake with other shareholders who are our new investors, our new investors and these sales represented a gain of BRL151 million, that is in spite this BRL1.1 billion. So, we have this extra gain in the treasury in this quarter related to the sale of the CETIP shares.</p>
          <p>So, the fourth highlight is the non-performing loans and results were lower than these loans losses. The expenses was BRL4.97 billion with a decrease of $136 million when we compare to the second quarter that was a quarter that we made a lot of provisions especially related to small companies, if you remember. And this quarter, we reduced the level of provisions because we don't think it's necessary due the anticipation of provisions created by the expected loss model that we are using since the end of 2010. So, we make prior provisions. So, we don't need in our models to make new provisions in this quarter.</p>
          <p>The 90-day delinquency ratio increased 30 basis points to 4.7%. Here it is important to notice if the real didn't have the devaluations that increased our credit portfolio as I mentioned. This number should be 4.8%. So, our guidance was 4.8%, was a little bit lower especially because of the impact of this real devaluation in our credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>So, we continue to see a good performance in the delay, so we don't see further deterioration in terms of non-performing loans in the recent quarter. Of course, we have the reverse impact because the real is under valuation again. And also, of course, this will have an impact in the opposite direction that we had in this third quarter and maybe a marginal deterioration in the middle. So, we expected the number for this quarter to be around 4.9% considering these two factors.</p>
          <p>The fourth highlight is related to efficiencies. Our efficiency ratio achieved 47.5% and with a decrease of 80 basis points when we compare to the second quarter and 310 basis points when we compare to the third quarter of 2010. So we continue in the trend of increasing this efficiency ratios both from expenses controlled and revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Non-interest expenses increased 5.7% in quarter-over-quarter. Personnel expenses grew BRL135 million. So we were able to continue the trend of reduction that accumulated expenses when we compare to 2010. In the first nine months of this year, the growth was 12.5% and we continue to believe that by the end of the year, the total non-interest expenses will increase between 8% and 10% as the guidance we gave.</p>
          <p>In terms of growth revenues, the growth was lower than expected. We were expecting more growth from &#x2013; talking in terms of revenues. That's the reason why the efficiency ratio is not in the level that we expect it to be at this time. This lower growth was related to the pace of changing the mix of the credit portfolio. We are in a faster pace entering into lower risk credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>So we are going to have lower revenues, lower spreads, also because banking fees and tariff are growing lower than we expected. Our guidance is 14% to 16% growth in banking fees for this year. But we don't believe that this number will be achieved. So the new expectation that we have is for the whole year 2011 of 13% growth in terms of banking fees and tariff.</p>
          <p>Going to page four, highlights some numbers. The operating revenues had a growth of 12.5% when we compare 12 months. Loan losses increased 18.8% to BRL10.5 billion and decreased 1.6% in this quarter. Non-interest expenses, the growth was 12.5%, as I mentioned reducing from 19% by the end of the second quarter in the accumulated basis. Third, recurring net income had a growth of 13.2%, achieving BRL10.9 billion in the nine months.</p>
          <p>Highlights also on page 5, net interest margin is 11.6%, a reduction when we compare to September 2010 and an increase of 10 bps when we compare to the second quarter of this year. So second quarter was 11.6% and we achieved 11.7% going into a lower risk portfolio. Banking fees almost BRL14 billion, up a growth of 10.7%. And as I said, we expected now 13% for the year. And the ROE in the quarter, 23.5% but due to the second quarter that was lower than that, the nine months was 22.4%.</p>
          <p>On page six, the net interest margin slide. As I mentioned, a small increase in this quarter; that was the good news. On page seven, we can see the dynamics of this origination of this credit portfolio. We already renewed this year 57% of the portfolio and we still have free for next year 26%. So we <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:26) credit portfolio.</p>
          <p>On page eight, it's just numbers, the total assets of BRL836 billion, stockholders equity of BRL69 billion and loan portfolio BRL382 billion and total funding from clients including the AUM BRL869 billion.</p>
          <p>On page nine, we see the results in this quarter, as I mentioned, an important growth in terms of operating revenues of 6.7% achieving BRL19 billion, an important impact of margin with the market of BRL1.1 billion in this quarter, BRL2.7 billion in the year. The second quarter you will remember that it was not so good. And when we compare with last year, we see that even this line is standard, the numbers of 2010 there's a reduction of 2%. So, with the reduction on net of loan losses and a better control of non-interest expenses, we have this recurrent results of BRL3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>On page 10, we see the loan portfolio by kind of clients and we continue to see a very important growth in terms of mortgage as the first quarter is still small when we compare with other segments that is growing fast for almost 15% in this quarter and 79% in 12 months. So, we're gaining importance.</p>
          <p>In terms of small and very small, small and middle markets the growth was only 2.2% due to the fact that we reduced the portfolio of very small and small companies as we mentioned in the second quarter's conference call. But we were reducing these portfolios due to the risk and with the levels to be aware of light to make in the second quarter. So, we continue to grow in the middle, very middle companies but we reduced the portfolio in respect. And corporate also an increase of almost 9%. Of course, here also we've had a impact of the growth of the dollar portfolio due to the devaluation of the currency.</p>
          <p>And on page 11, the NPL ratio of 4.7% should be 4.8% if we didn't have the devaluation of the currency, In terms of companies, we're almost stable but we had deterioration in this quarter in the case of individuals with the NPL ratio over 90 days increased from 5.8% to 6.2%. On the NPL ratio 31 to 90 days, we see the number is good, good numbers. We don't see any big problem related to the increase of deterioration in the credit portfolio. We believe these numbers for the fourth quarter will remain something between 4.8%, 4.9%. We don't see big problems in this area. The coverage was 166% and the total provisions for this is BRL24.7 billion. Of this total, BRL5 billion this related to the expected loss model that provision that we made before.</p>
          <p>On page 12, we have the evolution of the expenses in a visual way. We can see the reduction in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And also on the right side of this page we can see that renegotiation under the resolution of the Monetary Council is 3.9% of our total portfolio.</p>
          <p>On page 13, the total funding and working capital was a BRL1.1 trillion. On page 14, we can see that we improved the balance between funding and credit portfolio in this quarter. We increased the deposits, so have moved to a level of the pre-deposits to credit when we consider in this number the reserve requirements in the Central Bank, we have 75%. So, funding continues to be another issue in Brazil. To fund the deposit is not an issue, to fund the credit portfolio growth.</p>
          <p>On the slide 15, we can see the banking fees, the growth in the quarter is 3.2% and sales was 10.7% and if we expected now 13% growth for the year. On page 16, we can see the non-interest expenses 5.7% in the quarter, 12.5% when we compared to last year. And we continue to be very stringent in terms of controlling the expenses and we maintain our expectations for 2011 of growth of the expenses <mark type="ph" /> non-interest (20:20) expenses between 8% and 10% when we compare to last year.</p>
          <p>It is important to notice in this slide, the evolution of employees of the bank. We continue to reduce, we achieved almost a 110,000 in March of this year and we finished with 106,000 in September of this year. Of these, 6000 are outside Brazil and 99.8 thousand is in Brazil, which shows us a very good efficiency in terms of number of employees for the size of the operation that we have here in Brazil.</p>
          <p>On page 17, the efficiency ratio, we continue to grow with the level of 41% in 2013 as I mentioned this year. We are in a slower pace than expected especially because of the lower growth of our revenues. On page 18, evolution of BIS is in a comfortable position 15.5%. We still have some approved spending on the Central Bank and these number are approved, supposed to make that this number will increase to 15.7%.</p>
          <p>So, I think we had a very good quarter, of course, the second quarter as we mentioned was below the potential of Ita&#xFA; Unibanco for specific reasons that we talked about in the last conference call, but we were able to relieve a very strong BRL3.9 billion recurrent number for the third quarter. Our portfolio growth was both the average of this season. We were able to grow the net interest margin delinquency and debt provisions, clearly show us stabilization in these levels in the short-term. We are very confident in our models and the expected loss model that we are working since the end of last year. So, we are in line with the best process when we compare to IFRS and Basel III. So, we continue to be very confident that our models are working very well when we are talking about the provision.</p>
          <p>In the terms of expenses, I think those numbers are showing a very good control and we continue to target this 41% by the end of 2014 and we expect to grow the expenses in line with the inflation in the coming year. So, in general, this was a very good quarter. I think the research analyst in almost all of the resources that we were able to reach during these few days after the release, was very good in showing that we are in very track in terms of results.</p>
          <p>So, that's our first considerations and now we are open to questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first comes from Mr. Saul Martinez from JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everybody. I guess my question is on asset quality. And, just generally speaking, I want to get your sense about how confident you are that fourth quarter will be the peak of the cycle. I think if you wanted to be a skeptic, you could show that NPLs did increase in the quarter; you've seen the bigger increase obviously on the retail side. And new NPL formation did worsen in the quarter as well. New NPL before charge-offs did grow. So, what, other than a pretty small decline in the early stage delinquencies, gives you in your models comfort that the NPL cycle and that the quality is very close to reaching its end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Saul, it's Rogerio. You're right we are really confident on the trend of the provisions and the expenses in the NPL. This was actually more improved along the year. We increased the provision based on the expected loss model by the first quarter. And since then we didn't change anything. The criteria is absolutely the same one. They are consistent and not showing any needs for additional provisions. On the contrary by keeping the same level it's because we are actually economically using a part of the provision provided by them.</p>
          <p>Some other sources that &#x2013; it's confidential in our perspective, you mentioned the early delinquency basis on the 31 to 90 days with a very light improvement is true. If we take this system &#x2013; normally, the system uses the 16 to 90 days, this is even better. It is actually showing an improvement of 20 basis points for the consolidated portfolio, 40 basis points down for companies &#x2013; actually 5 basis points now on any deal, so it is really improving. We don't see any order change that could give us any sorts of movements on the order direction. We are pretty confident that this is what is going to happen.</p>
          <p>Also remember that we have been changing the mix of our portfolio towards a lower risk portfolio. So, we should see further improvements in the next quarters on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the that later point, Rogerio, your post-provision net interest margin as you show on one of your exhibits has declined obviously as the NIMs have come down, your loan loss provision has gone up. Can you give us a sense of what the outlook is for your NIM with clients after provision for credit risk next year? Do you think that &#x2013; do you think loan loss provisioning levels could start to moderate as the percentage of loans and hence, even if NIMs are flat or down, you could actually see an increase in your NIM with clients after the provision for credit risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we see. So, we are not expecting any major movements on this. But we do believe that net interest margin risk adjusted after bad debt provisions should be resilient flats or even improving as time goes on. Since, we have this benefit due to the bad debt expenses.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, it's very difficult to be assertive when talking on the net interest margin after the debts &#x2013; before the debts, sorry. Because we have at the same time movements in the spreads. You know that the interest rate is moving down in the country with some perspectives of keeping at the same as the same direction. So, the future yield curve tends to create spreads, lower spreads during the next winters. And we also have this interest on some of the mix of the portfolio. So should be, maybe resilient but definitely the best way to look at the future is by looking the risk adjustment interest margin that we are much more confident on the resilience of the figure. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Jason Mollin from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. Thank you for giving me opportunity to ask my question. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about Ita&#xFA;'s expectations for interest rate particularly given what you just said, where you think the SELIC will be heading next year, to what level if you're saying they're going down how far? And then maybe you can talk a little bit about the path of the net interest margin, the relationship or sensitivity of your margin to that path.</p>
          <p>And my second question would be just to understand a bit of your outlook for cost synergies, particularly efficiency ratio, you talked about on your metric of still sticking with the 41% at the least by the end of 2013. But you did talk about lower than previously anticipated revenues, if it makes sense, if you could give us some of your views, if it makes sense to stick with that. It's only been a couple quarters but to stick with this efficiency ratio expectation if in fact, we're starting from a weaker position? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jason, this is S&#xE9;rgio Werlang. Interest rates next year, our expectation is that the SELIC rate in Brazil should reach around 9.5% by some time mid-year next year and remain like that, at least with a more plausible scenario that we see right now. As for the linkage with the margin, I will pass on to Rogerio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, of course, we have several different consequence of any movement in SELIC. But we have a direct consequence in modules, consequence on the cash position we have invested in several bonds bearing SELIC or indirectly bearing SELIC, but actually bearing SELIC.</p>
          <p>These is in motion now corresponding to around BRL60 billion in our balance sheet. We show that figure on page 13 of our MD&amp;A. So considering any reduction of 100 basis points, we should observe a contraction of the margin by BRL600 million in a year, this is pre-tax. After tax is BRL400 million, BRL450 million. That means around BRL30 million, BRL35 million per month, around BRL100 million per quarter considering that the only consequence of SELIC would be on this position.</p>
          <p>Of course, when we look at SELIC, we have several others. Like I mentioned before on the other question, we have the spread with some level of sensitiveness because of the future yield curves. And we also have positions built up in terms of treasury. And the fourth consequence and by far the most important one is that with the lowering level of SELIC, we tend to set a removal of pressure on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:16) from the individuals what could benefit the delinquency. Removing some pressure and, of course, helping the risk adjusted net interest margin to recover and to increase. Those are the most important consequences of SELIC of course also in expenses we have impact out of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of expenses, you are sticking with your 41%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure. Sure in terms of efficient &#x2013; as Alfredo mentioned at the beginning, we are actually improving very much our expenses line. We decreased our expectation of growing expenses from 10% to 13%; we just decrease it to 10%. We will be inside this bench single-digit growth this year, what is very positive. Revenue generation was a little bit lower than expected. What could cause some difficulty on the delivering the first stage of our efficiency ratio, however, we keep pretty confident and we reiterate our commitment on the 41% by the end of 2013. We have no reason to believe this is not going to be delivered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Marcelo Telles from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello. Hello, everyone. I have two questions, one follow-up on asset quality. I mean, when we look in terms of your short-term NPL ratio indicator, I mean, that was in the quarter, let's say a 10 basis points improvement. But then you expect, I believe a 20 basis points deterioration in the fourth quarter, right. I would expect that given that in the short-term &#x2013; delinquency improving that you'd actually expect maybe some stability or maybe some improvement in the fourth quarter. Am I reading that right or what would explain this difference between what's your short term delinquency indicator showing versus your expectation for the fourth quarter?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding the operating expenses for 2012. Do you think that you're going to be able to grow OpEx below revenue growth next year? Can we expect another good year in terms of OpEx senses as you are seeing in 2011? Is there anything that make it more difficult to achieve, for instance, the increase in the salaries that you had in September, they are relatively high for the sector.</p>
          <p>And just one third question as well, if you &#x2013; a very specific question. I was wondering if you could share with us what was the provisioning coverage for the 90-day overdue credit in the re-negotiated portfolio. I know for the third quarter, you mentioned you were &#x2013; your provisional coverage was 141%, but I didn't see, at least in the release, that the same number for the second quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcelo, starting from the end. I just received your message asking for including these other information in the G&amp;A, thank you very much. We are considering it. We are preparing it to share with you guys.</p>
          <p>But going from the third to the second question, the OpEx is like I just said, we do believe we are going to deliver this 41% by 2013. The improvement from the current level to 2013 is similar between 2012 and 2013, we should see long-term expenses grow in line with inflation, definitely not more than inflation and probably it's going to be a similar level maybe even a lower level than what we are expecting for 2011.</p>
          <p>So, in 2012, we should see around 7%, 8% growth at the current situation of our budget processes is the perspective we have in mind. I just want to highlight that we normally announce our perspectives for the following year by the beginning of the year. It's going to happen in February, whenever we mention, we present the financial statements for the whole year. So far it's a preliminary figure but we have very good movements on this efficient process this year in 2011 that will contribute integrally for the year in 2012,; that will help in some cases even more than 2012 &#x2013; 2011, we will notice this in 2010.</p>
          <p>First question on NPL ratio as a whole, what we are serving in terms of our delinquency movements, Marcelo, and all of you is exactly what we had anticipated in our expected loss model that's why we created additional provisions mainly as a complement to the model of expected losses and this happened in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we kept at the same level the provisions. If you look inside the movement of the provision, what we had in the second quarter was an increasing of the generic provision and not the specific provision. And what we have now is an increase of a specific provision without an increase in the generic provision.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have an NPL. NPL reducing the pace of an NPL, this growth 20 basis points was exactly what we had anticipated. It would be 30 basis points, not 20 basis points. This was just an exchange rate benefit that will be back on the fourth quarter. That's exactly why we are anticipating 10 maybe 20 basis points at the fourth quarter. And more, more, much more important than this, this should be the peak end then NPL should &#x2013; delinquents should be flat or downwards.</p>
          <p>Pretty confident that the models never changed, the consistence of the models are actually being improved, they are pretty efficient. We are seeing what exactly what we had anticipated. A couple of other indicators show that the 30 to 90 is improving 10 basis, the 15 to 90 that is the system wide more use of figure is actually improving 20 basis points on NPL. So, we are at the end of this present cycle, it should improve. Now, of course our covers tends to reduce, when the peak is reached and then increases when the peak is &#x2013; after the peak when NPL decrease.</p>
          <p>This is the normal cycle. I just reaffirm, I just reiterate. We don't have any longer, any it we don't have any longer any anti-cyclical provision. We don't see anti-cyclical provision as the correct way to account for provisions in line with IFRS and BIS fees. So, the unexpected losses, the anti-cyclical provisions are considering in our capital formation not in our income statement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Perfect, Rogerio, if you allow me, just one more question, I don't want to take any more time from the other analysts that want to ask questions. But if you think about the outlook for next year and I'm thinking about your expected loss model, I mean at least the data, the economic data we've seen so far ends up in industrial production and to the growth employment I mean they've always &#x2013; they have come in terms of more on the negative side &#x2013; at least versus our market expectations. So, we're starting to see some deterioration in this economic indicators.</p>
          <p>How is that captured in your model? Do you have a different outlook for the economy next year or you are betting a lot on the fact that you are becoming a lot more conservative on your credit granting policies? So, how much do you think its related to let's say a more bullish, if you want, economy and how much should be should be &#x2013; because you guys are betting on this getting out of the weaker segments and moving to low-risk segments?</p>

          <p>Marcelo, this is S&#xE9;rgio Werlang, again. Just to comment on the macro, and here I'm not going to comment on the macro overview which is compatible with the macro scenario that I just mentioned in a previous answer. And then Rogerio's going to comment on the impact in our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Our current macro view is that there is going to be still a further deterioration on delinquency rates for personal credit. It's not a, it's not a large one but still there is going to be some deterioration on the average NPL of the system to more or less the middle of next year when we see some stability and then starting to go down as we see the full impact of the cuts in interest rates taking effect into the economy. Now, let me pass on to Rogerio.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, S&#xE9;rgio. Why I just want to wear the couple of other things that impacted our portfolio other than of course the macro scenario. The mix of our portfolio is moving towards a lower risk. We should present a better performance than the system because of that. Also the interest rate reduction, as I mentioned some minutes ago, helps a lot on the individual incomes. It's true that employment rate could increase but it's going to be in a good level, in a good level and considering that the macro scenario and that two movements in our portfolio, we believe the trend should be the one I just mentioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. I have two questions, the first one is sorry, again, on asset quality. And I guess, I'm just trying to put together what S&#xE9;rgio was explained and what Rogerio mentioned. I guess, I agree that NPLs moving waves, they just not jump up and down on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And if you look at the NPLs this quarter on the consumer side, they accelerated quite significantly up 50 basis points versus 10 basis points in the second quarter. So, we're still seeing an acceleration. Given that these things move in waves, I think it's fair to assume that it will continue to deteriorate for several quarters more, which if I understood correctly that's what S&#xE9;rgio said.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm trying to reconcile that with your view, I guess with the top num view that we are only going to see NPLs up in the fourth quarter and that's it. So, two questions there, first, can you just give us little bit of sense on exactly what's happening on the consumer side, what products or segments or particular clients are suffering the most? And then just what the expectation is if NPLs are going to grow, are going to peak in the fourth quarter or next year? Just to clarify that.</p>
          <p>And my second question is on margins. If the SELIC rates are at 9.5% by mid 2012, as your macroeconomic department just explained, average SELIC rate for 2012 is going to be around 10% versus 11.5% on average in 2011. So, that's 150 basis points lower SELIC. Can you a bit more specific at what the impact is going to be on your margin? I mean I appreciate the risk adjusted explanation and I just leave that aside for a second. Just on the margin per se, the 150% decline in SELIC, what was due to your net interest margins in an 11.7% this year. What do you think they're going to be next year considering the 150%, 150 basis points lower SELIC and your more conservative lending mix? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, Rogerio. Well, beginning from the impacting margins, on page 13 of our MD&amp;A, there is an statement in which we, we show BRL60 billion around BRL60 billion, BRL61 billion of our net assets that are sensitive to any variation in the SELIC. So, it's just 150 basis points on average, time BRL60 billion would represent around BRL800 million, net of BRL500 million to BRL600 million in the whole year. You should consider and that's what I just mentioned that this is &#x2013; we're not the movement that SELIC causes, there are several others among them, the most important is the potential improvement in the risk adjusted margins.</p>
          <p>Talking on the 50 basis point this quarter, what we are observing and that's really very important. What we are observing is actually what we had anticipated in our expected losses, expected loss model. And the movements quarter-to-quarter, they can be different, but what's important to say that it's true. It was 50 basis points in the third quarter, but this is the 50 basis points was the total for the year up to now. And could be another 10, 20 basis points as we mentioned this should be the end of this cycle.</p>
          <p>So, it puts under the perspective of the whole year you are going to see that our behavior in terms of NPLs is actually better than the system and similar to the other big players in the system although we have reached their portfolio on individuals because the level of consignado for instance is much lower in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>The 50 basis points increase in the third quarter; we don't have any specific line of product that shows an issue. It happened across the border, of course, as set by the consignado and the mortgage, but those two portfolios are very low and they actually serve as a sort of a <mark type="ph" /> subvention (50:36) to the any reduction of the orders. But if they are very small, they don't help the net interest margin as a whole in the individual's portfolio.</p>
          <p>So with 50 basis points in personnel portfolio was the same 50 in credit cards. So it's pretty much the same for each one of the lines and what is important to say is that it was 50 basis points in the quarter but it was 50 basis points in the year up to now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right and just to clarify, so you expect NPLs and consumers to peak in the fourth quarter or in the middle of next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fourth quarter that's the peak of NPLs for consumers, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so if I do the math of the BRL500 million on your margin that &#x2013; I'm trying to do the math really quickly here and this is why I wanted your help. So the &#x2013; from the 150% decline in SELIC, 150 basis points, sorry, decline in SELIC for next year, that translates, if I'm doing the math right, to around 50 basis points reduction in your net interest margin. Does that sound more or less correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should make the calculations. It's around I think net of tax would represent around BRL600 million &#x2013; BRL500 million, BRL600 million, I did the math when I talking to you. We can check and get back to you.</p>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Rogerio. And just  follow-up on the whole discussion about your cost income ratio program, improvement program that you're reiterating the commitment to reach 41% by the end of 2013, it seems to me that earlier in the announcement of this program, you were planning to rely more on revenues than on cost and as you started to see revenue being softer, you moved the emphasis to more reliance on cost. You will recall that you started the year guiding cost growth in the 10%, 13% level then you reduced it to 8%, 10% which you are comfortable you will reach this year. And then for next year softly, you are starting to guide more in line with inflation. I think you said, Rogerio, said 7% to 8%. So it is good to see that you are relying more on cost because it's likely that revenue will remain soft next year.</p>
          <p>So I wanted to talk a little bit about revenues into next year. I know that you are not giving guidance yet, but at least if softly, if you could comment what your expectations will be for loan growth next year assuming that most economy &#x2013; they're assuming now that the economy grows somewhere in the 3-point-something-percent reals below next year, and given what you're saying into income that you already reduced your expectation for this year to 13%, Alfredo said. What could be a good expectation to have for the income growth next year? I want to get a sense of how soft, again, revenues could be next year that will make even more important to be more stringent on cost than it seems to me that you are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, you are right, we are entering in a new scenario where revenues will be more difficult due to environment and the mix of products that we are aiming to achieve. So we have to work hard on both sides, try to concentrate revenues during <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:38) if possible and controlling expenses by the level of inflation to really achieve the efficiency ratio and to keep good levels of ROE for the shareholders. So we have to work both ways.  Of course, we expect that credit growth for next year to be around 15%. So considering inflation and the growth of the economy to 1.5% around that in terms of nominal GDP, this is we think it is feasible to achieve. We personally have to follow-up the market scenario to see the real trend in the coming quarters, but up to now we think it's feasible to achieve this level of growth in terms of credit portfolio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be bit lower, but similar, for this year we expect 13% maybe around 13% to 14%, I think it will be a little bit lower than the growth of credit portfolio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Mario Pierry from Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Let me ask two questions as well, the first one on asset quality. If you can just give us some color on how your SME portfolio behaved this quarter I think there was a bulk of your pickup in delinquencies last quarter was related to the SME portfolio, this quarter I have only seen that the data for the overall corporate portfolio if you could break down for me the deterioration in the large corporate and the SME segments?</p>
          <p>Also on the asset quality, I think your coverage ratio of 156% is the lowest I have seen probably in the last 10 years. Just trying to get a feel from you at what level do you think that this ratio could go before you start to worry about it?</p>
          <p>And then a final question would be on costs. We have seen your head count come down from 110,000 employees in the first quarter to 106,000. Should we expect more head count reductions or is this the level you are comfortable with because I do expect you to be opening branches next year as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mario, just a couple of questions here. So let's discuss from the movement in SME, the corporate portfolio growth was 9% including of course the exchange rate benefit, net of this, would be 3.5%, 3.7%. But very small, small and middle, mid-size companies' growth posted was 2.2%. If we break the micro, and it's more companies actually we had a reduction in the total portfolio and if we take the mid-size companies that was a growth. The figures are similar. The growth for mid-size companies was 4.1% and the decrease in the balance for micro and small companies was 2.2%.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the SME, taken as a whole, the growth was 2.2%, but what you have was actually in a business acceleration, there is more companies and the results of this the decision we took since November of asking for more collaterals from the clients by doing so, there was a business acceleration in the this portfolio. Just highlighting that we are talking on small, very small companies. The midsize companies we keep very, very &#x2013; it's strongly growing, it's pretty positive results and returns on this risk adjusted returns are very positive. Second question, excuse me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I meant that the delinquency ratio on your SME portfolio rather than the overall growth. So what happened to the delinquency ratio on the SME segments this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the figure &gt;: I don't have the figure here; I was trying to get it. I think was &#x2013; we had a deterioration of around 20 basis points during the quarter and the corporation as a whole was actually benefited by the large corporate managed by Ita&#xFA; BBA. But I can confirm to you there was bit deterioration but a small one. Talking about the coverage, I think this is particularly the most important point because I think there was some reason they're spending on this. The coverage ratio is always declines when NPL is growing and always when NPL starts to decrease, we have an increase of the coverage over 90 days. This is the cyclicality of the process.</p>
          <p>We decided that as from December that we don't have any anti-cyclical provision in our income statement, which is with any anti-cyclical risk and expected risk. This is different from the scenario we are looking forward we treat as capital. This is in line with IFRS and the BIS fees; those are the best practices you can find.</p>
          <p>So good advances of expected loss perspective. This is what drives our provision. Of course if we look at the future and repeated pace NPLs growing in the future we can increase provisions, the coverage increases. Whenever the NPL is coming confirming what we had anticipated that covers the price, that's absolutely expected. We were not expecting a different behavior; different behavior would be a wrong behavior if you look from the cyclicality of this.</p>
          <p>I just draw your attention to, if you want to look the absolute coverage, it's very important to mention that if you look at our coverage on specific provision, that is the provision based upon periods, the projection was actually 2 percentile. If you look our coverage by removing the Class H of our provision because Class H is a 100% provision, so there is no sense on increasing additional provision on a 100% provision advantage. So, if you remove that, the coverage during the whole year was actually flat.</p>
          <p>I think you had a third question under head counts. What we are seeing is a consequence of integration of some areas particular in the consumer credit areas, and we should see, we may see some additional reductions over time but not strongly most of them were red of salary in second quarter and third quarters.</p>

          <p>Excuse me; our next question comes from Mr. Jonathan Prigoff from Equinox.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I just wanted to see if you can touch more on the different types of individual loans and which ones are growing faster. Specifically, we've seen personal loan growth pick up a lot. I was wondering if you could touch on that and I know vehicle loan has been slower due to what's going on in the market and may be due to some regulatory concerns but may be you could help us understand your expectations for those other buckets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The personal credit growth was mainly accelerated during the last three quarters, two or three quarters because they were a little bit behind during the process of integration of branches from Unibanco to Ita&#xFA;. Now, with the single platform we can explore more adequately the level of risk, so we are catching up, that's the reason why the personal loans increasing in recent quarters.</p>
          <p>Actually, we had lost some of our normal market share on this and we are catching up, that's the reason. And looking at the auto loans, you are right when saying that auto loans is not growing but the reason is not &#x2013; it's not actually very related to this micro-provision measures. It's actually related to the maturity of this portfolio. We have a very strong risk appetite and this business is very contributive business and we keep originating around BRL2.3 million every single month on this portfolio. What happens is the -- with the maturity of the portfolio, there is no growth because we have the same letter of contracts expiring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if I look historically as I recalled, vehicle loans were a big engine of growth and kind of helped fuel the growth that we've seen over the past few years here. Given that as you said, maybe that market has kind of matured for you and given the pullback you've seen at the smaller end of the SME business, what's the engine of growth going to be going forward? I mean what are the products that you think are going to help you get a multiplier effect on nominal GDP growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Alfredo just mentioned that we believe the normal base onwards now is no longer three four times GDP. We're talking on 1.5 times GDP now. Corporate loans should be one of the important drivers, mortgage another one, credit card business is still under penetrated in Brazil should account for it. So, I'm referring to the lines of portfolio consignado, the payroll-type of credits, I'm referring to those that should grow a little bit ahead of this average 15%.</p>
          <p>On the other hand some modest, midsize companies again, on the other hand auto loans should be behind even under a positive scenario, it's difficult to figure out any growth bigger than 5% to 8% in auto loan. So, some could be behind this average, some orders ahead and the total 15% is what we expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, one more question if I may just to take a step back about individual delinquencies what do you think is actually causing the delinquency? A few months ago people were taking lot about the debt service requirements being high and I think you and lot of the other banks made a good case as to why by, at least historic standard, debt service requirements are not that high for Brazilian individuals, but yet we are seeing this uptake in delinquencies without huge increase on unemployment. So, what do you think, is it just due to interest rates and once rates come down that should correct itself or what's the &#x2013; are more people having affordability issues with their levels of debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's related to inflation and interest rates. The increasing of these two components in the individual income so that's cause of this. Of course we noted this and we provided for it by the beginning of the year based on the expected loss. What we see now is exactly what we had anticipated, nothing new, nothing different from there. Based on the methods you anticipate provisions before anything else. That's the reason we don't see any figure and just to reiterate, bubble we don't share any given bubble with the mid it is impossible to created in a scenario of so high interest rates and so short duration parameters to talk in summary. Let's go to the next question because the time is expiring, please.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thank you, couple of questions here. Just on cost, Rogerio, if you can focus on, you're talking about in line with an inflation OpEx growth. But can you just remind me what you're also planning in terms further expansion? Is there anymore in that in line with an inflation cost growth? Is that built in some increase in the branch network et cetera?</p>
          <p>And my second question is on margins and really focusing in on this revenue line. So, the kind of core scenario or the soft guidance should we say of 2012 is 15% loan growth, if you go 15% loan growth what can we expect in terms of net interest income? And I presume we're looking at best case scenario in this environment of lower risk credit 12% something along those lines in line with kind of fee and commission guidance that you gave us is that right?</p>

          <p>Yes, actually when we look at the top line we see credit growing 15% we see a Brazilian risk adjusted margin eventually improving a little bit. So, let's consider around 15% growth in top line fee income should be at similar level, should not reduce too much and it's important in relations to the total top line. But I just want to mention that we are going to present our perspective for 2012 within three months in our conference call on the results for the entire year that is scheduled for February; those are all preliminary deals on this.</p>
          <p>Back to other questions on costs the 7% or the inflation alignment in our cost line, it's actually &#x2013; what we have behind is &#x2013; the improvements in cost, the efficiency in cost could fund our growth. We expected to open branch on average 150 branch for next year, actually next year we have some a little bit bigger figure for next year. It is scheduled to be a 170 branch but on average we opened around 150 branches. And also we have a schedule removed in relation of branch totaling 600 branch store next year. All those cost should be funded by this further improvement in cost in order to have the full line, grow in line with inflation. Let's consider now around 7% and we will be back to this and following up on these within three months.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so just, just to recap on the branches, you are expecting to increase about 150 this year, 170 next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's actually &#x2013; we have already opened 50 branches this year and we have schedule and ordered 90 branches for till the end of the year. So, it's going to be around 130, 140 branches this year. The normal level anticipated for this year was between 120 and 150; we are going to be inside these branches. Next year is going to be a little bit higher than the normal 150s around 170. Re-modelization &#x2013; we had this refurbished remodeling of the branch this year with a total &#x2013; a little bit, a little bit below 500 and it's scheduled to have 600 next year.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you. So, long, we still have some questions that we did not attend, we are going to call these, for those who are on line. Sorry, but the conference it's a little bit too long, so we have to stop here. But thank you for your time, I think we had a very good quarter. I think we are on the track of good quarters ahead. And so we continue very confident about our models about our business. We are very confident in that. So, we will see you again in the conference call next year about the year-end results.
