        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everyone. This is Christian by the way. Thanks for joining us for our call on the January 2012 renewals and key financial data for 2011.</p>
          <p>Today's speakers are J&#xF6;rg Schneider, CFO, and Torsten Jeworrek, CEO, Reinsurance. According to our usual procedure, the two gentlemen will kick it off with a few statements based on the slide that we provided this morning. And afterwards, there will be ample opportunity for Q&amp;A as always. In order to give as many participants as possible the chance to take part in the discussion, please let me remind you to limit the number of your questions to a maximum of two per person.</p>
          <p>So far, so good. J&#xF6;rg, up to you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As usual, all data provided at this early stage is reliable already. More detailed information has been put up. But this is still subject to the normal quality assurance and also the auditors still need to sign-off. So all detail will come with our annual report on the 13 March and during the analyst conference on 14 March.</p>
          <p>Given that 2011 was a year of extremes in each and every respect, we are quite satisfied that we had still achieved a net profit of roughly &#x20AC;710 million and once more show a resilient capital position.</p>
          <p>I start with the key figures on slide three. The net result for the fourth quarter was about &#x20AC;630 million. This is almost on a normal level, but it was impacted by countervailing non-recurring items. For the fourth quarter, like for the full year, there was especially the impact from natural catastrophes along with the volatile capital markets. This was mitigated by the sound underlying performance. And operating results of &#x20AC;1.2 billion for the full year or &#x20AC;800 million for the fourth quarter on a standalone basis was achieved.</p>
          <p>We had positive net tax income. This perhaps requires some explanation. First of all, we had losses from the natural disasters, which are mainly tax deductible, but nevertheless we had a positive operating income even after these losses. Therefore, there were additional special effects. And these &#x2013; most of these have to do with our situation in the US where we had losses in the past and tax losses carried forward where we had not set up a deferred tax asset yet. Therefore, our very substantial profit in the US came in tax free in 2011, which translates into an advantage of &#x20AC;190 million roughly.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had to &#x2013; I emphasize that &#x2013; we had to set up a deferred tax asset now because the profitability of the US group has become sustainable. We set up a DTA for the losses carried forward in the order of &#x20AC;300 million. That's an additional income from taxes of &#x20AC;300 million. So these two effects alone make up for almost &#x20AC;400 million, 500 million. And this largely explains the special effect not only for the full year, but also for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Shareholders' equity was up &#x20AC;300 million for the year, &#x20AC;1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. And compared to 30 June, it was even up &#x20AC;3 billion. The development in the fourth quarter, &#x20AC;1.1 billion up, was made up by the profit, roughly &#x20AC;600 million, an increase of unrealized gains and losses and a currency effect of &#x20AC;400 million. So, overall, &#x20AC;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The increase from &#x2013; of &#x20AC;300 million since the beginning of the year was also quite satisfactory, considering the adverse developments and not to forget the payment of &#x20AC;1.1 billion dividend and some share buybacks at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Since capitalization is still strong &#x2013; very strong &#x2013; we are able to propose a very attractive dividend of &#x20AC;6.25 per share to the supervisory board and to the AGM. This totals again an amount of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Sustainable high payouts to shareholders are for us of utmost important. From today's point of view, our dividend is well financed also for the next year. The investment result was &#x20AC;6.8 billion after &#x20AC;8.6 billion in 2010, return on investment 3.4%.</p>
          <p>Segment highlights, reinsurance property casualty, this was the most expensive year ever in terms of nat cat losses. Combined ratio for the full year, 113.6%, and for the fourth quarter also a very large number and amounts of losses, a combined ratio of 101.8%.</p>
          <p>Primary insurance achieved a consolidated result of &#x20AC;350 million roughly, which is more or less on prior year's level. This was impacted by several non-recurring items, which I would like to mention briefly. First, the impairment on the Greek bonds of &#x20AC;1.1 billion gross; and for the net result, an impact of a little bit more than &#x20AC;200 million.</p>
          <p>Then we had on the positive side, net gains of roughly &#x20AC;150 million gains from disposal of a major real estate complex in Singapore. We also had net gains from &#x20AC;115 million from the disposal of the DKV subsidiaries to the sister segment, Munich Health. This latter gain is not relevant for the group results due to the consolidation of intra-group profits. We also had some positive effect from the protection against low yield scenarios with a net effect for the bottom line of some &#x20AC;85 million.</p>
          <p>Munich Health, first and obvious very strong growth from health reinsurance. These are solvency relieved solutions which bring the premium income for this segment over &#x20AC;6 billion. Bottom line, MH is delivering with the underlying performance according to expectations. However, the net results are distorted by adverse currency effect.</p>
          <p>Additional information on the following slide four. First, IFRS numbers for reinsurance. Also the fourth quarter was characterized by further above-average nat cat losses. To mention first, the Thai flood was over &#x20AC;500 million loss and also a reserve increase for the three New Zealand quakes of about overall &#x20AC;400 million.</p>
          <p>But also we had reserve releases. The normal year-end exercise brought the usual actual versus expected comparison, which showed consistently favorable indications, more or less across all legal entities' lines of business and accident years, positive news here. Altogether, we released in 2011 roughly &#x20AC;600 million, of which some &#x20AC;400 million were done in the final quarter. That's even after having done this, when we compare our confidence level at the end of 2011 with that of 2010, it didn't suffer. To the contrary, we strengthened the confidence level here.</p>
          <p>The combined ratio for the full year, if we adjusted for these reserve releases and for the above-average large losses, then we would be down to a normalized level in the order of 96% for the full year and a little bit lower for the fourth quarter on a standalone basis.</p>
          <p>To describe this exercise, for the full year, major losses were 32.5% of net earned premiums instead of a normal, good 11%. If we adjust for it and add back the reserve releases which make up for some 4 percentage point loss ratio, then we are at roughly 96%.</p>
          <p>Primary insurance, combined ratio higher than in the preceding year with 97.8%. Especially in Germany it was 93.1% worse than before, but still good. International business was 105% better than before, but still not good enough, but we are on the right track. The restructuring of the respective businesses where we had problems is well underway. And we are confident that it gets fixed &#x2013; or it has been fixed.</p>
          <p>New business in life, &#x20AC;2.7 billion, minus 6.1% against 2010. This was mainly driven by the decline of single premium business, minus 8.3%. We are pleased because the investments for a very long period is quite a challenge for single premium business. And therefore, we are also very satisfied that regular premium business went up plus 4.3% from a still low level. The net results were influenced by the one-offs, which I had already mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Capital position, from the bottom of page four, some first indications on the economic perspective. The lower interest rates and the higher implied interest rate volatilities translate into a decline of the market consistent embedded value for primary life business and an increase of the economic risk capital requirement. That means that we are hit in two ways &#x2013; for the numerator and for the denominator of the capital calculation.</p>
          <p>And also what should be mentioned is the very high burden from the natural catastrophes. On a pre-tax basis, it was some &#x20AC;3.5 billion above what had been expected for the natural catastrophes which translates into something like &#x20AC;2.5 billion less than originally anticipated after-tax. That means that our capital suffered from these two effects, but nevertheless, the economic solvency ratio based on our internal 175% mark, 175% of the regulatory solvency to future minimum, our capitalization according to that level is expected to remain similar to that of the end of September, so most probably still above 100% of our internal target. And our internal target, as mentioned, is way, way above the regulatory minimum.</p>
          <p>Also our rating capitalization remains absolutely commensurate with the AA rating. Munich Re clearly has a sufficient capital to grow the business and participate in market opportunities to the full extent. And of course, capital was not a constraint for the general renewals neither will it be for the upcoming renewals or for further growth aspirations.</p>
          <p>Slide five. Here is the overview of the preliminary numbers. Some short remarks only on premium income. An increase of &#x20AC;4.1 billion to almost &#x20AC;50 billion. This is a plus of almost 10% from organic growth and a negative impact from foreign exchange effect and just a small impact from acquisitions. Overall, plus 8.9%.</p>
          <p>We had &#x2013; in reinsurance life, premium income went up by 22% and in Munich Health by 20%, both benefit from large volume deals, which are financially motivated solvency-relieved deals. And the same applies more and more also for reinsurance property/casualty. Premium volume up 8%. Also more and more from that type of business, but of a more short-term nature, especially from Asia. Primary insurance premium income was only slightly higher than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Investment portfolio, on slide six, we have a well diversified investment portfolio with very cautious shift between the asset classes since the beginning of the year. We've further increased our exposure to corporate, as you can see on the following slide. But apart from this, the mix of the investment portfolio is more or less unchanged.</p>
          <p>The investment result is shown on the right-hand side. Regular income was up by &#x20AC;300 million. The current yield was at an unchanged good level of 4%. Write-downs were much higher, mainly driven by the impairment of our Greek government bond. And the net realized gains were lower than in the previous year, but still on a rather high level. These high gains from the disposal are partially just the result of our overall asset management activities. A lot of that happening from the highly rated government bonds. But the unrealized gains and losses nevertheless went up in the fourth quarter, also thanks to our overweight position in German bonds.</p>
          <p>You can see some of that on the following slide seven, which shows a breakdown of our fixed income portfolio of &#x20AC;178 billion, which is &#x20AC;8 billion more than in the preceding year. Throughout the entire year, we further diversified our portfolio with even more emphasis on highly rated securities and some reduction of the weaker sovereign bonds.</p>
          <p>The high level of diversification is important and we also try to expand our exposure to emerging market countries, but only in a very careful and moderate way.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to my colleague, Torsten Jeworrek, who will guide you through the renewals in property casualty reinsurance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am on slide nine and lead you through the non-life January renewal. First, I start with the portfolio split. You see here on that slide, on the left hand side, that 2011 portfolio had the premium volume in non-life of about &#x20AC;16.5 billion. The business &#x2013; the treaty business which was up for renewal now in January represented a share of 52%, being &#x20AC;8.5 billion. The remaining part will either be renewed in April and July or there's &#x2013; and there's another 30% of premium volume which comes from facultative business in our specialty insurance business. That means that January renewal is still an important renewal date for non-life in the Munich Re portfolio. However, because of the expansion of our primary and specialty insurance activities, this renewal date in relative terms is sort of less important than in the past years.</p>
          <p>When you look at the right part of that slide, you see the regional allocation and the proportion between excess and proportional business. January 1 renewal is very, very important for Europe, worldwide business and for North America. 97% of all the European treaty business was renewed at January 1, 73% of the global worldwide business and about 70% in North America.</p>
          <p>When you look at the other part, you see here, that January 1 was not what we call our major cat renewal date. Only 11% of the premium volume, which was up for renewal, came from catastrophe business. The other part is, of course, proportional business. And why do I mention that? Because as we all expect and as we all know, particularly the cat business was that business where we expected significant and substantial price changes in the renewal. This part of the business only contributes, however, 11%. So it's mainly a proportional renewal date for the Munich Re.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide number ten, I give you some observations of the market behavior, how we observed it in January. Overall and irrespective of the regions, it was very competitive, but I would still call it disciplined market. We got first &#x2013; some first evidences of improved terms and conditions and prices. But we saw very differentiated picture by segment and by market when we compared the regions.</p>
          <p>What happened? The capital base in insurance and in reinsurance was very stable and that despite of the very high natural catastrophe losses, which occurred during the course of 2011. That is certainly positive because it shows that our industry can absorb, can digest these losses without financial stress.</p>
          <p>We, on the other hand, saw that the capital base was, in our opinion, artificially inflated because of the low interest rate environment. Both these naturally high capital base, although this inflated part, they fuel, of course, the competition in an environment where the organic growth is not very strong.</p>
          <p>When we compare the various segments, the reinsurance segments, we saw a very heterogeneous picture, very significant price increases in those segments which were affected by losses. Australia and New Zealand price change, price increases between 35% and 100%; in some cases, up to 150%. US cat business, price increases in the order of 10%. Here RMS introduction and application was important and maybe drove the developments.</p>
          <p>Caribbean cat business very similar, increases in the order of 10%; offshore flow business, also up to 10% price change.</p>
          <p>And then in respect of cat business, the European business performed differently. Here we saw very stable prices. RMS Version 11 was not applied yet. The only exception in Europe were the Nordic countries. And because of the Copenhagen cloud burst, prices were increased here.</p>
          <p>So cat business, in general, very promising, very nice increases except Europe. When we look then at the primary rate, and all the other segments except the mentioned cat lines, rest of the world, flat to gradual price increases. Positive is that we hardly saw any segments where prices were decreased or eroded. So price reductions came to an end. The only exception is maybe the credit and bonding business where because of the very good performance of the segment where prices increased, if you remember, as a consequence of financial crisis, we saw some erosions from high level, but still very profitable.</p>
          <p>So I can summarize, abundant capacity available, tight reinsurance budgets at the insurance side forced our clients to increase retentions in one or the other way. And we have not seen a higher demand as a result of introduction of RMS 11, at least not yet.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 11, we would like to give an overview of the major price and volume changes in the Munich Re portfolio. You see here in this slide, in the columns, the major lines of business. And for each of the lines of business &#x2013; property, casualty and specialty lines &#x2013; we show then the volume change and the price change &#x2013; the pure price change in the Munich Re portfolio.</p>
          <p>Before I go into the figures, I would like to underline, the figures we publish here are not comparable to those figures which you see sometimes from our friendly competitors. We strictly distinguish in our published figures between volume change and the pure price change. Because only the price change and only that part of the volume change is responsible for the change in profitability in the coming year.</p>
          <p>First, property. Under excess of loss business in property, you see here the 10% -- there was about 10% price increase, 9.6%. As mentioned, this is exposure adjusted. You could ask now, why was there only then the 2% change in the volume? Shouldn't that be more? That has to do with two developments. One is that, as I mentioned, some of our clients responded to the price increase with higher retention under the excess program.</p>
          <p>And the other development was an own decision by us. We decided in European windstorm to reduce our capacity, which we provided in 2011 and the years before, significantly. Why? Because we felt that the gradual erosion over the last years that some new adjustments which we make over the years for climate change for our reaction to frequency losses that all these changes are not reflected in the price anymore. For that reason, we decided to reduce capacity here.</p>
          <p>Property pro rata business, unspectacular, price and volume flat.</p>
          <p>Casualty is the middle part of the slide. Pro rata, volume increased only due to growth of strategic partnership in motor. Rest of the portfolio is pretty unchanged. Excess of loss business, here the improvement of the Munich Re profitability, which you see here, 4.7%, was only achieved due to active portfolio management. That means, not due to price increases in the external markets. In other words, we reduced and gave up that part of the motor excess business which was unprofitable or did not meet our price requirement, particularly in motor UK and US casualty.</p>
          <p>And as I mentioned already, on the credit on the right side of the slide, some price reductions in the market which are also reflected in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>In summary, this picture reflects, in our opinion, the right combination of active cycle management and the realization of price increases in the respective markets.</p>
          <p>I switch now to slide number 12. And number 12 shows the portfolio movement. On the left &#x2013; I start on the left side. Here you see the renewable premium, &#x20AC;8.5 million. We gave up about 8.7% of that premium volume because of cancellations.</p>
          <p>On the renewed part, we could achieve 7% volume increase and then could write another 4.4% new business. That altogether leads to a volume increase of 2.6%. And I think now the most important part is to be seen in the middle of the slide because here we show the price movement of 2.0%. And this price movement is the change in profitability, which is the composition of the various developments of the slide before.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide number 13, we give you some hints what happened in the various segment of the portfolio. First, the portfolio reductions, the decreases. Here you see European property, &#x20AC;160 million reduction. That stems from the markets &#x2013; Germany about &#x20AC;70 million, France &#x20AC;40 million, UK &#x20AC;30 million. And again, as I mentioned already, RMS Version 11 in Europe was not applied yet. Maybe next year, we don't know exactly. At least, we have reacted.</p>
          <p>Traditional marine business, here reduction of about &#x20AC;90 million. And this &#x20AC;90 million is the traditional reinsurance business. What is not shown here on that slide is that at the same time, we could improve or write additional marine business through our Lloyd's syndicate, Watkins, in London, which is primary business which counterbalanced or offset this effect by about &#x20AC;45 million.</p>
          <p>European casualty, minus &#x20AC;60 million, basically from the markets, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and UK.</p>
          <p>Motor, UK, minus &#x20AC;30 million. What's the reason here? It has mainly to do with the fact that we could not achieve the terms and conditions which we think are necessary under the non- proportional motor activities responding to the PPO issue in the UK, the periodic payment issue.</p>
          <p>Why? You know that when we had this development in the UK where more and more losses are payable, broadly injury losses are payable over the remaining life time of the injured people, we think that we have to protect the non-proportional treaties against this medical inflation, like in other countries. And we wanted to implement not only higher prices, but also change in conditions to protect the treaties. That was not achievable. For that reason, we gave up a very significant part, about 60% of that volume in UK.</p>
          <p>The growth, as I mentioned already, that is expansion of strategic business, &#x20AC;350 million from motor in UK, but also from some other parts of the world.</p>
          <p>The quota share deals, which are mentioned here, &#x20AC;90 million are mainly from agricultural business, &#x20AC;40 million Chinese large solvency-relieved quota shares where we could expand our shares, then from some Solvency II treaties.</p>
          <p>So all in all, good renewal for the Munich Re. We think it was a very right decision by our underwriting units to respond to the very heterogeneous development in the market. The question is, what will happen now in the remaining renewals in 2012? There are two renewal dates, April and July. These are more cat driven renewal dates. And we have put forth a very clear expectation, but also ambition to implement and to achieve similar price increases which we have achieved under cat business in the January renewals, although we think this trend should and must continue.</p>
          <p>I hand over back to J&#xF6;rg Schneider.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Torsten. I summarize on page 15. We had resilient earnings in a challenging environment. We had a pleasing development in the January renewals and improving pricing prospects for the coming renewals during 2012. Munich Re's capitalization is solid which allows us to participate in any attractive business opportunities and to continue paying the high dividend of &#x20AC;6.25 per share.</p>
          <p>For the outlook of 2012, I can keep it very simple. Compared to the time before the very difficult year 2011, we expect a lower investment income and a higher result from the insurance &#x2013; from the technical business. Overall, we want to achieve a profitability level which is similar to that of 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand back to Christian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon and it's good to hear such a bullish tone from you for a change, J&#xF6;rg. Two questions. The first is just around the tax and your changing assumptions in the US to realized to deferred tax asset. I was wondering whether you can give us an indication. From memory, you had written down a quite lot of DTAs. I don't know whether that was five years ago or something like that. Sounds like you're reestablishing them based on more optimism around the U.S. profit generating ability. Are you able to give us any indication of what that sort of profitability is or how far in the future you're assuming that's going to be achieved? I'm assuming from today, but I'm assuming you're making assumptions around how many years of profitability you'll make to make that &#x20AC;300 million or whatever the number is realized. I was wondering whether you can give us some color on that.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, just on the Thai loss, you haven't moved it, obviously. And I was just wondering what it is that gives you confidence that your Thai number is reasonable, given we are beginning to see notifications, and I think at the time you said that you haven't received any. And so if you can give me some color on that too, that will be great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. First, on the deferred tax asset, yeah, you are right, we wrote it completely down a couple of years ago. This was a very conservative move. But at that time, we did not have the profit history which we have now from a couple of very profitable years now. So it is now done in a way that we look at five years ahead from now, take our business plans, and then we set up the taxes which we would have to pay as a deferred tax asset, but only a fraction of that amount. So we were quite conservative and took only something like one-fourth or so from the theoretic tax one would have to pay. So it's still conservative.</p>
          <p>I'll adjust it's for roughly 40%, 40% of the potential full tax amount for that period. So this is still somewhat careful, but it was, if I may say so, unavoidable in light of the very decent profitability of our U.S. organization. Torsten, on the Thai loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thai loss, our estimate is unchanged, &#x20AC;500 million. The reason is we have, for our portfolio, hardly any better information than two months ago. Of course, I realize and I know it's very uncertain at this point to make a good prediction or good estimation for that loss.</p>
          <p>What happened? We get this loss in our portfolio mainly through the Japanese clients or from Singapore, and these are subsidiaries of Japanese clients who place their own reinsurance. We have hardly any local Thailand business in our portfolio. So that makes it a bit &#x2013; I do not want to call it simpler, but maybe a bit more transparent.</p>
          <p>The Japanese business, and although the majority of our Singapore business, which causes these losses, is non-proportional business, it has only one treaty through a Singapore branch where we don't have an occurrence. And so that means we went through all the non-proportional treaties and through the proportional treaties, and in most cases, reserved full limits.</p>
          <p>Does it mean that we have certainty now? No, of course not, because it can mean that we have, for a particular &#x2013; on the risk excess treaties, reinstatements under the treaties, and it remains to be seen to what extent they are affected and uncertainty at this point, and that the major uncertainty, how much CBI exposed loss will materialize. And these are then very probably losses which come from other parts in the world, from Europe or America.</p>
          <p>Here we looked a bit at the Japanese event, Japanese earthquake last year. And we can be wrong, we can be right, but at least in Japan, we were a bit too conservative in our original assessment regarding CBI losses, but still it's an open issue here.</p>
          <p>So altogether, that means, on the basis of the current information, we feel well with our loss estimation. CBI is the biggest question mark here, but so far not even one loss has been reported to us. For that reason, for the time being, we leave definitely our estimation unchanged.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So just on the CBI, am I right to understand that you are suggesting, you haven't put much in for European-exposed CBI from &#x2013; as there was already a consequence with your experience with Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of course, we do. But of course, we try to compare a bit, what did we do for CBI under the Japanese earthquake and what would be the right reaction here. In both events, we still see uncertainty. And, of course, it's considered in our &#x20AC;500 million whether such an unknown exposure &#x2013; and we've outlined after Japan, all the uncertainties because transparency is not there. Meaning, it is uncertain, but to our best knowledge, we included that in the &#x20AC;500 million reasonably, I would say.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. Just one thing I wanted to clarify that in the fourth quarter numbers, I know there will be more detail in March, but was there a similar kind of FX impact as in third quarter? I'm sure it was not as big as third quarter maybe, but was there some such, a few hundred, couple of hundred million kind of impact there? That was something I needed clarification on.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on slide 11, Torsten, fully appreciate that peers can have a different experience on pricing, but on volumes, on specialty lines, you did seem to &#x2013; at least scaling back a bit more than recent data point we saw from a peer. I was just wondering if you could comment on your own book a bit more, just first to understand where the difference lies because specialty is apparently where at least one of your peers is growing quite rapidly. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is J&#xF6;rg speaking, Vinit. We had a negative currency effect in the order of &#x20AC;85 million. This was due to the weak euro. Always when the euro is weak against the main foreign currencies we have &#x2013; that is, U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar &#x2013; we have more negative effect and vice versa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll definitely go an encore. Was there any goodwill impact then because there's at least &#x20AC;200 million to &#x20AC;250 million between your operating profit and pre-tax that I could work out? Was there something else that moved as well or is it only the currency which was a major, &#x20AC;85 million you mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I come back to it later. Torsten before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I come back to your question regarding the specialty lines and try to answer why we have reduced our volume, our business in these three lines mentioned here.</p>
          <p>I think aviation and credit is easy. Credit and surety business, again, I said we saw price reduction. I think there's consensus in the market about this development from reasonable, from decent level, so we will generate a good &#x2013; still a good profitability. But of course, it's not the time to grow into that business if it's on a sort of declining trend in terms of profitability. For that reason, a very normal reaction, so to speak, that in line with reduced volume or reduced prices. We had reduced our volume.</p>
          <p>In aviation, here, I think we are in a soft market, particularly in the airline business. General aviation is still okay, I would say, almost flat, but aviation airline business is under pressure. Major &#x2013; main renewal date is through the fourth quarter. And that has, of course, to do with the below-average loss activity in 2011 and the years before. There is plenty of capacity in the market. And I think both for our reinsurance business and the insurance business which we write through our GAUM participation in London, we apply very active cycle management, so there's no appetite from our side to grow into that business now.</p>
          <p>Marine, here we have sort of diverging or controversial pictures in the market. And we know, of course, that some of our peers decided to grow here. And we also ask, why not the Munich Re, what happened? The market prices in some of the marine segments in nominal terms, if you compare rates on line or so between 2012 and 2011, the price on a nominal basis did increase. However, we made a deeper analysis and took the exposure change of the underlying portfolios of our clients into account, and here, we found out that despite these price increases, exposure-adjusted prices deteriorated. So that means what looks good at the surface is not as good when you look a bit &#x2013; drill a bit deeper and look into the client exposure. So for that reason, fully in line with our renewal strategy. We said then, no, price increase is not a good price increase if it does not even reflect the exposure change. And for that reason, you see here in reinsurance, the reduction in volume.</p>
          <p>Again, I mentioned on the primary side of Lloyd's syndicate, Watkins presented a bit of a different picture, and partly at least compensate our premium reductions in their syndicate. Does it answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it does indeed. Just a bit of clarification there. The exposure changed because of your own internal model or was it because of what was offered by clients?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The exposure change &#x2013; let me give you an example. Two participations where we &#x2013; or two segments where we reduced our volume, our participation were quota shares, so proportional reinsurance treaties covering either energy business or hull business also. And exposure change means we got better prices, but the clients even disproportionately in their underlying book wrote more business. That means the price increases were not even sufficient to catch up &#x2013; to mirror, so to speak, the higher liabilities, the higher exposures in the client book.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Vinit, now from my side, the operating result for the fourth quarter is roughly &#x20AC;780 million. Then the non-operating items, other non-operating result, impairment losses of goodwill, and finance costs overall is roughly &#x20AC;290 million, of which I've already mentioned the foreign exchange effect was some &#x20AC;85 million. Then we have finance costs, roughly &#x20AC;70 million to &#x20AC;80 million and some restructuring expenses with ERGO. And then we have the tax gain, the tax income. And that brings you to the overall net result of &#x20AC;630 million.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I had two questions. One is on the primary business and the other one is on the &#x2013; what the combined ratio could look like in 2012. And on the primary, could you explain a little bit why international &#x2013; because you started sourcing out international, from memory, Q3 last year and it's still not very good. Can you give a number for international in Q4? Maybe &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; give some feeling for where Turkey and Korea is? And you said, Mr. Schneider, that you think it wasn't &#x2013; it had been sorted, so you have a certain degree of certainty, and I just wondered maybe you can explain how it's working there?</p>
          <p>And then on the combined ratio, so I'm not sure whether I take the adjusted Q4 or the full year. So Q4 would be 95%, full year 96%, everything adjusted. The price improvement of 2% in the renewals, so that gives me somewhere between 93% and 95% and there's more price improvements. So I kind of half-understood what you're expecting from the later renewals. Does that mean that we should be looking for a combined ratio for the year of somewhere in the range of 93% to 94%, maybe below in reinsurance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be very optimistic, Michael. But theoretically calculated, yes. So the adjusted number, the normalization is correct, like you described it. But it's never an exact sign. So there are 100 special effects each year, and some of them you take out, others not. And so we still have our budgets for major losses. And therefore, let's see what is the outcome. I am confident that we can make a very strong progress into the right direction. That is, that the normal combined ratios should be lower than where it &#x2013; where we wanted it to have in the past on the basis of a higher investment income. But please leave that question to the Analyst Conference where we would very much like to discuss that in more detail and give you more flavor on the underlying performance. The same applies, by the way, for the international business. It's very early. We have a lot of individual data, but not full &#x2013; a full view and the internal talks with the respective management hadn't happened at that time. What I can say you is that the improvements in Turkey are underway. Nevertheless, we increased the reserve in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the result is still not where we wanted to be and where we expected to be as of this year. So, therefore, please bear with me and we will talk more about that in the Analyst Conference.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and thanks. I have actually two questions. The first one is about renewals. I'm rather in the camp of the one which was a bit disappointed this morning with the 3%. But on the other hand, I understand the geographic argument and the split up that you show, to show actually that more will come and we will see higher growth rates going forward in 2012. Still I have a base question. Could it actually be that, given that you are still growing very nicely in other segment and the P&amp;C reinsurance business remains actually pretty illogical because prices should rise far more aggressively, that you are a little bit &#x2013; some sort of fed up of this segment. And you say, 'Okay, fine.' Given that you have other segments like life reinsurance in which is you're growing at far better margin or more attractive conditions and the <mark type="ph" /> badges (55:40) higher we stop actually to grow aggressively this type of business and focus more on the other segment. Or is it higher as we focus really only the geographic story? Is that really a change also of risk allocation and appetite for this segment?</p>
          <p>And the second question is in terms of time for the transformational mergers and acquisitions. We are seeing all other sector, from foods to, just more this morning, commodities, there is a lot of M&amp;A activities going on. My question is, in the past, you used to say that you were rather interested for smaller bolt-on acquisitions, but what we are seeing in the market in other segment are transformational M&amp;As rather. Would you also start to mull to take such considerations or are you still in the bolt-on mentality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Fabrizio, Torsten here, and I start with your first question. And I thank you how you describe our business. It underlines how difficult reinsurance is, of course, and how challenging it can be. I cannot fully understand why you were disappointed with the 2% pure price increase on a portfolio basis, to be honest. Why? Because, first of all, for worldwide portfolio, for a large portfolio like the Munich Re portfolio, a 2% improvement is extreme ambitious. When you had asked me before, I said that it would have been my dream to achieve 2% or so. That is nice. Of course, if you compare the expectation against those of the pure cat writers in the world, that sounds small. But don't forget, we have a very mixed and very heterogeneous portfolio where we try to achieve permanent and sustainable profitability over all segment and because of the good composition of the portfolio. So I think it's a good result to be very honest.</p>
          <p>Second question &#x2013; or second point, when you ask me, will we see this more significant worldwide changes, sort of hard market discussion, in the future, to be honest, I don't think so. And we don't plan for such a scenario when we define our internal renewal strategies or growth strategies. What we think is the world &#x2013; the reinsurance world is more educated than ten years or 20 years where the full market, all lines of business and all regions, did react sharply after such loss events or comparable loss events to last year. Yes, that was the case. I don't think that we will see that. And we will see nevertheless the right reactions and the right improvement in those segments where we have to fix problems, where we have to respond to certain exposure on model changes, and I think that is right.</p>
          <p>That means, on the other hand, that no one in the world, neither the Munich Re nor any of our peers, can in future rely on an automatic compensation of losses because of a worldwide change from soft to hard market. So it means the cycle will be there, but they will be flatter &#x2013; let's say, less extreme than in the past.</p>
          <p>And maybe the third point, exactly because of these cyclical development of the non-life business, we think that the Munich Re decision to expand the business base into specialty insurance business, which can nicely be written because of our core know-how, was a very right step. And particularly for that reason, I mentioned in my first slide that an already significant part of this specialty and facultative business, in the meantime, is written in the non-life portfolio. That means, we are to some extent less dependent from the cycles. So I am pretty happy with the renewal and maybe you can follow me why. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And J&#xF6;rg on M&amp;A. As you know, we, as Munich Re, had mixed experiences with our own M&amp;A activities in the last two decades. Some were very successful; others turned out to be quite difficult Therefore, we have a very disciplined approach. We look at many, many potential targets. We are involved in a lot of auction exercises. But during the last couple of years, it has always turned out that we are, with our offers, substantially below what others were prepared to pay. And in almost all cases, in hindsight, we are very glad that we remained so disciplined. So it wouldn't fit to a very disciplined underwriting standard, which Torsten described before, if we were very courageous and would jump into M&amp;A adventures. This still holds through. Nevertheless, we are not sleeping here. We continue looking at potential opportunities, but up to now we had not seen a clear change to realistic pricing. Therefore, there is only a low probability that you will see from us major steps here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions please. First of all, it's a very basic question. I'm having a little difficulty replicating your 96% underlined combined ratio calculation. I guess the only answer is I must be getting the premiums earned wrong. If you could just provide that number, I'd be grateful.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, for reserving, I think you said your reserve cushion was higher than at the end of 2010. I think you said that. I was a little bit surprised with that because I thought a year ago, you said you were right at the very top end of what you found to be tolerable. So am I wrong in that or have you changed your tolerance? So what is the reserve cushion that you'd like to maintain? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the last question, Brian. Conservatism is a flexible word, I would say. When we talked to our actuaries and when they have observed and shared with us the difference between the actual reporting activities and what they had expected from an actuarial point of view, we constantly have a positive deviation. That means, actual is substantially below what we had expected.</p>
          <p>The translation into final reserve numbers, it's not so easy because we are somewhat cautious here to too swiftly react to it because you never know whether the reporting behavior of our clients had potentially changed due to whatever phenomenon. And therefore, we are still cautious. We still want to keep a very substantial management margin not because we are just conservative for its own sake, but rather because we firmly belief that a loss portfolio like ours need some buffers because there must be &#x2013; there can be errors in the one or the other direction.</p>
          <p>So having talked to our auditor just yesterday, I can confirm that we are still within the range of reasonable best estimates, but definitely at the very high-end of a certain range. But I do not want to create too much of a fantasy with regard to future reserve releases as a constant source of additional earnings. We think that the current level is appropriate and should be contained.</p>
          <p>And I hope that somebody gets me the net premiums earned. But what I could do is I can share with you, again, the data for the normalization of our combined ratio, starting from 113.6% for the full year. Natural catastrophe, 28.8% instead of 6.5% expected. That is 22.3 points more. Man-made below the five-year average, 1.1 points below. Means that overall we had 21.2 points too little loss ratio. And for the expenses, a slight deviation. Then I expect the reserve releases with some 4% and come to a combined ratio on a normalized basis of 96%.</p>
          <p>Net earned premium, do we have them? It's &#x20AC;15.8 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you. I've just got one question. In terms of your comment about the outlook for renewal seasons, I guess I understand your optimism about April, but can you elaborate why you think the momentum will continue into July? Last year, the U..S was predominantly affected by the RMS model change and it's been a relatively light cat season since. And as you've already said, capacity is quite plentiful. So why are you optimistic, if you are, about rate increases into the July renewal season? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Two things. First of all, we think there's still some way to go in respect of those programs who were not fully, let's say, hit last year where our math was not fully adopted in the last renewal. So there is some gap which we should and want to close.</p>
          <p>Second reason is, we have, of course, in the meantime, some losses from the market which came through hurricane Irene last year. So there are some new situations, some new pictures. And then we're still uncertain to what extent additional capacity demand comes into the market, which should drive the prices to some extent. Again, we don't expect Japanese type of rate increases, but maybe it's similar like in the January renewal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two things please. The first one is, I guess a number of your competitors and primary companies have been sounding a bit more optimistic in terms of the German motor market. And I know it goes to sort of underweight German motor. But do you sort of share that optimism in terms of improving conditions there?</p>
          <p>And then the second one is, in terms of the reinsurance pricing, I think you alluded to this point of prices needing to go up because of the low interest rate environment. And I think you were suggesting the market is not yet fully taking that into account. But if you look at your own portfolio, presumably price increases of 2% are not enough to compensate for the reduction in yields we've seen this year. And therefore, I wondered if you could just give us a view in terms of how much the economic profit &#x2013; if that's right, how much the economic profitability has fallen? Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>First question, the German motor market. The renewal date for the existing book of business is the end of last &#x2013; was the end of last year. For the first time, and that is the first optimistic development, we saw price increases which were not just announced, but which did materialize up to some extent, in the original rates, in our opinion, in the order up to 3% or so.</p>
          <p>Of course, you should ask now, is it sufficient? Will that turn the market from unprofitability into profitability? Certainly not. The market profitability or combined ratio level according to the outlook of our German Insurance Association is in the order of maybe 106% to 108% or so in 2011. Full figure &#x2013; final figures will be released later in the year.</p>
          <p>So when you now argue or assume, let's say, 3% rate improvement, then, of course, part of these rate increases will be eaten up by loss inflation. So that means, yes, the combined ratio will probably increase, always assuming that the price announcements will continue during the course of the year, but we do not think that the profitability level, particularly considering the low interest environment, is achieved in 2011. When the trend continues for another maybe two to three years or so, then we think we will achieve that, but most likely &#x2013; very likely not in 2011 or 2012. And your second question was, may I ask?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was about the economic profitability of the book. So you were mentioning in the presentation around the market needing to take into account lower interest rates and that wasn't happening. So just wondering what the economic profitability and how has that changed in your book given the too set price increase presumably from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. We always calculated and give you a very good indication. This year, it's for us a sort of zero sum game. And this might surprise you, but it's true. And I tell you why. When we compare the necessary prices of the last renewal, early 2011, with the current renewal, 2012, we always ask how much interest change has to be translated into price &#x2013; into prices. And what we did last year in 2011 was we fixed our pricing parameters already in September 2010 for the 2011 renewal.</p>
          <p>At that time, we probably saw the lowest interest rate in 2010 which then improved during the course of 2011 before it deteriorated again. So that means we &#x2013; when we're comparing our pricing parameters, 2012 versus 2011, the interest level now was almost exactly on that level on the basis of which we have fixed our pricing parameters one-and-a-quarter years ago. So that means in our pricing, we had nothing to add this year, despite ups and downs in the financial market during the course of the year. So this time zero for us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hi, J&#xF6;rg. Two questions please. I just wanted to return to the reserve releases because you mentioned, in 2007 to 2009, mostly coming from the shorter tail things, fire, credit and engineering, many of your peers have actually seen releases coming from liability and casualty. So I was just wondering what kind of trends you are seeing there and why we are not seeing the same kind of releases from that side of things. And if you could also comment on the 2001 and prior development as well please?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I'm just wondering about kind of demand trends generally in the industry. The source of losses &#x2013; nat cat losses that we've seen in 2011, all quite strange losses in a way. You've had non-peak kind of losses that really cause people to reassess tail risk. So what I'm wondering really is what kind of demand trends you're seeing from the primary players. You mentioned that people got tighter budgets and the recession impacts and the fact that they are increasing their retentions. But at the same time, you've got this tail risk issue. You're reassessing those kind of risks and you've got the fact that they are finding it harder to recapitalize in the event of a large loss. So if you could just kind of discuss in general terms about the demand side please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me start with this last question. It's a good question. And to some extent, of course, the demand side is driven by regulatory and legal changing coming from the very front-end of the equation, so to speak, from the customer end. Some come from our insurance companies and some changes are certainly caused by models or by assets or by the reinsurers. There is no general answer in respect of demand side. And each scenario is considered differently. But I can give you some &#x2013; few examples maybe as a result of the last catastrophe event which we have seen.</p>
          <p>In Japan. Japan, the very severe event, a stronger event in terms of magnitude than expected in the specific area, but no other changes or surprises, in general, in the earthquake. What happened? The question in the Japanese market, and that is the demand question, is if the current earthquake system intact and adequate to give the right protection for a private customer, for commercial customers, et cetera. Why this question valid? Because, as you know, earthquake coverage is available in the Japanese market, but the proportion of insured losses and reinsured losses in relation to economic losses is still pretty small. That means, considering the potential size of the loss, there is probably a possibility to discuss changes in the system also. In respect of New Zealand, for instance, the demand side is completely different. Here we discuss questions, how do we proceed/continue with the pool in New Zealand, what will better construction code mean for the earthquake coverage, will that reduce demand or will it continue &#x2013; lead to a continued demand, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>From the insurance company side, we see currently sort of changing demand in respect of frequency cover protection, meaning because of the frequency we have seen with earthquake or smaller hurricanes, more and more requests come to our table asking for frequency protection. And this is a new discussion, of course, and not a very standard product in the market where we have, of course, in certain cases, appetite to underwrite it.</p>
          <p>How do we react to these demand? And here I repeat what I said over the last one to two years. The Munich Re has decided that in terms of overall capacity, our two major scenarios are US hurricane and European windstorm. Particularly, on the US hurricane, we have no appetite further to increase it, and that is almost independent from price changes. In all the other scenarios which are considerably smaller, we have definitely an appetite depending on price to increase our capacity if we can achieve the right profitability. That is maybe some indication what happens now, but there is no general different or general picture as a result of all these catastrophes we have seen.</p>
          <p>The first question was the reserve releases. And when I remember correctly, you ask why the short-tail lines of business, why not casualty, why not more from casualty. The answer is not that straight forward. And of course, the releases, which we show and we will get a detailed picture in our Analyst Conference in March, you will see that comes from all lines of business and from all possible underwriting years, particularly over the last ten years. But why do the short-tail lines dominate these releases? For a very simple reason, our general reserving policy is conservative. That means that particularly under the long-tail lines of business, under casualty, we want to get really good transparency before we make internal decisions to release reserves.</p>
          <p>And the property engineering, it's a bit different. These are short-tail lines. And the reserves we decided to set up in the last years, 2007 through 2009, were too high, were too conservative. And then there is a point where you have to make these releases under short-tail. You come sooner to this transparency, which allows you or us to release these reserves. Therefore, a higher concentration or higher dominance from these property lines. Under short-tail &#x2013; under long-tail, yes, there is contribution. But here we would like to wait a bit longer to get to full or the same transparency before we decide further releases.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Just on that last point, how much longer do you need on casualty to sort of get comfortable with the &#x2013; the development is starting to mature properly, is it one year or is it two years? And can you just comment quickly on 2001 and prior please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not a general answer. It depends, of course, on the reserve pattern of the various sub-segments in casualty. There are lines of business, like the workers' comp business or the asbestos business in the United States where we write 10, 20 years or more before we change any reserve or before we release reserve. In other motor lines of business, of course, we look at that after four or five years and then decide how we proceed with the reserves. And the years before 2011 are, although affected by our releases, but to a significantly smaller extent. So the majority of releases comes from the younger years and here more from short-tail.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. My first question is regarding Solvency II. In the past weeks, we had one additional year of delay and there is a significant risk to see the entire process postponed. What's your view on this process and do you see any risk that the old project will fall apart?</p>
          <p>And my second question is regarding the pricing on proportional. When you give a figure, do you take into account the price increases on the primary level or is it only based on the higher commissions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm J&#xF6;rg speaking. Hello, Thomas. Delay on Solvency II, we read these articles and we did not find them confirmed by the politicians. That means that we are still confident that the time table will be kept. At least we prepare ourselves as if it all get implemented in the course of 2013 and 2014. There are enormous challenges with regard to the reporting requirements still to be fulfilled, also for us here. But we are confident that we will make it. And there is a saying that a better &#x2013; better continue working on a good solution than to have a swift implementation. In our view, we are quite close to a good solution and we very much hope for the last couple of questions to be resolved soon. Torsten?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pricing proportional treaties, yes, of course, we do consider rate changes on the primary side, of course. And we are particularly concerned when primary rates are expected to reduce. And we do take that into account. The commission is only the final, the last instrument you could say, to compensate for any gaps to achieve our profitability target, but primary original rates are decided.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just two quick questions. First of all, when you're normalizing the combined ratio, you don't feel it's time to start increasing the cat load assumption? I think you currently use 6.5 points in nat cat. Some of your peers are actually increasing the loading as a sort of normalized basis. Maybe just comment on whether you think you should be doing that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you're being protected at a local GAAP level considerably for the last two years by your equalization reserves, your stock of equalization reserves, particularly on the property fire account. I think, J&#xF6;rg, you mentioned that was expected to be &#x20AC;2 billion. So I expected to be &#x2013; it was &#x20AC;2 billion in the Q3. Obviously, you had about another &#x20AC;900 million of cat losses in Q4. So it's at a very low level &#x2013; an extremely low level versus history. So how do you kind of give reassurance on the resilience of the local GAAP results sort of going forward if we have another above-average year of catastrophes? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First was the normalization, the cat load. Final decisions haven't been made here. And I guess that there's a difference between us and some competitors because we still have a big proportional book and, therefore, the nat cat impact is not as high. But we will come back to that in the course of the Analyst Conference.</p>
          <p>Second, the equalization reserve, you are right that also in the fourth quarter, part of the equalization reserve for the fire business has been eaten up by the additional losses. But when we look at that now, there's still a little bit less than &#x20AC;1 billion left according to provisional numbers. Also we have our normal nat cat budget against which this all works in a way. So, therefore, there is still some resilience. And also, our calculations for the equalization reserve and the gains under local German GAAP going forward are based on an injection into this equalization reserve, which would not happen if we have additional major nat cat losses. That means, the equalization reserve works in a way even if it's starting from a somewhat lower level. And by the way, the overall reserve, so all lines of business, will still be &#x2013; this is a preliminary number &#x2013; in the order of &#x20AC;6 billion, so quite a substantial amount.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry. Finally, the cat loads, I appreciate what you are saying about your business mix, but I guess some of your peers are also changing it just on sort of revision of modeling and a revision of recent experience, particularly in non-peak zones. Is that &#x2013; would that not be a consideration as well?</p>
