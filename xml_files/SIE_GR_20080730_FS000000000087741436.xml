          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Siemens 2008 Third Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. Before we begin I would like to draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on page two of the Siemens presentation.</p>
          <p>This conference call may include forward-looking statements. These statements based on the company's current expectations and certain assumptions and are therefore subject to certain risks and uncertainties.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Michael Sen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining our investor and analyst call. This morning we announced our results for the third quarter of fiscal '08. The Q3 presentation, the flashlight, the earnings release and supplementary financials can be downloaded from the IR website, and our call will obviously be webcast. We also sent out a press release yesterday relating to the Enterprise Communications JV.</p>
          <p>With me today are Peter L&#xF6;scher, our President and CEO and Joe Kaeser, our Chief Financial Officer. After Peter and Joe's remarks on the accelerated execution of our strategic agenda in Q3 and of course the highlights of the current quarter, we will as always leave time to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I would like to hand it over now to Peter to get us started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Michael. And again welcome to everybody. Joe and I will be covering quite a bit of ground during this call expanding on our continued progress on execution of our TAP program. We will provide operating guidance for 2009 and outline with some details our new compensation scheme which fully aligns management remuneration with financial performance and the interest of our owners.</p>
          <p>Of course Joe will highlight the very good performance in the quarter. Like all of you, we are monitoring the economic situation carefully. And it's getting more uncertain rather than less. But the underlying trends for customer spending in our core businesses remain intact. And our order intake continues to be very strong, laying the groundwork for ongoing quality growth for Siemens.</p>
          <p>During the first nine months of 2008, we have continued to move forward towards the targets we have set forth. In the third quarter, we have shifted into a higher gear and seen double digit increases in orders and revenue, driven behind quality profitable organic growth. And as we have just announced we have also found a very good solution for our non-core asset Siemens Enterprise Communications.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A has moved from planning to execution. We have had very productive talks with the German unions and work councils which have already led to an agreement on the cornerstones for the implementation of our staff reduction plans.</p>
          <p>In a few minutes, I will also outline our new compensation scheme and the outlook for 2009. Our focus on execution has accelerated the share buyback and contributed to some very strong financial results in the quarter, which I will ask Joe to take us through in more detail.</p>
          <p>Over to you Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Peter. Welcome also from my side to our conference call today. As Peter said, Siemens delivered a very strong financial result in the third quarter against a more challenging foreign exchange environment.</p>
          <p>As previously announced this is the first quarter we have reported our results in the new structure. We have also submitted historical financials to the markets few weeks ago, if I am not mistaken, that was on June 24, 2008. I would like to start by briefly highlighting some of the key figures of the quarter and discussing some of the important trends and drivers we are seeing across our businesses.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter we delivered excellent organic growth of 26% with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.23 and organic revenue growth of 13%. The main drivers here were industry was 31% and energy was 33% growth year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Order intake includes one large contract for mobility with the Belgian state railway system worth about 1.4 billion or seven percentage points of the total increase of comparable orders year-on-year. Even if that order was excluded, however, the remaining order growth of close to 20% would still be excellent.</p>
          <p>As it did last quarter our strong order book will result in 2x GDP revenue growth for fiscal 2008 and beyond and that's exactly what Q3 demonstrates.</p>
          <p>We were able to report very strong revenue growth across most of our businesses. Our Energy Division saw double-digit organic revenue growth and the energy sector continues to see very strong global demand, particularly in the renewable with organic growth of 231% and revenue growth of more than 100% in the quarter off the back of some great customer wins like the Greater Gabbard off-shore wind project in the UK with a total contract value of about &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>With such enormous order growth, the number one priority of the division is managing growth, ramping up capacity and executing the backlog without delays.</p>
          <p>I'm sure everybody is looking at our shorter cycle industry businesses. We did saw excellent growth in the quarter. Industry Automation reported organic revenue growth of 16% and Drive Technology of 18%.</p>
          <p>In part this results from our long-term oriented investments in emerging markets like China, which I referred to earlier in calls. Also Industry Solutions reported excellent organic growth of 16% and Osram which is very much at the face of consumers was up 5%, which we believe is a decent performance given exclusivity to those markets.</p>
          <p>Our Healthcare sector, despite a challenging market environment also delivered solid results, with organic revenue growth across imaging and IT, workflow and solutions as well as diagnostic.</p>
          <p>It is also worth-noting that the imaging business, which has seen a drag effect from the DRA this year, in the year achieved 8% year-on-year organic order growth, driven by continued innovation strengths and new products.</p>
          <p>Let me touch briefly on the regional trends. We did see significant organic order and revenue growth in nearly all regions. In particular I would like to highlight our US business, which continues to execute on a very high level, delivering a 24% order growth and 7% revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Turning now to profitability, let me reiterate that we had a relentless focus on earnings quality growth and total sector profit in the quarter was about 2.1 billion, which is actually up 33% year-on-year. Every sector and most of the divisions had a hand in contributing to our top line growth and I am also very encouraged by our margin performance in this quarter. Overall margin of the Sectors is 11.6% and that's 180 basis points higher than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Let me maybe briefly touch on the few businesses. In our recent meetings I have told you that you will like what you see in what used to be called the former A&amp;D. Industry Automation continued its great performance with an underlying margin of 17.9% up 210 basis points year-on-year not including PPA OTC of 41 million and proceeds from the divestiture of the wireless modules business in the amount of 113 million.</p>
          <p>We also saw very good earnings conversion year-on-year based on the underlying profits. Incremental margins were 33% for Drive Technology and 32% for Industry Automation. I would assume that we have seen peak margins or at least close to those peak margins.</p>
          <p>Looking at Energy, our renewables division, the margin was at 11.4%, up 240 basis points year-on-year. Earning conversion year-on-year was exceptional for power transmission with incremental margin of 41%.</p>
          <p>The reporting -- the reported gross margin of Healthcare came in at 12.2%. The underlying margin was 14.3 flat compared to year ago which actually is a very solid result in a very difficult market environment. And here ladies and gentlemen, we clearly do see significant transactional impact of the exchange rate to the US dollar in that business.</p>
          <p>Income from continued ops rose to about 1.5 billion in the quarter, up 143% year-on- year.</p>
          <p>Siemens Equity Investments was breakeven for the quarter, due in part to the significantly improved performance of NSN [Nokia Siemens Networks] despite further restructuring charges which we might also see continuing in the next quarter.</p>
          <p>Corporate items fell to 270 million from 379 in the previous year, mainly due to lower expenses for legal and regulatory matters. Our cash conversion from &#x2013; in continued operations was 105 and this is well above the target of one minus the growth rate.</p>
          <p>A transactional highlight of the quarter is the acceleration of our share buyback program. We have matched our words with action here. And as I said before, we have had a bond offering which in challenging financial environment was heavily over subscribed at spreads of less than about 20 basis points over CDS. As a consequence, we took more than what we initially had intended for and we immediately accelerated the second tranche of our share buyback to 2 billion over a very short period of time, closing July 22.</p>
          <p>In fact we executed this tranche within 32 trading days and since the start of the buyback program in January 2008, we have acquired worth 4 billion of shares and that brings our total shares outstanding down to 861.4 million, a total reduction of 5.8%.</p>
          <p>That's much for the Q3 report. And now I hand it back to Peter for the 2009 outlook. Peter?</p>
          <p>Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Joe. Like all of you, we are keenly away of the macro environment and where we have been more cautious than others. Generally I think opinions in the industry are converging and we see more peers coming into the Siemens camp. We are convinced that the overall economic environment in fiscal 2009 will be less favorable than in the current year. And we think that this might impact the dynamics of our order growth going forward.</p>
          <p>Looking at the consensus estimates, I feel comfortable with the Street's opinion, so let me share with you our take on 2009. We do think that we can grow our revenue for the full year 2009 at twice the rates of our global GDP. After receiving your feedback on our initial plans, we concluded that the meaningful operating guidance would address our core businesses, Industry, Energy, and Healthcare. So we expect total sectors profit in the range of between eight and 8.5 billion for fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>Below the sectors we expect growth of income from continuing operations to be above the growth of total sector's profit and this outlook excludes earnings impacts that may arise from legal and regulatory matters and charges for the SG&amp;A reduction program.</p>
          <p>Let me continue with a brief update on SG&amp;A and other transformation programs where an important lever was the job reductions which we announced on July 8. As I said earlier, talks with the German unions and work councils are very productive. We've already reached agreement on cornerstones for the staff reductions and detailed negotiations with the local works councils have been started. There is a lot of work to do on this and we will add detail when appropriate.</p>
          <p>As we move through and beyond the reenergizing of Siemens, we've also spent considerable time on how to best align management incentives with financial performance and the interest of the owners of our company.</p>
          <p>We focused on two aspects. The first was to ensure that annual compensation is focused on clear metrics, which rewards value creating performance, bonuses which constitute a significant part of management's total annual compensation will be based on achieving strict financial targets, achieving our "Fit for 2010" programs and which are derived from benchmarks and performance relative to competition.</p>
          <p>The second element is designed to create the long-term alignment of management with the owners of our company. And going forward Senior Management will have to invest their own money in the business.</p>
          <p>We believe they will have skin in the game, bringing commitment to an entirely new level within Siemens and further we are going to put in place a comprehensive set of measures and incentives to grow equity ownership within the entire company, from the top to the shop floor. We have designed a very straightforward and comprehensive system that fosters transparency and emphasizes delivery of best in class results.</p>
          <p>To mention just one of the criteria on the right hand side. Simplicity is very important if you really want to change behavior and the scheme must be easy to understand and even more importantly comparable in an international context if Siemens intends to capitalize on the global talent base.</p>
          <p>Let me go into some more details of the annual cash compensation management bonuses. Again the focus is on delivery, roughly two-thirds as you can see on the left hand side, of the variable portion will be tied to relative performance and strict financial targets, such as our Fit for 2010 targets, which are based on competitive benchmarks and we have already raised them in January this year.</p>
          <p>We're moving from budget based to benchmark driven compensation. The remaining third is linked to an annual performance evaluation which considers both compliance and individual achievements over the year. To encourage managers to think beyond their own business, the individual reward assessment will be adjusted based on how well the group performs overall. And here we will be using measures like return on capital and free cash flow, which is right in line with the priorities we've laid out for Siemens in our TAP efforts.</p>
          <p>The second topic is equity ownership. To foster a real equity based culture, we look at the various levels of management responsibility and assigned stringent share ownership requirements which increase as managers move up within the organization and Siemens' top 600 senior managers will be obliged to own shares in an amount of between 50% and 300% of their annual-base compensation. This will definitely motivate them to meet targets and drive shareholder value. These top 600 senior managers are the leaders which really drive business on a day-to-day basis.</p>
          <p>And just remember when I came here last year, the top 20 managers including the Board owned as I shared with you, just 0.0027% of the shares of the company. With the new mandatory share requirements, this number will be at least larger by a factor of 10. For the top 50 alone, we estimate that they have to hold around &#x20AC;30 million will be held in stock at the price of around &#x20AC;70 per share.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will continue our long-term incentive program by awarding restricted stock to the top 5,000 executives of the company. And further, we are planning a global 3 plus 1 share matching plan which will provide incentives for all 380,000 employees to own an equity stake in the company. For every three shares bought and held for three consecutive years, Siemens will match that with an additional share.</p>
          <p>All together, this will increase employees' sense of ownership in Siemens, creating a real equity based culture from the top to the shop floor. The incentive and reward in turn stems directly from our ability to produce the kind of performance we have committed to you. And this is the starting point for the long-term financial alignment of the entire organization with the owners of our company.</p>
          <p>I have said all along, and as you well know, we have embarked on a very ambitious journey to reform Siemens and to deliver world-class performance. Progress is steadily and consistently being made. And there will be no let up in our efforts. It is about changing the culture and this will take time. And as I have told you already in my first meeting with all you, sometimes there will be two steps forward and one step back.</p>
          <p>Challenges are being dealt with decisively. The staff reductions we have announced will be painful and difficult, but they are necessary and will be delivered. The energy in the company is high. We are building a performance culture based on world-class innovation and clearly the strength of our portfolio and the underlying trends in our businesses are intact and delivering. We will get through a more challenging environment in 2009 and are committed to our goals for 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Let me sum up by reiterating our goals for fiscal 2008. Organic growth will come in at twice the rate of GDP -- of global GDP with operating profits and income from continuing operations matching those of last year.</p>
          <p>We have performed well through the first nine months and we have an excellent platform for growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.</p>
          <p>With that we will be happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Andreas Willi with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions please. The first one on your progress on the compliance situation: the number of internal investigations launched in Q3 has gone up quite significantly to 62 from 28 in the previous quarter. Should we read anything into that in terms of further delays until you can get to a SEC settlement?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the corporate expense eliminations line which contributed significantly to the stronger than expected results today, were there any unusuals in there? What should we expect going forward as an underlying level in those two lines?</p>
          <p>And the third question is just, in terms of your lawsuits you are launching to former executive that was communicated yesterday, what is your expectations? What do you expect to gain from that? What's the motivation behind that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas, let me start with the third one first. We have -- as you are aware, we have communicated through a press release, the actions that the Supervisory has taken yesterday. And it's clearly &#x2013; this is the responsibility of the Supervisory Board. It is not up to me to really make any type of comments on it. So it just demonstrates how serious we take the whole issue and how committed the overall company is to really deal with it.</p>
          <p>On the compliance matters, Andreas, I would actually read in exactly the opposite. It's just demonstrates how seriously we are going after compliance matters. We have staffed up the compliance function significantly if you look into the numbers of the staff increases. And we have now really fully covered all the high risk countries as well as closely following key high risk projects as well. So all of it is dealt in a very, very serious way which should obviously be very helpful in the eyes of the SEC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andreas, I would like to cover last one on corporate expenses and eliminations. I think that improvement was more related to base line effect of Q3 2007 where we had several charges and expenses there which did not reoccur again in Q3 2008. So Q3 2008 would be kind of a number to deal with. On -- just for an explanatory note if we booked charges within the SG&amp;A program in the fourth quarter that would be the line that those charges would show off. Generally, underlying fiscal Q3 2008 would be the number going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Scott Babka with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning gentlemen. Just a question, a bit on 2009 guidance. So, I just wondering if, Peter, you'd care to comment on the swing factors you see in the numbers in 2009, kind of what you're assuming for the shorter cycle businesses, and how does SG&amp;A play a part into that?</p>
          <p>And my second question really would be, the commentary on the press release indicates the intention to take the charges in the fourth quarter, I just want to get a sense of your confidence level in terms of going throughout the gating factors to get that done this year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first one, the second one first Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is clear that and this was a major aim as we -- in our negotiations with the unions that we try to go through the consultation process during August, so that we should be in a position to take the majority of the charges in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And as far as the guidance for 2009 is concerned, of course, that guidance, that operational guidance would include all the potential savings which arise out of the SG&amp;A program in 2009 already. Peter talked about the aim we have made that very clear, that we target to get most or everything of the charges in fiscal Q4 2008. But then again there are accounting requirements and those are the ones we are going to follow. We're working on that to get the prerequisites done in due time.</p>
          <p>May be to the operational guidance and also to more global guidance on income from continued operations after-tax. For 2008, we said we want to achieve last year's numbers. So last year's numbers on operational business was 6.521 billion and that included also the division's SEIs, Strategic Equity Investments as well as other operations. So if we translate that number to the total of the sectors which the guidance refers to for 2009, that number would be 6.662 billion. So if you assume for a while that the 6.6 billion would be the number, then the range -- the operational range we have been giving for 2009 on the sectors would be an increase of 20 to 27% from the reported numbers.</p>
          <p>We also did say that the earnings growth in 2009 for -- the results from continued operations after tax would be significantly higher. That actually hints at the fact that we are making good progress for cleaning the other operations and all the items which are between total sectors and discontinued operations line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just any comment in terms of your thinking about your businesses and setting the plan for '09. I mean are you assuming that your Industry part of your business will be under some pressure and that's embedded in the expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Peter said in his speech that we do expect a &#x2013; let's say an ease out of the orders growth in 2009 and we've been quite early in projecting that and I remember at the EPG, he probably was the only one in that camp and it seems that now people are joining that. We are suggesting that for the remainder of the fiscal 2008, there will any weakness in the numbers, but we have to prepare our company for a &#x2013; let's say less bullish order growth for 2009. And as you know, we do have a significant order backlog, which carries as well into 2009 in terms of revenue and here we did commit to grow 2x GDP in 2009.</p>
          <p>As far as margins are concerned and I think I mentioned that in my part of the numbers presentation for Q3, on the industry, especially what used be A&amp;D, we probably are at or pretty close to peak margins going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Joe, good morning Peter. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, on growth and margins. One big surprise from this quarter I guess is -- are the growth rates notwithstanding your generally cautious message. Are we to interpret that as specific acceleration within the divisions that we see those numbers higher or do you think you have just gone after the market better and are gaining market share? That will be question number one.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the margins, margins were generally strong as well and clearly there will be some operational gearing effect. Is that better pricing management for example in a period of high raw materials or are there any other explanations for why this performance has come out so much better than expected even in the Sector groups? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. Let me try to answer your question. Generally, the growth of the business whether or not we have won market shares, I think that is discomparative. We compare ourselves with our peers in industry, not everyone has reported that yet. So we will diligently look into our peers' performance in terms of top line growth and then we will see whether that went at the expense of others and gaining market share or whether we have a generally strong order execution in our revenues.</p>
          <p>And I just want to be clear on the cautious outlooks we have been giving recently since the EPG that always has been reflective to the macroeconomic conditions first, and secondly, if our company was affected by that, that would have been related to order growth in 2009. We never actually said that it was -- that it would affect the revenue growth at any time soon.</p>
          <p>As far as the margin improvement operationally and also the gearing, I think the most dominant effect on the good numbers was that our business have been able to execute without any excuses on any charges and on any non-performance cost. It actually shows the potential of the company, if and when we execute right. So there has been no particular favorable impact or unfavorable impact, it was just a mostly thin quarter.</p>
          <p>One topic though I do want to highlight, we did have proceeds and other gains from the sale of our wireless module segment of 113 million in Industrial Automation. So that one is, I think one impact which we also mentioned in the earnings release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful. Joe, thank you. And just turning to medical, I just wanted to understand how we see the DRA affects playing out in the US. It seems from -- at least what I have seen that demand for scanners generally is still strong and it does depend on the modality, but are the pressures looking to be easing there, or are they still very intense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark we see this actually. There is not much difference in terms of how we have assessed the situation, already a couple of &#x2013; since the last two quarters. By modality you see a difference, so MR for example is spotting out. So there we see clearly a good trend. On the CT side, on the other hand it's still very, very difficult. So overall, we continue to see a difficult environment in the US for the next, let's say six to twelve months.</p>
          <p>What I also would like to highlight on the in-vitro diagnostic side, if you look into the numbers you see probably a slower growth rate than you maybe would have anticipated. This is happening due to the fact that we are now in the process of integrating the three companies. We are consolidating distributorships. We are streamlining basically part of our portfolio from the standpoint that we will be focused on profitable growth going forward. So this is more a quarterly effect what you see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And on the margin on Healthcare, especially on Imaging and Workflow Solutions what we do see, entering the picture now is that we do have to deal with transactional challenges and negative impact on the margin through the FX exchange rate. For the year-to-date number on Healthcare, we have about 100 million adverse impact from FX transactions and the number alone for the quarter was about 40 million. And Imaging as well as Workflow Solutions are particularly affected by that, while we see some positive contribution on <mark type="inaudible" /> from that matter. And we may need to see that for the next couple of quarters till our hedging eases out on a higher level of the forex exchange rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you and good morning.  Just staying with Healthcare, the drop in the margin in Diagnostics by 200 basis points is that also due to integration? And in terms of the 8% organic order growth in Imaging and IT, can you talk about where that's coming from and what kind of pricing trends you are seeing? And then finally looking at fossil power generation, double-digit margin there, clearly, above guidance for next year. Can you talk about what's going on there, especially with the execution of the large projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let's start with the fossil. The fossil is clearly -- I mean this is how the business should execute. So this is a quarter where they have executed well and I think the CEO of our Energy Sector is on record that he said 2009's 5 to 7 is rather conservative. I would agree to this.  The 7 to 9 is what he has communicated.</p>
          <p>On the IT front, I mean we are making good progress with Sorian. We have Sorian now built out. I mean there will be some -- we are now moving into the stage where we move clearly into application development. From a development perspective we had some customer wins. So there again we see progress, but going forward, you also will see how the new leadership team will actually emphasize certain aspects of it in a very clear way within the given committed strategy what we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and maybe adding to Diagnostics, James, hi. You rightfully were hinting at the 200 basis points drop in the third fiscal quarter under discussion. Now that predominantly stems from a one-time spike on R&amp;D spending due to new pipeline products coming through, so I would expect the margin to be -- let's say north again in the fiscal Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning. Two questions please. Firstly, can you talk about the cash impact of the exit from Enterprise Networks, or at least the creation of the joint venture, there was a quote yesterday, Joe, where you were saying that Enterprise Networks would start-off with I think &#x20AC;500 million of cash. Is that cash already inside assets held for disposal or will it be a visible cash outflow when the deal is closed?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the strategic review of Healthcare, I presume that's focused on the IT business, is this just some small issues around the future direction or are you undertaking a more thorough review of what you might do with the IT business inside Healthcare going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the Healthcare first. The Healthcare is I mean -- as I said earlier, Peter, it's basically -- Jim Reid-Anderson is taking over right now, is going through a thorough strategic review process which is happening as we speak. The overall strategy is absolutely on track and he is clearly committed, but I would expect that he emphasizes. And he will make his own judgment calls in terms of parts of the business. And we just have to wait and see how this will probably in the next quarter we will be in a good position to give you further clarity on this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Enterprise piece, I think we have taken some time to get this deal done, with joint venture with the Gores Group in order to, let's say, initiate what we have called a strategic attempt to form a strong number 2 in the marketplace. Gores contributes two companies which also are present in the datacom space which helps Enterprise to improve its standing in that particular segment.</p>
          <p>As far as the financial impact is concerned, already in Q2 we said the financial impact in both reported loss as well as cash outflow will be material we said that again in fiscal Q3. Major reason being that we want to make sure that there is enough financial stability in that company for a good going concern and also withstanding some, let's say, potentially adverse impact from a maybe slowing economy in that sector. So the answer is yes, we will see both a visible cash outflow in the same magnitude as the book losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. Can we take the next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now move to Tim Adams with Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a question on Mobility. When you had the conference call, talking about sales and admin costs, I think you flagged up a couple of issues in Mobility, one concerning product costs in Europe were too high, production costs in Europe were too high. And that the product portfolio was not fully geared to higher growth markets. You are also talking in this release about charges in the fourth quarter, depending on the progress of labor negotiations. I mean what I wondered is if you could share your sort of view on how mobility transitions from where it is today through 2009 toward getting to the targets in 2010? I mean specifically, are we looking for sort of quite of weak 2009, as you actually increase the investment rate, R&amp;D on new projects, that sort of &#x2013; new products, that sort of thing and continue to slim down the cost base of the business? Is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Mobility in Motion, Tim, what we have highlighted is fundamentally because we have really dealt with this, also in our negotiations with the unions as a separate integrated program of, I think, in total of 2,500 people. You should not see an impact in terms of the growth profile, because the order book in this business alone is currently between 36 and 38 months. So it's really how we execute indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A major focus is right now that we actually increase the competitiveness versus our competitors, that we clearly focus in our new orders and order intake on platform development and for this reason on a short-term basis the business has to increase also the R&amp;D initiatives to really develop and fully build-out the platforms. So this will be a program which you will see impacting, obviously not within months. You will see this in the next one or two years, where it &#x2013; how it really plays out. But from the growth profile, the growth profile shouldn't be impacted.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So 2009 profits may well be depressed by increased R&amp;D spend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean we would de disappointed if underlying profitability in 2009 would be worse than 2008, which has already been mediocre. I think what Peter has said is important that we stabilize that business by making sure that we work on platforms. Working on platforms will mean that we get a much more predictable execution on the project. That actually has always been the setback in that division, that projects which actually show the decent order intake calculation on the margin were then negatively impacted by project execution risks. So I think that's in essence what Mobility is suffering from. It's the predictability on execution -- executing the project. And investing now into the platform concept and harmonize the number of potential versions, that's actually for us the key to get a much more stable execution on what we would consider decent return on capital employed, our returns.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Yes, I have a couple of questions. Can you confirm that all new orders coming in in this quarter are -- fulfill the underlying target margins for the divisions?</p>
          <p>Secondly, are there any charges in the power generation results and please give us an update on your view on the Finnish project?</p>
          <p>And third one, can you give us a figure for the total restructuring charges on the Group level?</p>
          <p>And last one with regard to the SEN disposal, have you any tax implications for the full year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Roland, been quite a series of questions. Let me maybe start with the charges on Power Generation, especially related to Fossil &#x2013; the Fossil Division. We also did have some charges related to projects in Fossil Power. Also just for Q3 the positive was though that the negative impact from charges were mostly compensated by favorable developments of project execution and that's what we expect divisions to work on that setbacks are being compensated by better performance in other areas. So that happened in Fossil, so all in all what you would consider our underlying margin to be at about 10 to 11%, I think that would be the right assumption on underlying.</p>
          <p>And then -- so that actually is also true for the total -- let's say the total charges in a way for fiscal Q3 from the operational business on corporate level. You also have seen some adverse impact on Mobility projects, but also here, you also had favorable project execution performance, which will kind of level itself. So no material impact also on corporate level.</p>
          <p>So on Enterprise tax situation, potential tax implications on the transaction, if and when they stem from the transaction would be included in that material book loss we have been disclosing. So therefore, there will be a number on what that transaction did cost as of 9/30/2008, because that's supposed to be the closing date and then we will disclose more details on what that number looks like and what the factors are which make up that number. But tax implications would be included in the number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last one --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there was one missing. It was the Finnish project on the famous Olkiluoto. You know we have got two aspects here, one is the nuclear island where we have a 34% equity stake and the other one is the conventional island. From what we know today, we are adequately reserved on the conventional island. There we have full ownership on the operation and the turnkey activities. We also need to caution that even though we believe we are fully covered at this point in time from what we know, this is a prototype reactor and the degree of completion is still in the neighborhood of about 60%, so there is a way to go and therefore, there is this usual disclaimer.</p>
          <p>On the nuclear island, as you know we depend on the P&amp;L, and the P&amp;L statements from AREVA where we then take a 34%. In our recent earnings release, we have cautioned that there could be one-off type developments here. But then again this would be a perfect question for AREVA to ask in their next conference call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from William Mackie with MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Thank you. A few questions. First of all, you are now managing concurrently a number of portfolio and restructuring programs be that SG&amp;A or Mobility in Motion, or the efforts to reposition other operations or SIM. Can you just clarify with your guidance, should we expect all of the associated charges with those effects and others such as the strategic review of Medical to be excluded from the 8 to 8.5 billion of sector, and the income from continuing ops or will there be a proportion of those which you will charge against ongoing results?</p>
          <p>My second question would just come back to your more &#x2013; comments of the more challenging economic conditions in 2009. Perhaps you could elaborate on which sectors and specifically which divisions you feel may see more of the slowdown in order intake within the framework of your assumptions for economic growth in '09 versus '08.</p>
          <p>And then lastly perhaps just a smaller point on the legal expenses, obviously lower in this quarter, but how should we anticipate that the legal expenses progress through Q4 and into next year. Do you still have a burden ahead of you, or are we through the peak? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Will. Let me maybe start with the legal expenses on Q3 and related in fiscal Q4. I think your assumption is fair to say that we're seeing peak levels here, predominantly in fiscal Q2 with 175 million in total, including also the discontinued operations, aspect of that. So, it's not going to go down, that significantly as we probably would wish for, because we thoroughly investigate into matters and make sure that we resolve the matter once and for good. However, I think, for the model, the assumption is right that we have seen peak levels. And on fiscal Q4, I would not expect the charge to be let's say tending back on Q2 levels.</p>
          <p>On the portfolio and the number of restructuring programs, yes, there has been quite a number of programs we are executing parallel. Our guidance for 2008 which we actually reiterated today to the same levels as we have announced in Q2, as well as fiscal 2009, they do not include transformational and regulatory aspects which may arise from those areas. So they would not exclude any, let's say, SEC matters nor would they exclude, if there were any, material topics from divisions, which are transformational.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In that context what would we take as material? Would it have to be a three-digit plus number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please give the question again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You stated that if they are material charges they will be excluded from the guidance. There are ongoing business transformational efforts such as Mobility in Motion that might be regarded as a necessary rather than exceptional part of business activity. So what makes something exceptional rather than ongoing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think exceptional charges would be such as related to the SG&amp;A program, because that still leads the company effort and as we said we will try to include everything possible already in fiscal Q4 2008. Of course, there are accounting rules here which we are obeying too but then the company is set up to go for fiscal Q4 2008. On the Enterprise piece even though it's a discontinued operation that would also be coming in fiscal Q4 2008, since we expect closing as of 9/30/2008.</p>
          <p>The other operation topics, I think we are on the record saying that the proceeds from divestitures would in essence cover the restructuring charges for that area. So that's why I think it's fair to say that we would not expect major transformational aspects anymore in 2009, because 2008 is considered to be the year of transformation and that also would be reflected in the numbers.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you and good morning. My first question relates to the Energy Division. We've seen slowing order growth for both the Fossil Power Generation and the Power Transmission divisions this quarter, especially compared to peers in the same divisions. So are there any financing difficulties or environmental factors that are holding back order growth right now? Or are we seeing here the first effects of your strategy to refocus on product and services and be more selective in bigger contracts? That is my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, you see really -- I mean as we have highlighted, this is an execution issue. We have said that we would like to basically reemphasize the overall spread between two-thirds services and turbines versus one-third of turnkey programs. This is an issue where we have simply had a quarter where we had less turnkey programs coming in as order growth.</p>
          <p>On the other hand we will have for the full year, a 50% increase in our gas turbine, we will increase this significantly, so we are executing against our strategy and therefore we'll have a significant opportunity also for our highly profitable service contracts going forward. So that's an execution aspect of our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And just one quick question for Healthcare, especially the diagnostic division: could you may be give us an update on the level of PPA charges and one-time costs for diagnostic expected for 2008 and for 2009. The growth was pretty low this quarter compared to the guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That usually has to do how much the -- let's say the portion of the inventory step-up, will be that sometimes is volatile, so there could be deviations predominantly based on the inventory step-up portion of PPA and one-time cost. So the OTC costs are suppose to come down over time, because they're as much related to integrational aspects and then if we go to DX, the one-time cost on DX has been 29 million on PPA and another 29 million on OTC. And I think for the full year if you go by about 180 million PPA and about 170 million on one-time cost that could be about the ballpark you can expect for the full fiscal year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I have a question about your guidance for 2009 with respect to profit. I mean heard Joe when we said before that the 6.5 billion is kind of like of the level you are -- you are starting from in 2008 you should try to get the bridge from the group profit. I am just trying to figure out how that works. Because I mean after nine months your sector profits stand at 5 billion -- a little over 5 billion and you had in the quarter 2.1 billion. So, assuming no major deterioration in the fourth quarter or major issues that you will book in the fourth quarter, and from what I understand all those major ones wouldn't be booked in sector profit anyway. So the starting point from my point of view would be more in the ballpark of 7 billion for sector profit in '08 and that number includes roughly 1 billion in project related charges you took in the second quarter. So, to me the underlying number for this year appears to be somewhere round about 8 billion. So the 8 to 8.5 billion you are guiding for next year is not exactly an increase, at least on the underlying side. I mean, am I doing anything wrong on the calculation or maybe you can just help me on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's been quite a good analysis on the numbers we've disclosed. And the year-to-date numbers are 5.037 billion on total sector profit. Obviously, there is also -- there are also positive impact from the divestitures of assets in those sector numbers. I just would like to remind you on the 113 million of wireless modules. There has been a positive impact from the sale of the hydrocarbonate and other topics in the last nine month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Though you also had -- sorry -- you also had a couple of negative restructuring charges and stuff like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. So there have been positives and negative. So while I think it remains to be seen whether it's 1 billion or maybe a little less on the underlying. I think your analysis is right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what Peter said earlier -- and obviously by the numbers is right. I am not sure about the conclusions. But as Peter said earlier, he and the whole management team feel comfortable with what Street considers a consensus or a kernel estimate. And I think that's as much as we would want to say at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe just as one follow-up on the SG&amp;A there. I mean the big question right now is how and when you will book the charges? Now the positive impact from the SG&amp;A, your guidance for next year, does it imply any material positive impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The positive impact of the SG&amp;A program would be part of the guidance for 2009. As I said earlier, we try as hard as we can to book at least the majority if not all of the charges for SG&amp;A this fiscal quarter Q4 2008. I also would like to remind you though that we are base lining 9/30/2007, which is 12.1 billion. If you look at the P&amp;L year-to-date 2008, and do just a rough estimate like dividing by three times four to get a linear forecast if you want for the total SG&amp;A in 2008, you might recognize that actually the baseline unfortunately developed into the wrong direction. So what the company needs to make up for is not only the 1.2 billion savings from 12.1 to 10.9 which obviously we are very committed to even though we believe it's a big stretch. If we are speaking to the anticipated top line growth, but then we have to make up first and come back and drive the cost back to the baseline. And that obviously happens predominantly in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I just come back to that? I mean you set the targets for the total program at 1.2 billion in cost savings, I mean how much of that have you factored in your '09 outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Honestly, that's what I just tried to explain. Again, if you look at the 12.1 billion as a baseline 2007 and look at the company P&amp;L for year-to-date 2008 and just do the math in SG&amp;A divide it by three times four to kind of get a linear annual estimate. And you will see there is actually efforts to be achieved in 2009 to bring it actually back to the baseline. So therefore, I would not want to speculate it to any additional upsides from the SG&amp;A in 2009. So the numbers -- the operational guidance, we have given 8.0 to 8.5 that's the number including all the impact total from the SG&amp;A.</p>
