          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the MetLife Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session; instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife Inc.'s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife Inc. specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mary and good morning everyone. Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2009 earnings call. We are delighted to be here with you this morning to talk about our results for the quarter. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. We have reconciled these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in our earnings press release and in our quarterly financial supplements, both of which are available on our website at metlife.com. A reconciliation of forward looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of the net investment related gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.</p>
          <p>Joining me this morning on the call are Rob Henrikson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Kandarian, our Chief Investment Officer, and Bill Wheeler, our Chief Financial Officer. After our brief prepared comments we will take your questions. And here with us today to participate in the discussion are Bill Mullaney, President of our U.S. Businesses and Bill Toppeta, President of International, as well as other members of management.</p>
          <p>With that I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Conor. Good morning everyone. During the second quarter MetLife generated very strong top line results. Premiums, fees and other revenues increased to 8.4 billion, which by the way is one of our highest quarters ever.</p>
          <p>Our operational earnings increased significantly over the first quarter earning $0.88 per share. Book value including AOCI improved by approximately 18% from the first quarter. It is evident that our diverse mix of businesses and solid fundamentals have allowed us to perform well and to continue to grow in this challenging environment. We are still experiencing a flight to MetLife and increased market share in many of our key businesses while importantly maintaining our pricing discipline.</p>
          <p>Before I share our business highlights, I would like to talk briefly about our recent decision to combine our Institutional, Individual, and Auto &amp; Home businesses into an integrated U.S. business organization. We have an incredible opportunity to leverage our capabilities and further drive growth as we enhance our product design and distribution and streamline our decision-making process. This is an exciting time for our company as we build upon our strength and seize opportunities in the marketplace. This realignment was a significant outcome of our strategic review that we have been telling you about since last summer.</p>
          <p>Another element of our strategy, which we have discussed before, is operational excellence. We are well on our way to achieving the significant cost savings that we've targeted under this initiative. Now let me provide some insight into the performance of our businesses.</p>
          <p>The Institutional business generated outstanding results as the top-line grew 8% year-over-year to $4.3 billion. Our group life premiums, fees and other revenues grew over 4%, our non-medical health grew by 3%. Retirement and saving business grew 35%. We had higher closeout sales particularly in the U.K. where the market is improving. We also experienced a significant increase in structured settlement sales as we grew market share in this business. Our group life and disability underwriting results were strong, though dental performance was disappointing with higher benefit utilization as a result of the ongoing economic uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Individual business after two challenging quarters generated some very positive results during the second quarter. Life sales were strong across all channels up 27% sequentially though down 9% year-over-year. Annuity deposits increased year-over-year by 43% with a record $4.5 billion in variable annuity deposits and nearly one billion in fixed annuity deposits. Annuity net flows or both fixed and variable annuities remained positive, 3 billion in total and both our benefiting from declining lapse rates for the second consecutive quarter.</p>
          <p>In international premiums, fees and other revenues declined over the year ago period due to the strength of the U.S. dollar though on a constant currency basis, top line revenue was flat.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, premiums, fees and other revenues were down 6% on a constant currency basis. We continue to have solid performance in the Asia-Pacific and European regions. In Asia our premiums, fees and other revenues were up 8% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, there has been significant growth of fixed annuity deposits while variable annuity deposits have declined reflecting a continuing shift in that marketplace.</p>
          <p>Our European premiums, fees and revenues were up 7% on a constant currency basis as our European region businesses continue to grow. Auto and home had another strong quarter delivering earnings of 76 million up 46% over the second quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to shift gears for a moment and talk to you about our capital strength and some related events in the quarter. Over the past several months, I have been telling our clients, our shareholders and all of you that MetLife's strong excess capital position, ample liquidity and leading market position set us apart in the life insurance industry.</p>
          <p>As you know, MetLife participated in the government stress test and we believe the assessment reinforces what we have said about our strong capital position. Let me just mention a couple of points. On the measure of total potential losses, ours was the lowest of the 19 participants. Furthermore, the potential losses on our commercial real estate loan portfolio were also lowest at 2.1%, a fraction of the median at 10.6.</p>
          <p>I point this out because commercial real estate mortgages continue to be a topic of discussion and we believe the stress test assessment supports our view that our underwriting differentiates us from other financial institutions.</p>
          <p>On the measure of Tier 1 common capital adequacy, we were fifth strongest. And remember we were also the only company of the 19 that did not participate in the TARP capital purchase program.</p>
          <p>Also in the second quarter we took the opportunity to further bolster our capital and issued an additional $1.25 billion in debt, which was several times oversubscribed.</p>
          <p>All told, we continue to be confident that we have the financial strength to succeed now and over the long term. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage opportunities to build an even stronger company. We're proud of our initiatives to offer simpler, better products to our customers as they continue to seek trusted companies and quality products.</p>
          <p>For example, we recently launched our Simple Solutions variable annuity which offers easier to understand and lower cost benefits especially to those nearing or in retirement. These are being offered through banks providing a new vehicle for financial advisers to help clients turn retirement assets into a stream of withdrawals they cannot outlive.</p>
          <p>We've also commenced a co-branding pilot program with other major global financial firms. These efforts among others will allow us to maintain our leading market position as we continue to benefit from a flight to quality and increased market share.</p>
          <p>In summary, despite the uncertain environment MetLife's businesses are performing well and with the recent realignment we are even better positioned to meet the needs of our clients and we have the capacity and financial strength to further solidify our leading position in the industry.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Steve.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Rob. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing the key components of our investment results for the quarter. First let me start with a comment on variable investment income. Pre-tax variable income for the second quarter was zero, which is below plan by $150 million or $102 million after tax and DAC primarily driven by negative real estate fund and corporate joint venture returns.</p>
          <p>Real estate fund returns were negative due to the continued decline in property valuations. We estimate that property values have declined an additional 5 to 10% during the second quarter with an expected peak to trough total decline of about 40%.</p>
          <p>While corporate joint-venture returns improved substantially from the first quarter, they still remained negative during the second quarter. On the other hand, income from our securities lending program continued to outperform plan. In addition, hedge fund returns continued to improve and were above plan during the quarter. However, we expect variable income will remain below plan for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Now let me cover investment losses for the quarter. Gross investment losses were $546 million, in line with the previous four quarters. Write-downs this quarter were $846 million, these write-downs were experienced across a variety of sectors including $248 million in corporate credit, $129 million due the strengthening of the mortgage valuation allowance and $82 million in structured finance securities. Write-downs also included $325 million of partnerships in equity securities and $62 million of hybrid securities which were impaired because of length of time and the extent to which the market value had been below amortized cost.</p>
          <p>Losses due to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting were $2.8 billion. This was primarily attributable to a $1.5 billion pre-tax loss due to the improvement in MetLife's own credit spread and its impact on the valuation of certain insurance liabilities.</p>
          <p>For example, MetLife's five-year credit spread decreased 312 basis points. This reverses derivative gains in previous quarters that occurred when our credit spread widened. The remaining $1.3 billion loss was due to several factors that negatively impacted the valuation of our derivatives including higher Treasury yields which reduced the value of our interest rate swaps and floors, the weakening of the U. S. dollar which reduced the value of our foreign currency swaps used to hedge foreign-denominated assets, and the decline in credit spreads which decreased the value of credit default protection we purchased for our corporate bond portfolio.</p>
          <p>As I have discussed previously, while the decline in value of these derivatives is reflected in our income statement, it is generally offset by a change in value of the hedged assets or liabilities. Gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities were $19.5 billion at June 30 down substantially from the $28.8 billion at March 31 as spreads declined across all sectors.</p>
          <p>Next I would like to discuss our real estate related holdings. As of June 30 we held $41.8 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities including $7.3 million of non-agency prime and $3.4 billion of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities. As I discussed in the last earnings call, the rating agencies have downgraded virtually all 2006 and 2007 vintage Alt-A securities to below investment grade.</p>
          <p>As a result, 88% of our 2006 and 2007 vintage Alt-A securities and 56% of our total Alt-A portfolio is rated below investment grade at quarter end. In addition, during the second quarter, the rating agencies downgraded non-agency prime securities. As a result, 32% of our non-agency prime holdings are now rated below investment grade. The remaining $31.1 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities are AAA-rated agency-backed securities.</p>
          <p>As noted on several occasions, we believe our non-agency RMBS portfolio has superior structure to the overall market. For example, 86% of our Alt-A and 97% of our non-agency prime securities are fixed rate versus 35% and 51% for the market respectively. In addition, 90% of our Alt-A and 51% of our non-agency holdings have super senior credit enhancement. Furthermore, we hold no Option ARM mortgages as compared to 29% for the Alt-A marketplace.</p>
          <p>At quarter end, MetLife's commercial mortgage portfolio was $35 billion. As of June 30, the portfolio loan-to-value increased to 63% based on our rolling four quarter property valuation process or we estimate in the mid to high 60% range if all properties where revalued today. In addition, the debt service coverage ratio for the portfolio is a very healthy two times.</p>
          <p>Moreover commercial mortgage delinquencies and losses remained minimal. We had no defaults in our U.S. portfolio during the second quarter and only one small default in our international portfolio in the amount of $6 million. As I mentioned earlier, we strengthened our mortgage valuation allowance resulting in the commercial mortgage reserve of $435 million at June 30, up from $329 million at March 31. In addition only $1.6 billion of the portfolio matures during the remainder of 2009 and $2.5 billion in 2010. We remain comfortable with this level of rollover and expect to refinance and hold the vast majority of these mortgages as we refinance them at market rates.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me say a few words about our cash and short-term holdings. As of June 30, our cash and short-term investments were $21.3 billion down from $30.3 billion as of March 31. Over the course of the quarter we invested in a diversified portfolio of assets primarily including U.S. government securities, agency residential mortgage backed securities and investment grade corporate credit.</p>
          <p>The yield on these purchases excluding U.S. government securities and floating rate securities was approximately 5.65%.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, while we have seen some stabilization in the financial markets, we remain defensively positioned and are cautiously reinvesting our liquid assets.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn the call over to Bill Wheeler.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Steve, and good morning everybody.</p>
          <p>MetLife reported $0.88 of operating earnings per share for the second quarter. This morning I'll walk through our financial results and point out some highlights as well as some of the unusual items which occurred during the quarter. We had premiums, fees and other revenues of 8.4 billion. This represents an increase of 3.5% as compared to the second quarter of 2008. Adjusting for the impact that exchange rates had on International's reported revenues, MetLife's premiums, fees, and other revenues would have been up by 6.2% as compared to the second quarter of 2008. And I think that is an excellent result in this environment.</p>
          <p>Institutional's revenues were up 8% as compared to the second quarter of last year. This was primarily due to strong U.K. pension closeout and structured settlement sales. The group life premiums grew at 4.1% and non-medical health grew at 2.9 as compared to the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>International had reported revenues of one billion in the second quarter compared to 1.2 billion in the year ago period. Changes in exchange rates had a significant impact on reported revenue. On a constant dollar basis revenue would actually have been flat with the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to our operating margins, let's start with our underwriting results. Underwriting experience was generally favorable this quarter. In Institutional, group life mortality of 91.3% was well within our guidance range of 91 to 95% and flat with the prior-year. In non-medical health and other, group disability's morbidity ratio of 87.6% for the quarter was better than our target range of 89 to 94 driven by continued stable incidence. We saw higher claims utilization in dental but that was largely offset by favorable results in other non-medical health products. Individual's mortality ratio of 74.9% is significantly more favorable than our plan driven by lower claim frequency. Individual's underwriting results were favorable this quarter across all life products.</p>
          <p>Turning to Auto &amp; Home, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.5%, down from the 99.5% experienced in the second quarter of 2008 due to lower catastrophes in the current quarter. Included in this result is a non-cat prior accident year reserve release of $3 million after-tax compared to a $26 million after tax release in the same period of last year.</p>
          <p>Moving to investment spreads. With regard to variable investment income, as Steve just explained, we again saw a mixed performance of certain variable alternative asset classes this quarter. We experienced negative returns in real estate funds and corporate joint ventures. Securities lending margins were strong and hedge funds performed well with returns on both asset classes coming in above plan. For the quarter, variable investment income after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs was $102 million or $0.12 per share, lower than the 2009 plan.</p>
          <p>Moving to expenses. Our overall expense level was higher this quarter but that was driven by a higher pension and postretirement benefit costs. Pension and PRB benefits, PRB expenses were approximately $100 million pre-tax higher than in the second quarter of 2008. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect our pension and post retirement benefit costs to increase by approximately 300 million in 2009 mainly due to weaker investment results. Also this quarter, we incurred $33 million pre-tax in operational excellence charges, which consists mainly of severance payments, and some consulting payments.</p>
          <p>Our operational excellence initiative is progressing well. Related expense reductions were approximately $75 million in second quarter, which annualized to a current run rate savings of 300 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, also in the expense line, the equity market improvement of over 15% and interest rate movements in the second quarter increased earnings through lower DAC amortization in Individual business by approximately $58 million after-tax or $0.07 per share.</p>
          <p>Turning to our bottom-line results, we earned $723 million in operating income or $0.88 per share with regard to net investment gains and losses, in the second quarter, we had net investment losses of $2.6 billion after-tax, our derivative losses were 1.8 billion after-tax, and as Steve mentioned, the largest portion of that result was a $1 billion after-tax loss caused by the tightening of MetLife's own credit spread. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings for the second quarter of 2009 are approximately 1.1 billion, which is very good. And our preliminary statutory net income is 530 million.</p>
          <p>Our results this quarter include the adoption of a new FASB pronouncement for the recognition of other than temporary impairments of debt securities, which is FAS 115. Under this guidance the credit loss or the portion of the decline in value that represents a reduction of expected cash flows is included as a charge to net income while the remainder of the decline in value, or the non-credit portion is recognized within accumulated other comprehensive income, AOCI. As a result of the transition adjustment which is the transition adjustment required by this guidance, equity as of April 1 was increased by $76 million after-tax and DAC with a corresponding reduction to AOCI. This transition adjustment represented the non-credit portion of previously recorded other than temporary impairments on debt securities.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter of 2009, the other than temporary impairments of debt securities in total were $566 million on a pre-tax basis of which 332 million was included &#x2013; I've got to turn the page &#x2013; in realized investment losses while the remaining 234 million was recorded in other comprehensive income. So again the FAS 115 adjustment would have been 234 million.</p>
          <p>In summary, the fundamentals of our business continued to prove strong and we continue to succeed in the challenging market environment.</p>
          <p>With that let's turn it over to the operator so we can take your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had a few questions. The first one is on your cash balances. They went down 9 billion from the first quarter 21.3 billion. I just wanted to get an idea on where you think normal cash balances will be a year, two years down the road and how fast do you expect to get there?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on your &#x2013; just the variable investment income. I think Steve mentioned that it is unlikely to be below &#x2013; be at 150 million, the run rate or the guidance for this year. But versus the quarter that you just reported, how should it improve or what are the asset classes that are going to get better, what could get worse whether it is hedge funds or real estate?</p>
          <p>And then finally just on your derivative losses, if you could give us an idea of how much you have in less than derivative gains that could reverse over time if spreads were to go back to let's say where they were a year ago and how should we think about that number repeating in the third quarter again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jimmy, it is Steve. I will take the first two questions you posed. The cash balances are likely to drift down lower over time. I don't have an exact number or projection for you. It really is something we look at very closely with current market conditions and obviously with all the changing dynamics in the marketplace it is very hard to predict this. So as you know, we have been very cautious. We stayed liquid in the first part of the year here beyond what we would normally do. And we sort of have gone back into the credit markets gradually over last few months. So I don't have an exact number for you but we certainly are investing now in a more normal array of assets compared to early in the year and late last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding variable investment income I think there are some pluses and minuses that are likely to occur here over the course of the year. But that really is a guess because it is very hard to predict what is happening or what is going to happen in the credit markets, in the financial markets in general.</p>
          <p>So for example, if the stock market continues to perform reasonably well for the remainder of the year we would expect that our hedge fund returns would remain fairly strong, which they were in the second quarter compared to the two quarters previously. Private equity funds in that kind of environment would probably be going sideways pretty much. I don't see a lot of big realizations in this marketplace in the near term but at least we wouldn't see as many write-downs as we saw in the previous couple of quarters: Q4 of '08 and the first quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>We do think that the real estate fund area is likely to remain weak. It tends to be little bit more of a lagging indicator than some other sectors. So we anticipate that sector to be weak for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Again, all those comments are caveated based upon what happens in the markets in general. If we see a real rally in the markets even beyond what we have seen to date, then those numbers will improve. If we see the markets sell off dramatically then obviously the numbers will come down pretty sharply as well.</p>
          <p>The last thing I'd mention is our securities lending program. It's currently about $22 billion at quarter end, up from about 20 billion in the previous quarter. With the relatively steep yield curve it's a fairly attractive business once again for us and the profits there are strong but obviously the balances are far less than they were at one time when we saw balances in the mid-$40 billion range, actually peaking out at about $50 billion. We don't see those kinds of balances anytime in the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jimmy. With regard to derivatives I'm going to answer your question this way. If you look back at our derivative gains and losses, let's say over the last &#x2013; well really since the beginning of 2008. We, on a net basis, have derivative gains, okay? And just two quarters ago, obviously we had a very big derivative loss this quarter, but two quarters ago we had an equally big derivative gain. Now obviously a lot of that is driven by own credit which is not cash and obviously that's really sort of accounting noise, if I'm allowed to say that. And it's -- and it doesn't affect capital or anything.</p>
          <p>But obviously the other derivative gains, there might be a cash settlement component to it. So if you look over the last six quarters, we've really had derivative gains and another way to think about this is in our cash balance that Steve talked about, the 21.3 billion this quarter, in that there is about 3 billion related to collateral, mainly on the settlement of derivative contracts. So we're still way in the money on a lot of our derivative positions. So it's &#x2013; so there is room.</p>
          <p>And of course, remember, just keep this in mind, where derivatives are hedging something. And so if derivative values keep going down, some other part of our balance sheet is improving, probably AOCI, probably the bond portfolio, but sometimes it's liabilities. And so that's something we feel good about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly, could you just give us a number on your stat [statutory] income if you have an estimate for the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it was in my remarks. Our stat net income was 530 million bucks. This is an estimate still, it's not final. Our stat operating income was 1.1 billion which is quite good.</p>

First for Bill, in the past you have talked about the potential EPS power of the company being in the range of 4.25 to $5 but with the caveat that it will take time, perhaps significant time with respect to alternative investments to return to that level. Any change in your views of that longer-term EPS potential following these results?</p>
          <p>And then second for Steve, with realized investment losses. Earlier in the year you kind of talked about potential losses of 1% of general account assets. And the results in the first half of the year are certainly consistent with that. Is that still a good number for the back half of the year and any preliminary views for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will certainly give you my opinion about the variable investment income but it's probably Steve's the right guy to talk to. I think it should all recover next quarter. [Laughter]. But Steve might be little more cautious than that, so maybe I will let him comment on that.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, on the losses for the remainder of the year, again as I mentioned, under variable income, it is really hard to project when you don't really know quite what this market is going to be doing quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month, even day-to-day. But the 1% number we've used, I think is a pretty good guide for our estimate for the remainder of 2009.</p>
          <p>I think it is still early days to say too much about 2010. We will certainly talk about that at investor day. But so much of this depends upon the overall economy, consumer sentiment, policies in Washington, impacts upon markets, psychologies of markets and so on, it is just very difficult to predict. But I think we can say that the 1% number that we've used &#x2013; Bill and myself in the past &#x2013; is a pretty good guide here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry; maybe I misunderstood your question a little bit. The &#x2013; you know, I don't think actually in terms of that little exercise, that public exercise that we went through about four and a quarter &#x2013; I don't think that is &#x2013; I'm not sure &#x2013; that sort of assumes that eventually VII is going to recover, which we obviously think it will, and that eventually, we'll get fully invested, and we'll invest in spread assets.</p>
          <p>And the timing of that, I think as I said then, I would still say and as you obviously just heard Steve repeat, I think the timing of that is we're going have to see. I mean the momentum is going all the right way, but we're going to have to see about how quickly we do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Perhaps if I can just follow up on the investment portfolio. Below investment grade holdings continue to see some adverse ratings migration. What's the risk if you continue to face adverse ratings migration going forward, that some of those assets will not be able to be admitted for statutory purposes, pressuring your capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's &#x2013; I think we're far below any kind of limitations there with regard to the ratings migration. I'm kind of hoping &#x2013; maybe it's just wishful thinking &#x2013; that the ratings migration might be over. [laughter] But maybe not. We'll find out.</p>
          <p>But I think in terms &#x2013; obviously, it does &#x2013; just the mere fact that there is a ratings migration creates a capital charge. The way to think about that, or the way I encourage people to think about that, including our colleagues in the rating agencies, is obviously they have created this &#x2013; by downgrading a whole bunch of securities that we thought we were investing in at AAA, they've caused a capital drag. They &#x2013; but it's temporary. Eventually we'll work our way through that. It'll take a couple of years, and in our case, of course, as Steve just talked about, we think those securities are money good. But they've sort of &#x2013; it's a capital tax that they've created, if you will. And &#x2013; but we'll work our way through it.</p>
          <p>But in terms of whether or not we have &#x2013; we are up against any statutory limitation, I don't think we're very close.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Good morning, just two questions. First, on the variable annuity business, obviously your results there are some of the strongest we've seen so far in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Just want to talk a little bit about risk management. I think, Rob, in the past, you've said that one of the reasons that you like the VA business is that is because you have all these other businesses that form this diversification. How do you think about how much capacity you have to write new VA business? It just seems like kind of write as much as you want in this environment given your market share. So how should we think about that?</p>
          <p>And then the second question is just sort of some numbers questions on the capital, if, Bill, you provided the stat numbers in terms of earnings, but do you have a RBC estimate as of the second quarter? And then is the 5 billion of excess capital that you've talked about in the past still a good number to use? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just start off by saying &#x2013; and I know you would understand this &#x2013; just so that everyone understands. I do love the variable annuity business. It is something that is easier to love if you are well diversified and have multiple sources of earnings, and you can spread your risk.</p>
          <p>However, I would say as a caveat there is that's under the assumption that you are properly designing and pricing your products in the variable annuity business. So the way you phrased the question, I just wanted to make sure that people didn't think that I was ever saying that because we are in other businesses, we can have one that we don't pay attention to because we're very comfortable with the way we manage our variable annuity business.</p>
          <p>I'm happy with, obviously, our increased market share. It's very unusual to see your market share double in a period of a couple of quarters. Whether or not we can maintain that market share will be dependent on what happens to others in the market and so forth.</p>
          <p>Am I comfortable with the market share we have? Yes, I am. And &#x2013; but I don't know that it would be wise to predict that you would continue to hold a market share of 17, 18%. I think that's to be determined. Bill might want to add more specifics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, in terms of just a risk-management point of view, we want diversification of how we make money. And we make a lot of money. I mean obviously the VA business has a lot of earnings power, and a lot of earnings potential to it. And my feeling sort of is that, that's probably all the equity exposure we want. But we will see.</p>
          <p>With regard to RBC, I think &#x2013; we &#x2013; just for everybody's benefit, we don't calculate the RBC every quarter; it's only done once a year. And the reason for that is it's actually a very complicated calculation; there is lots of stochastic modeling, which gets done. And we do not do that every quarter. We do &#x2013; I don't want to pretend like we don't think about RBC every quarter, because we obviously do. And we do some shorthand calculations to make sure we have a good sense of what's going on with our capital ratios. But it's not a number that I think is ready for prime time. And so I won't disclose an interim estimate number, because that's not something I'm frankly comfortable with.</p>
          <p>The capital levels, there is a lot of attention to what's going on in capital right now. You've got ratings, you've got securities migration, which is obviously a drag, we just talked about that. You've got state regulatory relief, which is up in the air, about which &#x2013; we have some state relief for some of our &#x2013; in some states, not much in New York, frankly, but &#x2013; that happened this year, and who knows what will happen later in the year, when that stuff has to get renewed.</p>
          <p>You will have a &#x2013; you've got an environment, which frankly is much better than it was at year end in terms of where the stock market is and where interest rates are. And that helps your stochastic modeling, frankly, your C-3 Phase II calculations and such. So in general, I feel like our RBC ratio has probably come down from year-end, probably really driven by credit migration, but frankly the earnings that we &#x2013; stat earnings we had this quarter were quite good. The thing what you should remember is, not included in any of those calculation is the 5.2 billion of cash that's sitting at our holding company right now.</p>
          <p>So it's &#x2013; so I feel like it's hard for me to be real precise about what an excess capital number is. But I think we still have quite a bit of excess capital. And I think we're &#x2013; frankly, I know we all feel a little better now than we did maybe a couple of months ago. But I think we have plenty of capital to kind of meet any challenges which we think might be coming up over the next period of time. So that's probably as about as strong an answer as I can give you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just one quick follow up. When you used to talk about the 5 billion of excess capital last quarter, did that include any of that cash at the holding company, and if so, how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it did. It would have included all of it, except &#x2013; we have a rule of thumb that we want to have 750 million of cash at the holding company at all times. So I don't call that excess. So it would be anything north of that.</p>
          <p>But we have added to the cash pile since March 31. Rob referenced the debt deal we did in the second quarter for 1.25 billion. We also did a hybrid deal right at quarter end. I think it actually technically closed right after the quarter, for 500 million. We obviously burned a little cash, from interest payments and such like that, at the holding company.</p>
          <p>So yes, there is more cash at the holding company, but there is probably also a lower RBC ratio because of continued credit migration.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everybody. I had two questions. Rob, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on the rationale for the organizational changes, maybe specifically, I think there has been some in sort of the outside investor community who might believe that we should read something into that about positioning the company organizationally for some M&amp;A? Any comments there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, the organizational realignment had nothing to do with M&amp;A whatsoever. Remember, it was the outgrowth of our strategic initiatives that we've been focused on for the last couple of years. The purpose of the reorganization, if you look at it from the standpoint of, you may recall, that I talked about our focus was on decision making. That decision making and the streamlining of it has moved forward with just a wonderful pace.</p>
          <p>And what you're seeing, if you look at our businesses and the opportunities we have, that streamlined decision-making gives us a better, quicker way to enhance product design and distribution. It gives us better ways to recognize contingent space growth opportunities. It preserves the distribution channels we have that are so very important to us. And we're very fortunate to have a very, very strong management team that this organizational change allows to lever up even greater.</p>
          <p>So it has nothing to do with M&amp;A at all. I would only say that to the point that you have better streamlined decision-making and better leverage of talent that would allow you to be clearer and smarter and more progressive in your thinking in everything you do, including analyzing M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you. And then Bill, maybe going at Nigel's question in a little bit different tack. So obviously operating earnings rebounded nicely from the first quarter results. But if we look at sort of the absolute level, the ROE this quarter annualized was about 8%. And I know there is some meaningful drags on that ROE, the higher cash balances, variable investment income, and the like.</p>
          <p>But I'd be interested in your thoughts, assuming reasonable markets, on how long it takes for that ROE to get back to sort of the low double-digit range. And then maybe with your existing business mix, and again assuming reasonable markets, where that ROE can go longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Look, you know, I'd be &#x2013; it's certainly my expectation, again with your caveat of reasonable markets &#x2013; we're going to be within shouting distance of a 10% ROE next year. And that's not assuming any dramatic recovery. That's just putting money to work and stuff like that.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of &#x2013; obviously I think it can improve from there. I think the pension and I don't know &#x2013; I'm not sure how this will play out. To kind of get back to sort of I would say a mid-teens ROE, you have to &#x2013; in our industry, you have to manage capital, okay? That means you have to buy back stock, okay? And that means you have to run a relatively efficient capital level. You don't have to be real tight, but you have to be &#x2013; you can't just stockpile capital, you have to manage it.</p>
          <p>And I don't see how you really get to a 15% ROE. Certainly some &#x2013; maybe some businesses can, but given our current business mix, I don't see how you can get there without some capital management effort.</p>
          <p>And I think this industry &#x2013; and I would say this for Met, but I would say this is for the industry as well. I think it's going to be a number of years before we really start thinking about capital management again. And so &#x2013; and it could be because we're going to want that capital for other purposes, because frankly, given what our growth rate is right now, we may need to deploy that capital, just based on current internal growth. There is obviously maybe other opportunities to redeploy capital other than just buying back stock, but you can't count on that.</p>
          <p>So I think we can continue to move the ROE up as the economy recovers. I don't &#x2013; I feel pretty comfortable about that. But where we're going to be three years from now, when the way to move it up further is really by driving more aggressive capital management &#x2013; that's &#x2013; I think that's yet an open question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very fair. I appreciate that. And then maybe one quick follow-up on putting capital to work, maybe for Bill Mullaney. Obviously, a little bit more activity here recently in the pension closeout business. I'm wondering what that business in the pipeline and activity, especially relative to maybe bigger transactions, might look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just put a little color on what we're seeing in closeouts. Obviously, we have two closeout businesses, one here in the U.S. and one in the U.K. The U.K. business has actually been pretty active, and we did a couple of sizeable deals this quarter. I would say that, in the U.K., they've been farther along than the U.S. in terms of thinking about closeouts, positioning their portfolio for potential closeouts. So I don't think the portfolio has got as hit when the equity markets declined, and therefore I think you have a better funding status in the U.K.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so therefore &#x2013; and we've also see some competitors pull back in the U.K., which I think has made it a better pricing environment for us, so we're able to write some good deals at some attractive returns.</p>
          <p>We continue to have lots of discussions in the U.S. as well with plan sponsors who were thinking about closeouts. I would say the decline in the equity markets has certainly made everybody realize what the impact of equity market volatility has on funding status. And so I think, as funding levels recover, there will be a great interest and demand in terms of moving some of those liabilities off the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>And so as Bill talked about before, we do have excess capital and we're prepared to put that excess capital to work on some deals where we can get some attractive returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just real quickly, as a follow-up, in terms of how much capital that business takes. Can you give us a sense &#x2013; like, I don't know, $100 million close out &#x2013; how much capital needs to be &#x2013; needs to support that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's really very much a function of the structure of the deal. So if you have true non-par deals, you might have a capital percentage that could be in the 10% range. If you had separate account deals or par deals, the capital structure would require something less than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bill, I wanted to go back to the ROE question and back to the presentation you had done on sort of your earnings thought experiment. If we look at the second quarter of $0.88, I think that the &#x2013; the amount that you put back to work in terms of cash balances is in line with what you had &#x2013; roughly in line with what you highlighted as the low end in that presentation. And so if we just assume that you only had half the benefit in the quarter &#x2013; maybe you got another nickel from what you did, so we're up to say $0.93. I think you said you had 75 million of expense saves in the quarter, so a 300 million annual. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we're right at the midpoint, then, in terms of the expense save number that you highlighted in that presentation as well. So the only thing that isn't there is variable income, and conveniently, it's zero this quarter versus the low to high that you modeled.</p>
          <p>And I guess what I'm wondering is, if you take that $0.93 and you annualize it, you have &#x2013; you are at sort of a 3.70 &#x2013; let's say 3.70, 3.75 number. Is that &#x2013; what else can you do from that number to get the ROE up, other than variable income and capital management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I'd probably quibble with your &#x2013; are we investing this &#x2013; how are we &#x2013; have I &#x2013; have we already shot our wad, if you will, with regard to how much cash we've invested and how much more we have to go.</p>
          <p>We made some progress in terms of reinvesting cash, but we're long ways from &#x2013; if you just go back, look at our QFS four or five quarters ago, we're running about a $10 billion cash balance a quarter. We're 21 now. I mean and you can't just say, okay, there is 11 excess there. It's not quite that simple. But it's &#x2013; we have a long way to go in terms of, I think, cash efficiency. And then you heard Steve say in his remarks that where he put most of the money this quarter was in Treasuries and agencies, okay, which is better yielding than cash, but hardly what I would say a full spread asset. And the &#x2013; and so I think there is opportunity there as well.</p>
          <p>In terms of the recovery on VII, I mean, I don't want to get too hung up on this, because, look, it's not something we can control, obviously. Private equities will come back when they come back. But we have $8.3 billion in alternatives, and we're not making much on that today, at all, even in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>So I think there is a lot of power there over and above $0.88. And so I don't want to try to follow the math on the phone maybe, so maybe we can talk a little bit more offline, and pick and tie, but it's &#x2013; but I think there is a lot of earnings power that's sort of sitting there, that's not really engaged yet.</p>
          <p>And then of course, we're growing the business at the same time. Oh yeah, we're doing that as well. So there &#x2013; and I will tell you Ed, it's not just revenue growth, if anything the GAAP revenue growth probably understates how good this quarter was, because a lot of the money is coming in as deposits. And then I think it's &#x2013; and then the margins that this stuff is getting put on is quite good. And then just to pile on a little more, I don't know if I quite followed all your expense math, but I think &#x2013; maybe you got it right, I'm not sure &#x2013; but we're obviously not done in terms of expense improvement here.</p>
          <p>Operational excellence is obviously a nice kick. If we just &#x2013; our pension costs are really high. If we get any kind of rally in the equity market, that just starts to come down. And obviously that will &#x2013; unfortunately all the good work that we're doing in terms of OpEx are being masked by some unusually high pension and post retirement benefit costs. So probably the earnings kick there is probably even a little greater than &#x2013; than maybe we've estimated before.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's extremely helpful. Can I ask one quick follow-up on this? Your comment about capital management being a number of years away, I mean share buyback a number of years away, perhaps for the industry, for you. Have you had any discussions or thought about the trade-off with saying maybe it makes &#x2013; would it work if we had, if we kept 20 billion in cash balances and when the time was right, we reduced the allocation to alternatives and as an offset would the rating agencies then be comfortable with whatever now is considered to be the excess, the appropriate amount of cushion in capital to knock that down? Can you trade-off between sort of the cash and the investments in alternatives with the potential to buy back the stock sooner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an interesting question, I don't know. I mean I think it's &#x2013; I think &#x2013; I think what you really &#x2013; your question really highlights that all that stuff is very much up in the air yet. I don't think the industry is &#x2013; or really the analysts who follow this industry are really &#x2013; were really settled or the rating agencies who obviously cover it too are really settled on the way forward here. I think, it could very well be at the end of the day, we'll learn to evaluate companies, insurance companies by all the excess cash that's sitting in their holding company and that will be &#x2013; they'll view that as the excess capital component and then we'll take that off the top and then think about ROEs after that. I mean that may be how things progress, we'll see. I just think it's &#x2013; it just feels to me like it's a little soon to be putting out new aggressive ROE targets when I really don't know if two years from now capital management's really going to be in the cards.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, couple of questions. First on variable annuities, and I appreciate the very strong sales. I was wondering if you can give us a sense of what percentage of those are the GMIB products, which I think Bill explored last quarter. You don't do as much hedging because of the GAAP volatility it creates. And also what percentage were 1035s because it's certainly my sense that that number for the industry has come way down and so we're actually seeing a lot of new customers come in.</p>
          <p>On the investment portfolio, I appreciate on page 40 you break out the quality by NAIC ratings but that's on a fair market value and I wanted to get a sense of how much junk bonds were up sequentially in the quarter on an amortized cost basis, particularly as we look to that rapidly growing NAIC 5 category and what that may mean for losses over the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And then lastly Bill, it's my recollection that you had put on several billion of interest rate hedges and that you'd planned to take them off in the second quarter and where did they come through in earnings if that's correct?</p>
          <p>And then actually I guess the last one is what happened on the traditional life plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start, Colin. It's Bill Mullaney on the VA question. I'd say on our sales for GMIB this quarter about 85%. So it's pretty consistent with what we've seen in prior quarters.</p>
          <p>In terms of 1035 exchanges, we don't have that exact information but what I will say is we know that 1035 exchanges are down, but we are seeing some benefit from 401(k) rollovers, which is actually helping us from a sales perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, are you ready?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Colin. On the downgrades, it's about $2 billion of downgrades on an amortized cost basis for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well I'm actually trying to get a sense, okay. If we looked sequentially, all right, what are on an amortized cost basis, what do your junk bonds aggregate to at the end of the second quarter and what did they aggregate to at the end of the first? I've got the fair market as 14.8 and 18.3, but amortized cost would be more helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me look that up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was up 2 billion, is that what you're saying? I'm just not clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2 billion was the number I was giving you about the downgrades into...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And I was just trying to separate how much of this -- the increase is just spreads tightening and as to how much is what else is going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. They're looking through a folder. While they do that, let's talk about the interest rate derivatives. Actually I don't think we're talking about the same thing. We said that we took off some of our interest rates hedges that we have. And by the way, these tend to be very long-term interest rate swaps or floors that are used to hedge certain liabilities. So for instance we have minimum interest rate guarantees, we hedge to protect ourselves against the Japan scenario, and interest rates dropped a ton right at the end of the fourth quarter. So a lot of these hedges, these derivatives, went way in the money and that gain, that derivative gain showed up in our income statement in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>What we did is, we said certainly our feeling is that interest rates are going to go back up. There is a ton of value here. Are we just going to let it slip through our hands and watch the hedge move against us? And the answer is we chose to kind of split the difference and we took $1.5 billion of pre-tax gains off the table.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just to jump in for the second Bill so the &#x2013; the mark-to-market losses we saw this quarter were net against those gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, the gains &#x2013; remember just that we cashed in &#x2013; the mark-to-market occurs...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to know where the gain is. Where is that? How much was it? And where is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the gain was actually &#x2013; we took this &#x2013; by the way took this gain. We captured &#x2013; we unwound the derivative and pocketed the cash, okay. The gain occurred in the fourth quarter. We pocketed the cash in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so if we hadn't pocketed that cash, our derivative loss &#x2013; because obviously we &#x2013; it was the right decision because interest rates moved back up, our derivative loss would have actually been greater. So most of that, not all of it, but most of that 1.5 billion of gain would have shown up as a higher derivative loss both in the first quarter and in this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I thought you were taking some off in the second quarter from what you had said before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it was first. And we did and so we did it. So I mean it was a...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It worked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was the easiest billion-dollars we ever made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it was, I think, a smart thing to do. I mean that's &#x2013; I would say that's a highly unusual event for us and not something that we would repeat on a normal basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the traditional life line seemed to be unusually weak and it's &#x2013; whether it's higher expenses, higher benefits. What was that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of what was going on with trad life, it really was driven by a couple of things. First of all, we had change in our DAC modeling. And so we took a pretty big charge for DAC in the first quarter on traditional life. We actually had to reverse on variable and universal life, so you'll actually see some of the gain show up there.</p>
          <p>Secondly, some of the earnings on the closed block going forward are going to be lower than what you've seen in the past because of some changes that we've had to make in agreement with the state and glide path around the earnings for the closed block. So those are really the two reasons why trad life earnings were down over prior-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Bill, it's just &#x2013; that's the first time I think we've seen a significant change to somebody's DAC on traditional life. I know we're all getting tired of watching the variable annuities going up and down. But it's a whole different matter on trad life. Was that just low interest rates that drove that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask Stan to talk a little bit about some of the changes that we made around the DAC model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, it had more to do with our closed block. We have a DAC model in our closed block that reflects expected gross profits. We had been negotiating at year-end with New York State on the operation of the closed block. And our pattern of earnings was changing, not in total, that doesn't change. The assets are locked into closed block. The future earnings are the same but the timing changed and we revised our model to reflect that change in the timing. So that resulted in a one-time DAC adjustments in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Was that also persistency driven? I noticed lapses are hitting a record...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no it was not persistency driven at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, in terms of your expense assumptions. Okay thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, this is Steve, let me go back to your question. The reason we're struggling a little bit is the spread tightening is a market value number basically and the other is a book value number. So we're trying to make then all tie up. But roughly it's 50-50 of spread tightening increased that number in below investment grade and the rest was downgrades. There was some &#x2013; a little bit of net selling in that category as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And for our last question today we go to the line of Mark Finkelstein from Fox-Pitt Kelton. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I guess firstly a clarification. Have you updated your estimate of expense saves based on some of the recent actions, and if so, what are they?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just for everybody's benefit, we put out a target on Investor Day, I think it was Investor Day, may be a little earlier $400 million of expense saves related to operational excellence. And we said $400 million pre-tax related to operational excellence and by the end of 2010. And there are obviously, besides operational excellence, there is obviously other things going on in the expense thing. So I kind of gave you a little color on pension cost. We're not going to -- certainly the fact that the stock market rallies and therefore our pension costs go down next year has nothing to do with operational excellence. Okay, and so we don't try to take credit for that. So when we were throwing around maybe a number like 600, it's kind of stuff like that as well.</p>
          <p>The number that I quoted in my remarks that we have 75 million roughly of expense saves this quarter, implying a $300 million run rate, that's keeping score on OpEx. So you can see that we're close, even though it's second quarter of '09. We are relatively close to or we're bearing down on our OpEx goal that we had for the end of '10. So we're way early and things are going well. So we have not updated our OpEx target number and I don't expect to now. But obviously we are doing very well and there is a lot of momentum. So stay tuned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, if you're asking whether or not the recent organizational change was accounted in our OpEx numbers, it was not. The reason is primarily the focus on the organizational change is one about the growth and leveraging capabilities and market strength and so forth and so on. I can assure you however that, that will not cause the number to slow down in terms of our reaching our objectives. So I just thought I'd mention that. I couldn't tell from your question whether or not that was embedded in your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that helps. Okay couple of others, just quickies, on the VA sales in the quarter, were those all off of the new pricing or were there still some lingering old prices that helped drive the sales growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, it's Bill Mullaney. Yes, for the most part they were off the new pricing. We did some pricing changes in February and in May. And so &#x2013; and we also made some product changes too. And so while there may have been a little bit of run-up in the sales prior to the pricing change we brought the guarantee on the GMIB down from 6 to 5. By and large it was done on the new pricing and for the most part on the new product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just one final question. Just on the international business, can you just talk quickly about Latin America? It looks like on a constant currency basis premium would have been down. I know that's kind of more Mexico driven. But can you just talk about the dynamics in that and how we should think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Mark, it's Bill Toppeta. I would say that Latin America is actually holding up pretty well in terms of the top line and the reasons why we've seen some downturn first of all there is the FX question. The Mexican peso drives a lot of what we do and that's been weak compared to the U.S. dollar. Then when you get to the substance of it, you've got to remember that in the prior year we had the Argentina pension business, which at the end of last year was seized by the Argentine government so all of that revenue obviously goes away.</p>
          <p>In Chile, we're in the payout annuity business. That market has been down, total market down about 34% during the quarter and what drives that really is that people's accumulations that they would buy an annuity with are obviously down and they're very reluctant to buy annuities and lock in those losses. Now we are down a little more than the market, we're down &#x2013; the market is down 34%. We're down 50% and part of that is deliberate on our part. We've done some de-risking of our investment portfolio down there and therefore we're not in a position to as a result of that we're not in a position to put out some rates that would enable greater sales.</p>
          <p>So it's a combination I think of all those things.</p>
          <p>One last factor, relatively small but still had an impact. Remember that Mexico is our big driver in terms of the top line and because of the H1N1 virus down there, we pretty much lost, I would say, about a month out of the quarter. So all of those things contribute to the results.</p>
