        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alejandro. Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us in this conference call. Initially, we will provide a summary of our key financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2011. Then, we will review the outlook for the final quarter of 2011, and finally, we will answer questions from participants.</p>
          <p>So, let's turn to slide five to discuss some of the details of our performance in the third quarter. Ecopetrol exhibit strong operational results in the third quarter of 2011. Crude oil and natural gas production of the Corporate Group averaged 732,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 16% higher than in the same quarter of 2010. Also, out of six exploratory wells drilled in Colombia by Ecopetrol, three proved hydrocarbons presence.</p>
          <p>Financial results remain solid. In the third quarter of 2011, total revenues grew 64%, up to COL$14 trillion. Net income increased 147% up to COL$4.2 trillion, EBITDA rose 80% and amounted to COL$7 trillion. Results in the Upstream segment were driven by higher crude oil prices, while in Downstream, these were driven by sustained strong margins in products. We launched a successful equity offering in which 219,000 investors demanded our shares.</p>
          <p>Proceeds of these round came to COL$2.38 trillion. 87% of the offer was allocated to Colombian retail investors and 13% to institutional investor, mainly pension funds. Last, but not least, Ecopetrol became part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, being one of the 12 oil and gas companies included in the world index. We probably are among the top 10% companies with the best corporate sustainability performance.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to a slide six to review the progress of our investment plan. We are on track with the progress of our infrastructure projects, which are key to support future growth and achieve our strategic goals. Thus, year-to-date CapEx rose to $4.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion were deployed in the third quarter. CapEx in 2011 has been 24% higher when compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date capital expenditure allocation by segment was the following; 49% to production, 14% to subsidiaries, 13% midstream, 9% to acquisitions, 9% to exploration, 4% to refining and the remaining 1% to corporate and supply and marketing initiatives.</p>
          <p>I now forward the call to Enrique Vel&#xE1;squez.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. In slide number seven, I will summarize the milestones of the Upstream segment. First, let's view our third quarter 2011 exploration results. During the quarter, six exploratory wells were drilled by Ecopetrol in Colombia, of which the following three proved hydrocarbon presence: CSE-8, CSE-8 ST1 and Trasgo-1. Additionally, out of the two stratigraphic wells during the quarter, the Avila-1 well had evidence of hydrocarbons.</p>
          <p>During the first nine months of the year, 15 exploratory wells were drilled by Ecopetrol in Colombia, of which eight wells proved hydrocarbon presence, six were dry, and one was under evaluation with a technical success rate of 57%. Hocol, our Colombian subsidiary, drilled six stratigraphic wells in the CPO-17 block and proved hydrocarbon presence in five of them. Also, three exploratory wells were drilled, of which two were abandoned and one is under evaluation. Internationally, Savia, Per&#xFA; drilled five exploratory wells in the Peruvian offshore, confirming evidence of hydrocarbons in four of them. The remaining one well was dry.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, the Agua Viva-1 and the Ilha do Mel-1 wells are being drilled after the end of the quarter, while in the U.S. Gulf Coast, the Logan and Cobra wells reached total depth and currently are under evaluation.</p>
          <p>Regarding production in the third quarter of 2011, the Corporate Group achieved a record production of 732,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, growing 16% compared to the same quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months of 2011, the Corporate Group production averaged 716,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an 18% increase compared to the same period of 2010. Production growth was driven by the rise in Castilla and Chichimene fields, which accounted for an average production of 111,000 barrels and 30,000 barrels a day, respectively. Rubiales and Quifa fields added to Ecopetrol a gross output of 108,000 barrels per day, and Nare field produced 16,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn the call over to &#xC1;lvaro Casta&#xF1;eda, who will provide an update on our Midstream operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Let's move on to slide eight. The transportation capacity grew 15% for crude oil and 21% for refined products in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of last year. These increases were mainly due to the expansion of the Ocensa-Vasconia-Cove&#xF1;as-ODC, Apiay-Porvenir, Rubiales-Monterrey and Gal&#xE1;n-Ayacucho 18-inch pipeline. The optimization of pumping system and the use of drag reducing agents. Additionally, storage capacity increased in Altos del Porvenir station and in Apiay.</p>
          <p>Total volume of crude and products transported by pipelines in the third quarter of 2011 rose 17% up to 1.2 million barrels per day, of which 76% accounts for crude. Crude volume transported by truck reached 57,000 barrels per day in the third quarter of 2011, 101% more than in the same quarter of last year. Additionally, 39,000 barrels per day of products were truck, rising 10% when compared with the third quarter of 2010. Regarding the Bicentenario Pipeline, as of September 30, the project reached a progress of 38.7% on Phase I.</p>
          <p>Now, I will turn the presentation over to Pedro Rosales who will comment on Downstream results starting with refining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone. Let's move onto slide nine. In the third quarter of 2011, the Barrancabermeja refinery throughput dropped 2.4% due to the starting of a scheduled maintenance activity in one of the catalytic cracking units and in the polyethylene plant. The refinery utilization factor during this year has increased to 81.3% from 78.5% in 2010 due to the operation of hydrotreating plant since August 2010. Year-to-date, the gross margin for the Barrancabermeja refinery was $13.3 per barrel. The increase is explained by better price differentials of products related to crude oil.</p>
          <p>Regarding main refining projects, Cartagena Refinery expansion and upgrading project, which will double its crude processing capacity with a CapEx close to $4 billion, reported an advance of 45% mainly in the development of engineering with a 77% progress, 58% in procurement, 27% in module manufacturing and 10% in construction. The modernization of the Barrancabermeja refinery which will increase conversion capacity from 76% to 96% with a CapEx close to $3.4 billion began its contractual process for site preparation of new plants and reported a progress of 2.6%. In addition, the master plan of utilities in this refinery, which will update the infrastructure for the supply of the steam, air, water and energy reached a 38% progress as of September 30.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to slide 10 to review the sales and marketing results. The growth in sales in the third quarter was driven by higher commodity prices and rising crude oil production. The prices of exports increased 40% for crude oil, 46% for products and 25% for natural gas in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. It is important to mention that we have diversified the pricing indexes for crudes including Brent and Maya and using WTI benchmark in a lower proportion.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, our sales volume grew 20%. Export sales, including sales to free trade zones, accounted for 68% on local sales for 32% of total sales. Exported volumes, excluding sales to Reficar free trade zone, increased 41%, boosted by the higher sales of Castilla crude oil and new crude blend composed by Middle Magdalena forward crudes and Castilla. The main destinations of our exports remain unchanged and are currently U.S. Gulf Coast, Far East and the Caribbean. Natural gas exports rose due to the additional gas demand of Venezuela.</p>
          <p>I now turn the presentation back to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez, who will comment on the milestones of the internal consolidation initiatives, corporate social responsibility and corporate governance of Ecopetrol.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pedro. Let's turn to slide 11. Regarding HSE performance, Ecopetrol remains committed to a clean production as a key element of its strategy. That's a reduction of 7% in environmental incidents, with operational causes, and of 37% in accidents was accomplished in the third quarter when compared to the same period of 2010. In other aspects, the most important milestone for Ecopetrol during the quarter was becoming part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index-World. Starting September 8, Ecopetrol joined the group of the 10% companies with the best sustainable performance out of at least 2,500 public companies.</p>
          <p>In 2011, 118 oil and gas companies were analyzed, of which only 12 were included in the world index. The highest scores were obtained in human talent development, social impact on communities and commitment to its stakeholders. Also, compared to 2010 assessment, the scores in environmental and economic dimensions and the consolidation of the company's corporate governance were substantially higher. These milestone came four years ahead of the schedule, as Ecopetrol had initially envisioned becoming part of this index by year 2015. In addition, Ecopetrol was listed in the 179th position in the latest Forbes Magazine Global Ranking among the 2,000 world's largest corporations.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn the presentation to Adriana Echeverri who will comment on the financial results for the third quarter of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez, good afternoon everyone. Let's turn to slide 13. Year-to-date and third quarter financial results have a growing trend hatching in revenues, net income and EBITDA. Starting on the left side of the slide, higher crude oil market realizations and increased production made the growth of 63% in total sales compared to the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Export sales rose 91% excluding sales to Reficar free trade zone. Total cost of sales, plus operating expenses, grew 39% mainly due to a rise of 42% in variable cost as a result of more products imported, mainly naphtha used as diluent and purchases of hydrocarbons, and in addition, rising crude oil annually implied of course higher transportation costs. Fixed costs grew 18%. This was mainly due to higher depreciation in contracted services related to rising levels of production and costs linked to maintenance activities.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses increase of 55% was due to seismic surveys, non-successful exploration activities and investment in exploratory efforts. As a result, operating income amounted to COL$6.2 trillion in the third quarter of 2011, which is a 114% increase compared to the same quarter of 2010 and the operating margin was 44%.</p>
          <p>Moving to the non-operating results, we got a profit of COL$45 billion in this quarter, in line with the exchange rate gains and the income coming from subsidiaries accounted under the equity method. Those two effects were offset by the result of hedging on crude oil differentials. Net income, finally, amounted to COL$4.2 trillion, which is 147% higher than in the third quarter of 2010 and EBITDA amounted to COL$7.1 trillion.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to slide 14 and take a look through our segment results. In this slide, we find that Exploration and Production segment reported COL$4 trillion of net income in the third quarter, driven by the sustained increase in production and high crude oil sale prices. EBITDA of this segment reached COL$6 trillion.</p>
          <p>Refining and Petrochemicals segment was benefited by high margins in the sale of products as well as from the results of cost saving initiatives in place. This segment reported an EBITDA of COL$266 billion and a net loss of COL$57 billion, during this last 66% lower than in the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Transportation earnings reached COL$147 billion and EBITDA COL$246 billion attributable mainly to higher transported volumes by pipelines and trucks. Finally, Supply and Marketing segment reported a net income of COL$87 billion and EBITDA amounted to COL$254 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's move to next slide on slide 15, where we find an overview of the company's cash flow and balance sheet. Ecopetrol started this third quarter with COL$8 trillion in cash and received COL$235 billion as part of the equity offering. Operations generated COL$13 trillion. We used COL$2.5 trillion of the company's total cash flow to fund capital expenditures, COL$9.2 trillion to fund operations and COL$1.9 trillion to the second installment of dividend. Sales and other net cash flows resulted in a COL$8 trillion cash balance by the end of September.</p>
          <p>Moving to balance sheet, total assets amounted to COL$78.5 trillion and total liabilities COL$32 trillion. We did not contract any indebtedness during this period. Financial debt was equivalent to 8.4% of total assets and to 20.6% of total liabilities, while debt to EBITDA ratio for the last 12 months was 0.32. Total liabilities remained almost unchanged when compared to June of 2011. However, total equity of the company rose by 11%, in line with the increasing net income of the third quarter as well as with the second round of primary equity offering in the local market of COL$2.4 trillion recently closed.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 16, I will comment briefly on the main results of the above-mentioned equity offering. First of all, we are very pleased with the results of the second round of the equity offering because it proved once again that thousands of Colombian citizens believe in Ecopetrol. As ruled by Law 1118 of 2006, the equity offering was addressed exclusively to Colombian investors, and according to Colombian financial markets regulation, the offer was open 15 labor days between July 27th and August 17th of this year.</p>
          <p>As a result, a total of 644 million shares were allotted equivalent to close to COL$2.4 trillion. 87% of the offer was demanded by retail investors and the remaining 13% by institutional investors. After the offering, the ownership structure of Ecopetrol as of September 30 is as shown in the slide, which in summary, the central government, Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, 88.5%, Colombian retail investors 4.6%, largest Colombian institutional investors 4.1%, other Colombian institutional investors 1.3%, foreign investors in ordinary shares in the local stock exchange, 0.3% and ADR holders 1.2%. As announced previously, the proceeds will be used to fund CapEx of the strategic plan of the company.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to slide 17, you see main aspects of the results of the Corporate Group in this chart. In line with Ecopetrol results, the Corporate Group in the third quarter of 2011 maintained a growing trend compared to the same quarter of 2010. Total sales for the Corporate Group amounted to COL$16 trillion, which is 65% more than the third quarter of last year. Group's net income amounted to COL$4 trillion which represents a 147% increase. The Group's EBITDA was COL$8 trillion. This is 90% higher than in the third quarter of the previous year and EBITDA margin remained at 47%.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 18, we can see here the main figures of our subsidiaries. In the third quarter of 2011, the main contributions to revenues, before accounting eliminations, came from Reficar with COL$2 trillion, Hocol with COL$909 billion and Equion with COL$476 billion. Highest net income was reported by Hocol with COL$114 billion followed by Equion with COL$88 billion and Ocensa with COL$61 billion. Subsidiaries with the highest EBITDA were Hocol with COL$243 billion, Equion with COL$101 billion and Ocensa with COL$85 billion.</p>
          <p>With this, I now turn the conference back to Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez for the closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Adriana. Turning now to slide 20, I would like to close our presentation with our outlook for the end of 2011. Over the year, we have experienced some adverse conditions that have affected our production. The severe floodings, the delays in the completion of the additional capacity at Ocensa, the attacks on pipelines and the stoppages at the Rubiales field have cost up to September a reduction of 27,000 barrels per day of production.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of these various factors, we now forecast the 2011 production for our company to average 730,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our previous forecast of 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Regarding exploration activity, we expect to drill 37 exploratory wells, 33 in Colombia and four abroad. In transportation, we will continue with our infrastructure projects, and along with our partners, we expect to complete the first phase of the Bicentenario Pipeline by the second quarter of 2012. Also, capacity in Oleoducto de los Llanos Orientales will be increased to 340,000 barrels per day by the end of the year 2011.</p>
          <p>In refining, the last quarter will bring some scheduled minor maintenance works in both Cartagena and Barrancabermeja refineries. On the refining projects, we expect to start the contracting process for the modernization of the Barrancabermeja and reach more than 50% progress in the upgrading and expansion at the Cartagena Refinery.</p>
          <p>In the marketing segment, as a part of our diversifying efforts, we will continue positioning our brand new Magdalena blend crude oil in the international markets. On biofuels, we will sign the EPC, engineering, procurement and construction contracts in order to start the construction of the ethanol plant of Bioenergy.</p>
          <p>In summary, 2011 will be historical year for Ecopetrol, based not only on big production and financial results and expansion of our infrastructure, but also given the milestones in corporate responsibility and the second round of share offering, among others. We remain fully committed to deliver on our value promise to all of our shareholders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for a very clear presentation. Just to follow up on your outlook for the fourth quarter comments and just the security situation and the stoppages of the Rubiales field and such. Maybe you could comment on what &#x2013; how serious the problem is, whether this is something that is likely to cause further delays later on? It's something we should be worried that it could expand or &#x2013; and I know there's been some commentary about possible, it is possibly just politically motivated and related to shorter-term issues, in other times and based on other reports, you get the sense that perhaps, security situation has deteriorated more seriously. And I was just wondering maybe you could put some perspective on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Frank. As everybody knows, we have two stoppages at Rubiales field up to now. And currently, we haven't done some products in the field, but the production is running in normal conditions. The company, Pacific Rubiales, have undertaken some negotiations with part of the workers, but with the participation of the government through the different ministries, mainly with leading of Ministry of Mines and Energy and with the direct participation of the &#x2013; by Ministry of the &#x2013; Labor Ministry. There are some spaces open for talking and negotiations. And we consider that the conditions are given for advancing in the negotiation process, and we don't expect to have additional stoppages or interruptions in the operation of the field, notwithstanding that we can have maybe some minor restrictions in terms of the operation. But we have the expectation that we are going to continue with almost normal condition during the rest of the year, and we are not having an interruption of the operation. And we are not having important impact due to possible problems in the operation in the Rubiales field.</p>

We have been analyzing them with our board of directors through several meetings, and maybe no. We're going to have the approval in November, but really, we don't have figures up to now to reveal to the market. But what we can mention is that our general guideline is to maintain in the route to the 1 million of barrels. And it continues with our promise of having an increase in production of 12% annually as we have been presented during the last four years, and it is in line with our goal of 1 million of barrels for 2015.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I guess what my question is, you're reducing your full-year production number in part due to civil unrest, but also in part due to pipeline constraints. I guess what I'm trying to understand is at the exit of this year, what do you think you'll be producing, and are there any pipeline, major pipeline constraints that could have you waiting for pipelines to be completed before you can increase production? So I guess what I'm trying to do is ignore the civil unrest and just focus on the infrastructure constraints.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't expect any infrastructure constraint for the rest of the year. And we haven't had any restriction by transportation during the last month. We have, we presented some restrictions for the fourth...</p>

          <p>...at the beginning for the first three, four months basically, but currently, we don't have any restriction for infrastructure facilities.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And assuming a 12% growth into next year, are you assuming that transportation will no longer be a problem?</p>

          <p>Basically, we are supported in the development of the Oleoducto del Bicentenario or OBC facility. Right now, it is scheduled for the end of the second quarter. Basically, we will have some restriction if we don't have the available, availability of the OBC.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are currently with a cash position that is enough for the near-term requirement of the company. So, what we did was the last capitalization round that was performed this year in this quarter, and from now on, we do not expect to be going to the capital market, or so if that's what you're referring to. However, we've been working on some Exim Bank facility given the investments that we're making in our refineries and that we have the revenue on that with Exim Bank currently. And those facilities were the same that we have commented in previous terms, so there is no anything additional.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just one last specific question on the production side. Could you help us with any clarity around the production guidance for 2011, specifically related to Castilla and Chichimene? If I refer back to some of the previous presentations heading into this year, I think you've lowered the production guidance. Most of the production has been lowered at those fields by about 20,000 to 25,000 barrels a day. So, I was just curious is that a function of the pipeline access or is that really a function of the drilling plans and reservoir performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, could you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of the production guidance for 2011, when I look back at previous presentations, it appears that most of the production downgrade came at Castilla, and actually more likely at Chichimene. And I was curious, is that a function of reservoir performance and drilling results or is that just a function of access to the IPI pipeline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitively not. We are not having any restrictions in the development of the fields, basically our down reduction in terms of the production are completely due to the public order restrictions, mainly in Rubiales, also to the attacks to the pipelines and mainly for the effect in the Oxy field, Cano Limon-Cove&#xF1;as and also due to the restrictions in the first part of the year to the transportation facilities. But we are not having any problems in the development of the Castilla and Chichimene fields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just two quick follow-up questions. One surrounding which Acac&#xED;as, which I know, you've had an initial discovery success. Can you comment at all about the additional appraisal wells that you've drilled so far and when we may get results there?</p>
          <p>And then the second question would just be related to permitting. How has permitting changed at all in country on the exploration side? Has the process improved at all over the last six months and can you talk a little bit about kind of how the government is handling the permitting process currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the Acac&#xED;as &#x2013; okay, in term of Acac&#xED;as discovery, we are now try to drill a well and we are drilling a well in, well, it's a well in order to diminishing the size of the discovery. This is not a stratigraphic well because we can take advantage of the reef that we have close to the area. And in term of the permit, the new permit license that you're asking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is no, at this moment, there is no restriction with that because the new law is applying soon &#x2013; since September of this year, then now we are going in our rules of authority, okay, but a big symbol of the environmental permit, it's important to mention that recently, the government implemented the new organization for the Minister of Environmental, it's completed the splitting of the &#x2013; created the Ministry of Environment. And additionally, there is a new agency, part of the Ministry, but acting in independent way that is going to be responsible for the licensing, processing. And we, all the companies have the expectation that right now it's running in a more fluently way, like the permit process. And we are not going to have limitations in the future. And really we are not having real restrictions affecting our exploratory works at the present.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone, and Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez, I have a question. I would like to know if the negotiations that Rubiales has had with various unions affect the labor, could affect the labor costs for Ecopetrol in the long term. As the comments in the National Radio are that the agreements done with the unions have to have the best conditions in the market and that they are superior to the benefits that Ecopetrol workers have right now. And maybe we could be expecting a contagion effect as unions could start demanding more also to Ecopetrol?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're right. They were going to represent on additional cost because it implies something increment, but up to now, they are in line with their values that have been applying, like companies like Ecopetrol and others. And they are not so different of the ones Ecopetrol have right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you know how much in like a percentage increase can we be expecting or is it too early to say a number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right now, we don't have a precise number, but we can prepare when the negotiations are completed and we are going to reveal it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have several questions. First, how do you evaluate the performance to-date that you had in the secondary recovery projects in fields such as Tib&#xFA;, Casabe, Cantagallo, Yarigu&#xED; and La Cira?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as you know, we are having really excellent results in terms of the secondary recovery process. Maybe it's important to remember that in terms of the La Cira, for example, the production, we were begin working there with Oxy, the production was at the level of 5,000 barrels. And right now, our projection for the end of the year has been a number, a figure of 30,000, 34,000 barrels per day. And we are working in a very good coordination with Oxy Andina; that is our partner there.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we are also having an excellent result in terms of the Casabe with around 20,000 barrels per day. It's an excellent result, and maybe in terms of Tib&#xFA;, it is important to mention that due to the, that Petrobras didn't continue there, we assume all the developments of the project, and we are completing some of the facilities during the present quarter. And we are expecting to begin to increase the production there for the next quarter, maybe we're going to have 2,000 additional barrels for the next quarter in Tib&#xFA;. We are beginning &#x2013; maybe our expectation is, maybe we are expecting to have an additional recovery of 10% approximately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And second question, what are the implications in terms of future production with the recent discoveries in Savia, Per&#xFA;?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, the recent discoveries in Santa Teresa, Lobitos are basically to maintain the levels of the production around 14,000, 15,000 barrels per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And given the recently approved FTA with the United States, what is your outlook for the sale of biofuels to this country?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't yet evaluated the situation. Additionally, it is important to mention that right now we are mainly oriented to the attendance of the internal market, the needs of the Colombian regime.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And now lastly, what is your outlook on the natural gas business, given that there is a new law for the exportation of gas in Colombia and the restrictions of the transport capacity of gas in Colombia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pedro Rosales is going to comment about gas, and additionally, he has some &#x2013; maybe he has some additional comments in relation with the biofuels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. First, about the gas business, the new regulation give us the possibility to export some volumes if we comply with the ratio that the government defines about the production versus reserves of gas that give us the possibility to export some additional volumes. As you know, we have been exporting gas to Venezuela since 2008. And we have additional opportunities in the Caribbean in some countries that we are evaluating, and this give us the possibility to explore that market to increase our business.</p>
          <p>In the other field of biofuels, as Mr. Guti&#xE9;rrez talked before, really our two projects that are growing today are with the scope of the local market, but we are mainly focused to attend that project in this moment to cover that market, that has the possibility to increase the proportion of ethanol and biodiesel in the different sales of products, then we have enough internal possibilities as of today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. Thank you very much guys.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And thank you for the presentation today, it was really good. I have a quick question regarding production. Wanted to ask you regarding the production goals, objectives that you have for the coming years, do you feel that the current structure that you have with your partners is sufficient as well as the production they have on your own fields to reach this objective? Or do you feel that some of the structure will need to change in the near term in order for you to achieve your production goals, let's say, 2015 by 1 million? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really, we are not considering to introduce important changes in terms of the arrangement with our partnerships. And we are preparing our own management and our own plans for the development of the new fields and to develop different kind of arrangements to be able to develop the plans we have considered to achieve our goals for the next years. But we are not considering to introduce important changes in terms of the relations with our partnerships.</p>
