        <plist>
          <p>Good day and welcome to the Second Quarter Report 2012 International Telephone Conference. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Alfv&#xE9;n. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to today's conference call. With us we have CEO and Group President, Mr. Christian Clausen; CFO, Mr. Fredrik Rystedt; and CRO, Mr. Ari Kaperi. And I would hand over to Mr. Clausen, and after the presentation we will also have a Q&amp;A. Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and welcome to this telephone meeting. I will give a short introduction, and then hand over to Fredrik, and come back a bit later with the strategy issues. But first of all, the key message is, which I'm sure you already heard today, we have a strong income development and a solid cost control, and also a solid credit quality and improvement in ROE, low cost/income ratio and improvement of Core Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>But most importantly, we keep executing our New Normal Plan and it is indeed improving efficiency and growing income, and it's all over the bank. We are doing it in retail. We are mainly redesigning our distribution model, which we have touched upon on previous occasions, and very much improving the capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>In wholesale banking, we are deepening relationships and ensuring that we have the right business selection and pricing in order to mitigate the effects of all the new regulation. And wealth management is very much about increasing efficiency and sharpening the offerings. I will come back to the effects of all these initiatives which we are conducting. But all in all, it's fair to say that they have clearly contributed for building a more efficient bank, delivering these results.</p>
          <p>Fredrik, will you continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, Christian. We have had a good quarter with good results both in terms of income and also in terms of the expense level. Operating profit in the quarter is up by 6%, as you can see from slide five, and also for the full year a good income generation, 6% up, and the cost under control. So generally a strong quarter.</p>
          <p>Let me take you through some of the different lines. The net interest income continues to increase as it has done, and this is despite much lower interest rate affecting our deposit income.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page seven, you can see that the growth in the business, which has been primarily on the corporate side, but also to some moderate extent on the household side, has contributed with approximately &#x20AC;11 million in the quarter. The main driver for increased NII, of course, is the lending margin. And that has increased in most areas and in most geographies where the Norwegian market has been, from margin perspective, the country most improving followed by Denmark, Sweden, and after that Finland.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, of course, the lower interest rate environment that was seen during the quarter has had a negative impact of &#x20AC;27 million, but the net impact for margins as you can see is positive.</p>
          <p>Also on slide seven you can see the spread cost that has increased. This is nothing to do with the fact that the funding cost, the funding level, has not increased. It's been stable throughout the quarter. This is merely a volume issue and we have continued to issue long-term funding throughout this quarter, and now we have issued for the first six months an amount equal to the full year redemption.</p>
          <p>You can see on the slide eight that the blended margin has been fairly stable for a number of quarters and has improved a little bit during Q2. But, of course, the negative impact on deposit margins is mitigating the improvement from the lending margin. Volumes are increasing. As I said before, we have increased, up by 5% for the first half year and up 1.5% in local currencies for the quarter. And we can see now in comparison to Q1, but also compared to last year, we have an improved amount in Nordea corporates and especially among those in the bigger segments, up by 6%.</p>
          <p>Household growth remains moderate with only minor growth in the quarter, but looking at it in one-year perspective, up by 5%. Also, deposit volumes continue to increase at 2% in local currencies in the quarter and up by 6%, so a good development in more general terms. We continue to be benefiting from a flight to quality, so every time it is a problematic environment, we benefit and are able to attract good deposit volumes.</p>
          <p>Net commission income on slide 11. We had a good development during the quarter, driven primarily by lending fees, good cards and custody fees, and in particular custody fees. The asset management fees, as expected, were stable, but we continued with a strong inflow. In the quarter we reached very close to &#x20AC;100 billion of assets under management.</p>
          <p>Net fair value continued at good levels. We had a good demand also from the customer base, so continuous good development throughout the last several quarters in fair value.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned previously, we have set a target to remain with flat cost. And as you can see from slide 13, we had a slight uptick in expenses during the second quarter, and this has to do with the fact that currency and variable pay is slightly increasing. So for the first six months &#x2013; in comparison to 2011, first six months the expense level is in fact down by 0.4% adjusting for variable salaries and adjusting for currency fluctuations.</p>
          <p>I mentioned before that we have &#x2013; continued to have a good access to funding. We've done several really good transactions in the first half year. Particularly, notably in the second quarter, we did our first issuance of the Samurai bonds with lots of interest both as related to volume and also attractive terms. So we continue to receive favorable terms and also having a broad platform for our trading and, of course &#x2013; for our funding and, of course, part of the reason is the fact that we had maintained AA rating as one of very few banks in Europe to have that still.</p>
          <p>The recommendation from the Central Bank in Sweden is that we also publish the LCR already from the start of the third quarter &#x2013; or in the second quarter report, and we have also done that. You can see that we are LCR compliant for all currencies, and the total Group LCR level is 144%. We have continued to increase the size of the liquidity buffer, reaching now &#x20AC;68 billion. So I think, given the general situation on the financial market, we have a very, very strong and prudent position.</p>
          <p>Finally, just a few comments on our business model as such and where we generate the result and the income. If you look at slide 16, you can see that we are &#x2013; as part of our business model, being a relationship bank, we have the absolute overwhelming majority of our income from customer-driven business, and only a very small portion relates to hedging activities for those flows that we have in our market business. So approximately 96% is customer-driven, and that has been the case for several years, as you can see from slide 16.</p>
          <p>And with those words, I leave to you, Ari.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. On page 17 we've got the set of quality section, so that loan losses, they were at the same level as in Q1 and roughly at the same &#x2013; we have the same risk features then we had in Q4 also. So there's very low loan losses in Norway, Sweden and Finland, and also in other non-Nordic countries that we have two areas of higher pension, and that is Denmark and Shipping, which has been at the elevated levels.</p>
          <p>In the following pages, you see a little bit more information derived from various portfolios. Page 18, as you can see, the pattern is more or less the same, has been the same for now some quarters, so that very moderate loan losses in Finland, Norway and Sweden. Little bit variation between quarters depending on the few individual corporate customers, and then high levels in Denmark. But as you can see also the Danish figures have been stable.</p>
          <p>Following page we've split the Danish loan loss figures into two segments, household and corporate. And as you can see, the household losses, they were &#x2013; they have been little up in the past three quarters, whereas the corporate loan losses, which was the source of highest loan losses  in Denmark in the beginning of the crisis, they have stabilized. That was more or less the case also in Q2, so there's no big changes there.</p>
          <p>Moving to shipping, which is the other area of high attention, one on page 20. Still we book at this same level roughly between &#x20AC;60 million and &#x20AC;70 million of quarterly loan losses in Q2. Still the source for these loan losses is coming from this weak shipping sub-segment, i.e., tankers and dry bulk. Also container market is very weak, but our exposure to the container market is also very low, so that our losses are coming from these two sub-segments.</p>
          <p>You see also in terms &#x2013; in the right-hand right graph that the impaired loans in shipping, they are still up. This is what has happened now in the past three quarters, so that every quarter there is one or two or three new shipping customers where we have made an impairment and have booked loan losses. This continued also in Q2. And this is also indicating that there are still &#x2013; these segments are still weak and we expect that this will still continue for the previous quarters.</p>
          <p>It's difficult to see that the losses would be so much up even from shipping, but actually it's also difficult to see that they will be dramatically down now in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Then talking about the impaired loans on page 21, you see the total picture and then you see that our impaired loans, in total they were quite much up in the second quarter. In terms of euros, we've got &#x20AC;700 million. This &#x20AC;700 million is composed by this shipping, which is roughly &#x20AC;120 million order increase. Then Denmark is &#x2013; the main part is &#x20AC;450 million. Another specific issue in Denmark which is triggering this increase, the amount of impaired loans, and this &#x2013;  it is the new rules introduced by Danish FSA how to impair loans and how to record the loan losses. That then &#x2013; that impact on all the changed regulation in Denmark that &#x2013; the magnitude of that was roughly two-thirds of these new impaired loans in Denmark, i.e., two-thirds from this &#x20AC;450 million.</p>
          <p>You see our total allowances on the right hand side that we have now increased the individual allowances and loan losses taken down to collective loan losses. The background of this is exactly these new rules in Denmark. So that &#x2013; the impact of this new loan loss provisioning rules in Denmark was roughly &#x20AC;80 million in our book. But we had been covering for that type of risk earlier, because we had built up these additional buffers in our collective provisions in Denmark, and now we then offset this impact from the changed regulation by releasing respective amount of collective reserves.</p>
          <p>We have built these collective reserves exactly for the reason that we have seen that the Danish situation is difficult and we didn't see this kind of individual customers going into default, but we saw this can increase risk and thereby we made these additional collective provisions. Now, when we see and we are forced to book more individual loan losses, then it's very logical that we are releasing part of this collective provision for it.</p>
          <p>This change doesn't mean that &#x2013; or this what we did doesn't mean that we would expect much, much lower loan losses in the coming quarters in Denmark. There will always be new individual customers going into problems, other ones than we have now booked for loan losses and payouts, so that still the situation in Denmark is continuing to be difficult. But this is, of course, taking down the likelihood that the individual losses would go up dramatically Denmark.</p>
          <p>Then impaired loans on page 22, I already mentioned these &#x2013; the main part of this increase in impaired loans for Denmark, whereas in other countries the situation was stable. So that's all in all, the second quarter didn't change our credit risk picture. So that it was as expected and that is also roughly in the way we expect this to continue.</p>
          <p>Moving from credit quality to profitability, so that's page 23. Of course, when you have growth in income, stable cost and stable risk, i.e., risk-weighted assets, then the return on equity will increase and this was a good quarter, 12.5% ROE, one of the best or highest quarters in this period. And this is, of course, of the direction with our ambition to stay at par with the strongest banks in Europe. Of course, it remains to be seen, because we have not seen yet all the reports of the European banks. But this is a strong result.</p>
          <p>The same issue is also visualized in page 24, so that our profit generation is strong so that we have been able to more or less double our Core Tier 1 capital in five and half years. And this is very important to get &#x2013; to have this kind of flexibility in our capital operating fund of this new regulation so that whatever the minimum requirement in the end will be, this is the way to adjust for those.</p>
          <p>Moving to risk-weighted assets on page 25. You can see that we have been able to manage our risk-weighted assets well. They have been stable throughout this period. In the second quarter, they went down because of the credit quality, improved credit quality. We also were down in the market risk. Then on contrary FX issues drove risk-weighted assets up, but all in all we've been more or less stable or little bit down. And then you can see that this is the level we have been now in this period of time of roughly two years. The peak in Q4 last year was because of this Basel 2.5 implementation, which impacted &#x20AC;4 billion of risk-weighted assets, so that we have been able to digest already that part of the new regulation.</p>
          <p>And then it means that on page 26, as you can see, our Core Tier 1 ratio is improving in a stable manner, so that it has been now up by 180 basis points in two years. And what is important to recognize is that we have been able to keep the risk-weighted assets stable, or actually a little bit lower.</p>
          <p>And at the same time with strong profits, which is partly coming also from the fact that we have been able to continue to support our customers in terms of lending. So that we have not deleveraged our balance sheet, we have not reduced our business. We have been continuing our growth agenda, but with good capital management we have been able to keep risk-weighted assets stable.</p>
          <p>And then moving to updated estimates related to new regulation. We gave this type of indication in our Capital Markets Day in last autumn in London. We have updated the figures. The message is still more or less the same. So that, yes, there will be negative impact because of new regulation mainly coming from this CVA risk, which is coming from our derivative exposures taking down the Core Tier 1 ratio by roughly 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>But then again, on the other side, we have this kind of new rollout for our internal models, mainly advanced model for our Nordic corporate exposures, as well as some additional risk-weighted asset efficiency gains, and those are offsetting this impact of new regulation. So that we are roughly talking about a neutral impact of these factors. There is some uncertainty related to this estimation, especially with the CVA risk just because the regulation is not final, but this is now our best estimation what the impact will be.</p>
          <p>And then, I'm moving to Christian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'll give you a few comments on New Normal Plan and strategy. First of all, my favorite slide on page 29, which is our market cap compared to our peer group, which we monitor since 2007. And you can clearly see how we have climbed in position. So in relative terms, I think we have been given recognition for our efforts in creating a stronger bank and are now number three in the peer group.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's based on our relationship banking strategy, which is the key of Nordea. So we are building relationship with our customers so we can advice them, we can be close to them, we can know their risks, and we can do all our business. So it is a win-win. The customer gets value advice and feel very pleased about the service. They rate us very high, and we get all the business and good risk management. This is a successful strategy. It has been, but it will even more in the New Normal.</p>
          <p>In the New Normal, it is about finding the right solutions which are capital, liquidity and cost-efficient. And that can only be done if you're very close to your customer and really have a chance to tailor-make a lot of solutions. So all our resources are being directed to this core relationship banking, and this also gives us a well-diversified and balanced model. We have both lending and deposits. We have all the transactions in our balance sheet business. And we run the bank fully integrated, very, very focused, and based on the Nordic structure.</p>
          <p>I'll go now through the highlights of the quarter. You have probably already heard about it, but a bit more into the New Normal Plan. So we have a large number of initiatives actually working at becoming more efficient in whatever we do. It's very much in capital. There are a lot of things we can do, from getting more collateral to changing products, to changing processes and to changing models. There are lot of things and they're all important.</p>
          <p>Capital is a sure expensive resource now and we had to quote a lot of it, so therefore this is important. And Ari already went through the RWA  development, but of course we &#x2013; it is clear that this effort has had a huge impact on our  RWA development, which is flat or even down. Also the costs were already accounted for. You see our FTEs down and we will continue having unchanged cost for prolonged period of time, i.e., taking out efficiency gains so at least 3% to 4% per year, which is quite an achievement, I think, remembering that we have a high business momentum and we are not deleveraging. We're actually adjusting the New Normal.</p>
          <p>But one of the most important part is actually funding and liquidity efficiency, and this is important because there's lot of efficiency to be gained here, because previously we didn't do that for two reasons. First of all, liquidity was free. It didn't cost anything. And secondly, we didn't really have to post any liquidity buffers. Now we have to post liquidity reserves for more or less everything we do, or even post long-term funding reserves. And therefore, the way we price and the way we put liquidity into equation, everything single customer and every single transaction is important. And we are now rolling out our liquidity premia project. It's already out there, and as we go forward in the coming quarters, we will be able to price all transactions with the right charge in liquidity, which will be very important.</p>
          <p>So it's not only a capital gain. This is at least as impossible to get the liquidity equation right and ensure that we select this business we want to do, that is priced right also here, and we also educate our people and, of course, the customers in finding solutions which command less liquidity and funding reserves.</p>
          <p>And the result of all these efforts, you can see on the next slide all efficiency measures are going in the right direction. In each of the business areas, we are doing exactly this. It has slightly different &#x2013; focus is in retail. It has lot to do with our distribution strategy. We have now come 80% through rebuilding our network. So we had advisory branches and service branches that works extremely well, increases efficiency. We've been able to take out a large number of FTEs. And the customers get more satisfied, because when they go into a bank with advisory needs, they will need educated advisor. If they go into the banks and have a service need, then they will need an educated service person, which is, of course, very important.</p>
          <p>This will continue in the coming years as people change behavior, our customer change behavior, and they'll start to go to the bank with their fingers instead of with their feet. That will change considerably the cost of running our &#x2013; especially our wholesale strategy. And numbers from retail, as you can see, are developing very nicely.</p>
          <p>On wholesale, it's very much about business relation. It is about solving the customer needs in a different way, with less capital and liquidity, and ensuring that we only do the business that is priced right. This requires that we deepen relationships even more. And we're today giving out the number that now 60% of the large corporate customers in the Nordic area post Nordea as a leading bank, which, of course, a key to actually achieving this efficiency in the customer interface. But also in the wholesale area, we are, of course, also working very much on our value chains to ensure that we are even more efficiently turnout the solutions to the customers.</p>
          <p>And our wealth management, it's very much about efficiency in the front line in private banking, run an efficient fund universe, re-engineering funds, closing funds which makes us more efficient. And in life and pension, of course, keep migrating towards capitalized products. And this is quite sequential, as you can see from the numbers now, 75% of gross written premiums are in capital life products or unit-linked, which means it's a big increase even compared to 2011. So this development is important, and it's important to remember that life and pension &#x2013; our life and pension operation, when we're talking about capital-light products, it is profitable on the ROE &#x2013; on any ROE measure. So it's only in the old tradition which is not so &#x2013; by migrating we increase the profitability a lot.</p>
          <p>So the conclusion, strong income, solid cost control, improved capital and improved ROE, and the execution of the New Normal plan is continuing exactly according to plan and delivering the expected results.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And with that, operator, we would like to open up for questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Nick Davey of UBS. Go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for taking the time. Two questions please from my side. First, if I could bring you back, please, to the slide 27 on the risk-weighted assets efficiency programs that are underway. Could you please just give us a bit more sense &#x2013; a bit more detail around this 1.1 percentage points of Core Tier 1 you're hoping to generate on the RWA side. How much of that is, let's say, within your control based on the &#x2013; your internal model and internal capital efficiency, and how much of this is based on the advanced IRB approval from the regulator? And any updates please on the time horizon of these changes?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, please, on expenses. You've highlighted how at a Group level expenses are well under control in the constant FX terms. I just wondered if you could comment a little bit around the split between retail and wholesale. Retail looks to be down 6% half-on-half, wholesale costs up 9% half versus the equivalent half last year. Is this a trend that you're comfortable with, or would you be looking to keep a closer control on the wholesale costs? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take the first one, this rollup in RWA efficiency, this &#x20AC;19 billion which will give us a number over the target of these actions, more than half of it is coming from expected advance model approval. We are not very precise in giving this type of estimations, because they are estimations, and in the end they are subject to approvals and we can't control that so well. But that's now our assessment that a bit more than half of this &#x20AC;19 billion is coming from that model approval.</p>
          <p>And the remaining part is then this kind of identified actions we have been doing together with the business areas and the various other internal stakeholders. It's very much <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:38) still cleaning the house, so to say, and then taking in more collateral, sourcing in more information, being more precise in terms of our models and parameters, getting more external data to back up our own parameters, and then be more precise in various type of collateral approvals and issues like that. So that there are, I would say, if I remember correctly, 75 different type of actions in these categories smaller and bigger ones.</p>
          <p>And when we are talking about the timetable of all these gains, of course, its approval we can't influence so much. We are now &#x2013; we are progressing well with our dialog with the Swedish FSA and Nordic FSA, so that we start to be in this kind of content dialog. We are contemplating our application. We are verifying some issues. We have started this kind of more official dialog, which is, of course, a good indication that we start to be at the end of this very long process.</p>
          <p>But whether this approval comes in Q3, Q4, Q1, it's simply impossible to say at this point, but at least now we are in the &#x2013; start to be on the inside of the pipeline. And then this &#x2013; our internal efficiency gains, they are coming. The time period we are now talking about is roughly two next years, so that the part of it is coming already this year and then part of it is coming in 2013, minor part, and 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Nick, then you were asking about the expenses. Actually the &#x2013; we are pleased with the development in both wholesale and retail. It is pretty much exactly along with our plan. So if you look at the retail side of down minus 6%, it has to do with a very significant reduction of FTEs in the quarter, as you may have seen. As regards wholesale, if you look in the report, you'll find most of that increase, or all of it actually in other part of business area, so this is mainly related to variable salaries. So the underlying cost growth in both of these areas are very well-contained and also in line with our plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Thank you, sir. We will now take our next question from Claire Kane of RBC. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Can I first have a follow-up question on slide 27? Did I hear correctly that on the CVAs, that is the gross 200 basis points impact, and then there'd be a positive 100 basis offset for that 1 percentage point overall reduction? Just to clarify there.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on asset quality. Your gross loan losses this quarter were the highest since Q2 2009, and really benefited from the reversals of your collective provision. So you now have half your impaired loan book in Denmark. Can you talk us through what we should &#x2013; how we should think about loan losses there? How much do you have left of collective provisions in Denmark? And how have the rule changes, how will they increase the amount of provisioning going forward on a new impaired loan in Denmark, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First is clarification on page 27. Sorry if I was unclear, but no, that was not right what you heard. This 100 basis points impact is coming from CVA, not 200, so that is 100. And again, coming to your second question about this level of high gross loan losses. Yes, that's right that they were high. They increased especially for individual asset new loan losses, and the impact was very much coming from these new Danish rules. It was &#x20AC;80 million impact from that.</p>
          <p>So if you take away this &#x20AC;80 million, then we are still &#x2013; yes, we are still at the high end, but not at the highest among the quarters. We have still remaining collective provisions in Denmark roughly at the level of &#x20AC;100 million &#x2013; little bit more than &#x20AC;100 million. And still we have &#x2013; that collective reserve includes some kind of safety cushion, so that it's little bit higher amount than our models are giving us as the needed collective provisions in Denmark. So that still I would say that we are little bit on the safe side in the collective reserves in Denmark.</p>
          <p>But now this what happened in the new Danish rules, that was very strict new principles how to book for the loan losses, and just to give you some kind of example on that. For example, if you have a real estate client, commercial real estate client with a negative equity, then actually that triggers already the impairment and you have to impair this difference in terms of loan losses regardless of the cash flows of that type of customer. So that &#x2013; then it's a very strict way of impairing customers and booking for the loan losses, because in normal case in other countries and the best practice we have used this kind of normal impairment rule. So that when we identify a customer to be clear risk &#x2013; where we have a clear risk of loan loss, then we make this kind of very transparent impairment calculation, where we calculate for the collateral value and then we calculate for the future cash flows. And then, if we have a difference, then the &#x2013; compared to our exposure, then we book a loan loss. But these cash flows &#x2013; cash flow impact is more or less taken away in Denmark with these new rules.</p>
          <p>So it means that there are lots of customers who are simply very normally paying back their &#x2013; servicing their debts. But nevertheless, if there's a negative equity in that type of asset-backed financing, that has to be impaired and booked for the loan loss. Of course, this means for the future, as I said, that now, because we are going through our whole lending book in Denmark in light of these new rules. Now we have definitely identified lots of new impaired customers and booked lots of new loan losses for these impaired customers, so that it's very likely that this trend is not going to be repeated quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>But still we will have new loan loss customers and impaired customers also in Denmark, because, of course, there will always be new ones. So that this is more or less the situation we have. And what does this mean for the level of our loan loss is going further, I would say that we are expecting more or less the same pattern to continue for the coming quarters, so that we will still have elevated level of losses in shipping and in Denmark, and we will still have low and stable losses in other parts of our portfolio. Because still the fact is that the performing part of our portfolio, especially corporate portfolio, still improving so that we have more uprated customers and downrated customers. So that this healthy portfolio is improving, so that we are dealing with just this kind of tail problem in Denmark and this kind of very difficult market situation in shipping.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's extremely helpful. Could I just have one follow-up then. Given it's based on &#x2013; the provisioning is based on the real estate or market values, what's your outlook for the Danish real estate prices from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real estate and house market is still weak in Denmark, so that it's difficult to believe in quite fast pickup. But then again, it has &#x2013; through the first half it has been a little bit down. It has been in this type of &#x2013; in the past year it has been down, it's been stable, it has been then a little bit down again.</p>
          <p>Now it's stabilizing according to our views. So that perhaps difficult to say that if we have seen the bottom, but at least it should not go up &#x2013; go down very much from these levels. Because now we are starting to have these kind of strong fundamentals, so that disposable income or affordability in the Danish household is strong compared to these level of house prices. And that goes also for the commercial real estate, so that rental cash flows, they are servicing well to the values of where we are today. So that's difficult to say &#x2013; have firm opinion, but because downside risk is not so big anymore according to my understanding.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Omar Keenan of Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just two questions, if I can. Firstly, there's been a good job done in keeping the Group margin stable despite deposit margin pressure. In Denmark, how much re-pricing do you think we can get in from here, given that the outlook is for further deposit margin pressure?</p>
          <p>And then just secondly, just thinking about the Swedish regulator. It seems like on the one hand he's allowing risk weight efficiencies and improving modules, but on the other hand he's increasing the Core Tier 1 level requirement. So it seems to be just taking with one hand and giving with the other, and now you've delayed the mortgage risk weights. So well, what do you think his strategy and goals are? What do you think he is trying to do? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the first question was on the Danish margins, and of course we rarely give any forecast as to the margin. But, of course, we strive to continue to improve margins and their margin should go up on the back of the regulatory implication from more capital and more corresponding costs.</p>
          <p>If you look back on the margin development, it has &#x2013; off the back of reference rates or repo rates, there's been a significant uptick, but so has funding costs. So in real terms, funding &#x2013; the margins have, of course, improved. But, of course, you've got to remember that we come from a more than 10 or 15-year contraction of margins. So hopefully, we will be able to continue to improve the margin, but it's really very, very difficult to give any sort of forecast. It is part of, of course, our strategy to ensure a fair pay for the business that we do, so it's difficult to give more comments on that.</p>
          <p>Then relating to the capital requirements and the regulator in Sweden, I think there are two different things. The Swedish regulator is among the toughest, if not the toughest, in terms of requiring higher capital level, specifically on the Core Tier 1, and the suggested levels for Core Tier 1 ratio in 2013 and 2015 are very high. And, of course, that remains to be seen whether that will be ever implemented, but it is very high.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, I think the model changes that are now being granted are very much in line with the Basel III methodology. So it's not very easy, if you put it that way, for the regulators to sort of prevent those model implications or implementations to actually take place. So I think the overall stand from the regulator is that we should be implementing sound and good practices as related to capital calculation in the Basel III &#x2013; Basel II and Basel III framework, and then having done so, maintain a high and stable Core Tier 1 ratio. So I don't think it's inconsistent.</p>
          <p>When you &#x2013; you mentioned also the risk weights on household mortgages, that's been a very long discussion. It is not necessarily very easy to find a solution. I think the duration of the process is reflecting that issue that it will &#x2013; it's taking some time to figure out a good method. But for sure, that will come into the process at some stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think it's fair to say that this &#x2013; you said give with one hand. They don't give anything, I can assure you. They are super diligent on how they do this. So the reason why, for example, as Ari told that our advanced process has now gone on for two years and is still dragging out is because they are very, very eager to do then, and this is right. So we have to prove every single point, and therefore they don't give anything. They don't allow any model changes that do not reflect real risk, I can assure you. So don't think they intend to give out anything.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, they also have determined that implementing these new models maybe it's not so much about capital relief. It's actually more about right behavior, because in the models you now &#x2013; in the advance margin they have parameters which gives you a huge incentive to get to work in a risk aware way. You can actually &#x2013; because it involves margin, you can actually behave right in terms of risk. And that is a huge benefit, because you used advanced model for the more advanced product and the more advanced customers.</p>
          <p>So to give the banks incentive to do the right things in terms of both collateral and how we put together and structure the deals it's very important, and that we will, of course, do, because having an advanced model gives us possibility to add &#x2013; to structure deals in a way that it contains less risk for us in either before an event or after the event. So I don't think they give away anything, and I agree with what Fredrik said very much that they are tougher than the rest, to use Bruce Springsteen approach, for sure.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Just a quick follow-up from earlier in the meeting in Stockholm today. Just out of the &#x20AC;106 million release of collective provisions, you said that &#x20AC;80 million is to offset the Danish FSA changes. I just wondered, the rest of it, the other &#x20AC;26 million, does that come in a different division and where do we see that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The remaining part comes from our collective provisions, so the management judgment provisions we have made in the Baltics portfolio. And in Baltics it has stabilized and we have not seen for two or three quarters, more or less, any new customers coming impaired and where we have a need to book loan losses and we still have quite a substantial collective provisions remaining for the portfolio. That's the other explanation.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much for taking my question. I just had two quick questions. My first question is around corporate pipeline. How does it look for the second half of this year, and how much growth do you expect on the corporate lending side?</p>
          <p>And my second question is around the slide 27. In case there would be a delay in the improvement of the RWA efficiencies, I've heard that the Finnish and Norwegian regulators are, for example, quite slow. How would you reach the 12% equity Tier 1 minimum set by January 2015? Would you consider maybe lowering dividend or rights issue, or what kind of measures are you planning should RWA efficiency measures be delayed? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the corporate lending growth, you've seen a growth now in the second quarter, but we generally expect fairly &#x2013; as we also write in &#x2013; or as Christian also writes in his comments, we expect generally demand to be fairly lower on the corporate side and we continue to expect that for the remaining part of the year and for some time. Of course, it's our hope that market eventually will pick up. We see some growth in the Nordic region as we go forward, but we expect general demand to be fairly moderate as we go forward. If I just may make a really quick comment on the bridge and the IAS or the Basel III bridge there, of course, we don't expect the delay to last until 2015. We're talking about quarters here and not years in terms of delay relating to the advanced IRB approval. So it's not an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you wouldn't consider potentially lowering your dividend, you're sticking to your 40% dividend target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have provided here a bridge. And, of course, as we all have also shown to you that we since many, many years have generated a lot of capital every year. So reaching the required capital level is not an issue. And as I said, the advanced IRB approvals, it maybe late this year or even perhaps early in the next year, but you're referring to a potential requirement as of January 1, 2015, which is basically three years away. So, of course, we will have an advanced IRB approval long prior to that date. Then, of course, as you've seen, we continue to generate lots of capital, so reaching the requirement is not an issue.</p>

          <p>Thank you, madam. Next question is from Riccardo Rovere of Mediobanca. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everybody. I have three questions. The first one is on net stable funding ratio. If I understand, you are not close to 100%. So my question is, is this a set of numbers, especially NII, already impacted by the efforts of getting a better net stable funding ratio over time? This is my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on policy rights. Without entering into details country-by-country, do you think the time lag effect of policy rates going &#x2013; having gone down over the past few months already visible in these set of numbers, or do you think that there's going to be much more in the next quarters?</p>
          <p>And finally on asset quality, the sovereign debt crisis started a year ago, more or less, or even more than a year ago. After 12 months &#x2013; or more than 12 months, the asset quality of Nordea looks still pretty solid, pretty okay. Is there any reason why after 12 or 15 months the asset quality should suddenly start deteriorating?</p>
          <p>And then if I may, a very final curiosity on risk-weighted assets. The loan book is up &#x20AC;10 billion quarter-on-quarter, while the credit risk risk-weighted assets are totally flat. There is no difference. So given that you calculate credit risk and the standardized foundations, which should not be too sensitive, I really don't understand how &#x20AC;10 billion growth in the loan book is not reflected in the credit risk risk-weighted assets. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I should start with the first two, and then I guess you can come in, Ari. Your question was NSFR.  First, let me just say that &#x2013; a few things. First of all, it's confirmed that we're talking about 2018 here. And the rules &#x2013; the final rules remain unclear as to the parameter testing and even perhaps the fundamental way it will be implemented.</p>
          <p>We are still below 100%, but we have continuously strengthened our long-term funding and the maturity profile of the Group over the last several years, as you've seen. And we've also maintained a high funding ratio this year. So we don't know the rules as of yet and what they will look like, but we are going in the right direction. So this is perhaps a little premature to see what we need to do, but, of course, we will be able to cope with them so far in a good manner should that come onstream in 2018.</p>
          <p>Your second question related to the policy rates and the lowering of various interest rates, and in more general terms, it is a very short lag effect. We have typically a fairly fast impact from lower interest rates, particularly so on the transaction accounts and the other savings accounts. There is some lag effect relating to the liquidity, but generally it's not very big. We've now had a couple of policy changes or interest rate declines at the early part of July and they will impact, of course, also the third quarter. So the trend you have seen from previous quarters will likely continue in the third quarter, but there is no major lag effect from the past, so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Asset quality in the next 12 months, I see that our asset quality should be relatively stable in the next 12 months. So that this pattern we have seen a few portfolios with higher risk, as we have discussed a bit earlier in this meeting, that perhaps continues. But then this kind of bulk of maturity in our loan portfolio is very solid and strong, and actually it has even improved when just simply following up what is happening in our rating. So that strong Nordic companies, they are getting even stronger. That has been the case throughout the crisis more or less, and that is still expected.</p>
          <p>Of course, there is always provisions. If there is a very, very severe recession now triggered in Europe, then, of course, we are not immune what is happening in the macro environment. But if more or less the macro situation is looking the same as it's right now, this kind of low growth, more or less non-growth, that would not have a major impact on our asset quality or credit quality.</p>
          <p>Then that's a little bit related to your next question based at how we have been able to grow in our loan book, but still keeping our risk-weighted assets stable. Partly that is these risk-weighted assets efficiency measures we have gone through already, so that we have taken lot of actions just to simply be more efficient in our, let's say, calculations and models and data gathering and sourcing. That's one part of the explanation.</p>
          <p>The other part is that that's more coming from this kind of customer business, so that we have, of course, done more business. The growth is coming from the strongly rated customers so that our exposures with the solid and strong customers, that has grown. And then again, weaker customers, of course, we have been exiting and reducing our exposure, so that there is also dynamics within our portfolio. So that's the other part of the explanation. And by also creating solutions to our customers with very low amount of capital consuming product.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. This is Christoffer from BarCap. Thanks for taking the question. Just on liquidity and the liquidity buffers you're showing on slide 19, in the context of some of your peers that reported earlier this week have said that they have actually started to build out the liquidity buffer further, and another one actually said that they were &#x2013; they stopped building it out. Can you just give us some color around your intentions, if this growth that this slide shows, we can expect it to continue? Or I think you mentioned earlier on the call that you were &#x2013; you're quite content with your current liquidity position. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I can &#x2013; I don't expect it to grow much more. We have increased a little bit in the quarter. But as you can see, we are quite high in terms of LCR compliance. And then I think it's worth mentioning also that we are now measuring according to the existing rules as they look today. But I think much would suggest that the LCR regulation is likely to be somewhat loosened up during the fall or at least could be that.</p>
          <p>So I think we have an extremely strong liquidity position at this time. I don't expect the liquidity buffer to increase at this stage. We have maintained a strong position for quite some time and we are LCR-compliant in every currency. So we are ahead of that timetable both from the local regulator and from the Basel III in general. So I think we have a very adequate position at this stage.</p>
