        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being here. It is a pleasure for me to see you this morning to announce the Presentation of the Half Year 2010 Results. I am here with Tom Piquemal. He will explain in detail the trends of first half year statement. And I have the entire EDF management staff in front of me. All of whom of course are available to take any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>During the half year, the Group has continued to grow and expand in complex, context, difficult context stuff marked by economic difficulties of the world around. From an economic standpoint in Europe, growth as you know was very low. And basically, the recovery of electricity sales over this H1 2010, we are seeing a slight rebound with electricity consumption growing 4.9%, 3.7 in Germany and 1.5 in the UK. And this growth in sales results from strict climate as well as relative recovery of industrial consumption. When I say relative, it mean, I mean that we are not seeing a great increase but we are seeing a slight rebound following a relatively tougher recession period.</p>
          <p>This is the case as well on the other side of the Atlantic. The energy market nevertheless remains difficult due to price increases and marked by the economic crisis of course as well as lower prices in gas linked to shale gas, non-conventional shale gases, which where prices have gone down due to that context. Economic example, degradation of public finance in a context of disturbed financial markets has led the state governments to adopt budget savings plans which are sometimes called rigor plans. Plans that have been extended to all countries, particularly in Europe with concurrently an introduction of specific measures including nuclear <mark type="inaudible" /> that has been the case in with German landscape. We will come back to that. Link between the tax and the lifespan, the extension of the power plant's lifespan in particular in Germany is <mark type="inaudible" /> for EnBW are 50% subsidiary as well as EnBW's competitors.</p>
          <p>Regarding regulations more specifically, discussions have been taking place in the UK. They are looking at a <mark type="inaudible" /> as a minimum price of CO2. With the new British Government, who have clearly expressed their desire to develop nuclear power and that was confirmed recently by discussion, as a matter of fact <mark type="inaudible" /> from EDF Energy will be glad to answer and tell you how the situation; nuclear situation in the UK has been evolving. In any case, we are in a position where we are receiving good support by public authorities in this area improving the economic conditions on the development of new nuclear power.</p>
          <p>All of this of course will have a major impact and major significance for the Group as you can well imagine. In fact, we have the NOME law of course that is at top of the agenda. I'll also talk to you about that later on. This NOME bill was particularly unfavorable to us initially as it stood, and ultimately after a long drawn out talks and discussions with public authorities, it was amended quite largely; meaning that the bill today is much more acceptable for EDF than it used to be.</p>
          <p>Now obviously, conversations, discussions, talks continue until the final approval and adoption of the law that should take place in the third quarter. As you know, Parliament should take &#x2013; resume their discussions on this subject as well as the Senate.</p>
          <p>Pierre Lederer, who is with us today, Pierre also answer any details you may want. In this disturbed context, the <mark type="inaudible" /> nevertheless continue to expand in France and abroad, meaning that our sales are up 7.7% due to a scope effect as well as due to a significant non-negligible organic growth. The Group has continued its operational CapEx within its <mark type="inaudible" /> networks particularly in France and in the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>Operational CapEx have gone up 8% up to &#x20AC;6 billion in the first half year, 2010. As you know, we've also strengthened our positions outside of France both by <mark type="inaudible" /> taken in Belgium by SPE. This is a very first consolidation of the SPE under the first half year results as well as new developments in particular in Russia. As you've heard, we have an agreement on South Stream, all previous agreements adjourned with Gazprom and Eni, and extension of operation as well similar to operation <mark type="inaudible" /> that is Asian countries, Central European countries as well as in the U.S.</p>
          <p>In China, our position of course is now well established, Herv&#xE9; Machenaud will tell you about that. He was personally involved in the developments in China over the past decade, more than past decade. And we have been helpness of the Chinese in nuclear development with the Chinese authorities by cooperation and partnership agreement, initially entered with CGNPC agreement that have been renewed and extended for the next 50 years over the past three months. This is it for the general context recurring results whether operating income are in line with our targets or slightly better EBITDA excluding the TaRTAM extension has gone up and our net debt over EBITDA ratio remain stable at 2.5.</p>
          <p>Thanks to all of this and we'll look at that in detail. Well, that will enable us to confirm our financial targets for the year 2010. We have recorded a provision of &#x20AC;1 billion for our U.S. investment. Tom Piquemal will tell you all about that later on. Therefore, I will not comment that topic on non-recurring items which of course has an impact on our income for H1 2010. We'll get back to that later on.</p>
          <p>Over the coming months, priorities are first and foremost industrial performance at all level in the Groups. Group starting with generation, Herv&#xE9; Machenaud, sitting with us today who will give us an update on the industrial production. He'll tell you about the performance of our asset base. Significant item particularly in France that fits in would <mark type="inaudible" /> a breakthrough versus the gradual deterioration of availability over the past two years. We are now on &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" />. He will also tell you about the news far more about nuclear power plants. I think lessons to be learned as of today.</p>
          <p>The second big challenge of course as I said is linked to the French legislation contacts, the no mean law process that will continue until the fall that is major phase for us in terms of financial results and Pierre Lederer, will also give you some details about that later on.</p>
          <p>As a group's mid-term strategic vision is essential as well and obviously it is partially conditioned by the previous items I mentioned and fits within a rational that is defined by the group in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> and development outlook, and we'll get back to the subject early in 2011 to give you a more precise update and a more precise vision of our quantified targets for the coming years. This also fits of course in the general context that has been commented on over the past few days regarding the nuclear power industry, and we'll make more comments later on.</p>
          <p>Before giving the floor to Thomas Piquemal for detail, let me give you the key figures for the first half year. Sales is up 7.7% at <mark type="inaudible" />, EBITDA has gone up 4.4%, &#x20AC;10.4 billion, organic growth excluding TaRTAM extension is 3.8%. This is the figure on the right side. This is the EBITDA growth excluding TaRTAM.</p>
          <p>Net income attributable. You see the figures are a little bit biased by non-recurring items for the fiscal year, up 1.5% with virtually &#x20AC;3 billion. Naturally this is also impacted by the provision made in U.S. Excluding non-recurring items the net operating income as I said, has grown 1.5% reaching nearly &#x20AC;3 billion. Our net debt remains stable in relative value, 2.5 times EBITDA at &#x20AC;44.1 billion. So these are the key figures, if you will.</p>
          <p>And I'll now give the floor to Thomas Piquemal to give you more details in the first half year figures.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As Chairman Proglio gave you the key highlights of our financial results. I'll now try to detail and explain these results. I'll also give you some information regarding a number of changes in plan for our assets portfolio, the offering that we received regarding the UK networks distribution business, as well as an analysis we're currently having regarding RTE and its assets within the group.</p>
          <p>Let's first of all start with an accounting caveat to tell you that for the first time in H1 we've used the IFRIC 18 and IFRIC 12 interpretation of accounting standards, virtually no in back except for IFRIC 18 that increased our shareholders' equity by 1.9 billion and EBITDA, pro forma EBITDA by approximately &#x20AC;100 million. Second item has to do with the presentation of our accounts. This time we decided to isolate on a separate line the impact of what we call volatility due to application of IAS 39 i.e. the net change in fair value on energy and commodity derivatives excluding trading activities, the impact is you see here in H1 2009 plus 309 million, plus 539 million for the second half 2009 and we felt that it was important to analyze this to remove any bias in the operational analysis.</p>
          <p>Sales revenue &#x20AC;37.5 billion, up 7.7% versus the first half year 2009. For the first time this year we consolidated SPE for &#x20AC;1.3 billion as well as existing nuclear businesses of CENG in the UK amounted for approximately 300 million, aside from currency effect organic growth is significant plus 700 million in revenues i.e. plus 2.1% organic, a significant growth in France, It's more significant in France as a matter of fact than internationally.</p>
          <p>You see in France, our revenue has grown 600 million versus 150 million in addition international. International change variations reflect variances between Germany and Italy with higher growth and lower revenue in the UK due to decreases in prices.</p>
          <p>EBITDA has grown as well 10.373 billion aside from currency effect and scope effects organic growth was 111 million. It includes the impact of the TaRTAM extension. As you know the law of June 2010 has extended the trend, the interim TaRTAM mechanism for an extended period. So based on analytical estimates &#x20AC;269 million will be the impact of this extension of the mechanism. Aside from this provision that was made you see EBITDA reached 10.373 billion, hence growth of plus 4.4% and 3.8% including the TaRTAM effect.</p>
          <p>EBITDA has gone up 4.4%, but the EBIT has gone down 22%. Naturally this decline is primarily due to the line on operating income and expenses which was positive in 2009, plus 330. This is actually capital gains on the <mark type="inaudible" /> plus &#x20AC;133 million, while in the first half 2010, we recorded a non-recurring provision on the U.S. business for &#x20AC;1.060 billion, which in turn has an impact, negative impact on the EBIT which otherwise would have been stable and may even have grown versus the first half year 2009.</p>
          <p>Now why did we make this provision on our U.S. investments? The reasons are the changes in market conditions in the U.S., market conditions in prices of gas and electricity which are much less favorable on the short and long-term even though on the long-term there are many scenarios of course. What is less favorable is a very high volatility of expectation attesting of an increased risk both on our existing businesses, but also on our developing projects.</p>
          <p>Meaning that we can now confirm that we are continuing our analysis and we're confirming our ambition in the perspective of developing a new reactor at the Calvert Cliffs, a site that will be the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear 3.</p>
          <p>If you have this risk and those who hedge any risk of loss of value on the CENG assets, our investments in Unistar's, as well as to cover some of the future project costs and risk, we have recorded 1.060 billion provision that will be recognize at the finalization of the acquisition price for the 2009 transaction. As you know, we have until the end of the year to finalize the allocation, the purchase price allocation.</p>
          <p>So, change in net income excluding non-recurring items excluding this non-recurring provision, net income has gone up 1.5%. Net income, in spite of increased financial expenses most of which are linked to updating &#x2013; excuse me, discounting an impairment of provisions and variations in the UK.</p>
          <p>In France, EBITDA has grown in spite of the added expense of the TaRTAM expansion. A growth of 1.2% of EBITDA this &#x2013; in H1 2010, EBIT down 8.3%, once again this is due to the other expense and income that I just mentioned, particularly with the capital gain on <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow reached 3.708 billion down from H1 2009 where that reach 4.9 &#x2013; excuse me, 4.5 billion, difference explained by the income tax item in the first half 2009, we had cashed in &#x20AC;900 million in tax credit, while we have now a net position in the first half 2010. The CapEx amount in France has grown as well going from &#x20AC;3.4 billion up to &#x20AC;3.700 billion reflecting an increase investment in the French nuclear assets, as well as RTE's investment in the SNCF networks. Over this first year, we've actually &#x2013; we've also continued to fuel our dedicated assets for &#x20AC;1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>EBTIDA has grown of course and this maybe explain by regulated activities with &#x20AC;542 million additionally due to price increases plus 170 million that is the impact, a very favorable climate effect in the winter in France and a lower impact of storms impact. 2009 in France, we have suffered a storm that had major impacts and the climate impact, in fact, this year were lower on the network activities in business.</p>
          <p>In the non-regulated sector, in spite of the growth of EBTIDA, thanks to higher returns, the overall EBTIDA has declined due to increased OpEx approximately 2% as well as lower profit margin i.e. &#x20AC;180 million less. The decline in the profit margin, which is explained here by this chart, page 15, particularly on the left side. On right side, you have the evolution of consumption and cause of losses in the first half year. You see plus 5.4 terawatt hour were consumed by end-customers and losses and self-consumption. On the left side, nuclear output in France is slightly down but virtually stable, minus 0.9 terawatt hour as compared with the first half year 2009. Herv&#xE9; Machenaud will give you more details on these changes in our generation, so not for me talk about this.</p>
          <p>Increase consumption, increase losses plus 5.4 were not offset by a virtual stability of nuclear output, means that we would net purchase of 9 terawatt hour on the market and this net purchase is made at the worst time possible on that market, explain the degradation of our gross margin in France in 2010 or at least in the first half year.</p>
          <p>More than offset of course by the excellent performance of networks over the first half year. In the UK, the EBTIDA is virtually stable at &#x20AC;1.6 billion, minus 2.1% in organic growth. I'll come back to that. EBIT is down 13.9% linked only to the line just below i.e. volatility due to IAS 39, which was positive plus 115 in 2009, minus 23 in H1 2010.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the UK, as I said, is virtually stable &#x20AC;1.6 billion in H1 2010 in spite of excellent performance linked to climate effect and volume effect, as well as good supply margins, and in the UK thanks to price changes, and in spite as well to the negative impact of the <mark type="inaudible" /> disposal that was recorded during the first half year.</p>
          <p>Stability in spite of these positive elements may be explain primarily in the cost of the unplanned shutdown of the Sizewell power plant, accounting for approximately 3 terawatt hour in losses of availability. And I can now confirm that we're expecting a recovery or restart of the Sizewell plant and new injection of its output in the third quarter. The shutdown at Sizewell explains the degradation of 3 terawatt hour of nuclear output in the UK. Another item regarding the power balance in the UK is as you at the bottom, is a lower output from the fossil-fired asset due to unfavorable changes over the first half year.</p>
          <p>The Group preferred to buy on the market, as you see plus 11 terawatt hour were purchased from the markets, an arbitrage that explains the improvement of our supply margins for the first half year. In Germany, excellent performance, nearly 30% growth of EBITDA, plus 800 &#x2013; that is &#x20AC;816 million, in spite of cancellation of concession contract the other contribution was growth of activity with volume sold on euro market, thanks to increased outputs and excellent performance of the transmission network as well over the past half year.</p>
          <p>In Italy, <mark type="inaudible" /> margins have contracted, minus 13.4% in EBITDA, particularly at Edison, reflecting strong margin contractions suffered by Edison in the first half year, margins in electricity and mostly in gas sales. Purchasing contracts at Edison are pegged on oil prices these are long term purchases while selling prices went down, of course, contracting, squeezing the margins in the first half year and that is and is currently to actively renegotiating this purchasing contracts and naturally this is absolutely not satisfactory to us.</p>
          <p>Other international businesses EBITDA growth was quite satisfactory as well it's doubled from nearly 300 up to &#x20AC;600 million in the first half year just for the consolidation of SPE, CENG and Estag had constant scope &#x2013; growth was 19%. Illustrating the excellent vitality of our businesses in Central Europe, in Belgium as well as internal growth linked to the commissioning of the CCGT in the Netherlands of which we owned 50%.</p>
          <p>If we look at other business lines EBITDA is down minus 11.5%, which was what you have down on the left and this decrease is only due to the decrease of the trading business. The margin of which is shrunk that is a contribution of that the EBITDA is gone down between first half 2009, first half 2010. And we now have reached &#x20AC;331 million, it's mainly during the second quarter that the margin on the trading business went down due to the fact that the trends changed on the commodities market this is what we saw during the second quarter and this impacted all the segments we work on except for coal and to a lesser extent freight.</p>
          <p>As you can see here down on the left, EBITDA was up on all the other segments. If you look at renewable energies for instance EDF Energies Nouvelles with a nice EBITDA increase during the first half. Investments or capital expenditure is up 7.7%. These are operational expenditures almost &#x20AC;6 billion with three principle reasons due to explaining this increase that is the network activity in France. We're still invest in our networks and this figure also includes the fact that we &#x2013; that <mark type="inaudible" /> networks in the non-regulated business in France that is mainly the replacement of some elements, or unit in the nuclear fleet in France and also in renewable energies as I said before EDF Energies Nouvelles have pursued its development and this during the first half.</p>
          <p>In light of these changes that is plus 4.4% for EBITDA and in the light of the fact that <mark type="inaudible" /> has increased and this is in the line call WCR variation. We got an advanced payment during the first half of 2010. Therefore, free cash flow was up, plus 10.5% reaching almost 1.9 billion that is plus 10.5%.</p>
          <p>So positive free cash flow, &#x20AC;1.9 billion and now we have fund which has reached &#x20AC;900 million, we've paid dividends 1.2 and therefore the debt should be stable compared to the 31 of December, but since we've had unfavorable exchange rates that has had an impact on the debt, our debt is up due to exchange rates, &#x20AC;1.4 billion compared with the 31 of December 2009 and this is the main reason why we have this increase.</p>
          <p>Now, on the 30 of June, the total amount is &#x20AC;44.1 billion which means 2.5 times EBITDA. This is a stable ratio compared with ratio we had in 2009. These are some items, as you can see for our <mark type="inaudible" /> which is mainly bonds the average maturity is 8.2 years. And maturity I'd like to say few words about to highlight two things.</p>
          <p>First, this is a maturity calculated on the gross debt and not on the net debt from which we deduct variabilities and as you can see here between the mean maturity in 2009 that is 7.4 years and the average maturity on the 30 of June, 8.2 years, we have an increase of almost <mark type="inaudible" /> points. This is because the group has decided to increase maturity with a number of transactions that were made during the beginning of the year and also in April with the issuance of bonds which is &#x20AC;1.5 billion with 20 years of maturity. Due to increase in maturity and due to the fact that during the first half of 2009 maturity was shorter, the average coupon is up going from 4.4% up to 4.7%.</p>
          <p>And to wrap up a few words concerning our liquidity, our liquidity level is really high with a net liquidity is almost &#x20AC;20 billion. All these figures are such that I can confirm all of our objectives for 2010. Here is the reminder that is EBITDA is growing on like-for-like basis except for the extension of TaRTAM and IAS 39, so it's a true EBITDA organic growth which will be in between 3% and 5%.</p>
          <p>The net debt to EBITDA ratio will be in between 2.5 to 3 which is a bracket, which is wide &#x2013; I said a few words about this, during the shareholders meeting, I said, I wanted to be closer to the 2.5 than the three, figure. And the third objective, it's a stable dividend. All these objectives do not take into account a series of projects, that we're currently working on, that is portfolio of assets will be reshuffled slightly, I'll come to this in a minute, the first objective has to do with the distribution networks in the UK.</p>
          <p>We received an offer, which I would say is truly qualitative offer, because its came from Cheung Kong Group major investor in infrastructures in the UK, and its quality offer, because its firm and financed and of high quality as well in terms of valuation, &#x20AC;6.9 billion to &#xA3;5.8 billion that's on the regulated part of the business that could be disposed, corresponding to 27%, so the multiple would be in average 8.1, that's for EBITDA 2010. And these figures, I think reflect the quality of this asset and the remarkable work that was done by the EDF teams in the UK.</p>
          <p>With <mark type="inaudible" /> this morning, I wanted to underscore this and to congratulate them. This offer is a quality offer as I said, so we've accepted exclusivity to this consortium, so as to continue our discussions, we'll continue discussing with them, we'll talk about the finalization of the industrial projects and also the commercial agreement that we could sign with this consortium. So as to continue cooperation in smart grid, in R&amp;D and other aspect, our joint intention is to have as much cooperation as possible in the UK.</p>
          <p>When this is done, when the discussion is all over, when we finished discussing the industrial project and the cooperation project, we will present all of these items plus the offer received plus industrial project, plus the commercial project to the bodies that represent the staff, so that they can tell us what they think about this project, when we received this from the Personal Representative, we will send this to our Commission of <mark type="inaudible" /> and Transfers and Commission of &#x2013; Commission des Participations et des Tranferts and then the Board of EDF will make a final decision to see if we're going to dispose off these networks or not.</p>
          <p>We have a second project that we wanted to describe for a minute, which is the one we're currently studying, the one we have to talk about 10 days ago, due to a number of rumors. The objective is to have a transfer of 50% of RTE equity to dedicated assets. With this project, we'll be able to optimize the dedicated asset portfolio. This will have a positive impact financially speaking for EDF.</p>
          <p>This is a project we're studying at the present. We will need to modify the 2007 decree. We would need to have an opinion of the Nuclear Commitments Monitoring Committee <mark type="inaudible" /> from the Board of Directors and we'll need to get the approval from the Board of Directors. However, I think that today it's important to tell you more about the reasons why we've decided to scrutinize the projects.</p>
          <p>The principal reason is that of the way we manage our dedicated assets. As you can see here, in the middle of this circle today, on the June 30, the portfolio represents &#x20AC;12.3 billion, mainly bonds and shares and part of the portfolio, which is monitoring. We need to do this, so as to live up to cost. The cost of dismantling our nuclear plant and the management of radioactive waste in the long term and also with the portfolio deadline originally set at June 2011 and extended to 2016, should the NOME draft bill be adopted. And then we have to be less volatile, I don't need to say too much about this. We know how volatile the markets are and this is a risk for us when we invest in shares and bonds.</p>
          <p>And finally, there is something else concerning this portfolio that is the impact on the net earnings of this portfolio is 0.45%, so that's the return for H1. And that's the net impact. That's not the performance of the portfolio, which is above this figure, but most of this will impact the equity, so the return, as I said, is 0.45% multiplied by 2 for the full year, this would be 0.9%. So, to manage this, usually, we have a long-term debt with a rate which is above 4.6% as an average. So if we have a debt at 4.6% for a return of 0.9%, this is something we could criticize. This is the reason why.</p>
          <p>If we include RTE in dedicated assets, this would be more favorable for us and would have a good impact on the bottom line. Now you know what the RTE is all about. We think this is a major asset to improve the efficiency of our portfolio because we know the RTE network. They have the infrastructure and also the losses that we can have in independent management. And with this, we could justify the fact that part of the equity would be in the dedicated funds.</p>
          <p>As I said, the financial impact would be positive. I'd like to mention two. First, the reallocation of the 50% in our portfolio and doing this will avoid having a debt, which would be &#x20AC;2.3 billion. The assumption is the net of book value of RTE on the June 30, so we don't need to increase our debt.</p>
          <p>Mechanically, we'll reduce the economic debt tendering this type of transaction. The second positive impact is the one I mentioned before when we look at the return before or the loss we would avoid. We would, therefore, have a positive impact which would be almost 2% on the net earnings. Theoretically speaking, this is the annual figure. If we take the return I mentioned before, 0.9% and of course we would still keep the integrated business model of the Group, which, as you know, is something which is dear to us.</p>
          <p>That's the end of this section that is our results and the changes in our portfolio. Now we will listen to Pierre. Pierre will tell us more about the French regulation in France and how the reforms are being deployed.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I will tell you more about the NOME law in France. Henri Proglio has said a few words about this. As you know this was adopted in France. It was examined by the Senate on the July 7. The NOME law will be passed in autumn. The objective for implementation will be at the beginning of 2011, which means that the number of governmental tax will have to be endorsed. These are decrees and, as it is we say, and the main ones are shown here. There is a slight mistake here.</p>
          <p>The first bullet point would be an attitude, some type of decree. And as you will easily understand we have a number of government texts. The main ones will have to do with the way we will calculate the price of ARENH. And the assessment of maximum access volumes, this will be determined with time and the conditions to give them to the different players and also another clause which is called the method to compute the supplementary price.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, these are the new characteristics of the new electricity market designs. ARENH implementation regulates access to nuclear market. That is competitors will have access to nuclear electricity generated by EDF with the maximum of a 100 terawatt-hours plus in 2013, the losses of the network managers. We could, therefore, increase the figure and reach a 120 terawatt-hours depending on the rules that will be set up for the &#x2013; in terms of access of the network managers to the losses, if the network managers are treated like any other clients that is, they will &#x2013; we would reach 120 terawatt-hours as I mentioned here on the slide.</p>
          <p>When the law is enforced, we will no longer have the TaRTAM. And therefore, the 80 terawatt hours that's for the customers that receive electricity from the competition of &#x2013; by ourselves. And today these trends have the special TaRTAM tariff. These clients would be the first ones to be the first beneficiaries of the NOME law, therefore, that will be quite important market here.</p>
          <p>And then the green and yellow tariffs will be disappearing for the local authorities and companies, the total is 115 terawatt hours that was for 2009 and this will disappear in 2015 And before 2015, there will be progressive conversions towards a system based on sacking of tariff element that is cost of generation, cost of transmission commercial costs and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>The blue tariffs that for clients below 36 kilowatt that is the residential customers and small businesses and this corresponds to 175 time terawatt hours will be maintained as you know. And before 2015 the tariffs will convert to ARENH <mark type="inaudible" />, conversions of implicit income on base load energy for supply towards ARENH prices at the latest in 2015.</p>
          <p>And finally, the peak load issues, as you know they are not always valued by the market such as, this means introduction of output or interruptibility capacity mechanism across market suppliers. And the suppliers will be able to exchange those. Therefore, this will be to share the security cost of French power systems. The cost is borne at present mainly by EDF. And there are still a number of pending issues.</p>
          <p>And as you know, there are many things that will have to be clarified in the French decrees as I said before. These projects have been drafted by the government. First, we have to look at the initial value for the price of access to the regulatory market in the nuclear business, the law says that there will be consistency between the bills paid by the TaRTAM clients and the price of ARENH and from the EDF point of view, this means we would have constant flow of income for EDF on this 80 terawatt hours that's for TaRTAM customers.</p>
          <p>And as you know, according to us this leads to a price, which would be &#x20AC; 42 per megawatt hour. And then, the evolution of the ARENH price will be clarified by the law of other decrees and there will be no ambiguity any longer concerning the calculation method.</p>
          <p>And finally, we think that the parliamentary discussions and as the decrees will help us reduce the arbitrage opportunities with the supplementary price closed another measures, which will be adopted and well I think you are familiar with all of this.</p>
          <p>And without further ado, I'll hand over to Herv&#xE9;.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. EDF's industrial challenges you are familiar with, but I will give you a brief reminder. Five key challenges are of course, first and foremost to restore the performance of our generation asset base over the long-term in fact.</p>
          <p>It also means preparing together with the local nuclear safety authorities the extension of the life span of our nuclear power plants both in France and in the UK. It involves completing naturally successfully the Flamanville 3 construction and to capitalize on the lesson learned for the next EPI units.</p>
          <p>It also involves and that is based on the EDF's history and it makes good sense. It involves initiating studies in order to broaden the range of nuclear reactor for the future and last but not least, all of these challenges are backed by EDF's industrial reality i.e., it's ability for industrial mastering, mastering control of its generation assets and tools i.e., requiring a renewal of nuclear expertise and know how.</p>
          <p>Let me focus on the first and third of these challenges as we had announced. A number of audits and assessments have been initiated leading to new insights today regarding an outlook and a diagnosis if you will. Firstly, regarding the generation and output, on the one hand and on the Flamanville project on the other hand.</p>
          <p>Nuclear output for 2010 or at least in the first half year as Thomas said earlier, the nuclear output should be growing versus 2009 approximately 15 to 25 terawatt hour in addition. As you see on this graph on page 40, what's important to look at is agenda over the year.</p>
          <p>In the continuum of a bad second half in 2009 naturally there we had deal with the &#x2013; cope with the consequences of a number of outages meaning that we had approximately 6.3% under output as compared with January 1. The trend has improved over the first half year, with reach &#x2013; point &#x2013; minus 0.4% in the first half and in end of July we've reached minus 2 with a target of plus 4 to plus 6% in the output for the end of the year, so a gradual recovery of our output availability.</p>
          <p>And actually the output is directly linked to the Kd coefficient availability coefficient, itself in turn directly linked to the number of outage days in nuclear output. What explains the lower output between 2009 and 2010 is that we had more added days in the first half 2010 then we did in 2009 over the same period, taking a closer look we're seeing encouraging signs of improvement and better control.</p>
          <p>First of all, the number of plant shutdown days that is dark blue is higher in 2010 because we have more plant shutdowns in the first half 2010 then we had in 2009, meaning that we have less shutdown days in the second half 2010.</p>
          <p>Extension of shutdown, which is another element to assess our industrial control performance, as you see that is significantly lower in the first half 2010 than it was over the same period in '09 and virtually half of these shutdowns are linked to two key elements, i.e. the impossibility to reside the Bugey 3 power plant, because the French Nuclear Safety Authorities have requested that we do not restart the Bugey 3 reactor until we've changed the major component.</p>
          <p>Hence three, the three failures that we had at Paluel linked to a turbine and the first 30 year inspection at Fessenheim and the non start up of Bugey account together for approximately 50% in the extension of the shutdown time, okay, downtime.</p>
          <p>So the trend is for a significant improvement of better control, better mastery of these shutdowns, the remaining risk naturally is linked with generic failures, and I will come back to that latter on.</p>
          <p>Aside from plant shutdown times, we of course have direct consequences on the Kd coefficient.</p>
          <p>You see here on this slide, page 41, we had more shutdown days in this half year and extension of shutdowns, if we remove those linked to Fessenheim and Bugey, are virtually of the same order of magnitude as in the first half 2009. Obviously, the problem is linked to unplanned outages and <mark type="inaudible" /> failures, this is linked to incidents we had in alternative and transformers as well. And I'll show you later on that we're expecting to reach better control of these incidents in the very short-term.</p>
          <p>The lessons to be learned from that or the takehome messages is that today in the first half year, we're still suffering the inertia from generic failures but our position today is that we have improved and we are continuing to improving the duration of the maintenance shutdowns.</p>
          <p>Regarding the output, in terms of power outputs, we're seeing the direct consequences of what I just said. The availability of factor Kd coefficient is down 4.2 points compared with H1 2009, i.e. minus 10.6 terawatt hours of which 8.5 due to exceptional generic failures and to the residual impact during H1 2010 of the disturbances in 2009. Conversely, only minus &#x2013; only 2.5 terawatt hours are due to outages and shutdowns planned which were higher than during the first half 2009, hence the balance is 0.9 difference that we mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Our target for our annual output in 2010 are ranged between 405 and 415 terawatt hour, somewhere around 410 with an availability coefficient target ranging between 78.5 and 79.5 linked to any residual risk of course of generic failures on the transformers or generators and steam generators.</p>
          <p>And let me close on an optimistic note. It seems to me that the trends are much better secured now. Indeed, the major residual risk i.e. generic failures shows that today out of the 25 alternative <mark type="inaudible" /> that were regarded as at risk, by the end of December 2010, we would only have four leftover to be completed in 2011. And out of these four remaining <mark type="inaudible" /> to be replaced or repaired, three have been inspected and we have good assurance that no incident should take place on these three.</p>
          <p>Out of the 28 steam generators, regarded at risk, 20 &#x2013; I don't know, but that's all of them, 20 out of the 28 steam generators will have been replaced by the end of 2010. So we will only have eight remaining to be replaced between 2011 and 2015. Analyses are currently underway, exhaustive analyses on all major components of the power plants to check which ones would justify in early treatment, if you will, to anticipate any future and unexpected generic failures. These analyses have already started and by the end of the next quarter, the final conclusion should be available.</p>
          <p>On this next slide here; you'll see another element of securing; that is the number of units to be coupled to the network by the end of the year. At the end of July, 2010, 26 shutdowns of units will need to be restarted before the end of the year, including three that will be restarted in early August. By September, we will have nine less; meaning that we will have more security in terms of the risk linked to extended shutdowns.</p>
          <p>As I'm speaking, we have 42 nuclear units in normal operations. Eight in planned shutdowns, hence we have eight units which are either under extended shutdowns or unplanned shut down. And by the end of this week-end only two should be left over, meaning, that by the end of the month, except for one plant &#x2013; one unit in Tracastin and one in <mark type="inaudible" /> all of the units planned for operations will indeed be operational.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, we could say that we have significantly less risk of contingencies in failures; less risk of extended shutdown and overall, we have &#x2013; we enjoy a much better control of the output from our nuclear asset base.</p>
          <p>I want to tell you few words about the Flamanville EPR project. We had announced that in number of analyzes and assessments and audits have been initiated regarding the construction, the supervision and the control command system at the Flamanville EPR result, and probably <mark type="inaudible" /> audits gives us to announce a first announcement of that the first marketable output is targeted in 2014 with a construction cost re-estimated at around &#x20AC;5 billion.</p>
          <p>It is important to take into account the fact that Flamanville is not only a first-of-a-kind EPR reactor; but it is also &#x2013; and this is novel EDF history, it is <mark type="inaudible" /> following a 20-year interruption in the nuclear construction which, of course, has weakened our industrial fabric as well as the industrial control that we're trying to restore.</p>
          <p>The assessment that I spoke about was done exhaustively, seriously with a number of significant and positive elements that have come out of it. And obstacles have been overcome, probably those that included the most risks. We had major problems in the rejection gallery, which is now completed. We have major problems and difficulties on iron framework and welding of the liner, these problems have been solved.</p>
          <p>Now we have reached a stage of starting up the electro-mechanic assemblies on the nuclear island and the engine room is progressing well. As well as audits on control command system gives us a much optimism in regarding the feasibility under proper deadlines and proper conditions for the final completion of the EPR project.</p>
          <p>Another important element is linked to reorganizing the entire system to improve the supervision and steering and control over the project. This reorganization was initiated back in the first quarter 2010 and this organization is now fully finalized and established.</p>
          <p>Consequences for the continuation of the construction program is that we believe that &#x2013; thanks to this reorganization, the project with the commitment, with the lessons to be learned and capitalized on within EDF industrial model, we believe that a great many other difficulties of the past will not reoccur. And the example of Taishan has demonstrated that. These main components involve civil engineering work, improvement of the liner welding process. Naturally, we've had many technical specifications for concrete and materials that been improved and we have also improved our technique, particularly those used for concrete and civil works.</p>
          <p>We believe that following these assessment and versus the Flamanville reactor, in any future projects the construction deadline could be reduced down or kept down by approximately 14 months. The feedback from the Flamanville 3 expansion is already capitalized on the leverage on a continuous basis in Taishan in China. This is gains that have been achieved, thanks to new technical specs and civil works, and liner welds and so on. This is due not just to feedback on experience, it's also due to our industrial capacity and this is a major element that will be leveraged for future project.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we could say that for the UK nuclear projects and possibly in Italy as well, all of the gains and experience learned and gained in Flamanville can be directly reproduced with a beneficial impact, both in terms of construction deadlines and construction costs. In fact, the perception of our industrial mastery, if you will, that is being restored, this is the key message that I would like you to take home.</p>
          <p>Excuse me, I forgot something and I missed one important slide on page 47. This graph illustrates the first-of-a-kind effect that I mentioned earlier. You see in the history, throughout the history of EDF nuclear program, every time we've moved up to a new step, we've also analyzed the following step and so when and once we've completed the first-of-a-kind of the next step, there is always a learning phase. The situation where we need to <mark type="inaudible" /> and mastery with cost naturally for the first-of-a-kind that are significantly higher than for the rest of the series.</p>
          <p>So, for the first-of-a-kind unit for each of the step you have the cost of the first two units as compared with the average cost of the next units. And you see there is a difference that ranges from 11% for the 900 megawatt to 17% for the 1,300 megawatt and minus 23% for the final unit. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Before we reply to your question, let me, in the nutshell, summarize what's been happening over the last 8 months since I arrived as &#x2013; at the head of this Group. Lot of topics had to be dealt with and actually handled.</p>
          <p>The first big topic, of course, meant that I was &#x2013; I have to form a new management staff, which is now finalized and you've heard them on here Pierre Lederer, Thomas Piquemal, among others, and Herv&#xE9; Machenaud, who are top members of my Executive Committee. Jean-Louis Mathias, of course, is among the executive staff. Daniel Camus and Vincent de Rivaz. It's pleasure to see in front of me, he is now a member of the executive committee. And of course he is leading the UK businesses that Thomas described earlier.</p>
          <p>So, I want to establish a new management staff with their new ambitious and renovated frame of mind and that management staff is now fully operational. Over the past 8 months we have also dealt with many topics that I would <mark type="inaudible" />. First of all, the issue of the NOME law and new regulations in France are significant topic naturally on the Group's agenda, and that will not be finalized until the end of the year once the NOME law has been adopted and voted and the enforcement decree has been signed by the French public <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>As to being able to &#x2013; and we're very pleased to have been able to influence the amendments in the NOME law which is the major concern for us early this year.</p>
          <p>Another major issue is of course to see the regulatory framework being stabilized. We talked about the UK as we spoke about the NOME Law in France. And to perhaps lift any possible uncertainties, I would like to confirm that no nuclear taxes on the agenda in France. I have received a letter and I would reply it in writing to the Minister in-charge who confirmed that there would be no nuclear tax levied on nuclear power output in our country.</p>
          <p>We've also devoted major efforts, as Herv&#xE9; Machenaud explained, on the recovery of the industrial performance of the nuclear power base and availability factor, generation capacity of the entire base. This is a key topic. We've made key to commitments on that. And we have now &#x2013; we are now on the way to full recovery and I am &#x2013; we'll soon be able to confirm our ability to improve the industrial performance of our existing asset base in the very, very short-term, i.e., over the next 3 to 4 years.</p>
          <p>Another one of our great ambitions is to continue to pursue the expansion of our group, particularly in nuclear power. Clearly in this respect, the expansion of nuclear power throughout the world is a topic that can only rouse enthusiasm within EDF naturally. And to support to our determination we believe that our feedback &#x2013; experience, feedback in our own history in nuclear industry will be a major asset for us throughout the world. This will naturally require major cooperation with all key players whether French or otherwise, hence the need to strengthen synergies, to converge efforts and to build common interest.</p>
          <p>Recent declaration by the French public authorities and the French President go in that direction and I am very pleased about that, and I am sure we'll have more opportunities to discuss it again in the future. Similarly day-after-day, we are building up our cooperation with key international players in the nuclear industry among others. And this is reason why we have build new cooperation agreements with other players, whether the Chinese.</p>
          <p>Now we've been working with them for the past 25 years. And we have renewed and strengthened our cooperation agreements with the Chinese authorities with a 50 years extension of CGPC and other competent Chinese authorities. Similarly we signed cooperation agreement with our Russian peers and we intent to continue to be a major player in international energy industry in close cooperation with French energy companies as well and in with full respect of the role as a lead player that has been entrusted to us.</p>
          <p>Nuclear power is not the exclusive issue of the agenda. We've also reinforced our ambition in hydro power, fossil-fired power as well as renewable energy sources. And there again we will have ample opportunities to discuss this subject again in the future, near future. We've also strengthened our ambitions in 2 other major sector of the groups' expertise, namely the networks on the one hand and again we've signed cooperation agreements for the operational management or participation in the management of networks in our &#x2013; the international markets in Russia in particular as well as down stream, of course, i.e. our expertise in the field of optimization, trading, this being under the leadership of Pierre Lederer. This is one of the groups' key expertise, fields of expertise that we will be developing internationally. And all of these topics will be addressed at the early 2011 meeting where you will be invited to give you a more, a better idea, a better insight of what EDF groups will look like over the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to mention our huge efforts devoted in the field of human resources. Indeed one of the key challenges facing the group is naturally the availability and in spite of the age pyramid that forces us to be lucid about the necessary renewal of our teams and skills. Half of our workforce working in the nuclear sector will be retiring over the next 10 years, a key challenge that we have taken over with much determination. We have developed decisive efforts and measures in developing, creating skills. The topic that <mark type="inaudible" /> and Jean-Louis Mathias are devoting much of their time and energy, a key essential topic for us, developing human resources.</p>
          <p>So this is basically what I wanted to share with you. Now all that's left to do is to open the floor for your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I work for Societe Generale. I have a first question to Thomas that has to do with taxes. Do we know what the impact is when the Taxe Professionnelle, the company tax is stopped? Is it positive or negative at the end of the day? I have another question or 2 questions rather concerning 2011 as well. What do you think is the market share that you're going to lose due to the NOME Law, that is, if you look at other suppliers? What do you think about this? How much of the market will you lose to start with?</p>
          <p>Second question, what about Georges Besse and the fact that it's going to stop because you are going to get the electricity that was sold to Areva, I suppose you don't want to go to Finland since we're talking about Areva, but what are you going to do there? Is it a 15% equity? Will you buy mines? Will you take 30%? What do you intend to do? What's the maximum amount that you would be willing to pay so that you would have a stake in the equity of Areva?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll start with the company tax called Taxe Professionnelle. Well, my answer is no, this Taxe Professionnelle no longer exists in France. It's been replaced by another tax but impact is zero, zero impact on our statements. As far as the other questions are concerned, I am not certain I am the best to answer this, that is the market share and how are market share's going to be impacted by the NOME Law or should we talk about &#x2013; should be one or &#x2013; well, I'll try and answer these questions. As far as the French law is concerned, the NOME Law is concerned and this is something I've said several times, our objective is not to have decreasing markets, but to lose market shares. Our object is to define the rules so that we would not be obliged to sell electricity generation at a price that would be below cost price.</p>
          <p>This is what we've always tried to do &#x2013; influence the course of events. This is quite normal. It's a normal ambition. This is what most companies do in the world. So if this is done, if our objective is met, then the next issue is to know how efficient we will be on a market where the rules will be stabilized. And I don't see any reasons why we would say we would lose market shares. If the operational conditions are the same, we will be able to prove that we are the most competitive company. And therefore I contend that we're going to increase our market share. That's the only answer I have to your question.</p>
          <p>Now the other questions you asked concerning Areva, I think it's too early to answer the questions. This is purely an industrial matter. It's exclusively an industrial topic. What we are fighting for, what our Group is fighting for is its competitivity, our ability to develop an industrial project in electricity and in nuclear electricity. To develop this industrial project, we need to meet all of the necessary conditions to be efficient, which means we have to have a good portfolio of products to live up to customer needs which is something essential and natural. And secondly, all the players on the market should have converging interests so that this business could gain market share so that we could conquer new positions in the new nuclear market in the world which is what we are currently working on. This is our ambition. This has always been our rationale.</p>
          <p>If your question was, which are the main players on this market? Well, you know what I want to do. My objective, which was recognized by the public authorities, is that I want people to recognize the fact that EDF has to be the leader, the coordinator, the lead player, because we have the experience, we have the expertise, we have developed the nuclear asset in France which is the world benchmark, the reference in the world.</p>
          <p>And our main asset is that we have this 40-year experience, the design and build experience in the nuclear sector. Therefore, we are the benchmark in the world. And we will coordinate with the other players in this sector that is Areva, but also other players so our cooperation with Areva has to be efficient and we have to see eye-to-eye with them. Our interests should more or less converge. If this means to take a stake in their equity, this is something we could contemplate, but it's too early today to say what we're going to do. We don't know what form this could take.</p>
          <p>In any case, should we contemplate this, we'll be totally open. We will always defend EDF's interests, and we will do this so as to preserve the interests of the Group, which is quite natural. Whenever there is an investment, the Group will do this, we'll receive the approval from the Board of Directors and the shareholders and we'll do this to meet all the needs of our shareholders, of course.</p>
          <p>And there was another question concerning GB I. As you know, well, I'm not going to give you all the particulars of Georges Besse I or V; it will be replaced by new unit called GB2, Georges Besse deux. The contract was signed by the Group in 2007. And in this contract, we had said that this plant should be decommissioned at the end of 2010 and the new plant should be commissioned at the beginning of 2013. And EDF has bought UTSs so that between 2010 and 2013, we would be in a good position.</p>
          <p>Today, we have met our contractual obligations. We will get two nuclear units as planned and the construction of the second unit is a bit late. There are current discussions by the way on this and Areva would be late in the building of this new plant. So that means that the old unit will still have to be up and therefore Areva needs to get electricity. And I think we would be able to recover one of the two units, and then the conditions of the availability of one of the two units is still something that is being discussed and this is what we're talking about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take a question that we've received before, an email question concerning the cost price of Flamanville the increase in the price or the cost, will this threaten the new nuclear business? Well, I have to answers to it. The first answer is that, it's &#x20AC;5 billion, that's the global expected cost. Therefore, Flamanville is still a unit that has a cost price which is to be compared with fossil fuel. Now, of course, the carbon situation would be different, but out analysis is such that Flamanville could still be compared with fossil fuel plants. The second answer I have is something that corresponds to what Herv&#xE9; said before. From the cost of Flamanville we should not deduct the cost of the new nuclear business. What Herv&#xE9; said before really shows that our objective is to build several of those plants and our Chairman and Herv&#xE9; has underscored this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, Benjamin Leyre from Exane. I have a few questions I would like to ask. First concerning, RTE, the possible transfer of 50%, could you tell us what the conditions would be or the value, is it a regulated asset basis or with a premium? And will you be forced to deconsolidate RTE or is it a choice that you made or choice made by the government? Question number two, could you tell us more about Constellation? Do you think there are more risks of Constellation exercising their put option? And thirdly, a question concerning the total economic cost of the nuclear business, could you tell us how you're going to calculate this and how the regulator can or cannot approve this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, the RTE, as I said before this is a project that we're currently studying. The value we have is the net book value. We don't know about the transfer value in the dedicated funds. This is a marginal issue because it will still be at a 100% in the group. However, it's important because the more valued it is, the better it is in terms of dedicated assets. But this is not the principal objective. The main objective is that of allocation of assets in dedicated funds. And therefore, it is important for us to have the RTE in this structure.</p>
          <p>So to answer your question, I'd say the valuation will be based on independent valuation or not but net book value is good. It's a good starting point. We know what the impact will be on the group. The second quarter concerning RTE, is there any constraint put upon us or is it a choice? Is it a choice we made or is it a decision made by the government? Of course by definition the government made the decision. The reason for this deconsolidation is that when part of RTE could be transferred in dedicated assets. And given the fact that, the weight of the stake in dedicated assets it could be legitimate for the government to have two seats on the supervisory board. Mechanically, this would lead to the deconsolidation of RTE in our accounts, even though we would have 100% of the cash flow, half of the cash flow dedicated to be fund and half allocated to the rest of the group.</p>
          <p>Concerning the put, Constellation's put, I have a number of questions I've received on this via email. By the way, Constellation is not in our debt. The 2 billion we have is an off balance sheet commitment. Let me tell you more about these negotiations, it was not there at the time but the situation is clear. At the time Constellation had problems with liquidity. I understand that today they no longer have problems with their liquidity. It's a partnership, Constellation confirmed the part that they want to continue this venture of Calvert Cliffs. They want to develop this project with us. And they like this partnership with EDF.</p>
          <p>And as I said before, our objective is to develop this project in the U.S. and to continue the development and to meet all the terms and conditions, so that this is completed. As far as the total economic cost is concerned, the law says that there will be a number of steps to be introduced and after the first step, there would be "speculative cost" that would justify the calculation of <mark type="inaudible" /> and we're currently discussing this with the regulator. And we've just about started. We've started discussing with the regulator and other bodies but it's too early to know today. These are issues that we're currently discussing.</p>

          <p>Emmanuel Turpin, Morgan Stanley. I have three questions to ask. I'll start with a question concerning tariffs which is normal. Could you tell us what you think about a possible tariff or price increase in August? Some say that in Europe and in France, since we have a slowdown, we would most certainly not have a price increase. Do you think that the government will do it or not which is summer tradition in France?</p>
          <p>Second question concerning your 2010 objectives. Your guidance has not changed even though the nuclear output has changed, going from 20 terawatt hours to a bracket between plus 15 to plus 25. And how could you possibly offset this decrease of 5 terawatt hours in the full year? And finally, could you tell us more about the capital expenditure program of the group for the three years to come and making a difference between France and the rest of the world? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer your first question. Well, of course as you might expect, I'm not going to answer your question. I'll just say that all traditions have to be respected despite of the slowdown or in spite of the slowdown or the economic situation. So, we are currently discussing this with the government. I have no right of course to unveil anything. I have no right to tell you anything about what I'll think about this when the conclusions are drawn. The government will define the tariffs, the price. This is something we're currently discussing. This is all I can say. There's nothing special, nothing exceptional, nothing to worry about.</p>
          <p>You have another question that you've asked concerning the 2010 target. You've said that the nuclear output could go from 15 to 25, the brackets has increased. Okay, but we're still within this bracket. During the first half we saw that. There is no reason why I should question these figures. Of course there are always ups and down but all in all this is the trend. This is what we expect. And I'm not certain I could add anything to this. There are always positive or upsides and downsides.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the capital expenditure program is concerned, I've read many things here and there, people have talked about this. In the annexed documents, you have the figures and you have an analysis of capital expenditure. I hope we can show you this slide now. David is going to try and help us. There we are. An analysis of capital expenditure and I would like to spend some time on this. This is not going to be an answer to your questions, sir not immediately. These are the figures for 2009, more than &#x20AC;12 billion, &#x20AC;12.3 billion in 2009.</p>
          <p>What I wanted to recall is the breakdown of capital expenditure: first, the regulated business 36% in dark blue. And the other business lines, 64%, which include development, 53% and maintenance 47%. The objective of this very simple slide is to show you that we can always choose how quickly we want to grow and develop.</p>
          <p>This is &#x2013; this situation that we will analyze so that we can analyze during autumn, as Chairman Proglio said, our trajectory for the mid-term &#x2013; our mid-term plans will be based on a number of factors as you know. And if we can give you our plans before the beginning of next year, we will do so. But as you know, there is still the NOME draft and the ARENH program which are key elements and this is probably the reason why we'll have to wait until the beginning of next year, so that we can tell you more about our mid-term view.</p>
          <p>But we wanted to give you this breakdown of our capital expenditure, so that you understand that as of 2011 we'll give you the mid-term view that is covering three or five years to come. We'll tell you more about development and our business model and our cash flow position. This is the mid-term view I have concerning capital expenditure.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more question regarding the value &#x2013; the work of the UK networks. Somebody calculated by dividing the corporate value removing the premium and did not reach the regulated asset value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me remind you that out of the overall value, we also have non-regulative assets. We calculated the premium based on regulated assets, removing the value of non-regulating assets from the proposed price, i.e. approximately &#xA3;500 million. That's for your own calculations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>J.P. Morgan. Three questions very briefly. Simple questions I hope. First one that the NOME law, there is one point I'd like to check from Mr. Lederer's presentation. Are you expecting for the calculation method and the evolution of the ARENH price over the 15 years of the mechanism, will be set in enforcement decrease before the laws this budget or would it take place later on? Second question, the lag time or rather the delay in the Flamanville startup. Does that have an impact on your calendar abroad particularly in the UK? Will you be prepared to start building a new plant in the UK even before the completion of Flamanville reactor? And lastly you have an improvement of 700 million in your working capital requirement largely because of the balance from Exeltium and if you deduct that from the 1 billion, could you detail that for me, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding, your question regarding the calculation of ARENH price. We're expecting for the enforcement decrease, the government decrease to specify the list of the various positions that are included in the NOME bill. Now remembering that the practical formalities to determine the ARENH price will have to be worked out, particularly the method that will be used for cash prices and future cost that are included in the NOME bill. That is one of the reason why the NOME bill includes a period of three years during which the ministries will be deciding after which the, CRE,. the French Energy Authorities will be applying the method that we will have determined in the mean time. So first the decree will come out and then the CRE energy authorities will of course come up with this own method to calculate cash cost and future costs that are used to determine the iron price regarding return on capital. We believe that the government degree should give the details on that.</p>
          <p>Answer regarding the UK or rather the UK new nuclear. I would say it as the Chairman that Flamanville will not have any other impact aside from an experience lessons to be learnt. There is no other conclusions to draw except that we can improve gradually the economic and industrial efficiency of the future units.</p>
          <p>Conversely the ongoing talks and negotiations underway that are led by <mark type="inaudible" /> with the British government regarding the operational conditions, economic conditions, particularly regarding negotiating a price cap on carbon prices. These will be key elements of course of the context for that decision to be made.</p>
          <p>So the one thing I can confirm is the support of public authorities the new government authorities to this nuclear project, that was confirmed, reasserted, repeatedly on repeated occasion. Again reflecting the determination of British authorities to implement and establish this nuclear program IER nuclear program as well.</p>
          <p>Now once economic conditions have been defined or simultaneously then we will undertake to implement the projects that are the relevant projects that have been largely announced already.</p>
          <p>And so regarding the working capital if you remove the Exeltium effect, there is a degradation of written capital requirements in the first half 2010 versus same period 2009 which we've explained by two elements, reversal of the trend on trading which required the increased margin cost.</p>
          <p>Second element is a factor of provision on the TaRTAM mechanism, I won't go into details but just to summarize the whole thing. In the first half the cost of the TaRTAM mechanism was higher than expected in the second half year, hence there is a change in the working capital.</p>
          <p>TaRTAM cost is approximately &#x20AC;400 million which had been provisioned of course and write off of this provision and new allocation, our provisions that explains largely the degradation of the working capital requirements.</p>
          <p>Another element of course has to do with optimization and trading business due to optimization measures taken in the market and changes in the market over the first half year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a question, an email question, regarding the guidance. What is the baseline if actual acquisitions and so on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've already given you some information in the first quarter. This is unchanged regarding contribution of acquisitions approximately &#x20AC;400 million. This is the 2009 base line readjusted for volatility lead to IAS 32. Just to give you more details perhaps I would say &#x20AC;18 billion i.e., 4.18% growth rate, i.e., in the middle of this 3.25% annual growth rate bracket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question <mark type="inaudible" /> Could we get back to RTE? Why would you be transferring only 50% and not more since it's improving your debt position and why you're not doing the same thing for the British distribution networks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's is several ways to reply already two key elements. Number one, as I said earlier our main target, main objective is to have good management of the portfolio of dedicated assets. This is something we need to do together and analyze with a group of experts the AVI and we need to discuss it as well with the Board's committee involved with this dedicated assets. We believe that 50% of RTE gives a <mark type="inaudible" /> way to that within the overall dedicated assets portfolio. This is why we use this assumption if we were to use 100% that might be a little bit much i.e., having such a significant line item of our dedicated asset allocated to RTE even though having between 10 to 20% of infrastructure on such a long term portfolio of asset is not absurd of course. This is a choice and not a charge we made with assets allocation. This is reason why we're using this assumption of 50% but it can change which is investigating this project this plan for time being.</p>
          <p>Now why did we &#x2013; are we not doing the same thing with the British networks? Using the same terminology, I used earlier, it seems to me that RTE is a choice business profile, that the income flows and so on and also because they have a specific governance system with a real management independence. We hold 100% of that company. RTE has its own governance system is particularly suitable for this plan and our goal is not to put all of our subsidiaries into dedicated assets but because of this specific features and governance and features of RTE this is why this plan is beneficial.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give us an update on the new concession contracts for the hydraulic dams?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you mean, give you an update?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is a lot of discussion, lot of headlines in the press, telling us that the concession contracts are being up for renewal for hydraulic dams?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> I don't really understand the question, because this concession contracts have a final definite term and at the end of the term of the contract, we naturally will try to renew the contract, it's perfectly natural, very legitimate and the update is very clear, very simple, we win or we lose them, but naturally we intend to win these new contract bids.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

          <p>Regarding capital gains, we own the disposal of the UK networks, will there by any capital gains? That is an email question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My answer is yes, but naturally it depends if the transaction is voted or not by the Board of Directors, it depends if also the authorities, European authorities and French authorities approve of it and if the answer is yes, and we do sell, yes, there will be a significant capital gain on that transaction. Questions?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Germany what is your key scenario regarding the nuclear tax? Could there be a swap or a change or could there be a tax without extended life or span of the nuclear plant. Second question are you more optimistic regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S. then in France, since you're having a provision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the nuclear tax in Germany, if it were to be confirmed based on our initial calculation, it would have a very significant impact on the profitability of <mark type="inaudible" /> we're coming up with figures estimates between approximately 500 million impact. And the comments that are being made on that or that can be made on that should be made first of all by <mark type="inaudible" />, the only thing I can say is that the consequences or impact will be obvious, if that nuclear tax were to be confirmed.</p>
          <p>Possibly tax deductible, we don't know any link, potential link with the expansion of the reactor life span all of that is uncertain. The one certainty is that, if we were to &#x2013; if there was to be a nuclear attack, that would lead to a question, within <mark type="inaudible" /> and government systems, question about adequacy between CapEx plans and the company's cash flow and so on; it sounds like self-evident, but it's important to remind it.</p>
          <p>Regarding fuel cells, are we more optimistic in Europe or in the U.S. let me get back to that, maybe I was unclear as to the reasons for the provisions made on U.S. investment. This provision should be analyzed based on the CapEx conditions in year 2009, and of our investment in Unistar. The risk has increased, so when you look at the value of this investments versus an increased risk than you can only conclude that there's a strong probability that we will have to depreciate and impair the value of maybe CENG's assets, probably impair the assets of Unistar; where we invested $600 million. And probably we'll need to provision some future risk and contingencies in the development since we want to continue the developments at Calvert Cliffs.</p>
          <p>Getting back to your question, the provision has nothing to do with difference of optimism of anticipation or pessimism. It is more linked within our assessment of the risk and the value of the investments made in 2009 and little bit earlier in Unistar.</p>
