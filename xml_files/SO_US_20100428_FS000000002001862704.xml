          <p>Thank you, Rachel, and welcome to Southern Company's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Call.  Joining me this afternoon are David Ratcliffe, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Southern Company; and Paul Bowers, Chief Financial Officer.  Let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements today in addition to providing historical information.  There are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, including those discussed in our Form 10-K and subsequent filings.  We'll also be including slides as part of today's conference call.  These slides provide details on the information that will be discussed in today's call.  In addition, these slides provide reconciliations for certain non-GAAP financial information that will be discussed on this call.</p>
          <p>You can access the slides on our Investor Relations website at www.SouthernCo.com if you want to follow along during the presentation.  Now at this time, I'll turn the call over to David Ratcliffe, Southern Company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Glen, and good afternoon, and thank all of you for joining us.  Our excellent first quarter results were significantly influenced by weather and the slow but steady economic recovery here in the Southeast.  On January the 11, we set a new winter system peak demand of 37,224 megawatts.  The average temperature across our service territory that day was 18 degrees.  This winter peak surpassed our 2009 summer peak of 36,505 megawatts.  As you know, our peak period on the Southern system normally occurs in the summer.  I'm pleased to note that our generation and transmission system performed extremely well during this period for our 4.4 million customers.</p>
          <p>Since our last Earnings Call in January, we've had some significant new developments related to our two new nuclear units under construction at Plant Vogtle.  In February, the Department of Energy announced that Georgia Power has been offered a conditional commitment for loan guarantees for the construction of units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle.  Both the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Georgia Legislature have been very supportive of our plans to build the nation's first new nuclear plant in more than three decades.  We believe that the administration's support for the nuclear energy is vital in helping meet our nation's future energy requirements.  Under the construction &#x2013; under the current DOE schedule, we have until mid May to accept the nonbinding conditional commitment.  Discussions are under way to secure a one month extension to the schedule, which will give us additional time for further due diligence.</p>
          <p>The loans are expected to cover approximately 3.4 billion or 70% of Georgia Power's eligible projected cost for Plant Vogtle.  It's important to note that the execution of the loan guarantees and actual borrowings will not occur before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues the combined construction and operating license for the project.  Although specific numbers cannot be determined yet, we expect the loans will save us approximately 15 to $20 million per year.  The loans will benefit our customers and the company through interest savings as well as providing approximately 3.4 billion of committed debt financing.  At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer, for a discussion of our financial highlights for the first quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.  As you mentioned, we're off to a good start this year.  In the first quarter of 2010, we reported $060 a share compared with $0.16 a share in the first quarter of 2009, or an increase of $0.44 a share.  The 2009 result includes a Mirant litigation settlement charge of $0.26 per share.  Excluding the 2009 Mirant charge, our earnings were $0.60 per share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2009, or an increase of $0.18 per share.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our first quarter numbers, compared with the first quarter of 2009.  First, the negative factors.  Non-fuel O&amp;M reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009.  Increased maintenance costs for our fossil hydro fleet, where 5 of our flagship units underwent scheduled maintenance in the first quarter of 2010 compared with one unit in the first quarter of 2009.  Total planned outage days in the first quarter of 2010 were 94 compared to 11 outage days in 2009 for these large units.</p>
          <p>At Southern Power, the expiration of contracts for 2 combined cycle units in Georgia reduced our earnings by $0.02 per share compared with the first quarter of 2009.  One of these units will be under contract beginning in June 2010, while the other unit will be sold into the spot and forward energy markets.  It's important to note, however, that 84% of Southern Power's generation is currently under long-term contract.  Finally, the increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the first quarter of 2010.  Colder than normal winter weather in the first quarter added $0.10 per share to our earnings for the period, compared with the first quarter of 2009.  The first quarter of this year was the third coldest in more than 100 years for the Southeast United States.  The average temperature was 5.4 degrees lower than the 15-year average, resulting in a 10.3% increase in total energy sales as compared with the first quarter of 2009.  Increased usage and better than expected economic activity, primarily in the industrial sector, added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2009.</p>
          <p>Other revenue effects in our traditional business added a total of $0.04 a share to our earnings in the first quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2009.  This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating companies.  Depreciation and amortization added $0.04 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the prior period.  This increase was driven primarily by amortization of excess costs of removal obligations at Georgia &#x2013; approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last year.</p>
          <p>Increased wholesale sales and transmission revenues in our traditional business added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.  Recognition of certain State of Georgia tax credits added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.  In conclusion, we had $0.08 of negative items compared with $0.26 of positive items, or a positive change of $0.18 per share over the first quarter of 2009, excluding the 2009 Mirant settlement charge.  So overall, our quarter came in at $0.60 per share.</p>
          <p>Before I discuss our earnings estimate for the second quarter, I'd like to update you on the economy, our dividend policy, and regulatory issues.  The improving economy saw industrial sales increase by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009.  Quarter over quarter, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 35.5%, transportation up 13.6%, and chemicals up 9.5%, as compared to the first quarter of 2009.  The increased consumption by the primary metals sector reflects an improved demand for rolled steel by the transportation sector and steel piping for gas and oil exploration.  In addition, the new ThyssenKrupp steel facility in Alabama has begun receiving steel slabs from Germany for processing.</p>
          <p>All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area are reporting stronger demand for their products.  Year-over-year production at Honda has doubled.  Hyundai has increased production by 65%, and Mercedes has increased output at its facility by one-third.  The Kia plant in West Georgia is now in full operation, whereas in the first quarter of 2009, it was still preparing to start up production.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009.  Building permits are up by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the same period last year.  This increased activity should influence new connects, which we believe have bottomed out at an annual rate of 24,000.  This activity combined with the fact that household creation in our service area is outpacing the U.S. by 40% and should result in positive customer growth for the future.</p>
          <p>As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining 0.3% on a weather normal basis in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009.  Customer growth in the commercial sector has seen a year-over-year decline, as many small businesses have closed their doors as a result of this recession.  The vacancy rate for offices of 22.6% has increased slightly from the year-ending 2009 rate of 21.5%, due in part to the opening of 3 new commercial high-rise buildings in Atlanta adding to an already oversupplied market for office space.</p>
          <p>On the positive side of commercial sales, electricity demand by data centers is up 6.9%, reflecting the decision to locate these businesses in the Southeast due to lower costs and reliable supplies of energy.  In addition, electricity consumption by hotels increased by 11.2%, which indicates that convention activity and business travel has begun to increase.</p>
          <p>In summary, the residential and commercial sectors are performing according to our forecast.  Sales to the industrial sector in the first quarter are ahead of plan.  However, it should be noted that a comparison to the first quarter of 2009 reflects a period in which industrial sales were experiencing a significant impact from the recession.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our dividend increase.  As you may have seen last week, we announced a 4% annual dividend increase effective with our second quarter dividend payment in June.  The dividend is now $0.455 per share on a quarterly basis and $1.82 per share annually.  This marks the 250th consecutive quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its common stockholders.  In fact, every year for the past 62 years, Southern Company has paid a quarterly dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter's dividend.  Our decision to raise the dividend this year reflects our confidence in the long-term future of our business.  While we are comfortable operating in the 75% payout range, our long-term objective remains to achieve a payout ratio at or below 70%.  Our dividend and our long-term earnings per share growth, coupled with the stable A credit rating, are key components of our overall value proposition.</p>
          <p>Finally, my last item addresses 2 system regulatory issues.  As you may know, Georgia Power's current 3-year rate settlement will expire on December 31 of this year.  Georgia Power will file a new rate case on July 1.  We expect a 6-month proceeding with a decision sometime in December.  As always, we will keep you updated on the progress of this important matter.</p>
          <p>In Mississippi, the Mississippi Public Service Commission is expected to issue an order by Monday on our proposal to construct a 582-megawatt coal gasification facility.  The commission has already approved the need for the additional capacity.  This decision concerns the type of generation that will be built to meet the need.  We will of course communicate that decision to you after receipt of the Commission's order.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010, our first quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.18 a share.  As we've discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather, and to a lesser extent, the gradual economic recovery we are seeing here in the Southeast.  We are, to be sure, off to a good start in 2010.  However, questions remain about the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery.  As you know, the majority of our earnings are derived in the warmer months during the second and third quarters.  Therefore, our guidance will remain at 2.30 to 2.36 per share.  Finally, our estimate for the second quarter is $0.56 per share.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'll turn the call back to David for his closing remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul.  As Paul outlined, we're off to a good start in 2010.  The economy has shown by sales to industrial customers it appears to be gaining strength and momentum.  While we're optimistic, we're still mindful that we're still in the early stages of this economic recovery.  In January, you may recall that we announced a strategic alliance between Southern Company and Ted Turner to pursue development of a renewable energy project in the United States.  Last month, Southern Turner partnership announced the Cimarron project, a 30-megawatt facility capable of supplying electricity to 9,000 homes.  That will be one of the nation's largest solar photovoltaic power plants.  The plant will be built by First Solar Incorporated and located in northern New Mexico.  The output from this facility will serve a 25-year power purchase agreement with Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association.</p>
          <p>The Cimarron project is an example of our entry into renewable energy projects which fit our overall business strategy and risk profile.  We will take a measured and disciplined approach to potential growth in this business while remaining true to the business model that we use in Southern Power.  That is, long-term contracts for output with credit-worthy counterparties.</p>
          <p>At this point, Paul and I are ready to take your questions, so Rachel, we'll now take the first question.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Your first question comes from Rudy Tolentino with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.  Actually it's Greg Gordon.  Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Greg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, two questions.  First is just &#x2013; and great quarter, guys, by the way.  It's good to see the economy is coming back.  What factors in the data that you see at the end of the first quarter are those that give you the most pause, in terms of not wanting to annualize the momentum you're seeing in sales until you actually see some traction going into the second and third quarter, in terms of earnings guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, I think &#x2013; this is David.  Paul can chime in.  I think from my perspective, we saw great results, as Paul indicated, from the primary metals sector, and associated with that, the transportation sector, which says this is part and parcel of the automotive rebuild and restock, if you will.</p>
          <p>What I want to see is continued expansion of that into the rest of the industrial customer base.  I'd like to see the typical industrial supplies to the residential portion of our customer base begin to gear up.  We think, as Paul said, that the residential situation has bottomed out, and we're back on a positive note.  We talked about a rate of 24,000 new connects.  That's a long way from where we were several years ago, a couple, 3 years ago.  So I'd like to see a little more strengthening across the entire industrial.</p>
          <p>I know that if we get the consumer reengaged in automobiles and housing, then obviously that industrial sector will follow.  We also know that the commercial sector typically is the last to go in and the last to come out.  So we would expect, as we've said, for it to continue to be fairly stagnant, even decline some more before we see it rebound, hopefully late this year, early next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, the only addition I'll make to that is when you look at the transportation segment, we saw an increase in production of over 73% across our automobile manufacturing facilities.  However, when you look at the industrial sales overall, we're still below the '08 peak period, and that's one of the items that we're really watching.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  One other question on the regulatory front: can you refresh our memory &#x2013; our memories on what the flexibility of the process is, in terms of &#x2013; I know that historically, you've had the ability to file for accounting orders instead of for base rate cases.  Do you still expect to go through a formal base rate making process here, or is there a possibility of a settlement?  And if so, at what point in the process does that become viable as we gear up to monitor your process and going through this rate making year, what are the milestones we need to look for, and what flexibility do you have in the process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, we will always &#x2013; and as we have in the past, we'll always file a traditional rate case.  We may also file for alternatives to that, such as an accounting order, but it's hard to say what the milestones will be.  Obviously when we file, there'll be a period of interrogatories and questions, and then they'll schedule public hearings.  I think when we get into public hearings probably in the September, October timeframe, that's when you ought to see what the mood is and the temperature is.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I was just wondering &#x2013; I may have missed this, I apologize.  But the drivers in Southern Power, it's a couple of cents in the quarter, but when you actually looked at the net income numbers, it was down very materially, percentage-wise.  Can you just help frame that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Jonathan, when you look at Southern Power as compared to last year, you have two units that, Southern Power that came off contract.  One of those units will not go back on contract until June, so you have a period where these two units are just uncovered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So this was kind of consistent with expectations?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then maybe I wonder if David might provide us some insights into what your expectations are regarding potential revival of the tripartite climate bill after recent events?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, my crystal ball's not any better than yours there.  I think obviously the dynamic in the Senate is pretty fluid, and you've read all the commentary.  I think the question is whether or not Lindsey Graham will reengage in the discussions.  And even if he does, remember, that's still a very steep hill to climb in a short period of time.  They've made significant progress in making what came out of the House much better, but we've said very clearly, at this point, this has all been very behind the scenes, discussions of concepts, and we haven't seen any legislative language.  And we've been clear as a company, as an industry that until we get the actual legislative language, which they had talked about releasing this week, as opposed &#x2013; but that was prior to the derailment they had over the weekend. Until we get that, it's awfully hard to get comfortable that we actually understand the specifics of what we think has been improved.  That means that it's going to be difficult to keep this on track in a short period of time.  I think they have something like 40 to 45 legislative days left.  They say they're going to try to do this and immigration.  Remember, this has to be scored through the OMB process, so it's got a long way to go, even if Lindsey does reengage.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Paul or David, to come back to Georgia Power, and the way 2010 is supposed to work, as I understand it, you have got the amortization that you can take out and then you have an ROE threshold as well, which I believe gets trued up at the end of the year.  So it appeared to me that in the first quarter you had the best of both worlds.  The amortization was taken out as well as the strong sales.  And I'm just wondering, as you look through the year, do we run into a situation where either you run into that ROE cap or you have to stop using the amortization deduction, given the strength we saw in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Ali, you have that opportunity, as last year if you recall, we had in the fourth quarter an adjustment that we didn't use all the opportunity on the COR or cost of removal amortization.  So you do have the potential of that for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  But it's fair to say if we were to annualize our Georgia Power run in the first quarter, that you probably would have been above that threshold, the ROE threshold?</p>

Remember, this year we have $216 million or $54 million per quarter that is amortized, and as you look at the stream of activity, one being the O&amp;M spend at each one of the companies, there is from plan, they're a little bit below plan on O&amp;M spend.  So when you true up O&amp;M spend, I can't make that assumption at all.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I see.  And one other question going back to Mississippi Power and the IGCC project.  Obviously we will get some clarity on that by early next week, but is your sense &#x2013; I mean, that is the Commission relatively favorably inclined to the IGCC option, based on the hearings and the feedback, et cetera?  Can you give us some color on how you think it's positioned there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is positioned extraordinarily well.  I think Anthony Topazi and the Mississippi Power team have done an outstanding job of a very thorough presentation of the opportunity it has, all the kind of benefits that you would want for this kind of project.  We think it is positioned very, very well.  The industrial customers and the co-ops are very supportive of going forward with the project.  So I don't know that there's anything else we can do, but as you know, this is a process of the 3 people who are Commissioners have to decide, and until they decide, there's not much way to predict.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.  A couple of questions, and once again, congrats on the good quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, can you provide a little bit of guidance, just year-over-year 2010 versus '09 expectation for consolidated O&amp;M costs?  And second, can you talk a little bit about what other rate actions you have coming up across your jurisdictions outside of Georgia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  When you look at O&amp;M, Michael, we have, as you recall in the January earnings presentation, the O&amp;M cost escalation would increase approximately 2.7% if you look at annual growth rate from '08, '09, and '10.  When you look at '09 to '10 and you see the amount of maintenance activity that we have within the system, it's approximately 12 to 13%.  It all depends on how you want to treat environmental O&amp;M.  But there's an escalation between '09 and '10 of that much.</p>
          <p>The other piece, as you recall in '09, we were focused on reducing O&amp;M significantly to manage, if you will, the activities of the business to ensure that we provide earnings streams that meets our guidance.  The other item that I will address is really that when you look at normal O&amp;M, go back to the escalation rate.  That's really the normal activity we have on a year-by-year basis of an escalation of 2.7%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So it strikes me that the year-over-year hike between '09 and '010 is much greater than the normal.  Just a little bit surprised, because when I look at the first quarter O&amp;M, to be blunt, we came in well above your expectation &#x2013; where you guys actually reported.  And I just wanted to know if we're missing a big picture trend, or is this just a quarterly fluctuation, not having as big of an increase as we would have thought?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add to what Paul said.  By definition, we made a conscious decision to move some of the maintenance that would normally have occurred in '09 into the first quarter of '10.  And what Paul is saying was we should be back on a more normal track of routine O&amp;M, so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other piece, Michael, is at Georgia Power, as you recall, we had a voluntary attrition program that also was enacted in 2009, so the benefits are now showing up in the first quarter as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Okay.  And can you address any potential rate filings or rate actions in the coming 12 months outside of Georgia?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the end of the year, you have the process within Alabama that starts the RSE, the rate stabilization and equalization filings; that will be at the end of the year.  You have the same going on in Mississippi with their PEP filing, and then you have cost filings at Gulf Power that are the normal process they go through every year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>$0.10 of it was because of the cold weather, so that would leave me 0.60 minus the $0.10 would be $0.50 cents, so that would be about a $0.20 &#x2013; 20% upside from the $0.42 that you were expecting for this quarter, if my math's correct.  Obviously you can't control weather.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of that, I guess, upside would be from the industrial production?  Because last quarter, it was down about 11.7%, industrial sales.  So I guess I'm just looking for some color in terms of if industrial production will hopefully, as the economy gets better, increase as you have seen a little bit with the numbers you've reported from the automobile industry, and the reengagement in the housing sector, what could that do to your earnings per share going forward?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or another way to phrase it is if you were down 11%, 11.7% last year, year-over-year, how is it this year?  I assume that the industrial sales are getting better.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, when you look at our industrial sales forecast for 2010, we said that the industrial sales will increase by 2.6%.  But if you compare that increase to 2008 actuals, that would show still a decline of 3% in overall sales.  So we're now seeing more positive sales growth in our industrial sector, but I want to be cautious about being too optimistic about that sustained growth.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon.  I just have &#x2013; can you give us &#x2013; give me more color in terms of your commercial sales, in terms of kilowatt sales?  You mention on the call that you &#x2013; that's the sector you still see some weakness.  Do you see that bottom out, or you see continual weakness going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Annie, if you recall, when we set the forecast for 2010, we said that the sales year-over-year would increase by .5% in our forecast.  If you weather-normalize the first quarter, we're down .3%, so relatively, we're on target to our forecast.  There are some sectors that are showing some improvement; however, there are the big sectors, if you will, in terms of the overall sales in the commercial sector that are still very weak.  One to point out, the grocery store segment is down 2.2% year-over-year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, when you look at the ROE for Georgia, remember you had the cost of removal account that was approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission with a 9.75 cap for them on the retail basis.  So that's what they earned in retail for the company last year, and then you add 110 basis points to that for the wholesale activity.  So roughly right at 11%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can you give us any flavor for &#x2013; I know that we're talking a little ways away on the upcoming rate case, but can you give us a sense as to what you'll be looking at, in terms of the potential I guess increase, or how we should think about the ROE going into that rate case?

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to really get into that discussion.  The Georgia folks are still working on the details of the filing, so I think we ought to wait until we actually make the filing.  When we make the filing, we probably will have a separate call just to go over the fundamentals of the filing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's great.  And then also, just has there been any change in the RTP outlook, or with this boost in industrial usage and all the other many factors that go into RTP, which is hard for us to &#x2013; at least hard for me to model, could you give us a sense if there is any change in that, or if you guys have pretty much got the same outlook as you had earlier?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, it's pretty much the same outlook.  As you recall, in January we said it would be relatively flat to a positive $0.01 for the year.  If you look at the first quarter, it's $0.002 on an earnings per share basis for the quarter.  And that's really driven by just increased usage.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the first quarter, Dan, we spent 1.1 billion, and it really is lumpy relative to the addition of new environmental projects coming online and the <mark type="audio gap" /> for Plant Vogtle as well.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that &#x2013; will it mostly be in the second and third quarters?  Is it somewhat seasonal due to the construction, or how should we think about that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, for the year, we're saying for Vogtle about $700 million for the year, and it really is just a timing question, that's not back-end loaded or summer loaded.  Projects associated with Kemper County, you'll see costs of about $341 million during the year.  You have projects associated with environmental controls that are close to $600 million for the year.  So it's really the timing.  First part of the year, January through April, you'll see the major capital expenditures around environmental, and then during the latter part of the year, you'll have the environmental CapEx spend.  Transmission and distribution is relatively spread throughout the year, except for the summer months.  That's when you do not want to mess, if you will, with the lines during our peak period of use.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at our slides, in the appendix we have an update of where we are relative to the capital that we've spent plus the financing of that capital.  We have gotten to, for debt financing, we have achieved roughly 1 &#x2013; $525 million so far this year on a basis of 1.6 billion that we'll need for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then, trying to get a little more color on the industrial, I think you mentioned that you have the Kia plant that wasn't in production last year that's now in full production and then the steel plant in Alabama.  How much of the additional industrial sales is related to those new facilities, as opposed to just increased demand from prior customers?  Do you have a sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, most of the demand is from our prior customers.  Kia, if you look at it on a quarter by quarter basis, it's a huge number, almost 426% increase year-over-year, so that tells you about the ramping up during the year until the fourth quarter when Kia came online.  But in general terms, those kilowatt-hours for those automobile manufacturing facilities are not real large in terms of total megawatts that we produce for the industrial sector.  The chemical sector, your pulp and papers group, and the steel group, are the primary drivers overall for us, in terms of our sales.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the last thing I was wondering, I just wanted to verify, I thought I heard you say that you did more maintenance in the first quarter on the fossil plants, that some things that maybe had been deferred in '09.  Has that pretty much caught up then?  Are you saying the maintenance going forward will pretty much be comparable to what we saw in '09 for the last quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, it will not be comparable to '09.  We are back on schedule in terms of our overall maintenance plan for the company, relative to our plants and our distribution and transmission activities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how should we think about, then, comparing 2010 to 2009 going forward?  Is what we saw in the first quarter similar to what we'll see going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, some of that is timing, but go back to the response we just had on O&amp;M spend.  When you look at our O&amp;M spend on an annualized basis over '09, it's going to be increasing by 13%.  Again, we're back on the average if you look at '08, '09, and '10 of 2.7% compounded annual average growth rate, if you take the '08 and compound it up 2.7%.  Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Couple of questions.  There's been more transactions done for various natural gas generation plants across the country.  And I believe you still have some money slotted for potential transactions, despite doing some recently.  Could you just give us an idea and update on your view on that &#x2013; those potential, that potential?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, we're always looking for a good deal.  And if we find one, we're willing to make an acquisition.  It has to meet our conservative criteria.  We won't buy something just to own an asset.  We want it backed by contracts with credit-worthy counterparties.  That's sort of our disciplined approach.  We maintain a pretty active radar screen, as you know, looking at opportunities, and we have made acquisitions in the past.  We're certainly willing to do that.  As you point out, I think we've budgeted money if and when we find the right opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The recent transactions, though, some of them don't have backing with contracts.  It sounds like to me that that's not even an area of interest that Southern would be willing to consider, even though those multiples seem to be fairly low.  Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be unusual for us to do that, very unusual.  I think we did make a swap of sorts with West Georgia asset purchase that didn't have backing, but we felt like it was a much better strategic play for us than just an outright acquisition like you're describing.  So it would be very unusual for us to make that kind of acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, let me add to that.  When you think about assets that are uncovered, the question immediately comes to the front, where can we place a contract with that asset pretty quickly?  That's one of our business drivers as we assess these assets.  The other, on the West Georgia, if you recall, we swapped down 2 uncovered assets in Florida for these assets in West Georgia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Just could you give some commentary on the derivative legislation that's shuffling through Congress?  And as a kind of an associated question, if there is a requirement for industrial users to post collateral for the customers in Georgia that do shop, could that potentially be a positive catalyst for Southern, or how would that play out for Southern Company generally, and even Southern Power?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, when you look at the industrial customers in Georgia, they do not shop, if you will, after they have one-time decision.  So the competitive platform is for the in-state utility suppliers to compete for loads over 900 KW, and once that decision is made, they are locked for that supplier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Do you have a view on how the derivative legislation will play out, and is there any potential impact if there is a requirement for customers to post collateral?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nathan, we have assessed that legislation, but it's been primarily from a focus of what it will do in our fuels market.  And posting any collateral associated with that, as you recall, we have through EEI been active to try to carve out that element, which we &#x2013; I think we have succeeded in carving that out and seeing the final language on this proposed legislation.  But I think everybody recognizes that we have these type transactions on an ongoing basis.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually, as it comes to your fuel situation, could you just give us an update on where you stand with coal inventories and what you see in the coal markets?  Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Nathan.  Currently, we're at 52 days of inventory for the system.  We were at a peak at the end of the year at 59 days, so the weather has benefited us in terms of coal burn.  As we look at the fuel markets, they have moved up in terms of overall price.  Some of that's driven by Central App for export markets, primarily for the met market, metallurgical coal.  So that is sustaining a higher price right now in the central Appalachian market.  And as you've seen, the gas markets continue to fluctuate in the 4 to $5 range.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys.  Real quick follow-up.  Someone asked and I wasn't sure I understand the answer.  How do you think about your earnings guidance sensitivity is to every percentage change in realized demand?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at 1%, it's roughly &#x2013; it depends on what sector.  Associated with the residential, commercial, and industrial.  When you look at industrial, the impact of 1% is roughly $0.02 earnings per share, and if you look at 1% for the residential commercial, it's significantly higher, around $0.04 per share.</p>

And as we said, we're comfortable we're off to a good start.  We think we can see some legs in the economy that we're optimistic about.  Look forward to another call with you on the Georgia rate case.  We'll also keep you informed about the decision with regard to Kemper County, and then we'll be back again with the second quarter call in July.  So thank you very much.</p>
