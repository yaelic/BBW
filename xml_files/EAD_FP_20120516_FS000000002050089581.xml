          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the EADS Q1 2012 Results Release Conference Call. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Hans Peter Ring and Philippe Balducchi. Please go ahead, gentlemen.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is EADS first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Hans Peter Ring, our CFO; and Harald Wilhelm, our future CFO, will be presenting our results and answering your questions.</p>
          <p>The call is planned to last about one hour. This includes Q&amp;A, which we will conduct after the initial presentation. This call is also webcast. You can access it via our homepage where we have set a special banner. Playback of this call will be accessible on the website, but there is no dedicated phone replay service.</p>
          <p>The supporting information package was e-mailed to you earlier this morning. It includes the slides which we'll now walk through and financial statements. Through this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The packages you received contain a Safe Harbor statement which applies to this call as well. You should read it carefully.</p>
          <p>And now, to Hans Peter Ring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Philippe, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this Q1 conference call. This will be my last call as a CFO as you all know. But let me assure you that for me, and I can also speak for Louis, it's business as usual for this Q1 call.</p>
          <p>It's early in the year and the management transition is looming large in an environment which has not changed so much since our last call and with our strong underlying business delivering good results, it should be no surprise that our outlook is almost unchanged. I feel very confident that the new management team will build on the strong momentum we have established. In fact, they have been part of it, so there should be a lot of continuity. My successor, Harald Wilhelm, is sitting next to me today. He will present the other section later on and will be available in the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>I think it is fair to say that this quarter results confirm that we are on track. EADS continues to grow in line with expectations. And despite challenges is fully focused on improving profitability. This is based on a somewhat stabilized, though still volatile, global GDP development, which is supporting passenger traffic growth and demand for commercial aircraft and helicopters. While fuel price is an ongoing concern for our customers, it additionally drives demand for our fuel-efficient equipment, and we expect stronger momentum in the following quarters. Deliveries of Airbus and Eurocopter are increasing as we ramp up production as planned, leading to a back loaded profile over the year.</p>
          <p>For a brief summary and look at the other divisions too, let's now go to page 4 of the presentation. Orders at Cassidian are encouraging. Despite flat European defense budgets, the order intake is solid and includes a roughly &#x20AC;400 million export sale from MBDA to India. Order momentum is also continuing at Astrium. We believe that our product and service mix is well aligned to the needs of the international markets. We are also seeing first contributions from our newly acquired businesses with an overall revenue contribution of more than &#x20AC;400 million during the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>In early April, Airbus began final assembly of the first A350 XWB airframe in line with the schedule as we said in March. The program remains very challenging as we progress towards the next milestone.</p>
          <p>Within the A380 program, Airbus has defined a permanent fix for the rib feet issue. This has led to additional charges treated at &#x2013; as a one-off in the quarter. Compared to the same period of last year, we have doubled our EBIT before one-off performance.</p>
          <p>During Q1, we have implemented close to &#x20AC;10 billion of new hedges at a favorable rate, enhancing stability of our future financial performance. At the same time, we have had to make considerable investment in production ramp up especially for our popular single aisle light aircraft. This, together with the phasing of deliveries, leads to a negative effect on cash flow during Q1. We continue to maintain a very prudent policy on cash and costs and anticipate a positive trend in cash for the full year.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to the specific financial highlights on page 5. In the first quarter of 2012, we have seen a revenue increase of 16% with more favorable phasing than in Q1 2011. The growth is driven primarily by increased activity across all divisions. Defense revenues are up by 18%. The EBIT before one-off doubled to &#x20AC;480 million.</p>
          <p>At Airbus it stands at around &#x20AC;320 million driven by higher volume, price improvement in A380, over compensating headwinds from hedge rate deterioration of matured hedges and higher R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter and Astrium also contributed to the increase at Group level while Cassidian EBIT before one-off was stable. The higher order intake compared to the first quarter of last year is mainly due to the A320neo order intake. It also includes an encouraging &#x20AC;1.8 billion order intake from Cassidian.</p>
          <p>Our order book remains strong at more than &#x20AC;520 million (sic) [&#x20AC;520 billion] and supports further growth. The Airbus commercial backlog has been reduced by a negative revaluation impact of around &#x20AC;13 billion, due to the deterioration of the U.S. dollar closing spot rate since the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>On slide 6 we can see the underlying performance of the business. The EBIT before one-off margin increased to 4.2% at Group level confirming our path towards improved profitability. At Airbus, the series program's profitability combined with A380 improvement drove the EBIT before one-off improvement, despite higher R&amp;D and maturing hedge rate deterioration compared to Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>Favorable mix in pricing at Eurocopter and Vizada contribution in Astrium had also contributed to Group EBIT before one-off improvement.</p>
          <p>Finally, EBIT before one-off also improved at headquarters, due to positive Group elimination and increased allocation of management fees to divisions.</p>
          <p>This quarter the dollar mismatch and balance sheet revaluation had a positive impact on our EBIT result of around &#x20AC;20 million. The A380 wing rib technical fix is now defined, the implementation of the retrofit fix will have a negative cost impact, which leads us to take an additional charge of &#x20AC;158 million, as a one-off to cover the repair costs of the 71 delivered aircraft at the end of March.</p>
          <p>Now up to slide 7. R&amp;D increased compared to last year, driven mainly by the development on the A350 XWB at Airbus. Following the start of the final assembly in April, capitalization of R&amp;D according to IAS 38 will start in the second quarter. The interest results deteriorated compared to 2011 level, mainly due to lower interest income, related to the lower gross cash level and a reduction of the average interest rate compared to last year. Meanwhile, the other financial result improved by &#x20AC;80 million year-on-year, important changes come from a revaluation impact of our FX options, and a less negative revaluation impact of U.S. dollar and British pound cash assets, compared to the year before. In Q1 2012, the closing spot rate deteriorated by $0.05, so $1.35 compared to $1.29 in December 2011, while the year before, the difference was $0.08. The tax rate for the year 2012 is expected to be slightly below 30%.</p>
          <p>On to the hedging portfolio, now on slide 8. During the first quarter of 2012, we again accelerated our hedge activity and implemented $9.9 billion of new hedges at an average rate of $1.32 per euro enhancing stability for the coming years. In the same period $4.8 billion of forward contracts matured at an average rate of $1.39 per euro. We have therefore managed to improve the average hedge rates of our hedge book throughout all years.</p>
          <p>The hedge book increased from $75.1 billion at the end of 2011 to $80.3 billion at the end of March 2012. The size of the hedge book and the volatility of the dollar allows us to be more ambitious in achieving attractive rates, and I guess the market has confirmed in the last few days, I would say, this philosophy. At the end of March, the mark-to-market of our hedge portfolio was negative at around &#x20AC;744 million before tax compared to a negative &#x20AC;2.4 billion at the end of December. This movement is driven by the evolution of the closing spot rate from $1.29 in December 2011 to $1.34 for March 2012.</p>
          <p>Up to the cash flow now on slide 9. Free cash flow for the quarter is negative at minus &#x20AC;1.2 billion. The improvement of the operational performance is weighed down by a deterioration of the working capital. This is mainly due to a strong increase of inventory, as we continue to ramp up production while deliveries are back loaded especially on A380. Customer financing generated cash of &#x20AC;65 million in the quarter as the lessor and banking market appetite continues to be active. The level of capital expenditure increased compared to last year mainly at Airbus and Eurocopter.</p>
          <p>Now, we will walk you through the performance by division in more detail, and Harald will start with Airbus on slide 11. Harald, please.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Hans Peter, and hello everybody. I'm very pleased to be joining you today for this call. Let me give you now the detail on Airbus. Airbus Commercial booked 100 gross orders for this quarter. Ten cancellations were registered in the same period. 131 aircraft were delivered in the quarter. The commercial backlog stands at 4,396 aircraft, providing significant volume uplift in the midterm across the product range. Market success for the A320neo continues with a commitment for 100 A320neo from new Airbus customer Norwegian, while AviancaTaca of Ecuador, Spirit Airlines in U.S. and Kuwait-based ALAFCO firmed up previous MOUs for both the A320neo and the A320 current engine option.</p>
          <p>In early April, Airbus began final assembly of the first A350 XWB airframe in line with the schedule. As we progress towards the next milestones, the program remains very challenging. During the first quarter of 2012, Airbus delivered four A380s, the same number as in Q1 of 2011. Airbus has been working with priority on a permanent solution for the wing bracket issue and is collaborating closely with A380 operators to respond to their operational needs. We have now come to a definition of the final retrofit fix, which is more complex than initially anticipated in March. We therefore updated the cost for the retrofit solution, leading to an additional charge of &#x20AC;158 million in Q1, which is now treated as a one-off since the anticipated retrofit cost goes beyond the recurring warranty levels. The implementation and production of the final fix will temporarily generate headwind on the year-on-year A380 EBIT improvement in 2012 and 2013 to account for non-recurring cost and delivery adjustment.</p>
          <p>Airbus is still targeting 30 A380 deliveries in 2012, which is becoming more challenging with a more back loaded delivery pattern. General discussions with customers are ongoing. However, this should not jeopardize the reaching of breakeven by the beginning of 2015, assuming 35 to 40 deliveries.</p>
          <p>In its Military segment, Airbus delivered four aircraft, while five new C295 were booked for Egypt and Kazakhstan resulting in a military backlog of 218 aircraft. Within the A400M program the initial type certification has been received from EASA at the end of April. The focus is on the timely delivery of the first customer aircraft contractually due in early 2013. The FSTA program achieved Introduction to Service milestone by the end of January. Meanwhile, the first aircraft made its service flight, signaling the start of the FSTA to the UK Royal Air Force.</p>
          <p>Up to slide 12 and a closer look at the segment numbers. Compared to a year ago, Airbus Commercial revenues benefited from favorable volume and pricing effect. Airbus Commercial EBIT before one-off also benefited from positive volume and pricing effect as well as improvement on 380 which were partially reduced by hedge rate deterioration of matured hedges of around &#x20AC;50 million and higher R&amp;D expenses, particular on the A350 XWB.</p>
          <p>At Airbus Military, revenues are in line with last year. Higher revenues on tanker and services activity were offset by lower A400M revenues. Airbus Military EBIT improved compared to Q1 2011, mainly due to a phasing of R&amp;D. Airbus continues to examine the implementation of the A330 production ramp up to the rate of 11 aircraft per month in Q2 2014, provided the emission trading scheme issue does not harm aircraft orders.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now, we come back to the other divisions, and we start with Eurocopter on slide 13. The commercial market momentum improved significantly, compared to last year, and the level of cancellations is back to a pre-crisis level. Underlying those signs of continuing recovery, in particular, in the U.S. civil market, Eurocopter received contracts and commitments for 191 helicopters at the 2012 Heli-Expo in Dallas. In addition, a range of new and enhanced helicopter products were unveiled, including the next generation of the EC130, for which 105 bookings were recorded during the Expo.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter revenues rose strongly, and EBIT more than doubled. The increases, compared to a year ago, are mainly due to a favorable mix from more Super Puma deliveries in Q1, and favorable pricing. The revenues include also a contribution from Vector Aerospace business consolidation.</p>
          <p>Further steps were made to expand international services in the quarter, with the inauguration of the new Dauphin flight simulator at the Eurocopter Southeast Asia subsidiary in Singapore, which has become the Asia-Pacific training and MRO hub for all Dauphin helicopters.</p>
          <p>Eurocopter is continuing challenging discussions with the German government on the future of the German part of its key defense programs, the outcome of which is still open.</p>
          <p>Up to Astrium now on slide 14, Astrium saw a second start &#x2013; sound start to the year, driven by solid operational performance. Revenues increased by 13% year-on-year. The rise is mainly related to the initial inclusion of the acquired Vizada group into the Astrium perimeter. The overall EBIT improvement, mainly due to Vizada and first benefits from the AGILE transformation program, was partly reduced by a higher R&amp;D investment relating to innovation.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Astrium successfully launched the Automated Transfer Vehicle, Edoardo Amaldi, also marking the 47th successful Ariane 5 launch in service &#x2013; in series. And if I'm not mistaken, we had another successful start this night. That's at least the message I was getting just before this meeting. The ATV build by Astrium performed a perfect automatic dock-on maneuver with the International Space Station.</p>
          <p>Order intake included two export contracts this quarter, a Russian order for two telecom satellites and a contract in Saudi Arabia for telecom services. In addition, Astrium was awarded an ESA contract to adapt the Ariane 5 launch vehicle to enable simultaneous launch of four Galileo satellites.</p>
          <p>The ESA Ministerial Council, due to take place in late 2012, is expected to provide clear perspective on the future direction of European space programs.</p>
          <p>Now up to Cassidian on slide 15. Despite flat European defense budgets, Cassidian generated a significant order intake, which includes an important Eurofighter sustainment contract of around &#x20AC;840 million, covering the support of the Eurofighter fleet over the next five years. Additionally, a sizeable missiles contract of around &#x20AC;400 million at our MBDA share of 37.5% was awarded in India.</p>
          <p>Compared to last year, Cassidian revenues rose 5%. The increase reflects a favorable phasing of Eurofighter deliveries. The EBIT is in line with last year. Positive volume effects from Eurofighter are offset by higher non-program related costs for globalization and transformation. Cassidian continues to maintain a high level of investment in next generation products and services. Through its transformation program, Cassidian is maintaining its focus on global growth, particularly in security.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Cassidian is finalizing with Rheinmetall their agreement to pursue the latter's Unmanned Aerial Systems activities together in a separate entity. Additionally, Cassidian announced the creation of a CyberSecurity entity, commencing 1 of July, 2012. Cassidian continues to monitor closely export opportunities for Eurofighter and ongoing developments in India and Switzerland.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our businesses &#x2013; other businesses on slide 16. Revenues increased compared to the 2011 level, mainly due to increased deliveries of CN235 military transport aircraft and slightly higher revenues in ATR. Despite the revenue increase, the other businesses EBIT for the quarter was weighed down by a negative mix effect at the EADS North America, and a temporary negative cost phasing at ATR in the first quarter. In March, the U.S. Army took delivery of the 2,000th &#x2013; 200th &#x2013; it would be good to 2,000th, but it's only the 200th, Lakota helicopter, the first production aircraft with the new Security and Support Battalion Mission Equipment Package.</p>
          <p>The backlog for other businesses now stands at &#x20AC;2.8 billion, order backlog of 218 aircrafts for ATR reflects strong demand for regional turboprops in the high fuel price environment. Sogerma's backlog has benefited from the increase in Airbus and ATR production rates.</p>
          <p>Now, I will comment on our guidance on slide 18. The first quarter achievements well confirm our outlook for the year. And we think it's too early to change guidance. That means for all items, apart from EPS before one-off, we confirmed the guidance given in March based on an assumption of &#x20AC;1 equals $1.35, for year-end closing spot rates.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Airbus should deliver around 570 commercial aircrafts, including 30 targeted A380 deliveries. Gross orders should be above the number of deliveries. EADS 2012 revenues should continue to grow well above 6%. Group EBIT, before one-off, should improve significantly, thanks to volume increases at Airbus and Eurocopter, better pricing at Airbus and A380 improvement finally, which we have said before.</p>
          <p>We expect with increased confidence that 2012 EBIT before one-off to be above &#x20AC;2.5 billion. As already said, based on Q1 achievements and an expected tax rate for the full year slightly below 30%, the EADS 2012 EPS before one-off should now be above &#x20AC;1.85, so 1 euro, 85, yeah, that's...</p>
          <p>Going forward, the reported EBIT and EPS performance of EADS will depend on the Group's ability to execute on its complex programs such as A400M, A380 and A350 XWB, in line with the commitments made to customers. Based on this EBIT guidance and the target delivery plan, EADS should continue to generate a positive free cash flow after customer financing and before acquisitions. As this is the most volatile item especially during uncertain microeconomic times, EADS will give a more precise guidance later in the year.</p>
          <p>By way of conclusion, we are pleased with the Q1 performance. We've built on the momentum established in 2011, and we are increasingly confident about our outlook for 2012. Our ongoing production ramp ups are on track, and we are benefiting from strengthening dollar to improve our hedge book for the years ahead.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we remain fully focused on our challenges, mainly relating the A350 program and the implementation of the A380 fix. And we will closely monitor the challenging discussions with the German government on our key defense programs, and here I'm talking particularly about Eurocopter.</p>
          <p>That concludes my last conference call. I think all together as a Management Team and Board, we &#x2013; all of our people achieved a lot, I particularly want to thank my whole Finance Team, supporting me over the last 10 years. In a way, they are the foundation and the secret of success.</p>
          <p>Certainly, many challenges remain for the next year's business environment strategy programs, program execution, not to forget covenants and so on. I am confident the new team and Harald, as our CFO, will manage them professionally and successfully.</p>
          <p>Thank you all. I enjoyed working in this very international market environment. Thank you particularly for your trust and for your patience over the many years, and sometimes difficult years, where I stretched it a little bit. Harald and I are now looking forward to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> One moment for the first question, please. And the first question is from Rupi Vig from Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yup, good morning everybody. It's Rupinder Vig here from Morgan Stanley. Hans Peter, perhaps given it's your last time, two questions for you. First one just around the A380, when do you expect to get certification for the permanent fix that you've now identified? And just leading on from that, can you give us an idea of how much of the install base now needs to have a permanent fix put in place? And what is the status there in terms of when will this happen, what are the timings around this, et cetera? And then second question just around the kind of working capital build up we saw in 1Q. Can you just give us an idea of what exactly this relates to? Is it specifically 380, 350? Just an idea of scale of what's happening there, please. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rupi for your questions, first of all. Now coming to the first one, I'm afraid I'm not yet at this point exhaustive on my answer and probably fully satisfactory for you. We have just within the last few days finalized the definition of the repair solution and the final fix for the A380 wing crack issue. This is now under discussion with certification authorities, as you may imagine, and we are conducting the necessary discussions with our customers. And only after that we will probably &#x2013; not probably, but certainly, give you more flavor on what it exactly means.</p>
          <p>From our point of view, we think this is the solution so we &#x2013; the Airbus teams are pretty sure that we have understood the root causes and that we have now defined something which is, I would say, the best way we can deal with that problem in, I would say, the context of our customer relationship. So this is going to take a couple of, I would say, more weeks until you will get a more technical briefing. And until then I do not want to disclose too many things. Obviously we know what we want to do. But again we need to get the feedback of the customers, and we need to get first feedback of IATA and then we can tell you when we expect the certification of that, first of all, and when we have the repair kits available for the final repair solution. And until then obviously we are dealing with the fleet based on what we've done so far, so if necessary, exchange brackets. So that's the current status, Rupi.</p>
          <p>On working capital, you've seen, indeed, we &#x2013; there is a sizeable deterioration. It's &#x2013; if we compare it in the quarters, it is linked to inventory increases. It is linked to phasing of the A400M cash profile to supplier payment phasing to some extent and also a little bit of CapEx increase, which you can read in the disclosure somewhere.</p>
          <p>If we start with the end of last year there are two &#x2013; there is one major issue which I mentioned in the speech, it is clearly inventories which are driving that. Inventories, which are linked to single-aisle ramp up. Inventories linked a little bit also to A330 and to A380 deliveries, which as I said before, are going to be back loaded into the year so there are number of issues which impact Q1. I mean we've seen these kind of fluctuations already in quarters in the last years from time to time, so it's not a total surprise, but obviously minus &#x20AC;1.2 billion is a significant number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Hans, could you just perhaps, if I could just follow up just on the first question. I mean, the charge you've taken, I'm assuming that still includes &#x2013; excludes, sorry, any potential conversation with customers, is that right to assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes what we are obliged to do under our contracts, which means to repair the wings, and then obviously, to deliver the ultimate solution to that, so it is linked to repair costs for the wings.</p>

          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you. The first question I had is I'm afraid, one third of the follow up on the A380, if you can help to scope out how you now see the rate of cost improvement on the A380 changing in 2012 and 2013, versus your original expectations, and I suppose what still gives you the confidence why you can reach breakeven in 2015, having now obviously, seeing things slip out a little bit?</p>
          <p>And the second question is &#x2013; I know, obviously, this is progress after the end of the first quarter, but how is the final assembly progressing so far on the A350 stereotactic test aircraft, if you can give us a discussion on issues you've run into, how smoothly it's going, your sense and your feeling over how that's progressing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Ben, since Harald is here, and since I said he's available for Q&amp;A, I can make my life a little bit easier, so Herald, I think, you probably could take both questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben, for the question. On 380, I mean, we've put aside the wing crack issue. We're making the progress as we scheduled. I mean, however, I mean, there is some interruption in cost by that. I mean, you could see that we had to take the rate down on a temporary basis from 2.7 to 2.3, will come back up again. And this is causing some headwind in terms of &#x2013; I mean to continuous cost improvement, and I mean there's also some cost, I mean, going with the design activities of the final repair solution. That's where we mean we're seeing there's some headwind on the year-on-year improvement in 2012.</p>
          <p>2013, I think it's too early to say at this stage. However, we need to work very closely. And this is a process which started with customers to find the embodiment of the final repair solution. And that's why we caution on the 2013 progress regarding year-on-year improvement. However, all in all, we consider that the bulk of this activity of the wing rib repair is a 2012, 2013 activity, and this should not jeopardize 2014 and 2015 progress. As we said in during the speech before, however, the 2015 breakeven is on the rate assumption of 35 to 40 aircraft.</p>
          <p>To your second question, A350 progress, on ES aesthetic aircraft in the fall. As you know, the sections came together in April, there &#x2013; including section 1521 and also the MPR section so now really fall activity could start. I think we're very pleased with the geometry of the aircraft, so the file process itself is working in line with expectation. However, the progress on all of the components on ES and also then on the subsequent aircraft to come on one, three and so forth, is very challenging as we said already in March and for sure, I mean, issues and problems encounter every day need to be managed down to stick to our schedule and our timeline. So it remains challenging. However, in your file process, I mean as you ask for that one, we're pretty comfortable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Maybe, if I could just one follow up on the A380, points on the cost side, will you be taking a further provision to account for the retrofit costs on the aircraft components that are in build at the moment or is that going to be absorbed just within the ongoing operational numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The provision of 158 refers to aircraft being delivered, 71 by the end of Q1 2012. And as long as margins are positive for aircrafts to be delivered in the future, we'll &#x2013; do not need to provide for the repair cost for aircrafts to come, i.e., that means that in the future for the aircrafts which will still be delivered with a retrofit solution to be embodied later on, we will need to provide for. So, this will be reported separately now as we went to the &#x2013; before one-off concept on the basis of the full year targeted deliveries of 30 aircraft. We could scope the impact, including the Q1 provisioning impact of 158 to be 260.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is still an increase until the end of the year for the 30 to be targeted deliveries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And will that be taken on a aircraft-by-aircraft basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Or do you think in Q2, you'll just recognize a charge that covers all of those 30 aircraft for the full year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Edward Stacey of Espiritu Santo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yeah. Two questions, please. First one is customer financing. I saw some comments on the newswires about the quality of your counter-parties and I just wondered if anything's changed in terms of especially whether you have to revalue anything that's on your balance sheet? And secondly, whether you're finding it more difficult as the year's gone on to sell down exposure? So any changes in the customer financing environment?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the full year free cash flow, you said the A380 delivery target for the year is very challenging. But you haven't said that the free cash flow positive is very challenging. So do I assume that you had built in enough buffer previously into your free cash flow expectations that you can absorb whatever cash flow implications the A380 might have? Are you still confident of positive cash flow for the year in spite of the A380?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are still confident at this point. But clearly, A380 as we now move into the next steps of &#x2013; first of all, discussion with customers, repairs, et cetera, will have to be followed up and is a cash flow item. In case the targeted deliveries would not be achieved, that is I think what we wanted to say. But based on these targeted deliveries, we are still confident that we will generate positive free cash flows.</p>
          <p>On the newswires comment, that was related not to customer financing. So I could say simply no, there is no impact on customer financing at this point. It was related &#x2013; my comment was related to cash management hedging, et cetera, where due to downgrade of financial institutions across the board, across all the countries, it has become more difficult in terms of dealing with banks, in terms of counter-party management. That was the comment.</p>
          <p>But as you have seen in the first quarter, customer financing is progressing well. I think we even generated a small amount of money in the first quarter, so it just demonstrates that the market is the market and is, I would say, delivering what we expect currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Tristan Sanson of Exane Paribas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, everyone. It's Tristan Sanson from Exane. Thank you for taking my questions. Sorry, I'm going to come back to the A380 again. I just wanted to understand in your press releases in Q &#x2013; you mentioned that the charge, your &#x20AC;158 million charge, it's booked as a one-off, as the anticipated retrofit cost is going beyond the recurring warranty levels. Does it mean that there's a part that is below the recurring warranty levels that is fixed on as a charge but as a recurring charge in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, this is obviously a question of definition, but the question of what is recurring and not, to some extent, obviously, depends on the magnitude of the issues, because there is recurring warranty provisioning every year, so we have issues on all our programs where we need to fix issues and things with our customers. So that usually does not have any press coverage, because it's business as usual. So this is a recurring theme, each and every year that we consume some of these warranty provisions, we add some of the warranty provisions, if there are new issues popping up. And then it is a question, obviously, can you deal in such an environment on a recurring basis with something like the wing rib issue? Until March, we thought, based on what we knew at that time, yes. Now, it has reached the point, and Harald gave you the number for the expected number for this year, it has reached a point where clearly, I think we cannot say that this is still part of the recurring warranty provisioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if we look at what has been booked as a charge now, &#x20AC;105 million in Q4, plus &#x20AC;158 million in Q1 is the total charge that has been booked, and there are no extra costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have a second one, if I may? Can you tell us &#x2013; I think you explained to us that airlines had a choice of opting either for having a repair directly managed at Airbus, or during the first maintenance events of the aircraft. Can you tell us what is a percentage of airline that have been opting for the repair at the first maintenance event in your backlog, and does it mean basically, if everybody asks for it to be managed by Airbus, that you are not delivering anything until certification of the fix has been made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's all. We will not &#x2013; sorry, but we will not comment on airline by airline, and hence on a percentage of what is done which way. In the six has been defined and decided at our end very recently. We were just starting, I mean the in-depth discussion with each and every airline in order to minimize I mean the constrained at airline level.</p>
          <p>I think it was clearly mentioned by Tom Enders that we regret for the issues of cost. So, I mean, we are working with maximum effort in order to bring solution in the most efficient fashion, I mean, to the respective customers. But this is a discussion airline by airline. Clearly the aircrafts which are on the ramp can be taken. But there needs to be a discussion when is the embodiment also of the repair solutions. So again, this is a case-by-case discussion which we now started, and also the discussion with the authority, they are, though, on top of that. So I think it's very recent what we say here today, and we will progress as we go throughout 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's no reason to expect a material change in your delivery rate compared to the first four months, until the fix is certified?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think, I don't know, but I understand the question correctly. But we continue to deliver airplanes as Harald said. So the airplanes on the ramp can be delivered, because they are certified and safe. So and so far, you should expect that we target to get the 30 aircraft delivered this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Very quick one, just on the confirmation on the wording on your breakeven target on the A380, you're still expecting the A380 to be breakeven over the full year of 2015 and excluding R&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This, we can confirm, yes.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Celine Fornaro of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning everyone. Two questions if I may. One, sorry really to continue on this subject, but I guess is on the A380. So, just to be clear, I mean the &#x20AC;150 million charge is for the 71 planes delivered, we should expect more recurring charges so not booked as one-off, for the 30 planes to be delivered in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And potentially &#x2013; no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Celine, if I interrupt you, we will continue to treat this issue throughout the year as a one-off issue. So, we will have to book more charges as we deliver airplanes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And so the magnitude could be a total of &#x20AC;260 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the full year 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on top of that, you &#x2013; we could see a kind of a deterioration or a slowdown on your cost improvement on the 380?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As there was mentioned before, temporarily, I mean to some of the interruptions in 2012 and some of the cost to design and fix &#x2013; and freeze the design of the final retrofit solution, yes, temporarily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that meaningful or most of the charges in this one-off by you will be booked?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a temporary headwind and cost of the design is a part of the EBIT. It's not in the one-off. So, in the one-off, we clearly report, I mean, the costs of the repair per aircraft, for the aircraft delivered and then for the remaining one, which then leads to the &#x20AC;260 million. So &#x20AC;260 million, if we deliver 30 aircraft at the end of the year, will be, I mean, the total cost of the repair, and the other costs in terms, I mean, development of the repair, and the temporary headwind is in the, say, in the normal EBIT.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when do you think you will be implementing the fix from the &#x2013; in the brand-new plane? Second half of this year? Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, again, first, we need to have, I mean, final confirmation with the IATA, we need to discuss it with customers, and so I mean where the implementation of final repair retrofit solution will commence towards the end of the year so rather for deliveries 2013, and then, I mean, very forward solution in terms, I mean, line fit solution is about the same timeframe but, I mean, due to the lead time of the program, this will come in into deliveries 2014.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my second question is actually on the performance of Eurocopter and Astrium which were better, probably had good performance in Q1, and I just want to know if there is &#x2013; these are good quarters, and the performance should be continued through the year? Or there is a timing issue of charges, or I don't know headwind on pricing coming in the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Eurocopter, we have had a very good first quarter, which is &#x2013; you cannot extrapolate so it's &#x2013; you do not expect to have the same level of, I would say, big improvement as we had in the first quarter. It comes mainly from the mix. We have delivered much more big &#x2013; of the big helicopters, better-margin products, obviously, which is not recurring throughout the year. And then so far in Eurocopter, you should expect that it's not recurring at this point. But Eurocopter still will obviously deliver at least the margins you would expect.</p>
          <p>We also have to keep in mind for Eurocopter we are investing heavily in new products and upgrades. So R&amp;D is still increasing in Eurocopter so you should keep this in mind as well.</p>
          <p>For Astrium, it's mainly Vizada, our bigger acquisition at least in the Service business of Astrium. So it shows that the acquisition start to contribute. We will see so into &#x2013; and not only Vizada, we will see so through the year, that we'll also have some, I would say, integration related costs which have hit the Vector acquisition in the first quarter, for example. Not significant numbers, but this is going to happen this year, so the integration of those activities into our different divisions. But globally I can say at this point, I do consider that all of the big acquisitions we've made last year are on track and are going to deliver what we have expected when we acquired them last year. So, so far, I think we are pleased with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans Peter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick confirmation on the A380, when you say you're 2015 breakeven, based on a production of 35 or 40 planes deliveries. What hedge rate or what FX rate spot, is this based on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This was, as you remember, around $1.30 at the time, so and that has not changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's a spot rate of $1.30?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, this is a scientific discussion, Celine, because obviously, we continue to hedge ourselves into 2015 now, so the question will be, will the hedges be above or below $1.30 throughout the next one or two years, and we have already a certain amount of hedges for 2015, so that's getting more sophisticated, but globally, when we gave this outlook, and is already some time ago, there was a big open exposure in 2015, where the assumption was indeed around $1.30.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Nick Cunningham of Agency Partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. And Hans Peter, I just want to say thank you for being so patient with us. Okay, right.</p>
          <p>First, I wanted to ask was looking at the cash outflow in the first quarter, the &#x20AC;1.3 billion, you attributed some of that to ramp up effects, but I think that's counterintuitive because my understanding was that ramp ups are cash positive because you receive PDPs ahead of delivery and certainly ahead of paying money out. So why is that cash negative? And the second question, which is really related is, are you carrying A380s in inventory, i.e., aircraft that you've built that are awaiting the fix, and will that continue to be the case through this year and through 2013 until you get the line fix in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean on the latter question that all depends now on our discussion with customers. What I can say for the first quarter, indeed, we had expected more deliveries in our plan for the first quarter. And it means some aircraft are, I would say, almost finished or finished at the end of Q1 and have not been delivered. But I mean it's &#x2013; A380 is a big airplane and there is a lot of value behind and if you have two or three airplanes, it already means something and there is no &#x2013; at least on this one, no offsetting element from PDPs.</p>
          <p>On the PDP side, we can say that the PDP stock has not changed a lot in the first quarter. So actually we are roughly flat, I would say, with a small increase. We have PDPs against ramp up to some extent, but what we've seen in the first quarter is with PDPs being roughly flat that indeed the inventory ramp up weighs on the cash flows.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. I understand. And just following up on the A380, clearly it is very lumpy when they're sort of $300 million units. Do you have enough visibility to know whether there will be any significant change in the, if you like, the stock of A380s that you'll be carrying quarter-to-quarter across the rest of this year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean, again, I think to some extent it depends on the negotiations and discussions we have with the airlines in the next few weeks, and the way we are going to accommodate their needs with, I would say, our obligation to fix it. And so far it's difficult to give you precise numbers over the quarters now. Obviously the target is to stick to the delivery dates as much as we can.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just a quick question, sort of comments from Bloomberg about Boeing commenting on predatory pricing of the neo. Beyond, they would say that, wouldn't they, do you have any further comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They must have a problem here because we would not confirm what you say. I think there is &#x2013; from their side probably, and again, we do not confirm it from our side. There is obviously some aggressive behavior. And if you look to the recent announcements, you can look where it comes from in terms of regions. So &#x2013; but there are no further comments. I mean, we made our comments time and again, and it has not changed. Everything we've contracted on the neo is above our pricing expectation so far, so that &#x2013; we remain firm on this and it has not changed until today.</p>

          <p>Our next question is from Joe Campbell of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Hans Peter, Harald, and for the first &#x2013; thank you Hans Peter Ring for all the help especially for the helpful attitude towards all of us in the investor community, and the approach wasn't just at the top but the whole team, and we are all very grateful for the terrific IR program at EADS, and we're going to miss you, and we wish you a wonderful life after being CFO. And Harald, congratulations. We look forward to working with you, and we know you'll follow in H.P.R.'s helpful tradition.</p>
          <p>I have two soft, easy questions for the end. [Laughter] The first is, with Harald living in Toulouse and Hans Peter having worked from Ottobrunn, can you help us understand how the merger of the EADS and Airbus CFO team is going to affect the teams and the people who work in the various Paris, Ottobrunn and Toulouse offices? And the second question is can you give us an update on what I call sell Alabama? And since I haven't heard any announcement, I'm not asking if you're going to do anything in Alabama. But what the issues are about the pros and cons and perhaps timing of whether you might do something in Alabama? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, thank you, Joe, for your kind introduction. I think there couldn't have been better closing question on this conference call, probably. So thank you again.</p>
          <p>On Alabama, I think, as you know, we know the folks in Alabama since now &#x2013; several years since our tanker experience. There are certainly contacts, we can confirm that, but not more than that today. So you will have to deal with this with the new management team clearly. So there is nothing I have to say at this point to this question.</p>
          <p>I think on integration, there is no one better suited than Harold probably to make a few comments, because he is going to be the one who is carrying out that over the next months, and probably one, two years. I think what I can say, it's well advanced and it's coming back also to my proposal to have now some kind of more &#x2013; and more institutionalized integration between Airbus and EADS. But Harald, I think you should probably give a little bit more of a flavor, what it means.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hans, and thanks, Joe, for the question. In fact, I mean, Hans, you pushed a lot for the idea of the integration, and I mean, thanks for giving me that great opportunity. I mean, I was part of that team, and I'm looking very much forward to take that team and now forward. What does it mean? Probably, there are as many curious people at your end as internally on what I'm going to say on that one, but &#x2013; so let me say, I mean, as you know, I'm taking the succession to Hans Peter on the EADS side, but at the same time, I remain Airbus CFO, which I hope is also good news for you guys in terms of proximity to the business.</p>
          <p>But that should not be limited to myself. I mean, this should extend to the team, and this basically means that we're going to combine the finance team on the EADS and on the Airbus side in the field, so what we're dealing, I mean, with the closing and the reporting and the planning to basically have one team doing both things, i.e., EADS and Airbus. And I think that's, for the teams, an exciting opportunity moving forward to work, either on the EADS perimeter where they didn't work before, or on the Airbus perimeter where they didn't work so much before. And at the end of the day I think all of that should help to increase transparency, speed and proximity to the business.</p>
