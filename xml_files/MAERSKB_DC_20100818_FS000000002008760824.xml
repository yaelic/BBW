          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Interim Management Report. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Group's CEO, Nils S. Andersen.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining in for this half-year teleconference. We are today here; Trond Westlie, our CFO; and myself, and I'm CEO of the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Group. We're of course pleased to present the results we're presenting today, first of all because we feel they are good results but also because we are &#x2013; we feel it's a very good reflection of two years of very hard work of our employees, that not only has given a good result in this first half but also the fact that we have turned our particular container business into a much more solid operating unit than it was before. We feel that all the cost improvements we made and improved customer satisfaction as well as improved systems and reliability of our network has really made the business a more robust business than it has been in the past. But welcome once again, and I also suggest we just start straight on.</p>
          <p>If you go to page two, we have the usual reservation on all forward-looking statements that we may come with today and therefore subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. So please read it before we proceed to page three.</p>
          <p>On page three, you'll see the highlights of the first half of 2001. Of course the first slide shows total profit in the first half of 2010 of US$2.5 billion. A result in the second quarter of 1.9 billion and already a turnaround to profit in the first quarter has given that result. It compares to a loss of 0.5 billion in the historic bad 2009. If you go one segment &#x2013; down, we see the segment results and here you can see that the swing is coming mainly from the container business. There is a swing from a loss of US$1 billion in the first half of last year to a plus of 1.2 in segment results. And that is of course what is really giving this tremendous turnaround of the business.</p>
          <p>But the other businesses are also performing well. We have a profit growth in APM Terminals as well. This is mainly due to sale of the shares in the Yantian Terminal in China, which was booked in the second quarter this year. We have also growth in the profits in the oil gas &#x2013; oil and gas business; I'll come back to that, but of course mainly driven by increased prices.</p>
          <p>Going back up again and to the right, we are giving an overview of the group's cash flow. And of course, the cash flow from operating activities has &#x2013; following the good improvement in the operational results has also resulted in a substantial increase in cash flow from operations. We did go into the crisis, as some of you will recall, with a very big order book. So our investment activities in 2009 and cash outflow for investments was &#x2013; were very substantial. This has improved quite a bit. It's not that we are not ordering and that we are not making investments, but we are just making less and hopefully more adjusted to future cash flows going forward. And the result is free cash flow from the group of 2.5 billion or little less than 2.5 billion in the first half year. So we are very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>We have some &#x2013; of course the driver of this is the container business, also the oil business. But it is also very important, as I said in the opening, to note that we have worked very, very intensively with our cost and competitiveness situation over the last couple of years. And without being very detailed and very well documented on it, if we have not improved our cost position in the container business, it is very likely that we would still be talking about a result very close to zero in the first half and not a significant profit. So the rates have gone up, but we've also had a lot of doings of our own.</p>
          <p>We have continued our work to reshuffle the portfolio. We did sell the shares in Sigma Enterprises, that is the technical version of selling shares in the Yantian Terminal. As was mentioned before, we also completed just after the quarter the sale of Norfolk Holdings to DFDS, where we are now a major shareholder with 31% shares. And we have entered into an agreement to sell Netto U.K. to Asda. We're not quire sure of course when we will complete, but based on the informal feedback we get from the U.K. authorities, it looks as if the earliest completion time will be the fourth quarter of 2010, and that's what we are aiming at, at the moment.</p>
          <p>So we turn the page and go to slide four and straight into the business unit that has given the main changes in the first half, the segment result improved from a loss of US$995 million to a profit of 1.2 billion, a very significant improvement. And looking &#x2013; if comparing to 2009, the rates are up 31% and volumes are up 11%. So, all the bases are working in our favor. Bunker prices are up 69% compared to the first half last year, but we managed to cut &#x2013; continue our trend of reducing bunker consumption. So we cut our consumption with 6% and the outcome is a very, very positive EBIT pr. FFE 64. It is absolutely in the high-end of what we have ever delivered, and they compare of course to, well, you can say an extremely unusual situation in 2009. So it's almost irrelevant, but obviously a negative figure.</p>
          <p>But in order to put the things in perspective, we've put in two &#x2013; or we've put in comparison to 2008 in the two graphs you see below. And if you check the graph to the left, you will see that the development in rates, which &#x2013; here the growth rate, so it's including bunker adjustment factor, in order not to have two very technical separations. But you will see that actually &#x2013; the rates in the first half of 2010 were actually below the rates in 2008. So even if we see a tremendous increase compared to the 2009 figures, we're still not back to the 2008 levels. If we adjust for increasing bunker prices &#x2013; or decreasing bunker prices compared to 2008, it gets a little bit closer but here you can say, at this point in time, we're probably cleaned for bunker price differences at the 2008 level, but the first half is still below. So it's not that the rates are moving through absolutely unusual territory. It just increases to against a very weak 2009 that are unusual. So 2009 was the exception, it is the message I'm trying to bring out.</p>
          <p>And also &#x2013; if we look at the volume developments, also here it's quite interesting to compare to 2009, of course the volumes are up 11%, but if put in the volume development or the volumes we had 2008, the development is actually much less significant. We have a small growth but it is nowhere near a double-digit figure. So the market is basically returning to 2008 volumes and rates, and the real key difference is that we hopefully build a more robust and much more competitive business than we had in the past. This also, I think, is worth pointing out in this connection that we are also seeing increased customer satisfaction. We've had issues with lag of containers. We've had issues with schedule reliability around Christmas last year when we &#x2013; when the whole unexpectedly for everybody exploded. But nevertheless, we are seeing customers increasing their satisfaction and we are also now distancing ourselves from the rest of the market in terms of reliability of our schedule. So, there are many things that we are happy with in the container business. We think we have a more robust business model than we had in the past.</p>
          <p>Going to APM terminals on page five, and the figures are of course looking at the segment result going up from 211 million to 528 million. Those reflect the extraordinary sales gain we had on the Yantian shares which I mentioned before, and the business as such hasn't been more competitive, but I will come to that.</p>
          <p>We had continued growth in volumes in the first half of 2010. The global market in our opinion grew at approximately 12%. We grew approximately 6%, which is less than the market. It's reflecting that we are pulling out of the terminals, but we are also &#x2013; and that cost us about 3%, minor terminals around the world, it's Oakland, it's Savannah and it's Kaohsiung in Taiwan. But we still are slightly below &#x2013; approximately 3% below our estimated global growth. It has a little bit to do with where we're active, with little bit less weight in Asia where the growth is in Kaohsiung business. It's quite strong. And then of course we should not forget that last year when the markets were tanking, we also did better than the market. So &#x2013; but this is just pointed out.</p>
          <p>The segment result for the terminal business was 231 million excluding sales gains and all the usual abnormals against the 204 million last year. The figures are a little bit changed compared to previous figures because we have included now the Container Inland Services in the terminal's figures. We did that also in the quarter. And if you look at the total, terminal's businesses are doing little bit better than last year and the CIS services are doing a little bit less well; so all in all a small progress in the figure.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA margin is going down a little bit and that is because of CIS. We are showing in the productivities the EBITDA development over the last few years and you'll see at an up-going trend from approximately 17.5% in 2007 first half increasing in 2008, '09 and now up to 25% in the first half this year. This is in line with our strategy and also gives an improved return of course as you see in the last bullet point. The return for the business, the productivities, excluding sales gains and so on, has gone up from last year 7.7% up to 9.9%. So, we are working our capital better than in the past.</p>
          <p>New is also that the trend in non-A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk or non-Maersk line. Customers is going up, the share is now 43% and it's actually grown with 18% compared to last year. So that's a positive development and that is of course also in line with the strategy to get every more arms-length between our terminals and our shipping activities. I have mentioned the sale of shares a couple of times, but we also have decided to make &#x2013; to lease out our Virginia Terminal to the Virginia Port Authorities from July 2010. They've taken over operations and the terminal is filling up. The situation there was that we had a super modern terminal, but capacity underutilized and that the Virginia Terminal was actually short of capacity. So we hope we made a win-win construction there that will impact our profitability going forward in a positive way.</p>
          <p>So that was what we had on APM terminals, and I'd suggest we go to next slide, which is Tankers, offshore and other shipping. Here the results are in line with last year, if you look at the headline results. Revenue a little bit up; EBITDA slightly up; sales gains a little bit up; but the net segment result is 7 million down on last year. The main things in this business segment is that we still have very, very low tanker rates. We see some &#x2013; few moments in gas upwards. We see a little bit of movement in the VLCCs at the moment going up as well, but it is coming from a very low level and we definitely need higher rates to be profitable in this segment.</p>
          <p>There is of course some uncertainty about the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and the general drilling situation following the Macondo BP accident. So far we are not seeing any effects of it, but of course if the drilling moratorium is extended or is going on for a long time or activity is reduced, that would mean that some of the rigs could be move to other areas and there could be pressure on rigs. So far it's more of a theoretical consideration, but we think it's worth just keeping an eye on that. We have good contract coverage both in our drilling but also in our supply vessel area. But here the spot markets are affected by quite a lot of supply, new vessels coming.</p>
          <p>We've taken some impairment losses on LNG ships and FPSOs, in total of US$155 million, when that actually doesn't really change the total picture in comparison to last year because last year we had a very significant write-down in the tanker business. So in the total, that's not a big change compared to last year. And we also completed, as I said before, the sale of Norfolkline, and we are now owning 31% of DFDS and that will in the future be accounted for as an associated company.</p>
          <p>Going &#x2013; just spending a few seconds on the situation down in the &#x2013; on the different business segments, in the left down corner of the slide, negative result in the underlying operational business or Maersk Tankers excluding the sales gains we had in the first quarter. Maersk Drilling, Maersk FPSO and Maersk LNG is down also a little bit compared to last year. This is mainly due to the FPSO business where we have quite a bit of repairs and maintenance going on, and of course are also investing quite heavily in a new vessel that needs to come on stream. Supply service, a little bit down, that is lower day rates. SVITZER, a little bit up, they had a very weak period last year.</p>
          <p>So going through slide seven, the oil and gas activities, of course the result is very positive. We warned already at the end of last year that we would have lower production this year than in 2009 and that has also come true, but of course the pricing has gone up. We are now having oil prices about 50% higher than in the first half of 2009. We have a positive impact of lower exploration cost. They're down 41% compared to last year, and this is mainly due &#x2013; affected mainly due to reversal of provisions and special circumstances in the drilling. We're actually having the same drilling program as normal, and therefore we also know for a fact that in the second half our drilling expenses or exploration expenses will go up, which is why we say that we will have a significant lower result in the second half than in the first half, also because we are closing a couple of fields down for the period for maintenance.</p>
          <p>You can see the share of production down in the bottom. Decline &#x2013; significant decline in Qatar that's because of the profit sharing model we have with Qatar Petroleum. We've I think tried to give as much transparency into this previously as well. Denmark oil, still a decline in production but actually this year we see quite a bit of &#x2013; quite a good sales of gas from Denmark, which is compensating the decline in the oil. The U.K. is up so far this first half year, which is partly because we had closedowns in the first half last year. So the oil business is doing quite well. We have six &#x2013; had six exploration and appraisal wells during the first half and we will have slightly more activity in the second half of the year. The acquisitions we mentioned a couple of times, so there is nothing new here, but we are still looking to invest in the oil sector as we've previously stated.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to give the word over to Trond for the &#x2013; sorry, one more, other segments. We have the other segments as well. Retail business, a very stable business; during the downturn we had record results last year and the good trend is continuing. In all fairness, I think it's fair to say that this business is focused very much on the Danish and Northern European markets. And here of course the development in consumer optimism is not great. So, we are very happy to see a small increase both in sales and EBITDA and segment results. In the Shipyards and other activities, we're seeing a return to positive. We have &#x2013; the shipyards reduced their losses and the Danske Bank is improving its result. On top of that, we're having a few gains from &#x2013; through sale of real estate, a positive contribution as well from other industries which are our service <mark type="inaudible" /> service &#x2013; oil service sector as well as training facilities are now <mark type="inaudible" /> operation. So, there is a little swing in this part of the business as well.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd pass the word to Trond who will tell us about the consolidated financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As Nils said, we're very satisfied with the results for this first half. As you can see on slide number nine, the &#x2013; our revenue in the first half year is 20 &#x2013; a bit more higher than US$27 billion, 20% over last year; and an EBITDA of 7.8 billion. That is as much as 84% over last year's numbers. Depreciation, amortization is very much based to the same impairment level and slightly up from last year due to the fact that we have a higher asset base in our balance sheet. Sales gains in the first half is 551, very much influenced by the 430 million gain on the Yantian transaction and some other minor transactions in other segments. That leaves us the earnings before interest and tax of $5,438 million, which is a very much more &#x2013; or basically 220% more than last year, and as we can see very much driven by the return to profit in the container business. Financial items, on the same level as last year, 623, and taxes increases from 1.6 in 2009 to 2.3 billion as a result of oil &#x2013; and &#x2013; the improved oil result, as a result of the oil prices coming up. That leaves us a profit and loss for the period of $2,523 million.</p>
          <p>Going then to the &#x2013; to slide number 10, on the additional consolidated financial information; our cash flow from operating activity is very close to the full-year number of 2009 at 4.4 billion. Included in that is the negative change in working capital from year-end of 600 million, and that is due to the increased activities and of course the revenue base as a result of the improved performance. Cash flow used for capital expenditure is short of 2 billion as a result of &#x2013; as Nils explained earlier, the &#x2013; no new orders coming in so far and just taking deliveries and in &#x2013; or going further on the commitments previously done.</p>
          <p>On the total assets and equities, not major changes, but relative to the Danish numbers that also present, it is a lot of translation differences due to the fact that the U.S. dollar has developed very sharply towards this Danish kroner during the year, and so you will see significant effects on the balance sheet in Danish kroners when you look at that. Key figures on the bottom; we're really very satisfied that we now can show a return on invested capital of 12.8% for the first half year and also that earnings per share is $547.</p>
          <p>Going then to slide number 11, expectations for 2010; for the second half the group container shipping and related activities are expected to post a positive net &#x2013; a positive result at the level that we see in the first half of 2010. We must say though that it is with significant uncertainty for especially the fourth quarter this year. On the oil and gas side, we expect that the second half is expected to be somewhat below of the first half year, primarily due to planned maintenance in Denmark and Great Britain but also as a result of exploration being much higher than the first half. That leaves us &#x2013; the overall expectation for the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Group are that the result for 2010 will exceed $4 billion. That expectations are based on the retention of the present level of freight rates, oil prices and US dollar exchange rate and are excluding the expected gain from the sale of Dansk Supermarked of approximately $700 million. And as I said, the outlook for 2010 is subject to considerable uncertainty, not least due to the development of the global economy, which is then driving of course the uncertainty of the fourth quarter, as I mentioned.</p>
          <p>And with that, I leave the summary to Nils.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you'd go to page 12, and we'll talk a little bit about the 2010 priorities and the way it's affecting what we deliver. We will of course through &#x2013; also in the remaining part of 2010 continue what we've been doing over the last couple of years, which is really focus on our cost reductions and simplification of processes. I must say, coming from &#x2013; partly from the outside, I've been astonished about the speed and the professional ways that these improvement projects have been undertaking by the employees throughout the group. And I think the &#x2013; really by going very actively into change processes, the organization has managed to create a very, very solid and very market-focused organization in a very short period of time. And I really can't compliment the team enough for that.</p>
          <p>Also of course, continued focus on customers and market are just very, very important. We do see the swings in the economy affecting us more and more short-term and that makes the necessity of being competitive and delivering the best possible product to our customers all the time ever more important. And I think we've come a long way in terms of improving reliability of the network and our systems, and our customers &#x2013; really work very hard with customers to find the right products and we will continue this direction. We think the reliability of our network can be improved further and we have quite big ambitions to get to really a very, very high level of reliability compared to the rest of the market.</p>
          <p>We also believe that the focus we have laid out for &#x2013; in the area of investments &#x2013; is the right one. We of course make sure that we keep capacities in place to grow the markets in &#x2013; basically in all our business units, but we will continue to focus on expanding our activities in oil and gas and the APM terminals. We're still looking for distressed assets and hopefully we'll find some, but of course the important thing is the direction where we want to go. And in line with that, we've today released an information that we will buy 50% of the new deepwater container facility that would be built in Santos in Brazil &#x2013; or is being constructed and will be a rather big terminal with more than 2 million TU capacity when it's fully operational. So, we are investing in this business. We are also of course keep the investments in additional acreage as well as the Jack Field in Gulf of Mexico. So, a lot of things are going on and we hope that we will be able to really get more activities in those focus areas.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to pass the word back to the operator and for hopefully having some good questions and even more hopefully providing some good answers. Thank you for listening.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Lars Heindorff from ABG is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, morning gentlemen, and congratulations for the numbers. Start off with the container activities. Looking at the volume and the rate development, it appears that your rate development sort of &#x2013; may be sort of broadly in line with most of your peers have reported, but your volumes are not up as much as most of the other have reported. Are you &#x2013; and also not what market is growing at the moment, are you losing market share to your competitors at the expense of pricing or what is going on right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the rate development is probably more or less parallel with the rest of the market. We're not &#x2013; we don't have transparency to that, but we're trying to get the right rates across the base and we feel that the market is following rather well. We're not sacrificing volume for higher rates, but we're simply trying to use the capacity as best as we can. We're sailing with very good capacity utilization. And I think maybe the situation is a little bit similar to terminals. We did actually take a better market share last year and I think it's correct that we are probably losing a little this year in some trays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the outlook that you gave and also some of your comments about the current outlook for the second half of the container division, you say that you expect that rates will remain at these levels that they are now. Does that mean that you do not expect to get through with some of the surcharges that you have already announced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have got our seasonal surcharges through as announced and we don't see any problems in getting the rates through. Of course the season surcharge will go away when the season ends, which is why we have to expect low rates in the fourth quarter, but we have no problems getting the rates through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then regarding the cost level, it appears to &#x2013; I mean, quite impressive margins also compared to some of the peers. And you also mentioned &#x2013; you had a comment about that you have been close to breakeven on this, if you haven't been doing the cost savings. How much more can you take out do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That &#x2013; it's very hard to say. We have cost saving programs not just in the container business, but across the group this year as well, and we do believe that there is probably for the group another 0.5 billion improvements to be made which will partly be of course not by cost increases and salary increases and so on. But we do believe there are cost savings to be made, not of course to the extent that we've seen in the last two years where we were really catching up, but we will keep our focus on improving competitiveness, and that means that we also have to keep a very close eye on cost going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last but not least, regarding your cash generation and particularly the development in your net working capital, which is a bit down, not unusual when you start to grow as much as you've been doing. Can you give us maybe an indication about what you expect going forward? And would we would be able to maintain net working capital at these levels or how does it look?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess as I just said, as a result of the increased activity level, it's obvious that it comes down to the increase of the working capital. And as &#x2013; and we also say, we're basically going to see as we expect here the level of activity on the container business basically in the same level as in the first half. And as a result of that, we don't expect any major increase in the working capital in the second half.</p>

          <p>Dan Togo from Handelsbanken is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, and also from me congrats with the strong results. I would like to hear, what do you use for direction of what is the right rate, because looking at the container business right now, you have a return on invested capital of 14%. If you just, I mean, push up rates even further, it could attract new capacity to the market and we end up in the same squeeze in, let's say, three or four years. So what are your thoughts here? You mentioned earlier, Nils, that the market was aiming for 2008, is that so to say the level you see where rates will level off again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that the rates have reached a reasonable level now and what was &#x2013; and that's also a level that has been quite usual in the past. What has been absolutely abnormal was 2009, but your question is how far can you push returns up before you attract new capacity. And I think the trick is really that you have to make more returns than the market on average. Then you can deliver more than the whack and invest. And hopefully people &#x2013; other people will be a little bit reluctant to invest. That's the theory of the textbooks, and I can't really add much to it. But what we are focusing on is really making sure that we are competitive, that we have focus on our customers, know what the market is doing, and really try to give a good and superior product at a competitive price. And if we succeed in doing that, we do believe that we can deliver over the cycle a return that exceeds our way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the cost side, the global market is currently squeezed for boxes right now. I guess you will also feel a squeeze here because part of your fleet of boxes is leased and chartered. Then how does that affect your cost base going forward and what is the composition of owned and leased boxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've not gone out in major lease arrangements because of the squeezed box situation. We are ordering containers, we're also leasing some, but the balance is not moving towards more leased containers and definitely not at unreasonable rates long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we would...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not something that will affect our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then on oil, I think you mentioned earlier this year &#x2013; when entering this year that the E&amp;P cost would be higher in '10 compared to '09. Now you're guiding for more or less a flat development. What has changed and where?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the one thing that has changed is the activity level in the Gulf because of the drilling moratorium. That means that things will be postponed. So that's probably the most significant change. The other drilling programs we have are going on more or less according to plan, maybe we step up somewhat in another &#x2013; couple of other areas because of the Gulf situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where have you stepped up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have quite a high activity level, if you look at the global development, also in the North Sea we're drilling quite actively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And a final question on Qatar, 15 million barrels two quarters in a row, is that the run rate or should we expect it to come a bit down during the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what &#x2013; I think the situation in second half will not be significantly different from where it is in the first half, but of course given the profit sharing model we have with Qatar Petroleum, over time we will see our share of production drop as we go into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One final question, just in June you saw your volumes drop month-over-month in the container business. Why do you explain that? Any particular market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say &#x2013; tell you exactly whether it was one area that had that effect, but we know that there was a little bit of slowness in shipping in general out of China, among others, in the electronic area towards Europe. So that's probably where it comes from, but I can't answer you that off the top of my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Finn Bjarke Petersen from Nordea is online with a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning gentlemen. My question is concerning the volume growth in Maersk Line. You mentioned that you believe that the numbers will be equal to 2008 going forward. Does that mean that we should expect volumes at the same levels of 2008 in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It wasn't really a very specific and precise guidance, but what we're trying to say is that we've seen 11% growth compared to 2009, where we hade the drop in the first quarter, and comparing to 2008, the growth is less. And we also believe that in the second half where the 2009 volumes were actually quite okay is that we will see less of a growth than we've seen in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the final question, you are flagging that fourth quarter this year we should be especially cautious. Could you elaborate a little bit about that warning, which is quite unusual for your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not meant sort of as a doomsayer warning. What we're trying to say is that we actually, because our customers have very little disability regarding their orders for the fourth quarter. We do have to, let's say, wait a few months until we have more clarity on what would go on there. What is clear is that we will come out of the peak season then the peak season charge will be removed. So, the rates will be lower in the fourth quarter than they are at present.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one final question on the volumes. On your slide four, you're showing that the June was quite a negative development relative to the previous quarters looking back to 2008. Are there any special reasons for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not beyond what I just said. There was &#x2013; that we did experience in June by the way quite a bit of problems with getting sufficient containers back to Asia. So, we had to use quite a lot of capacity on the backhaul to get into the Gulf and took less freight onboard for that reason. So that's probably the main impact. But the business did slow down in general in the second half of June. And as I said before, we had &#x2013; we saw in particular some slowness in the electronics area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that has continued into Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I can't remember.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Menno Sanderse from Morgan Stanley is online with the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, gentlemen. What a difference a month makes, clearly. First on cash generation and CapEx, you're at the end of the program that you've had &#x2013; or nearly at the end. You made 2.5 billion of free cash in the first half. Some of the assets are making better returns than you thought at beginning of the year. Have you given some thought about the next investment phase? And do you see new markets, either by business or geography, or do you continue to build scale in existing businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is, yes. At the moment, we see opportunities to grow in the businesses where we're active. We have a nice positive cash flow for the first half and we expect this to continue in the second half. But that's not a situation which we feel is actually unacceptable. We do feel that with reasonable rates and everything moving in a sensible direction that having a positive cash flow is good. It will allow us to reduce our debts and prepare ourselves for interesting opportunities if they arise. So, we don't have immediate plans to step-up dramatic investment activities or anything like that in going outside our core businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as I think about the right level of leverage, if there is such a thing, how much further down is it from where we are today, where you would be ready to do bigger things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are actually ready to do bigger things...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel a good and healthy balance sheet, and following the &#x2013; our entry into the bond markets that we had &#x2013; that we did last year, we feel we're well prepared if interesting opportunities come up. But we can go &#x2013; definitely reduce our debt level without coming into, you can say, an underleveraged situation. So, if our cash flow this year just goes straight into debt reduction, we wouldn't feel &#x2013; absolutely not feel uncomfortable with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very clear. And then you've got $400 million for 40% stake in China. You received &#xA3;800 million for your U.K. shops. Those seemed quite significant prices. Have those deals made you sit up and think, well, I need to sell more of these assets, if these are the prices, or no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these assets, and the same goes for Norfolkline, are things that we identified as strategically less interesting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; and the reason for that is, if I may elaborate a second, is that the &#x2013; in Yantian Terminal we had a 12% share of the equity and no influence on management. In the U.K., we've had a very low overall market share. Even in the discount sector we were not the strongest players. So, we felt this was &#x2013; it was good move to move that to Asda that had the muscle in the U.K.</p>
          <p>And Norfolkline, we were one of many small or medium-sized players in a non-consolidated rural market, and by growing together with DFDS we feel it's the leading player and we are a shareholder on that. So we feel it had strategic merits. It wasn't really sort of opportunities that came along with great prices, but of course the &#x2013; we feel that we've gotten reasonable prices for our assets, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But there are not any other strategic &#x2013; non-strategic business that you think could be sold?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not &#x2013; we're not on a selling trip at all, we'd rather buy...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...at the moment within our four areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And two smaller questions; first on Angola, North Sea and other discoveries, do you have any further detail on when you can update us on the commercial viability of all the discoveries that you have made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We hope that in the first quarter 2011, we'll be able to give more transparency on the U.K. and Angola situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then finally &#x2013; this is a tiny business obviously, but the depots that you moved towards the terminal business obviously didn't have a great first half, anything special going on there that...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I &#x2013; in all fairness, they've been managed by the container shipping business unit in &#x2013; or container business unit for the first half and in the past, and I think they have adjusted rates to what you call arm's length basis...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in connection with the transfer, but it's an interesting addition to APM Terminal's activities. The rates to Maersk line and other customers had been under pressure in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we need to do now is making sure we operate in the most efficient way and clean up the business so &#x2013; and then it will be &#x2013; we'll hopefully be back on improving results.</p>

          <p>Last questions come from Peter Rothausen from Danske Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Plans to take out the container capacity going into the slack season? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't have any plans. If the market deteriorates and we don't need all the capacity we have, we will definitely take some out. But at the moment, we don't have a lot of investments or capacity coming in during the slack season. We start taking delivery of our West Africa and the South America ships into March 2011, but that is after the slack season. So, we don't really expect to have any problems utilizing our tonnage. But if the market goes down, we don't really mind taking our ships, it's just adjusting costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second question, on the cash flow usage, you mentioned a bit that you'll use some proceeds to invest in the business. What are your considerations for hiking dividend or potentially buying back shares?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is something that we haven't discussed with the Board. We are generating a good cash flow, which is great, which all good businesses should do sometimes. But that doesn't sort of lead to a reaction now that we have to change the way we do business or do something radically different. The dividend is decided by the Board, but they will not &#x2013; definitely not decide on that &#x2013; or I assume not decide on that before early next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
