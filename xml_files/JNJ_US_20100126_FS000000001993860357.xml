      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson &amp; Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter of 2009. Joining me on the podium today are Bill Weldon, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson &amp; Johnson; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>A few logistics before we get into the details, the audio and visuals from this presentation are being made available to a broader audience via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the fourth quarter for the corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Bill Weldon will comment on the 2009 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. At the completion of Bill's remarks, Dominic Caruso will provide some additional commentary on the 2009 financial results and guidance for the full year of 2010. We will then open the floor to your questions. We will conclude our formal presentation at approximately 9:30, and following Q&amp;A with some final remarks by Bill will conclude the meeting around 10:00.</p>
          <p>Distributed with the copy of the press release that you just received is a schedule with actual revenues for major products and/or business franchises. For the listening audience, these are available on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website as is a copy of the press release.</p>
          <p>Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this presentation may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2008 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from any projections and any forward-looking statements made this morning. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the company or online.</p>
          <p>Last item, during the call non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These measures are reconciled to the GAAP measures and are available in the press release or on the Johnson &amp; Johnson website.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2009. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were $16.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, up 9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. On an operational basis, sales were 4.5% and currency had a positive impact of 4.5%.</p>
          <p>I'd like to point out that our 2009 results included a 53rd week. The J&amp;J fiscal calendar is based on four 13-week quarters, so every five or six years we have an additional week. Since this 53rd week occurs during a holiday period, we do not achieve a full week of revenue. We estimate that approximately half the operational growth in the quarter was due to the extra shipping days. While the 53rd week adds some additional days to sales, I should point out that it brings with it a full week's worth of operating costs. Therefore, the bottom line impact is negligible.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., sales increased 2.6%. Outside the U.S., our operational growth was 6.4%, while the effective currency exchange rates positively impacted our reported results by 9.2 points. The Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew 19% on an operational basis. Europe grew by 5.1% operationally, while the Asia-Pacific-Africa region grew 2.3% operationally.</p>
          <p>If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings on a reported basis were $2.2 billion and earnings per share were $0.79. That compares to $2.7 billion and $0.97 per share in the same period in 2008.</p>
          <p>Please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings information adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the footnote, fourth quarter results in both years exclude the after-tax net gain from several litigation matters. In addition, the fourth quarter 2009 results have been adjusted to exclude the after-tax impact of the restructuring charge, and fourth quarter 2008 results were adjusted to exclude the in-process research and development charge.</p>
          <p>Net earnings on an adjusted basis were $2.8 billion and earnings per share were $1.02, up 8.4% and</p>
          <p>8.5% respectively versus the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. Cost of goods sold at 32.1% of sales was 330 basis points higher than the same period in 2008. As we discussed last year, the 2008 results were favorably impacted by one-time items. In addition, the change in the mix of the business and certain charges related to the restructuring program that are not treated as special items contributed to the higher cost.</p>
          <p>Selling, marketing, and administrative expenses at 34% of sales were down 330 basis points versus last year. As noted, the fourth quarter of 2008 included investment spending. Also contributing to the favorability is cost management across the businesses.</p>
          <p>Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 13.4%, 50 basis points less than the fourth quarter of 2008 due to a change in the mix of the businesses and reductions in spending levels due in part to increased efficiency.</p>
          <p>Interest expense net of interest income of $81 million compares to $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net expense was due primarily to a lower interest rate on our cash balances. Other income net of other expense was $361 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $638 million in the same period last year. In both 2008 and 2009, this account includes the impact of net litigation matters. In addition in 2008, the resulting gain from the divestiture of the Professional Wound Care business was included in this account.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate excluding special items was 16.4% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 19.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Dominic will provide more commentary on taxes in his remarks.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the year of 2009, consolidated sales to customers for the full year of 2009 were $61.9 billion, a decrease of 2.9% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales declined operationally by 0.3% and currency had a negative impact of 2.6 points.</p>
          <p>On the consolidated statement of annual earnings, I'd first like to draw your attention to the boxed section where we have provided net income and earnings per share information excluding special items. In both years, the after-tax net litigation gains have been excluded. Additionally in 2009, the after-tax cost associated with the restructuring program has been excluded. In 2008, the charge for in-process research and development has also been excluded. With these adjustments, net earnings for the 12 months of 2009 of $12.9 billion were in line with 2008. Adjusted earnings per share of $4.63 were up 1.8% as compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting major products and/or business franchises. I'll now review fourth quarter highlights for our three business segments, beginning with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 of $4.2 billion increased 10.2% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 5.2% while currency positively impacted sales by five points. U.S. sales were up 3.4% while international sales grew 6.5% on an operational basis.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter of 2009, sales for the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritionals increased 4.2% on an operational basis compared to the same period in 2008, with U.S. sales up 5.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.2% on an operational basis. Growth was driven by analgesics and upper respiratory products due to a strong flu season as well as nutritional products, partially offset by lower sales of smoking cessation products.</p>
          <p>Our Skin Care business achieved operational sales growth of 8.1% in the fourth quarter of 2009, with sales in the U.S. up 10.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 6.7% on an operational basis. New launches drove growth of NEUTROGENA, AVEENO, and RoC products.</p>
          <p>Baby Care products were up 3.4% on an operational basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales in the U.S. were down 2.8% due to lower sales for BabyCenter.com. At the end of 2008, BabyCenter exited the online retail business while continuing to focus on online content. Sales outside the U.S. were up 5% operationally due to growth in hair care and baby wipes.</p>
          <p>Women's Health achieved operational sales growth of 5.2%. Sales in the U.S. were down 8.8%, primarily due to lower sales of external sanitary protection products. Sales outside the U.S. were up on an operational basis by 12.5%, primarily due to the acquisition of the Vania products.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Oral Care franchise were down 1.7% on an operational basis. In the U.S., sales were down 13% due to softness in the category, lower sales of toothbrushes, and the fourth quarter divestiture of certain products. Sales outside the U.S. increased 9.1% operationally, driven by strong growth of LISTERINE.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Wound Care/Other category were up 20% on an operational basis, primarily due to the acquisitions of two businesses in our Wellness and Prevention platform and the Vania/Poliv&#xE9; acquisition. Strong sales of PURELL also contributed to growth.</p>
          <p>That completes our review of the Consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceuticals segment. Worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter of $6 billion were up 5.4% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales were up 1.6%, with a positive currency impact of 3.8 points. Sales in the U.S. increased 2.7% while sales outside U.S. increased on an operational basis by 8%.</p>
          <p>Our results continue to be impacted by generic competition on some of our products, namely RISPERDAL Oral, TOPAMAX, and RAZADYNE. The marketing exclusivity for RISPERDAL expired in the U.S. at the end of June 2008, and there are generic competitors for RISPERDAL in most markets. The marketing exclusivity in the U.S. for TOPAMAX expired this past March, and multiple generics have entered the market while generic competitors for RAZADYNE entered the U.S. market in the latter half of 2008. The combined impact of these products has reduced the fourth quarter worldwide Pharmaceutical operational growth rate by approximately 14 points, with the U.S. impact estimated at 20 points and the impact outside the U.S. estimated at five points.</p>
          <p>Contributing to the double digit growth excluding generics were a number of core products, which I'll discuss in a moment, and importantly the new products introduced over the last two years: INTELENCE, NUCYNTA, PRILIGY, SIMPONI, STELARA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA.</p>
          <p>Now reviewing the major products; sales of REMICADE, a biologic approved for the treatment of a number of immune mediated inflammatory diseases, were up 28.4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, with sales growth in the U.S. at 12.8%. In the U.S., strong double-digit market growth was partially offset by lower market share due to new competitive entrants and additional indications for competitive products. Export sales to our customers for markets outside the U.S. were up 79.4%. And adjusting for the fluctuation in inventory levels, growth was estimated at 11%. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2008 sales were impacted by timing of shipments related to production scheduling due to maintenance.</p>
          <p>PROCRIT/EPREX declined operationally by 1.9% during the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year, with PROCRIT down 3.1%. The U.S. market declined slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year ago, while PROCRIT aggregate share across all markets of approximately 48% was down one point. Sales of EPREX were down 0.3% operationally. Market share stabilized. However, the market declined slightly.</p>
          <p>Sales of LEVAQUIN, our anti-infective, were up 9.8% on an operational basis when compared to the same period a year ago. Total prescription growth in the U.S. anti-infective market was estimated to be double digits in the quarter due to the strength of the flu season. Increased competition from generic products has impacted market share.</p>
          <p>RISPERDAL CONSTA, our long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone, achieved fourth quarter sales growth of 18.1% on an operational basis. U.S. sales growth was 13.7% with increased script share and market growth contributing to the results. Sales outside the U.S. were up 20% operationally, with double-digit sales growth in all the major regions and the launch earlier this year of RISPERDAL CONSTA in Japan.</p>
          <p>CONCERTA, our product for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, increased 33.4% operationally in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period last year. Double-digit market growth contributed to the sales results in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. were up approximately 31.2% on an operational basis with strong growth seen across the major regions.</p>
          <p>ACIPHEX as it's known in the US market and PARIET outside the U.S. is a proton pump inhibitor or PPI that we co-market with Eisai. On an operational basis, sales were up 8%, with U.S. sales up 12.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.7% operationally. In the U.S., dollar market share in the fourth quarter was up approximately 0.5 point.</p>
          <p>VELCADE, a treatment for multiple myeloma co-developed with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, continued to improve its market leadership position. Operational sales growth was strong at 26.5%, driven by the additional approval in 2008 for front-line therapy.</p>
          <p>PREZISTA, a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, grew operationally 86.5%, with the U.S. growth at 76% and sales outside the U.S. growing 98.7% on an operational basis. Expanded labeling to include treatment-naive patients contributed to the continued positive momentum in share.</p>
          <p>INVEGA, an atypical anti-psychotic, grew operationally 8.4%. Sales in the U.S. were up 2.9%, in line with market growth. Sales outside the U.S. grew 23.8% operationally, driven by steady progress in market share growth.</p>
          <p>Wrapping up the review of the Pharmaceuticals segment is an update on carisbamate. Results of a recently completed Phase III study evaluating carisbamate for the adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures failed to meet its primary endpoint. Based on the findings of this trial, we will not pursue an epilepsy indication. However, we will continue to study carisbamate for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</p>
          <p>I'll now review the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment sales of $6.3 billion grew 6.8% operationally as compared to the same period in 2008. Currency had a positive impact of 5%, resulting in total sales growth of 11.8%. Sales in the U.S. were up 9.1% while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 4.9%. Results have been impacted by lower sales of drug-eluting stents due to increased competition. Sales excluding the impact of lower sales of drug-eluting stents grew over 8% operationally.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the franchises, starting with Cordis; Cordis sales were down 3.2% operationally with U.S. sales up 1.7% and sales outside the U.S. down 5.8% operationally. Cordis results were impacted by lower sales of CYPHER, our sirolimus-eluting stent, partially offset by the solid growth in balloons and our Biosense Webster business. CYPHER sales were approximately $225 million, down 23% on an operational basis versus the prior year. Sales in the U.S. of approximately $55 million were down 20%.</p>
          <p>In comparison to the fourth quarter of 2008, the U.S. drug-eluting stent market is estimated to be down 11%. PCI procedures were down 11% while penetration rates were estimated at 77%, up from 73% a year ago.</p>
          <p>The estimated price for CYPHER in the U.S. is down approximately 4% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Estimated share in the U.S. of 12% was flat on a sequential basis and down three points from the fourth quarter of 2008 due to the increased competition.</p>
          <p>CYPHER sales outside the U.S. of approximately $170 million declined 24% operationally. The estimated market share in the quarter of 24% was down two points on a sequential basis and down seven points from the fourth quarter of 2008. The increased competition has impacted the share outside the U.S. CYPHER estimated worldwide share for the quarter was 20%, down one point sequentially and down five points from the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Biosense Webster, our electric physiology business, achieved 14% operational growth in the quarter, driven by the successful launch of CARTO 3 in the U.S. this quarter and launches in Europe and Canada earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>Our DePuy franchise had operational growth of 10.1% when compared to the same period of 2008, with the U.S. growing 11.3% and the business outside the U.S. growing by 8.3% operationally. Pressure on pricing continued as a result of the economic trends. However, positive mix due to continuing product innovation has mitigated much of the impact.</p>
          <p>Hip growth on a worldwide basis was approximately 12%, with the U.S. growth at 15% and the growth outside the U.S. at 9% operational. Our market share leadership position in the U.S. has widened during 2009.</p>
          <p>On an operational basis, worldwide knee growth was approximately 9% due to the strength of the underlying business complemented by the new product launches. U.S. growth for the quarter was 10%, and outside the U.S. growth was 7% operational.</p>
          <p>Spine achieved strong operational growth of approximately 9% due to the successful launch of a number of products, with the U.S. up 9% and sales outside the U.S. up 10% operationally.</p>
          <p>Mitek, our sports medicine business, grew approximately 15% operationally, fueled by new product launches. U.S. growth was 17% and the growth outside the U.S. was 12% operational.</p>
          <p>The diabetes franchise grew 8% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2009, with the U.S. business growing 13.8%. As we discussed last year, the fourth quarter 2008 results were impacted by an adjustment to sales rebate reserve. Excluding this adjustment, sales declined 2%, with the U.S. down 7% due to both lower volume and continued pressure on pricing. Outside the U.S., sales increased 2.9% operationally.</p>
          <p>Animas, our insulin pump business, grew nearly 20% on an operational basis due to new product launches and continued development of the international market.</p>
          <p>Ethicon worldwide sales grew operationally by 14.8%, with the U.S. up 26.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 7.5% operationally. The acquisitions of Mentor and Omrix, partially offset by the divestiture of the Professional Wound Care business, added approximately 7.5 points to the worldwide operational growth.</p>
          <p>Sutures, biosurgicals, and meshes made strong contributions to the results of this quarter.</p>
          <p>As an update on the Fibrin Pad, we have elected to move the targeted filing date to ensure a robust submission, and we believe that we will be in the position to file the BLA [Biologic License Application] sometime during the first half of 2010. The Fibrin Pad is a novel product that combines two biomaterials and two biologics, which we believe could significantly enhance patient care.</p>
          <p>Ethicon Endo-Surgery achieved operational growth of 7% in the fourth quarter of 2009, with the U.S. sales growing 3.3% and sales outside the U.S. growing on an operational basis by 10.5%. Strong results for both the endoscopy product and the HARMONIC scalpel were driven by the strong performance in markets outside the U.S. Additionally, the recently acquired EnSeal products from our acquisition of SurgRx contributed to the results.</p>
          <p>Ortho Clinical Diagnostics achieved operational growth of 6.9% in the fourth quarter. Sales growth in the U.S. was 4% while sales outside the U.S. were up 10.6% on an operational basis. The recently launched VITROS 5600 and 3600 made strong contributions to results this quarter. Additionally, conversion from manual testing to automated procedures drove sales results in our immunohematology business.</p>
          <p>Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment, Vision Care sales declined 2.6% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in the U.S. decreased 6.5% while sales outside the U.S. decreased 0.7% on an operational basis. The worldwide lens market is estimated to be flat to up slightly compared to the same period last year. Estimated fourth quarter worldwide market share based on prescriptions dispensed was the same versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>Despite the softness in the market, ACUVUE MOIST and ACUVUE OASYS for astigmatism achieved strong double-digit growth. Additionally, the introduction of 1-day ACUVUE TruEye in major markets in Europe made a strong contribution to results this quarter.</p>
          <p>That completes highlights for the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson &amp; Johnson's fourth quarter of 2009. I'll now turn the podium over to Bill Weldon. Bill?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Louise, and thank you all for being here today. I'm looking forward to speaking to you about our people's extraordinary achievements in one of the most difficult years in the company's history.</p>
          <p>Faced with significant patent expirations worth nearly $3 billion in sales, an increasingly competitive business environment on many fronts, and unprecedented economic pressures around the globe, our people delivered results that met or exceeded expectations for 2009. Despite a decline in sales which we had forecast, we grew our adjusted earnings per share by 1.8% and maintained our long-term management focus. We also made many important investments for growth and a number of restructuring decisions that have positioned us well for growth and continued leadership in the global healthcare market.</p>
          <p>As we begin 2010, our business is focused, energized, and well positioned to take on the leadership and growth opportunities before us. We built the foundation for a promising future for our patients, customers, our employees, and our investors, and here's a brief agenda of what I'll cover today.</p>
          <p>It's often useful to begin a review like this by looking at what we said we would do a year or two earlier and then asking what we've accomplished. When we met with this group in January of 2008, we looked ahead at the business challenges we would see over the next two years and we spoke about building our foundation for growth, and we discussed many of the steps we were taking to do that.</p>
          <p>We were in the midst of completing the restructuring of our Pharmaceuticals and Cordis businesses to deal with significant patent expirations and competitive pressures. Those restructurings were completed. We were completing the integration of the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare business with our Consumer and OTC businesses and looking ahead to further developing iconic brands like LISTERINE and ZYRTEC. These integrated consumer businesses are seeing solid performance.</p>
          <p>We were continuing to make investments in emerging markets including the traditional BRIC markets, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, as well as other fast growing developing markets like Mexico and Turkey.</p>
          <p>We continued to advance our pipeline of pharmaceutical and medical device products, with many of those we highlighted now in the market or nearing approval.</p>
          <p>We continued to identify white spaces in healthcare, investing in two acquisitions as cornerstones to our new Wellness and Prevention business.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, we've made eight major acquisitions since the beginning of 2008 and invested in several strategic licensing or collaboration agreements over that same period. These deals are complementary to our internal pipelines and bring us new capabilities to assess new growth opportunities and platforms.</p>
          <p>In January 2009, we spoke about further executing on these plans for leadership and growth in healthcare. Even as the economy presented everyone with new challenges, we have met important progress this year. Today our businesses are well positioned for growth and focused on expanding their leadership positions in healthcare. We're strengthening our core businesses and investing in launches of recently approved innovative products. Our investments in R&amp;D from the last several years are coming to fruition in exciting and meaningful ways. And in 2009, we invested another $7 billion in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>In addition to advancing our pipelines through internal development, we are also continuing to acquire, invest, and collaborate with other companies to generate new platforms for growth: Cougar Biotechnology in oncology, Acclarent for minimally invasive sinus surgery, Elan for Alzheimer's disease, Crucell for vaccines, Gilead Sciences for HIV therapies, and Mentor for aesthetic medicine.</p>
          <p>We're also continuing to expand our global presence, including building operations and expanding our reach in the BRIC countries and other fast growing developing markets. Our operational growth in the BRIC countries in 2009 was 5%. Excluding Russia and the impact of the severe economic issues that they had, our growth has been double digits.</p>
          <p>We are often playing a role in helping shape healthcare policy around the world given our broad perspective on the business of healthcare.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are continuing to attract and retain and develop our people, the talented individuals and teams who work every day to address the unmet needs of our patients and customers.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, our sales for 2009 declined by 2.9% but were essentially flat operationally, reflecting a loss of revenues from the patent expirations that were mentioned earlier. Our broad base of Consumer, Pharmaceutical, and Medical Device &amp; Diagnostics businesses performed well, even as we saw increased economic and competitive pressures throughout the year. Our adjusted earnings were $12.9 billion and adjusted EPS was $4.63, up 1.8%, which was a higher rate of growth in earnings due to our share repurchase program.</p>
          <p>We also generated a record free cash flow of approximately $14.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Last January, we set expectations for our financial results that reflected the difficult business and economic challenges we anticipated, including a forecast of the first reported sales decline for the company in 76 years. Our people took on these challenges and produced results that under these conditions were as impressive as any we have ever achieved. Thanks to their diligence, our results were in line with our guidance for sales and exceeded our guidance for both reported and operational earnings, as you can see here.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales by segment, Consumer generated approximately $15.8 billion in revenue or 26% of our total; Pharmaceuticals approximately $22.5 billion or 36% of our total. And MD&amp;D generated approximately $23.6 billion or 38% of our total, making it now our largest segment.</p>
          <p>Our Consumer Products business is the world's premier consumer health business. Its total sales grew 2% operationally despite the soft economy and a rise in private label competition during the year. Operational sales in our Skin Care, Women's Health, Oral Care, and Wound Care franchises all increased with growth in several product lines including LISTERINE, NEUTROGENA, AVEENO, and SPLENDA. Consumer also continued to increase its market presence outside the U.S. with brands from Dabao skin care products in China and Vania in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our Pharmaceuticals segment with sales of $22.5 billion represents the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical business and fourth largest biotech business. The segment saw an operational sales decline of 6.1% for the year, reflecting a loss of nearly $3 billion in sales due exclusively to the loss of RISPERDAL Oral and TOPAMAX. Excluding the impact of generic competition, pharmaceutical sales grew by 7%. We saw significant growth from some of our larger products, REMICADE, CONCERTA, and RISPERDAL CONSTA. In addition, we saw strong growth from newer products like PREZISTA, VELCADE, and INVEGA.</p>
          <p>Our Medical Device &amp; Diagnostics business is the largest medical technology business in the world with sales of $23.6 billion. Sales grew 4.2% operationally for the year. We achieved strong growth in four of our seven franchises while facing tough competition for drug-eluting stents and tighter out-of-pocket spending on products like contact lenses and diabetes test strips. Excluding lower sales of drug-eluting stents, our MD&amp;D business grew 6.5% operationally.</p>
          <p>Our growth franchises in MD&amp;D spanned a wider range of treatment categories: Ethicon's wound care products and biosurgicals; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's energy based surgical instruments and REALIZE adjustable gastric band; the DePuy orthopedic, spine, and Mitek sports medicine business; and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics products.</p>
          <p>In the other three MD&amp;D franchises, we saw significant growth in some of their specific products. For example, our Cordis business saw strong performance in cardiovascular products like balloons and catheters and its Biosense Webster business. Our Vision Care business saw significant growth in its ACUVUE OASYS and ACUVUE MOIST contact lenses. In Diabetes Care, our Animus business achieved very strong double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for 2009 excluding special items was $17.4 billion and 28.1% of sales. That is an increase from $17.3 billion or 27.1% in 2008, a year when operational sales were essentially flat. This 100 basis points increase can be attributed to the excellent job our leadership team did in managing their businesses and in containing costs during the year, even as they stayed committed to investing in key products opportunities for the future. In fact, all three segments increased their operating profit as a percent to sales in 2009.</p>
          <p>This slide on our constant performance looks different this year. We extended our track record of adjusted earnings increases to 26 years and we have 47 consecutive years of dividend increases. But as I mentioned earlier, we did not continue our run of 76 consecutive years with reported sales growth due exclusively to two major patent expirations.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, last year's overall performance in this environment speaks to the character of our leaders and our disciplined management approach. We have always taken a long-term view of our business, and we would not take short-term actions just to continue a record of consecutive years of sales growth. We faced difficult choices, made prudent decisions, and relied on our people to deliver the results we forecast while positioning ourselves for the future.</p>
          <p>With this approach and by staying focused on scientific innovation, we have built enduring market leadership. In fact, 70% of our sales are from products with number one or number two global market share positions. And approximately a quarter of our sales last year came from new products that were introduced in the last five years.</p>
          <p>More importantly, we look forward to returning to operating sales growth again this quarter, building off the momentum reflected in today's quarterly results. We also look forward to continuing our strong financial performance in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we delivered a total shareholder return of 11.3%. This was a strong performance but it was a lower rate of return for one year than other companies and the company indices we compete against. However, when you look at the last two or three years, we outperformed the Dow Jones industrial average, S&amp;P 500, and other drug and healthcare indices. This reflects the fact that we performed very well and held more of our value during the large market downturn. Over the long term, we have continued to consistently outperform most stock indices in terms of total shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>I'd like to spend the rest of my time talking to you about how we view the future of the healthcare market and why Johnson &amp; Johnson is well positioned to remain the industry leader. The people of Johnson &amp; Johnson strive to improve the health and well being of men, women, and children around the world. This gives us a deeply held purpose to what we do every day. The world's need for affordable, quality healthcare makes this a compelling and growing market. And history shows that as most nations' GDPs and economies expand, so does their spending on healthcare.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to a current view of the global healthcare market and growth projections. The global healthcare market is expected to grow about 5% per year over the next five years, becoming nearly $7 trillion by 2014. This is a huge market opportunity, growing at a modest but respectable rate.</p>
          <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's broad base of businesses participate in about one-third of the overall market. We're focused on some of the fastest-growing segments of healthcare. In fact, those where we compete are growing as fast or faster than the overall industry growth of 5%.</p>
          <p>We are always looking for opportunities to enter new strategic areas like wellness and prevention, which can complement our strengths. Meanwhile, our decentralized management approach allows us to act quickly and responsively to specific market opportunities.</p>
          <p>As we put 2009 behind us, it's important to note that we are in significantly better shape than the rest of the industry when it comes to patent expirations moving forward. For the industry itself, the five-year period ending 2009 totaled approximately $85 billion of annual revenue loss due to patent expirations. We represented about 10% of that total impact with RISPERDAL Oral, TOPAMAX, and a few of our other products that lost exclusivity.</p>
          <p>Over the next five years from 2010 to 2014, this cumulative loss goes from 85 billion to over $200 billion. Although we will still see additional patent expirations in our business, we estimate our share of the industry impact will only be about 4%, much less than our share over the last five years.</p>
          <p>Today in the world's population approaching 7 billion people, a significant number of people still lack access to adequate affordable healthcare coverage. Many nations are moving to increase the access their citizens have to healthcare. And while progress has been made, sizable opportunities still exist. For example, in the last five years private medical insurance in Brazil has increased by 60%, but that still only covers 30% of the population. In India, the covered population is expected to double to 220 million by 2015. And in China, a nation with more than 1.3 billion people, coverage is expected to grow from 75% today to 85% by 2012, and universal coverage is planned by 2020. Similar pushes for greater access are occurring in other emerging markets like Mexico, Russia, Turkey, and elsewhere. Increased access to quality healthcare means more patients, more investment, and more opportunity for innovation and growth.</p>
          <p>Increasing access is also an important issue in the United States, and I'd like to offer the following perspectives on healthcare reform. First, given the Senate election results in Massachusetts and other factors, healthcare reform in the U.S. is obviously a moving target. And while there could be additional costs to our industry as a result of proposed reforms, there could also be an increased access and opportunities for healthcare leaders like Johnson &amp; Johnson to bring new, innovative products and solutions to more patients and customers. We need to stay cautious, however, about how any expansions would be paid for and about how quickly new patients would receive access. These are significant factors and their potential impact to our industry should not be dismissed as inconsequential.</p>
          <p>As you know at this point, we don't know what shape healthcare reform legislation will take. We know that Congress is looking at several different approaches in taking it forward. We will continue to assess it as we go along and keep you informed.</p>
          <p>While I am mindful of the significant impact on our industry, I remain steadfast in my belief that there is no better business to be in. The differences we can make in people's lives, the opportunity for meaningful innovations that can benefit society, and the value we can bring to our shareholders remains a powerful motivator for all of us at Johnson &amp; Johnson. We will continue to monitor the legislative process closely and update you on any significant impacts to our company if legislation is passed.</p>
          <p>As 2010 begins, there are some business and economic headwinds that our industry must manage through; for example, persistent changes that have been seen in some consumer spending habits as more people move to private-label goods. People's willingness to undergo elective surgery or make out-of-pocket expenditures for medical products like contact lenses or diabetes test strips also remains negatively impacted. The economic downturn continues to put pressure on hospital budgets, while the numbers of Americans still unemployed constrains their access to healthcare. And the pace and cost of innovation continues to be affected by increased regulatory scrutiny. Larger, more costly clinical trials and the increased complexity of the approval process are all key factors.</p>
          <p>At the same time, there are hopeful signs of recovery and tailwinds that may benefit our industry. According to IMS data, there appears to be resiliency in prescription drug growth. According to other reports, global R&amp;D investment is expected to grow about 4% in 2010. This indicates an ongoing commitment to innovation and bodes well for new products and potential partnerships that can spur new growth. Strong companies like ours have ready access to capital markets to help fund growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, Johnson &amp; Johnson's expertise and business strategies are aligned with many of the trends that are evolving in healthcare. From personalized medicine and comparative effectiveness to the increased use of companion diagnostics and biomarkers, Johnson &amp; Johnson is taking a leadership role in shaping this future.</p>
          <p>We considered the evolving global environment as we planned our business restructuring last year. We felt that such changes, even difficult ones involving our employees, would be essential for the sustainable growth of the enterprise. We worked to streamline our operations as increasing our efficiency and freeing up resources. In turn, this has allowed us to invest in long-term growth platforms and new product launches. Our work to implement these restructuring plans began shortly after our announcement in November and is continuing in accordance with the required consultation procedures in each market.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we will remain focused on executing and investing for growth in the context of our consistent strategic framework. We plan to capitalize on our key growth assets, our people, products, pipelines, and global presence. But the foundation of Johnson &amp; Johnson's business is a fundamental commitment to our credo which was established in 1943 and provides a common set of values to our approximately 115,000 employees around the globe. The four tenets of our credo provide a clear focus and mindset for how we approach each decision: patients and customers first, then our employees, our communities, and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>We're very conscious of the bar we've set for ourselves and that consumers expect more from us than others because of our history and reputation. A recent consumer product recall and FDA warning letter were important reminders of this expectation and the vigilance it requires. I want to assure you that we take these matters very seriously, and nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of the people who use our products. We are undertaking a thorough review of our procedures to ensure that we identify potential improvements we could make moving forward. We believe these and other actions we are taking will address the concerns that the FDA raised in its warning letter, and we will be working in close consultation with them.</p>
          <p>When McNeil Consumer Healthcare first received some complaints on a musty odor associated with our products in 2008, the company conducted a microbiological investigation to check for the presence of bacteria and mold, which would be consistent with the presence of the odor. No bacteria or mold was found, and it was believed that the complaints were likely an isolated issue.</p>
          <p>When similar complaint trends were identified in 2009, the company initiated further investigation and novel forensic testing. McNeil determined that the reported uncharacteristic odor was caused by trace amounts of a chemical byproduct originating from the treatment of wood pallets used to transport and store product packaging materials. Subsequently, we initiated a voluntary product recall based on broad precautionary criteria, recalling numerous product lots that had not been the subject of any customer complaints.</p>
          <p>Even as we continue our investigation, we have taken additional actions beyond the recall to assure product quality. We have required suppliers who ship materials to our plants to discontinue the use of the type of wood pallets associated with the recall. We are conducting full inspections of all materials coming into our facilities and have had outside experts evaluate our plants. We are confident in moving forward with production, and we will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation and consult with the FDA.</p>
          <p>The next slide should look familiar to you as it demonstrates the ongoing strategic framework for our business. In addition to our credo, we also work under an operating model that has served us well for decades. It has four elements: being broadly based in human healthcare, managing our businesses for the long term, taking a decentralized management approach, and focusing on our people and values.</p>
          <p>At Johnson &amp; Johnson, our businesses rely on our credo and operating model to provide a consistent framework for decision making while leaving the more specific business strategies to be developed at the local market or franchise level where they sit closest to the customer. Within our strategic framework, we galvanize our enterprise around common, high level priorities that reflect the changing global environment and changing needs of our businesses. For 2010, we will focus our business leaders on the common set of growth priorities. These growth priorities are what we believe our businesses need to focus on, and they are innovative products.</p>
          <p>Our growth has always been based on scientific innovations that serve unmet patient and customer needs in a meaningful way. This has led us to be market leader number one or number two in many of our businesses. We will stay focused on bringing fourth innovative, accessible, and effective products and entirely new business models that address the most prevalent healthcare needs of the day.</p>
          <p>Robust pipelines; we must continuously target, invest, and manage the development of a robust pipeline of new medicines, devices, and products. We plan to use a mix of internal and external sources to sustain pipelines that provide a competitive advantage. We fully expect the new products coming out of our pipeline today to accelerate the proportion of our sales driven by newer products.</p>
          <p>Global presence; as a global healthcare leader, we must continue to expand our presence and execute our strategies in the appropriate way for diverse markets and customers. Our approach will be strategic, effective, and cost efficient to address the local needs.</p>
          <p>Talented people; our extraordinary and diverse workforce is still our cornerstone and we must develop our people, challenge them, motivate them, and reward them to achieve success. You'll see these growth priorities reflected throughout our individual business segment plans as we move to those.</p>
          <p>In MD&amp;D, we have seen some terrific innovations coming to market that strengthen our core businesses. Atrial fibrillation is a condition affecting an estimated 22 million people worldwide and a leading cause of stroke. Our CARTO 3 product is a new catheter based navigational mapping system that provides incredibly detailed, full color, three dimensional images of the heart, enabling electrophysiologists to pinpoint where abnormal heart arrhythmias originate when performing catheter ablation.</p>
          <p>The physician feedback on our CARTO 3 system has been very positive. The CARTO 3 also works with our NAVISTAR THERMOCOOL catheters, the first and only ablation catheters approved by the FDA for the treatment of AFib.</p>
          <p>We received FDA approval in October for the SURGIFLO Hemostatic Matrix kit, an advanced flowable hemostat for use in a broad range of surgical procedures. This is our first product launch resulting from Ethicon's 2008 acquisition of Omrix. The regulatory knowledge gained from this combination product will be valuable as we continue to develop and commercialize other combination products in our pipeline like the Fibrin Pad, which I'll address in a minute.</p>
          <p>We are continuing the successful rollout of 1-Day ACUVUE TruEye in markets around the world. TruEye is the world's first daily disposable silicon hydrogel and the most exciting breakthrough in contact lens technology in years. Its material and design are well suited for patients with busy, demanding, active lifestyles. Introduction in the U.S. is expected later this year.</p>
          <p>And we continue to make acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio of products: Acclarent in the ear nose and throat space, Finsbury Orthopaedics in the area of hip implants, and Gloster Europe in the area of decontamination technologies that help prevent hospital acquired infections, a significant and growing global concern.</p>
          <p>We also have significant development in our MD&amp;D pipeline, which Alex Gorsky discussed with you in October. The Pinnacle CoMplete Acetabular Cup System is the first ceramic-on-metal hip bearing being considered for approval by the FDA. It is intended for use as a primary hip replacement in adult patients suffering severe pain and disability due to structural damage in hip joint from non-inflammatory degenerative joint diseases including osteoarthritis and posttraumatic arthritis.</p>
          <p>Clinical and laboratory data show that the Pinnacle ceramic-on-metal bearing combines the durability and stability of a metal-on-metal bearing and the enhanced wear characteristics of ceramic-on-ceramic bearing. It was unanimously recommended for approval by an FDA advisory panel last year, and we are awaiting a final decision from the FDA.</p>
          <p>The NEVO sirolimus-eluting coronary stent is the first and only drug-eluting stent utilizing RES technology, which incorporates hundreds of small reservoirs, each acting as a depot into which drug polymer compositions are loaded. This unique design allows drug delivery from a stent with a surface that is 75% bare metal upon insertion and which becomes purely bare metal in approximately three months.</p>
          <p>NEVO also contains sirolimus, the same drug as our CYPHER stent, which has data supporting the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in coronary applications out to six years. This body of clinical evidence for sirolimus is completely unmatched by any other drug-eluting stent. We have seen promising results from our clinical trials to date. And in terms of regulatory filings, we plan to file NEVO for CE Mark approval in Europe this year with a PMA submission in the U.S. to follow in 2012.</p>
          <p>SEDASYS is the first computer assisted personalized sedation system. SEDASYS integrates drug delivery and state-of-the-art monitoring, making it possible for a physician/nurse team to provide personalized sedation based upon a patient's unique physiology. Using this system, physician/nurse teams could deliver the sedative propofol during routine medical screenings for colonoscopies and upper GI tract screenings outside of the more traditional hospital settings. SEDASYS received a favorable recommendation from an FDA advisory committee last year, and we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, Johnson &amp; Johnson leads the industry in developing next generation advanced hemostats to address the persistent clinical problems associated with bleeding in surgical settings, and we are very excited by the potential of the Fibrin Pad. With our human plasma based biologics embedded directly into a proprietary matrix, the Fibrin Pad has the potential to uniquely and effectively address bleeding challenges that are currently unmet by traditional hemostats. As Louise mentioned earlier, the BLA filing for the Fibrin Pad is now expected in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>MD&amp;D has also been making important progress in expanding our global presence, especially in the BRIC markets, which are expected to grow at more than double the rate of the global MD&amp;D market. For instance, we've established R&amp;D centers in China and India and manufacturing facilities throughout the BRIC countries, including a new campus in Suzhou, China where DePuy products are now being made. We also operate surgical training institutes in the BRIC markets, with our latest institute set to be open in S&#xE3;o Paulo, Brazil in February. Globally we now have more than 25 professional education centers around the world.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our Consumer business, we continue to distinguish ourselves with science based innovations for consumers based on a wide array of research and proprietary technologies. In 2009, we launched LISTERINE Total Care in the U.S., a multi-benefit mouthwash that works in six different ways for a cleaner, healthier mouth. We also introduced AVEENO NOURISH+ hair care products, a new line of shampoos and conditioners and most recently styling products. And in the coming weeks, we'll be unveiling an anti-aging skin care breakthrough called CYTOMIMIC technology. This proprietary patented technology uses essential minerals to generate an imperceptible flow of energy that travels through the surface layers of the skin to stimulate the skin's renewal process. This technology builds on our heritage of science based innovation and will be used in three of our beauty brands beginning in February.</p>
          <p>One of our key approaches to innovation in the Consumer business is to build our iconic brands like LISTERINE, NEUTROGENA, and Clean &amp; Clear. The slides are stuck for some reason. There we go. Sometimes over decades through continuous scientific advances, we build these brands. In the case of AVEENO, we have a product that was developed by dermatologists at the Mayo Clinic and first brought to market in 1945 as an oatmeal bath treatment for relieving itch. Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired the brand in 1999 when it had $60 billion (sic) [$60 million] in sales. Since then, we have extended its active natural ingredients and soothing product qualities into AVEENO baby care products, body washes, skin care, and most recently into hair care. In 2009, the brand had more than $0.5 billion dollars in sales, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 23% since joining Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
          <p>More than half our Consumer sales come from markets outside the United States and some of our most important acquisitions and innovations are in those markets. Last year, we acquired the remaining share of the French brand Vania and its well-known cosmetic and sanitary protection products. Le Petit Marseillais, another French brand which we acquired just over three years ago, is in the process of successfully expanding outside of its home market.</p>
          <p>The Dabao brand continues to grow and thrive in China as a part of Johnson &amp; Johnson. And in Shanghai, we've opened a research center dedicated to servicing emerging markets, but which is now also developing ideas for well developed markets as well as those in the developing world.</p>
          <p>Our Pharmaceutical business has focused its research on five therapeutic areas, with significant new products coming out of the pipeline. In the last year, we've launched five newly approved drugs: SIMPONI and STELARA in immunology, NUCYNTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA in pain and neuroscience, and PRILIGY outside the U.S. in sexual health. And we are driving growth in other new products like PREZISTA and INTELENCE in virology and VELCADE in Oncology. In addition, we will continue to expand our core products with new indications, a practice we have done well historically with many products including REMICADE, which has 15 indications across a broad spectrum of immune system disorders.</p>
          <p>Back in 2007, we set some aggressive goals for our NME [New Molecular Entity] filings and we've continued to meet them. We currently have three products in registration including rivaroxaban, a novel oral anticoagulant that may prevent a host of thrombolytic conditions including venous thromboembolism and stroke. It is being evaluated in five different conditions.</p>
          <p>As this slide shows, we also expect to file several more new compounds between now and 2013. We have many important compounds in Phase III trials including an oral SGLT-2 inhibitor for diabetes, bapineuzumab for Alzheimer's disease, and abiraterone acetate, an orally administered inhibitor of testosterone, which is also a first-in-class compound for the treatment of prostate cancer. These are all addressing the kind of patient needs that affect or will affect so many of us here and our families in so many ways.</p>
          <p>You have also seen us emerging in innovative agreements, collaborations, and acquisitions with companies like Elan, Crucell, Gilead, and Cougar Biotechnology, which offer potentially dramatic advances in patient care such as a potential first-in-class treatment for slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, a potential universal monoclonal antibody product for the treatment and prevention of influenza, a treatment for HIV with a single combination pill, and a breakthrough in prostate cancer.</p>
          <p>In terms of enhancing our global presence, our Pharmaceuticals business has been strengthening our local capabilities in key markets outside the United States. For instance, we have been partnering on branded generics in India, expanding our sales reach in China and maintaining a strong manufacturing footprint in China, Mexico, and Brazil; developing our R&amp;D presence in emerging markets like India and China where we have established an R&amp;D operation in Mumbai, an R&amp;D headquarters in Shanghai, and a collaboration with Tianjin University on biomarker research.</p>
          <p>That completes our segment review around three of our growth priorities. Now I'd like to wrap up with a discussion of our talented people, who give me confidence in our ability to continue improving the health and well being of over 1 billion people every day. All of the products, pipelines, and global expansions I just described rely on the people of Johnson &amp; Johnson to make them a reality. It is their talent and commitment to our credo that has built our reputation and earned the recognitions that are mentioned here. We continue to invest more than ever in our people. Our objective is simple, to develop leaders with the skills, judgment, and integrity to carry on the Johnson &amp; Johnson legacy.</p>
          <p>We've taken you on a bit of a journey this morning from 2008 as we faced into some future headwinds and began building our foundation for future growth to 2009 as we further executed on these plans. We showed you how we kept progressing on those plans even though through one of the most challenging years of business that any of us have ever experienced. And now we've taken you into 2010, where we already see promising signs that we are driving significant growth and beginning to capitalize on the investments we have made.</p>
          <p>Certainly we've come out of this period better positioned with more innovative products capable of addressing the unmet needs of the patients and customers. Our pipelines have never been stronger. But importantly, our innovations are now moving into the marketplace. Our presence in promising growth areas and attractive geographies give us outstanding market access, and our talented people are already driving growth. This all gives me and all of us enormous confidence and enthusiasm for the future. We're proud to be the leader in human health and well being in one of the most dynamic and important industries in the world, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Thanks and now I'd like to turn it over to Dominic.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. We are very pleased with our solid financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2009 and with the underlying strength demonstrated across our broad base of healthcare businesses. Our annual results when excluding the impact of special items reflect an improvement in pre-tax operating margins over the prior year. This is a great accomplishment in a year when our top line growth was challenged by the impact of patent expirations and the global economic slowdown.</p>
          <p>Our financial performance for the year demonstrated again our ability to continue managing costs and improving margins while advancing our pipeline of new products, investing in new growth platforms through licensing agreements, collaborations, and acquisitions, and launching five new molecular entities.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we were able to implement some tax-planning strategies in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, resulting in an effective tax rate for 2009 which was about a point below our latest estimate. This lower than expected tax rate positively impacted our full year and fourth quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.07 per share.</p>
          <p>However, our fourth quarter 2009 results also include costs associated with the recent recall of certain OTC products, restructuring costs that are not treated as special items, and costs associated with proactive steps taken in Venezuela. Together, these items negatively impacted our fourth quarter results by approximately $0.06 per share, nearly offsetting the entire benefit from our lower effective tax rate. We therefore exceeded our estimated earnings guidance due to the better than expected operating performance, resulting primarily from the return to operational sales growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>To wrap up our formal presentation this morning, I would like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2010. First, let me set some context around certain items that are reflected in my guidance but may not yet be reflected in your models. Regarding our previously announced restructuring plans, as we noted at the time of the announcement in November, in addition to the savings which are being invested in 2010 in growing the business and in funding the impact of the acquisitions we made in 2009, these actions will also have a dilutive impact on our earnings from such items as accelerated depreciation and other costs incurred to implement the plans.</p>
          <p>After now completing our plans, we estimate that the dilutive impact of these costs for 2010 is approximately $0.07 per share.</p>
          <p>Additionally as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Acclarent just last week, and we expect that this acquisition will be dilutive to 2010 earnings by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share.</p>
          <p>Finally, it is important to understand that the following guidance does not include the potential impact of healthcare reform. In reading many of your reports, this appears to be consistent with the way you have built your models for 2010. There remains a range of possibilities in terms of what any potential financial legislation may entail. These can have a significant impact to the industry and Johnson &amp; Johnson, but we cannot be certain at this time what those impacts could be. We will continue to monitor the outcome of the legislative process, and we will provide an update to our guidance at a later date if any legislation is passed and when its impact is fully understood.</p>
          <p>Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest and common expense. During 2009, we continued to generate strong cash flows. In fact, as Bill pointed out earlier, we generated free cash flow, or operating cash flow after necessary capital expenditures, of approximately $14.2 billion.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2009, we had approximately $14.9 billion (sic) [$4.9 billion] of net cash. This consists of approximately $19.4 billion of cash and investments and $14.5 billion of debt. This is an improvement of nearly $4 billion in our overall net cash position from year-end 2008.</p>
          <p>During 2009, we used approximately $800 million to repurchase shares of our stock in connection with our $10 billion share repurchase program which began in 2007. Through the end of 2009, we have purchased approximately $8.9 billion of our stock under this program. As we indicated previously, we still expect to complete the remaining approximately $1.1 billion under this repurchase program but at a slower pace and contingent upon other uses of cash to invest in building the business.</p>
          <p>For purposes of your models, assuming no additional major acquisitions during 2010, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between 350 million and $450 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder this is the account where we record royalty income as well as one-time gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and asset sales or write-offs. This account is difficult to forecast, but assuming no major one-time gains or losses, I would recommend that you consider modeling other income and expense for 2010 as a net gain ranging from approximately 200 million to $300 million.</p>
          <p>And now a word on taxes; for 2009, the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was 22%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for 2010 in the range of 23% to 24%. This rate takes into consideration changes in the mix of our business for 2010 as well as the extension of the R&amp;D tax credit for 2010. And while not yet enacted, it is our expectation that the R&amp;D tax credit legislation will be passed, and therefore we have included this impact in our estimate for the year. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to sales and earnings; as we did throughout 2009, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations assuming that average currency rates for 2010 will be the same as they were for 2009. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. We will also continue to provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2010 with the impact that currency exchange rates could have using the euro as an example.</p>
          <p>Now turning to sales; the impact from the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity of RISPERDAL Oral is now largely behind us, but we must still take into consideration the loss of U.S. patent exclusivity of TOPAMAX, which occurred at the end of March 2009 and will still have a significant impact on year-over-year comparisons, especially in the first quarter of 2010. That being said, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 2 and 3% for the year. This would result in sales for 2010 on a constant currency basis of between 63 and $64 billion.</p>
          <p>While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency exchange rates for all of 2010 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our sales growth rate would be positively impacted by approximately 2% or approximately $1 billion. Thus under this scenario, we would then expect reported sales growth to increase to a range between 4% and 5%, for a total expected level of reported sales between 64 billion and $65 billion, again prior to any potential impact from healthcare reform legislation.</p>
          <p>Now turning to earnings; I suggest that you consider full-year 2010 EPS estimates excluding the impact of special items of between $4.80 and $4.90 per share on an operational basis; that is assuming the same average exchange rates for 2010 as we saw in 2009. This represents an operational growth rate of 4 to 6%.</p>
          <p>While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates for all of 2010 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our EPS growth rate would be positively impacted by approximately 1% or approximately $0.05 per share. Thus under this scenario, we would then expect total reported EPS excluding special items of between $4.85 and $4.95 per share or an EPS growth rate of 5 to 7%.</p>
          <p>To summarize, our guidance today does not include the impact of any potential healthcare reform legislation. Given that it is early in the year and also considering that our guidance includes the cost to implement the restructuring program plus the dilution related to the recent closing of the acquisition of Acclarent, we would be comfortable with EPS estimates towards the midpoint of this range.</p>
          <p>Importantly, as you consider the guidance I've provided today, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an improvement in pre-tax operating margins for 2010. And while operating margins may vary by business segment year to year or may be impacted from time to time by short-term dilutive impact of acquisitions, improving the overall pre-tax operating margin by growing income faster than sales over time while continuing to invest in growth is a fundamental discipline we use in managing our business.</p>
          <p>In closing, Johnson &amp; Johnson remains a company that is financially strong and we are well positioned for leadership and growth in healthcare. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Rick Wise, Leerink Swann. Bill, let me just start with a big picture question. Healthcare reform, I understand why you'd want to make cautious and diplomatic comments here. But maybe just in a more simple way, do you feel better than you did six months ago, more optimistic that whatever is going to happen will have a less negative impact on J&amp;J and the industry? Where do you think we are in this whole process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, I wish, as we all do, we wish we had the crystal ball. And as I said, I don't think the administration has really reached out to anybody since the Massachusetts election. So we only know what everyone else is hearing and what our people in Washington are telling us.</p>
          <p>I think there are &#x2013; we were talking about this earlier with some people. I think there are some fundamental areas that everybody can support. Access to healthcare is one, coverage for pre-existing conditions and things like that. So I think that there's a way that they could probably bring something together that everybody would support and could move forward in a very positive way. And these are things that we have, if you go on our website, you can see we've got this promise for healthcare for some time and have supported many of these evidence based &#x2013; medicine and comparative effectiveness. There are certain things that I think are really beneficial that could move that way, and that could be where everybody could come together and support it.</p>
          <p>There's another movement there that says let's go to reconciliation, get something approved that only needs 50 votes in the Senate and move forward with that. But again, today they're saying they don't have enough votes to get that through. I don't think anyone really knows. I think that they would like to get something through, and I'm talking about in general now, Congress and the President and everyone else. I don't think it will be what it may have been in the past.</p>
          <p>I think if we wanted to look backwards and say what could it have cost, and that's why both Dominic and I wanted to reference that if things do move along, it's not inconsequential. The pharmaceutical group could be up to, talking industry-wide, over $100 billion over ten years, medical devices between 20 and 40 billion. Those are large numbers. And I think &#x2013; but we don't know what they're going to be. We don't know what's going to happen.</p>
          <p>So I think right now it's really a matter of wait and see. We'll keep you informed, and it could be anything from &#x2013; probably from nothing to something substantial through reconciliation or anywhere in between. And hopefully they'll come to the point that it will help a lot of people and move forward in this area.</p>
          <p>The critical piece I think of all of this is how does it get paid for. I think if you &#x2013; we're going to see tonight when the President makes his speech, jobs seem to be the big concern. And I think we've said this all along. We have jobs and the deficit, and then we have some costs over here. And how do you reconcile this and drive the economy forward while people are losing their jobs? And I think it's connecting the dots that become so important.</p>
          <p>So I wish I had a better answer for you. I really don't. But I think there will be &#x2013; let's just say hopefully they'll be able to work together to move something forward that will be beneficial for everybody.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me follow up with two quick ones. One, you talked about 5% long-term growth for the markets that you could address. I assume you'd hope that through internal investment and acquisition, J&amp;J could grow faster than that. When do we get to that let's call it six to eight, seven to nine percent growth in your view? And a follow-up question for Dominic. Dominic, this is the third year in a row that gross margins are lower. I understand why, but maybe you can talk us through the quarterly impact of currency and the moving pieces. And where do we go from here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, I think the answer to the first part of that is that we feel very encouraged where we are. I think what we just talked about, the fourth quarter, when you see that we're back in positive growth, I think we've weathered the storms of the RISPERDAL Oral and TOPAMAX. We think we're on a positive movement. If you took generics out, Louise said we had close to what, 14% growth in Pharma in the fourth quarter when you take the generics out. We feel we're positioned very, very positively right now to move forward. The new approvals we have and the ones I talked about that are pending, when that's going to happen and not &#x2013; I shouldn't say when it's going to happen. It's going to happen, but when are you going to see the more even robust growth that you're talking about.</p>
          <p>As you know, we're always looking for opportunities to work together whether it's to acquire or license. And I think last year, we actually took a step that is different for us and that's the area of partnering. If you look at the Elan agreement, the Crucell agreement, and the Gilead agreement, which offer extraordinary opportunities for us, upsides as well as mitigating risks and sharing costs.</p>
          <p>So I think we're on a really strong trajectory. I think that the reason we wanted to go back and take you to the beginning is to show that we've been on a journey over the last few years. We've committed to you all that we were going to make these investments. We were going to do these things and we were going to build the pipeline to be able to take us to the future. We think we're there now and it's all starting to come, and we think we're on a trajectory that will take us to a much better place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, with respect to gross margin, you're right. It's three years that there has been some deterioration in gross margin. As you might expect, the largest contributor to that is the mix of the business, and the largest component of that mix is of course the patent expirations that we've experienced. We're happy that that's largely behind us now of course. And also we're launching a number of new products, five new molecular entities just last year. So new product growth plus the anniversary, if you will, of the patent expirations should help that.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, however, I would just refer you to the overall pre-tax operating margin for the enterprise which despite the pressure in gross margin has improved year over year. And as my guidance indicated, we expect that to be continuing in 2010 as well.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. I guess, Dominic, the first question is there was a series of economic headwinds, large economic headwinds in 2009, whether it be pressuring on volumes or the capital environment at the hospital. How does your guidance forecast those economic headwinds in 2009 becoming potentially tailwinds in 2010? Is there some sort of quantification you can give us in terms of the impact in '09 now that you have all the numbers and what the guidance implies for '10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to quantify either the impact in '09 or the impact in 2010. It's obvious that we did see some impact obviously in 2009 from the economic headwinds, particularly our Consumer business and some of the consumer facing aspects of our Medical Device business. Those trends in those businesses seem to be stabilizing to slightly improving. I think it's too early to say that we're out of the woods yet with respect to that. But our guidance takes into consideration what our folks that are close to the businesses see as a moderate stabilization and slight improvement; but again, too early to actually quantify what that could be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, you mentioned the increasing reliance on the partnership model may be some of the deviation to where J&amp;J has been in the Pharmaceutical business historically. Do you think going forward to the extent the partnership model takes hold or is a bigger percentage of the activities you engage in, you could still maintain the level of profitability you historically had in Pharmaceuticals if you're increasingly reliant on in-licensing and partnering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think so, and I think part of the reasons for that are that we're able to bring &#x2013; it's not that we have all of the best expertise in the world, and so if you look at the Elan acquisition or the partnership we have there. If you look at Elan, we think we've brought together three groups of people that have extraordinary talent in development of the Alzheimer's product. And it may be able to accelerate, may be able to better penetrate, may be able to move into new areas and fields in the neurology area using some of these compounds that will afford us more over time. So we think that the sharing will be able to put us in a better position.</p>
          <p>We also feel that we have the reliance on our internal R&amp;D, which is also yielding significant areas of growth for us. So I think you have to look at it that these are just ways that complement what we ordinarily do. But we think we'll be able to continue to move forward in a very positive way.</p>
          <p>Let me also comment on the comment of the headwinds becoming tailwinds. I think we have to be careful that when you look at all indications, things are picking up somewhat. But I think we have to be careful to assume that &#x2013; it's funny, somebody in Washington to me the other day said we don't have to worry about healthcare reform because it will be over shortly. I kind of laughed and I said you've got to be kidding me.</p>
          <p>I think that until we fix the things that I talked about before, some of the unemployment issues and deficit and some of these other areas, I don't know how much we can expect there to be this significant upswing. I think you're right. There will be some tailwinds or some things that we dealt with in 2009 as an industry and as a macroeconomic environment that are going to become less significant. But I still think we have a lot of challenges ahead of us that are going to continue to impact this industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. To both Bill and Dominic, a big part of the acceleration story at J&amp;J is predicated upon successfully launching new products. And as you said, you launched five new molecular entities in 2009. But all five of those have launched relatively slowly, particularly SIMPONI, which competes in a $16 billion market and for which expectations were quite high.</p>
          <p>So I'm wondering; just a two-part question. What do you think is going on with these &#x2013; your new product launches aren't the only new product launches that have been disappointing. I would say you could characterize that across the industry, but what are you seeing in terms of the environment?</p>
          <p>And Dominic, in terms of your guidance for 2009, how important is the contribution from new products, if you could help us to think about the importance of that to your 2010 revenue guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't characterize, at least from our expectations, our products as being disappointing. We're actually &#x2013; I think in every one of them, we are on or ahead of the targets we've set for ourselves to be able to move these products out. I think the environment we're in is much more complex today, but the trajectory is very good. STELARA is doing extremely well. SIMPONI is ahead of its projected numbers. NUCYNTA is doing very well. I think all of these are doing very well. But it's a much more complex environment today.</p>
          <p>The thing that we feel good about SIMPONI, which you specifically spoke to, is we're starting to see that pick up. We're actually &#x2013; I think it's the largest grower in the area of rheumatology today. And we're not being inhibited at all by third-party payor or anything else. We don't have any of these barriers in front of us. So it's not the market it was when there was only one or two of these products out there. There's a lot more today. But we feel very good about the acceptance of it and the way it's going.</p>
          <p>STELARA, we feel very, very excited about. NUCYNTA, if you look at it compared to other product launches in the similar area, in the pain area and the high area of pain, is doing equal to or better than the other launches, so we feel really actually very good. So I wouldn't say disappointed. I don't think in today's environment &#x2013; you mentioned other companies or products that have the same type of &#x2013; and you said disappointment. I wouldn't phrase it that way.</p>
          <p>I think the environment is much more complex when you start looking at the competitiveness, the numbers of products in the marketplace, the cost of generics that inhibit some products. So I think that there are a whole lot of factors that come into play. But I would say that we are on or ahead of the targets we've set for ourselves at this point in time in each one of those products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jami, as we said before in these meetings, we generally model new product launches in a reasonably conservative way because we have to wait to get reimbursement in some cases, and we generally look at the probability of factors impacting their launches. As Bill said, we're pleased already with the early signs. Most of them if not all of them are ahead of our own expectations. I can't quantify for you what the impact is.</p>
          <p>We don't provide any specific product indication, but our projections for next year estimate that our plans will be implemented as we thought they would be with these product launches; plus not to mention the growth in our core business, which is still progressing nicely throughout the year as well. That's across all businesses, not just Pharmaceutical including Medical Device and Consumer.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not to predict the future because the past never predicts the future, but again I want to go back to what Louise said. If you took the generics out of our Pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter, we had 14% growth, so we're pretty excited about where we're headed and the opportunities. And Dominic made a great point. Not only the new products, but we have a lot of really good products.</p>
          <p>You look at PREZISTA and INTELENCE. If you look at REMICADE, these have all had really a great trajectory of growth ahead of them, and they're growing quite nicely, very substantial products that are still growing and we're investing in. So we feel very good about where we are.</p>
          <p>And we feel the thing that we've talked about so much over the last few years is we now have RISPERDAL Oral and we have and TOPAMAX behind us. I don't know if you all realize this. They were the two largest single products the corporation had. It was like we lost $3 billion last year in those products. So we feel that we're really through it. To use the words we used before, we're through a lot of headwinds that we had to deal with that and feel very excited about the fourth quarter. And again, it's not a prediction for the future but hopefully it will continue in a very positive way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mike Weinstein, J.P. Morgan. Bill, of all the slides you showed up there, the one that struck me the most is the operating margin by segment slide. And if I look at the last couple of years, you've improved your operating margin pretty remarkably. If I look at the MD&amp;D business, you're up now at a 32% operating margin. I think it's up 460 basis points over the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>And the Consumer margin on the back of the PCH [Pfizer Consumer Healthcare] deal has had a dramatic move up as well. And probably most shocking of all is that you did lose over $3 billion of high margin sales in the Pharma business and held the Pharma margin flat year over year, which I don't think anybody on the Street would have modeled it that way.</p>
          <p>Can you address in the three different businesses the ability to grow margins from here? I look at MD&amp;D as about 32%. That's about the high for the industry. Consumer margins have had a big move on the back of PCH. You obviously have this restructuring now to work with.</p>
          <p>But talk about the ability in the three segments, the segments that necessarily improved margins, part of it on the Pharma side in the context of the deals you're doing, which you've already commented on, but I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, I think a lot of the growth in margins are going to come from the growth of the business. It's not that we're going to be restructuring any more. We feel we've got a cost structure that's in a good place. We feel we're now in a position to be able to invest. And as we are able to continue to maintain our expense or the lines we have and grow our top line, we'll be able &#x2013; we think we're positioned in a very good way to be able to do that without having to invest.</p>
          <p>As we said earlier, we've gone through a lot of these and we're going to take the money and invest, and it's going to be in new products. It's going to be in the development of new opportunities and actually have a trajectory of growth that will actually take us to a new place. So the margins will improve but they're going to be improving by a function, I would say by a function of the top line growth, not as a function of trying to manage costs out of the system.</p>
          <p>That's what we've really done over the last few years. We knew we had to do it. We knew we had to refocus ourselves, make sure we right-sized our expense structure, make sure we, as I said earlier, looked at the Cordis opportunity as well as the Pharmaceutical opportunity. And the PCH acquisition also allowed us a big opportunity to be able to put a lot of leverage there.</p>
          <p>We feel we're in a good place now and I think you're really going to see the growth coming through &#x2013; or the improved margins coming through a trajectory of growth that's going to be able to move us forward. I don't know, Dominic, if you you've got anything to add.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would agree with Bill that the best way to grow margins is grow the top line. The reason we called these restructuring efforts restructuring is they're not simply just cost cutting. It is in fact a restructuring of the way we conduct business which we think is sustainable going forward. We talked during our restructuring call that we had some additional opportunities in our supply chain, and I think that that will help us in the future as that initiative gets moving. So that will actually help us with the gross margin comment that was made earlier. But I think growing the top line with a sustainable change in the way the business is structured, that formula bodes well for increasing margins.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, there are comments we could make about standardization, which we're trying to do and standardize across the business. We talked about our operations and our manufacturing area and supply chain where we're looking at a more consolidated way of moving forward in that direction, which we said will take time to look at our facilities and everything else.</p>
          <p>So there are going to be ways we're going to improve, and we're going to continue to focus on it. I didn't mean to allude &#x2013; imply that we weren't going to be focusing on continuing to manage the business really tightly and well. But the real driver is going to be the opportunity to drive the top line.</p>

          <p>Just a couple of follow-ups; Dominic, I'm assuming that in 2010, the cadence of your organic growth will be impacted by the timing of principally the TOPAMAX impact, first in the first quarter and then fading in the second and third. I don't know if you wanted to comment on that.</p>
          <p>I was hoping you could comment additionally on free cash flow growth because you had such a strong year. You ended very well in terms of free cash flow generation. Do you have any thoughts on that? I know it's not part of your typical guidance commentary, but if you want to add to that?</p>
          <p>And then, Bill, one last question for you. If I look at the fourth quarter, and you talked about the Pharmaceutical growth in the fourth quarter ex-generics, you probably had the biggest contribution from price in the fourth quarter across your existing brands, the vaccine at the company. And in 2009, you took probably more price and more frequently in some cases than you have historically. Can you talk about price in the Pharma business going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just on the cadence of the earnings, as you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance, but you're absolutely right. The first quarter of 2010 will have a comparison of TOPAMAX I think before it lost patent exclusivity at the end of March compared to now one year later when obviously it's at a low point as it has lost its patent exclusivity. So that will be a significant impact in the first quarter year-over-year comparisons. I think it's important to consider that as you're modeling, and we certainly expect that in our business.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of free cash flow, you're absolutely right. I think our businesses around the world have done a terrific job of managing all the aspects of the balance sheet, our receivables, our inventory, our expenditures with respect to capital expenditures, and they continue to do a great job doing that. And we've generally generated free cash flow that's near 100% or slightly higher than our net income, so that's a testament to the way we manage the business.</p>
          <p>So we do manage the P&amp;L cost lines that come from all the efforts we talked about. But our business leaders around the world actually manage the balance sheet in a remarkable way as well, so we're proud of that. And it's an amazing generator of future growth opportunities if we can generate substantial free cash flow to invest in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the question on price; we took price, Mike, but if you looked at it over the year, we've made a commitment to keep our price at CPI or below, and we did that again last year with our healthcare products. So it looked like there was a lot of price being taken at different points in time, and we'll continue to strategically use price to help us in certain areas. But we have a commitment, we've had it for the last decade to keep our prices below the CPI, which we were able to do last year also. It may look like at times we're taking price in different ways, but we actually have a commitment to keep it at a low rate and we continued to do that in 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wasn't going to go there. So on the deals you talked about last year, those four deals, you took a lot of dilution. I don't know what the final number is, but it seems like when we look at the 2010 numbers, you made up a decent amount with the restructuring. That's a big number for a company your size for the deals you did. Again, we don't assume there's a restructuring in 2010. Are you still willing to do dilution like that if the right deal comes up? Can we still assume there's potentially risk to these numbers on dilution, or was this a one-shot deal where you did four dilutive deals in a row?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'll take part of it now, and I'll let Dominic say. If the right deal comes along, we're going to do it no matter what. I think if you look at the resources we have and the cash we're generating, if the right deal comes along, the question is always asked. Are we worried about protecting the AAA? Are we this or are we that? We're going to make the right deals I think you all know, but we're not going to make a deal that's not going to generate in our minds value for shareholders over time. So if the right deal came along, whatever that may be and whatever the cost may be, we're in a position to be able to take advantage of it.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Dominic, one quick one for you, I think I know the answer, but CONCERTA is probably the only one that has potentially generic risk in 2010. Are we assuming that's still okay for the year?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Tao Levy from Deutsche Bank. I was wondering if you could comment on the Medical Device side of the business and what you're seeing in terms of hospital pushback on pricing and whether you can still capture mix with new products. Is it more difficult? Do you expect it to get more difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think pricing in general is going to continue to get difficult. I think if you look at the orthopedic business, we've seen continuing slight declines, maybe a 1% decline quarter on quarter on price in some of those areas. I think we're going to see that.</p>
          <p>I think the area of major capital, when you look at our ASP [Advanced Sterilization Products] business for example, we know the orders are there. They're just not being processed at this point in time. So I think there's going to be &#x2013; everybody's going to continue to push on price, but we're going to have to continue to innovate and bring better products that are going to bring better results.</p>
          <p>And I think that's the whole area of what we're trying to look at this comparative effectiveness or evidence based medicine and moving into these areas. If we can show value, which is the critical thing, and we talk about it all the time. If we can show value, you're a lot better off than just looking at cost as a single entity. And I think there's a lot of traction in Washington understanding that right now. But no matter what you're talking about, there's going to be continual push-back on price, absolutely.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on REMICADE, Louise, you mentioned that it lost some market share in the quarter. If you include product changes that might have been cannibalizing REMICADE such as SIMPONI and STELARA, do you think REMICADE still lost share or did it maintain or increase as a category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you take the cannibalization question, SIMPONI is taken pretty much evenly across the class of the growth ones. So it's taking some from REMICADE but also from the other products that are on the market. If you take into account STELARA, SIMPONI, and REMICADE together, we're showing nice share in that market.

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob Hopkins from Banc of America-Merrill Lynch, two questions. First for Bill, I was just wondering if you could clarify the comments when you talked about the global healthcare market in terms of 5% growth. Was the message there that once J&amp;J is beyond generics, you expect your company to be a 5% growth company or was the message that you expect to be better than that in terms of just thinking in terms of long-term growth?</p>
          <p>And then for Dominic very quickly, the contribution from the extra week in the fourth quarter, I was just curious. Was that well balanced across the divisions of J&amp;J, or was one division more heavily impacted from that than another? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the comment about the 5% growth and then the follow-up about the coverage by different area or countries and developing world is really that there's a huge opportunity out there. It has gone to $7 trillion. We're a 60-plus billion dollar corporation, tons of room, whether it's in the developed, the developing world, or anyplace else for growth. And the markets that we're trying to concentrate and focus on are the markets that are growing much faster than the average market growth of 5%.</p>
          <p>So if you were to extrapolate out and if we run our business properly over time, we should be able to grow faster than the markets we compete in, which should grow faster than the market. So we should be &#x2013; when you look at it again, as you said strategically over the long term, we'll grow faster than the markets we compete in. Hopefully the markets we're competing in are growing faster than the healthcare market. So we should be doing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, for the 53rd week, just one thing to clarify, it's not a full week worth of sales, really just a few days within that week, first of all. Secondly, it's just an estimate. It's not an exact science. We think it's about half the rate &#x2013; half the impact of the fourth quarter growth; again, just an estimate. And yes, it doesn't really vary by segment of the business, probably around the same each, but again not an exact science.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Glenn Novarro with RBC. Bill, 2009 was another heavy M&amp;A licensing year. As you look out to 2010, are there any businesses, business segments that you look to and say these segments need a little help via M&amp;A and licensing?</p>
          <p>And conversely as you look across your portfolio of companies &#x2013; I'm sure you get this question all the time, but are there businesses you look at and say you know what, they're better off being sold, divested? And then just quickly, any update on the timing of Xarelto filing and NEVO filing? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glenn, we look all the time at the acquisitions. And yes, there are always opportunities to strengthen your franchises and your various businesses. You guys know as well as we do; there are some wonderful opportunities out there, and we try and look at those and try and make sure that if we want to move someplace it's going to strengthen us, and we have all the criteria which you all know that we look at it and it's really to strengthen us in markets. And I think you have to be strong in franchises as you move forward, not just in a product. So you have to really start looking at that.</p>
          <p>As far as divestitures, sure, we look at that all the time and say is this the right one it needs to be. Should we divest these businesses? Are there opportunities for growth? Are their margins going to be good to expand and things like that? So I mean I've described it as a snake shedding its skin. We're looking at that all the time and feel that we have to replenish certain things and have to discard others. So yes, we're looking at that all the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question about Xarelto and NEVO, so NEVO our expectation is CE Mark, filing for CE Mark in the first quarter of 2010, and then U.S. filing probably 2012. And Xarelto, we'll have to wait until we complete the discussions with the FDA before we give you any update on the expected timing for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to everyone's time, we'll take two more questions. Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bruce Nudell from UBS. Bill, I was struck by the pie chart of the composition of the business given the regulatory toughness in Pharma relative to Med Tech and certainly Consumer, and as offset by the intrinsic profitability of the businesses. Do you see mix shifts going forward in the portfolio for J&amp;J?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bruce, I really don't other than through the natural evolution of the way the businesses will grow and the way the markets themselves will grow. If you went back some time ago, Consumer was by far and away our biggest and Pharma was our smallest. Then Pharma became the biggest.</p>
          <p>It's interesting. The Medical Tech business or the Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics have remained pretty much constant. They've now taken over the largest. A lot of that was because of the patent expirations and whatnot. But what we try and do is make sure that our businesses have a good distribution, and that's why we did the PCH acquisition a couple years ago was because Consumer had gotten down to about 16 to 17% of our business, and we felt it was going to become insignificant in the space.</p>
          <p>And we wanted to get it to about 25%. I think it's 26% now. So no, I think that one of the great strengths is the diversification of the businesses and being broadly based. And I think that's something that &#x2013; we've adhered to that, and as I've said many times, we get challenged on it all the time. But the reality of it is that it does afford you lots of opportunities to insulate yourself, to continue to grow.</p>
          <p>I think the question on Pharmaceuticals, they are becoming more expensive and more challenging. But I also think that that is part of how we have to just get better at what we do. We also have to work with the regulatory bodies to look at it's called the critical path analysis in the United States. There's another program in Europe.</p>
          <p>But it's using new technology and new advances to be able to look for early approvals, earlier approval by validating cardiotoxic products and taking them out early on and things like that so we can get an earlier approval with reimbursement with the post-marketing surveillance. I think there are a lot of approaches that could be taken.</p>
          <p>But the environment, whether you look at it as Consumer or whether you look at it in Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics and the 510(k) that's under challenge, or the Pharmaceutical business, I think the regulatory environment for every one of them is going to get tougher and tougher and we're just going to have to get better to deal with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then, Dominic, on a global level, in the context of your guidance for the economically sensitive components of the businesses, does 2010 reflect halfway recovery, three-quarter way recovery? I mean where are you in that continuum? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said earlier, our business leaders have told us that they see some stabilization of some markets and some continued improvement, too early to say that it's over. In fact, the current rates of growth are still behind what they were a year ago. So what we're seeing is less of a decline in growth moving forward, right? But the markets are still growing at a rate that's negative in some cases or slower than they have been. So I can't quantify it for you, Bruce, but we do see some improvement, but we're not out of it yet.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in, Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray. One for Bob; you mentioned in one of your remarks that your using, as you have been using this mix of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean Bill or Dominic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, Bill. I'll ask Bob that question later. I wanted to ask, in your remarks you mentioned that you're pursuing or you have pursued a mix of internal and external programs to fill out your pipeline, and I wanted to get a sense of greater number of new product launches required to fill the pipeline, maybe larger new product launches required as you get larger and larger.</p>
          <p>How should we think about the mix of that strategy and what are you doing maybe to change the way you invest to respond to the need, if it is in fact a need, for greater and greater external partnerships and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the external partnerships are like everything else, is whether the opportunity presents itself or not. We've been very interested in the area of let's say vaccines, and Crucell offers us a great opportunity not only to get the vaccines that we want to work with but also to have an investment in a company that allows us to be able to work more closely within organizations.</p>
          <p>The mix, I think we've identified the therapeutic areas that we think really offer the largest opportunities for growth and many of them are tied to demographics and everything else that we'll be investing in. And I don't think they're much different than many other companies, so we all have identified those areas for growth. If you look at our Pharm business, if you go into Medical Devices &amp; Diagnostics, it ties much the same. If you look at orthopedics, cardiovasculars, diabetes, you look at these areas that are huge opportunities.</p>
          <p>So I think in each one of them, we're going to continue to invest internally. And obviously the best thing is to take the $7 billion we're investing and be able to generate products like SIMPONI or STELARA or SEDASYS, or the Fibrin Pad. But if we see other opportunities to license or to partner &#x2013; partner may be an even more strategic investment than just a license, but we will continue to take advantage of each one of those in the areas where we see again the biggest opportunities for growth in the corporation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One follow-up for Bill on the regulatory environment. The FDA is moving forward it seems like with more hearings and more discussion around the 510(k) process. It seems like in some of your businesses, you're already trying to do more in your 510(k) with data or emphasis on PMA [Premarket Approval Application]. How do you see that affecting what you do in your Device business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know it's kind of a double-edged sword. The 510(k) has always been a very good regulatory pathway for products that have a pre-existing product that you can build off of. But there's also a need for I think PMAs and others to be able to establish these products. It can offer a barrier of entry for others to go in instead of making it easier ways to enter into the market. But I think they both are very important.</p>
          <p>If you're going to go into a new area, we do want to do the work to bring the science behind it to ensure that we have safety and efficacy of the products that we're going to put in the marketplace. But if you have a predicate device and you can build off of it, the PMA is still an important way to do it. And personally for safety of patients, we want to make sure that our device is working and working the way it's supposed to be working.</p>
          <p>So I think that the movement to use 510(k) is a very &#x2013; or the ability to use 510(k) is very important. I don't think everybody &#x2013; everything should move to a new regulatory pathway, but I think some products should definitely be going through PMAs and other things.</p>

          <p>One last follow-up for Dominic. Louise, you mentioned some of the impact on cost of goods was due to restructuring expenses not taken out in the quarter. I was wondering if you could help quantify that at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the change between the two years in the fourth quarter of our cost of goods sold, which I think was about a 330 basis point difference, I'd say half of that is due to the mix of the business, and the other half is due to either restructuring cost in 2009, not in 2008. Or as Louise mentioned, there were some positive aspects in 2008 but not in 2009; so half mix and half in let's call it special items, not quite special items but one-time or unusual items in the COGS line.</p>
