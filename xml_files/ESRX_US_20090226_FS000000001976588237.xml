          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, David Myers.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning everyone and welcome to our conference call.  With me today are George Paz, our CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to read the following statement.  Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include but are not necessarily limited to financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations, or intentions.  These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties.  The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>In addition, the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income and the net cash provided by operating activities can be found in our earnings release, which is on our website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Hall, who will discuss our fourth quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.  As most of you already know, Express Scripts had another strong quarter and year.  Earnings per share were up 30% for 2008 and we have guided to 19% growth, at the midpoint of our range for 2009.  Cash flow from operations was 1.1 billion, up 29% from 2007.  And return on invested capital was 26.8%, up from 23.7% in 2007.</p>
          <p>We attribute this success to the continued focus on our model of alignment.  We only make money when our clients save money.  We're expanding the differentiation of this model through our behavior-centric approach.  That is the application of human behavior theory and behavioral economics to the pharmacy benefit.  By using technology to tailor our offerings and interactions to each individual, we can increase therapy adherence and lower cost of care, delivering lower costs and better health outcome.  And in this economic environment, saving money is more important than ever to many of our clients.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our results in a little more detail.  Earnings per share was $0.83 for the quarter, a 20% increase over the prior year; and $3.10 for the year, a 30% increase.  Our industry leading generic fill rate reached a record of 67.3% in the fourth quarter, up 3.6 percentage points from last year.  This increase drove both savings for our clients as well as contributing to our gross profit, which was up 19% from last year's fourth quarter.  We believe there is significantly more room to grow use of generics and low cost brands and increase the savings for our plan sponsors and members.</p>
          <p>We've also had encouraging results in home delivery this year that can be directly attributed to our behavior centric model.  As we've mentioned in the past, we made a strategic decision to allow several low margin mail fulfillment clients to roll off over the past several quarters.  Excluding the effect of this decision, our home delivery claims grew almost 5% in 2008.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we also continued to invest heavily in growth initiatives as well as prepare for the implementation of 226 new clients for 2009.  As a result of these investments and the 11 million of spending related to a security incident, SG&amp;A was up 23.6 million sequentially.  In Q1 and over the course of 2009, we expect SG&amp;A spending to return to 2008 average levels.</p>
          <p>Even with this increased level of investment, our EBITDA per Rx for the quarter was $2.90, up 16% from the prior year.</p>
          <p>The December quarter also marked the fourth consecutive quarter of earnings growth for our SAAS [Specialty and Ancillary Services] segment.  Earnings for this segment grew 32% sequentially and 84% for the year.  As you know, we have many different businesses in this segment, but one of the primary drivers of this improvement is the success we have had in integrating our specialty pharmacy operation with the operations of our core PBM.  These units are becoming one world class organization, driving better service and outcomes for our clients and members; and in keeping our model of alignment, increased profits for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2009, we still expect our diluted earnings per share will be in the range of $3.63 to $3.73, growth of 17 to 20% from 2008.  This strong outlook for 2009 continues our history of improving profitability by lowering costs for our clients.  This performance is driven by our differentiated model of alignment with the behavior centric approach.</p>
          <p>Finally, although we do not provide quarterly guidance, consistent with our prior experience, we expect Q1 earnings per share to be flat to slightly down compared to the $0.83 in Q4.  Also in Q1, SG&amp;A and net interest expense are expected to return to Q3 levels.</p>
          <p>We look forward to delivering another year savings for our clients and earnings growth for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone.  Before I comment on our prospects for 2009, I would like to briefly reflect on the success we achieved in 2008.  As a result of a tough economy, clients were more motivated than ever to lower their pharmacy spend, a trend that will continue throughout 2009.  The timing couldn't be better.  Our business model's alignment along with the differentiated behavior centric approach, what we refer to as Consumerology, is significantly improving our ability to deliver better health and value to our clients and to our patients.</p>
          <p>Clients are eager to adopt our new and innovative methodologies to promote the benefits of generics, home delivery, and specialty management.  We assisted our clients in driving out wasteful spend in the pharmacy benefit through the greater use of generics, which is evidenced by our industry leading generic fill rate.  We are driving toward an all-time low trend for our clients and a decrease in our members' copayments for the second year on a row.  This is especially important because the decrease in average member copayment was driven by more cost effective behaviors of members, not reductions in copayments by our clients.  In short, we are helping plan sponsors and members via our behavior-centric approach.</p>
          <p>Complementing our business models is a strong service offering, confirmed by J.D. Power and Associates, ranking our home delivery customer satisfaction ahead of our two largest PBM competitors.</p>
          <p>As we enter 2009, the continued turbulence in the broader economy provides the backdrop for Express Scripts to continue to do what we do best.  Now more than ever, our clients need us and we have being working tirelessly to produce solutions that will help drive out the waste in the pharmacy benefit while improving health outcomes and keeping employees productive and satisfied.</p>
          <p>Our confidence for 2009 and beyond is based on a clear understanding of what plans sponsors are looking for, and that is greater control of costs alongside optimal health outcomes.  Our distinct business model of alignment positions us ahead of our competitors to deliver with greater focus, objectivity, and evidence based recommendations.  We have a proven track record with our industry leading generic fill rate, which by the way is still at the top of every plan sponsor's priority list.  If it is wasteful spend we're after in these economic times, then it is imperative that we seek out the right balance of generics and low cost brands.  Combine this with the benefits of home delivery and a comprehensive specialty offering and you can see how our value proposition is in greater demand than ever before.</p>
          <p>But the fact is the appropriate clinical programs and services are the foundational capabilities of all major PBMs.  The key to success is not just having the appropriate clinical programs, but the challenge for us and in healthcare in general is the engagement of individuals, adoption of these programs, and adherence to protocols, in other words patient behavior.  No longer are we willing to sit on the sidelines hoping that financial incentives and more education can get the job done.  That is the reason we are taking an innovative, behavior centric approach to better management of the pharmacy benefit.</p>
          <p>The early results, as Jeff motioned, are encouraging and quite frankly fascinating.  This type of innovation is empowering.  This is innovation that matters today.  It allows us to take on our clients' key challenges with a new set of tools.  We are continuing to cross-fertilize these proven, indisputable psychological principles and are applying them to develop solutions that are intuitive, effective, and innovative.  And as we can all understand, our clients' thirst for innovation is considerable.</p>
          <p>As we have stated previously, we have a significant number of pilot programs already in production around the application of some of these key psychological principles.  While it is still too early to report on many of them, I can share with you that we expanded beyond home delivery, and we are aggressively exploring the areas of therapy adherence and specialty.  Our advisory board of thought leading academics is motivated to develop new innovative solutions for these two particular societal challenges.</p>
          <p>And finally, there has been a lot of conversation around a PBM's role in healthcare reform.  With our proven track record of managing the waste out of the pharmacy benefit, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities on the horizon.  For example, we will benefit from more individuals gaining coverage, accelerated adoption of e-Prescribing, and the swift development of a biogeneric pathway.  All of these will benefit us in the future.</p>
          <p>We are excited about our position in the PBM industry and the opportunity to deliver value to our clients and stockholders in the future.</p>
          <p>That concludes our prepared remarks and we'd now be happy to open it up for questions.  Operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  We'll go to the line of Charles Boorady with Citi.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks, good morning.  I'm wondering if you can comment on recent legislation, the stimulus bill, and what's in the Obama budget to the extent that you've had a chance to look at it.  And I saw something biogenerics related, and just comment generally on how we should think about the impact of all the change taking place in Washington on your long-term growth prospects.  And is there anything we need to worry about near term that would have a positive or negative impact on you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, thank you for the question.  Clearly, it's very early.  From a budget perspective, it was introduced.  The great news, we've been working tirelessly in Washington to try to influence a biogenerics pathway that makes sense for the population at large, and we're very pleased that what we've seen so far come through the legislation.  And that looks like it's more of a five-year period and it looks like it's got all the right components to it.  Now obviously we're a long way from actual introduction of bills, but it's certainly the right start.  It's both what our trade association and Express Scripts on its own, our Dr. Miller and our folks in DC have worked, as I said earlier, extensively on.</p>
          <p>I think overall to be an economy and a country with such profound wealth, if you'll allow me to define it that way in these times, [not] to have so many uninsured is not a good thing.  And I think we're moving in the right path.  I think it's going to be tough to try to control the budget during this process.  But each of these &#x2013; the steps that the government is taking to try to provide healthcare, especially to our children, to those in need, is at the end of the day a good thing.</p>
          <p>A lot of what you see in the stimulus program is around getting the electronic records and cost effective solutions for healthcare.  Those are very important.  There is a tremendous amount of protocols out there today, which is part of my prepared remarks, that are just not being followed.  And if the protocols around diabetes and asthma and many of the other disease states that we've done a tremendous amount of research on could be better followed, healthcare would go up significantly in this country.  It's very hard to do without wiring all the providers of healthcare.</p>
          <p>As we move down that path, I truly believe healthcare will become better.  And I think Express Scripts in particular and PBMs in general are very well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities that lay in front of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When would we be ready with the specific dollar amounts in terms of the profit potential or revenue potential from biogenerics legislation and other changes enacted or that are likely to be enacted?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're closely monitoring that, and we will provide that information once we see a final bill.  There is going to be a lot of lobbying going on obviously around this.  We will work hard to try to keep it in the best interest of our plan sponsors and our members.  And there will be other people with different agendas that will be working at some cross-purposes in certain situations.  And so we'll keep you posted but we'll provide that information once we see what it is we have to work with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  And next, we'll go to the line of Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen.  So can you talk a bit about the utilization trends you're seeing in the business?  And certainly obviously there is so much talk about the tough economy and increases in the unemployment rate.  One, obviously as we approach 10% unemployment, what does that mean for your business?  Are there certain areas that are impacted more than others?  And then relative to the previous comment, with Obama's clear support of generics, does that potentially provide some offset in certain pieces of the business where maybe doing step therapy or more aggressive formulary control could move the needle to offset maybe some of the volume weakness?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a great question and observation.  There are clearly opportunities.  Jeff, you can chime in here when I'm finished.  But utilization trends are down; they're down from prior years.  That's a bit alarming when you consider the aging of the population and the trend in diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, on and on.  And so the declining utilization rates long term cannot be good for us as a country.</p>
          <p>The other side of that though, which is I think your observation, is what we're really seeing today is more of a thirst for the member to conserve their own personal net worth.  And we've seen just unbelievable adoptions of the step therapy programs in a positive manner and people going online and reaching out, or our people reaching out to them and advising them of cost savings opportunities.</p>
          <p>At the end of the day, we refer to waste as a dollar spend for no additional clinical value and there is a lot of that in healthcare, whether it's very expensive brands when there is a cheaper brand alternative or whether it's an expensive brand where there is a generic alternative.  And what we're seeing because of the way we align our business with our members and our plan sponsors is that those members move away from the least effective cost &#x2013; the higher cost products to the more cost effective products and better products.  Their copays come down and obviously the plan sponsors save money and our shareholders make money, and that is gaining a tremendous amount of traction.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, the plan sponsors on the other hand are reaching out.  Again, at top of everyone's list is let's get the waste out of the pharmacy spend, even though it may be zero for many of our clients, negative for many, many clients, 1 or 2% for some of our other clients, every dollar you can save.  One thing I refer to is every $20,000 you save out of the pharmacy benefit ex-waste, you can keep an employee or drive more value to your bottom line.  And I think people are really understanding that and they're moving in that direction.  So we're seeing a tremendous amount of support in our clinical programs and movement to mail and specialty and certainly a biogenerics pipeline when you consider the cost of many of the biogenerics that are &#x2013; or many of the specialty products that are out there.  There is a tremendous opportunity for all the PBMs and I think Express Scripts in particular to take out a lot of cost and add a lot of value to the healthcare system.  Jeff, if you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I mean specifically on unemployment, the way we think about it here is as we prepare for the year and to give guidance, we actually go through client by client, bringing in the accounting teams.   The account team talks about specifics about clients.  And then we make assumptions about what gain or loss of employees insured at that client will be.  And then we roll that all up into our plan for the year.  So what we don't do is try to extrapolate that into a total US unemployment rate.  We think our book of business is not necessarily exactly equal to the US mix.  But certainly we feel pretty good that we've done a detailed job on what unemployment will do to our book of business.  And at this point, we still feel very comfortable with our guidance for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really helpful.  And just quickly, Jeff, relative to the guidance, you guys are generating a ton of cash.  We've seen some cash buildup on the balance sheet.  I know these are times when capital is certainly at a premium, and you guys have obviously shown phenomenal returns on your capital.  Could you talk about one, the degree to which share repurchase or other utilizations of the free cash are contemplated in guidance?  And to some degree, there is less so contemplated, what's the current thought process on where you feel like the capital structure is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  So we have I would say an average amount of share repurchase contemplated in our guidance, although it is certainly more towards the back end of the year.  We've been locked up all the first quarter so far from buyback.  So anything we do will start &#x2013; won't really start to impact the P&amp;L and earnings until really the third or even fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But really our look for cash hasn't changed.  I would much prefer to do zero buybacks and use that money to either invest in growth opportunities internal to the business or to invest that money in solid external M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just quick as a follow-up just in terms of where you're focused there, I mean is it continuing to beef up the specialty side of the business?  Are there assets available in that space or other broad growth niches that you see opportunity in that maybe you don't currently play in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are lots of opportunities.  At the end of the day, it comes down to is the price that people want equal to the value that we see.  And we obviously have very high expectations of value creation on deals we do.  It's around what we do today but I'm not for obvious reasons going to go into specifics about what the target might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't expect you to.  Thank you very much gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, operator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I did open Robert Willoughby's line with Banc of America.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I must have missed that.  I guess George, you still look at stock performance here certainly not mirroring the operating results that you just reported or your vision of the future and I guess it's just guilt by association with the managed care names, which may be more in the crosshairs from the Obama reform issues.  But what strikes you of everything you've seen and heard as particularly offensive about any of these reform initiatives?  I know you're positive on generics and the need for the services.  But what are people focusing in your view that creates this concern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe that the one of the biggest concerns is just purely the uncertainty.  When we talk about picking up millions and millions of uninsured into the rolls &#x2013; and again, I think we do need to cover children.  But at the end of the day when we don't explain how we can pay for it when we're facing staggering debt levels as a country and we don't have a whole lot of clarity around how we're going to not only provide the coverage but also how we're going to fund that coverage, I think that causes a tremendous amount of unrest.</p>
          <p>You know this better than I do, Robert, but I think uncertainty puts a risk to your stock price, and I do believe that the underlying trends are incredibly positive for PBMs in general and for us in particular.  But I think that pure uncertainty is still something that's just pushing on our stock price.  And to your point, a lot of the cutbacks in Medicare reimbursement rates certainly affect a lot of the managed care players, but it has had a disproportionate effect on our stock price as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I just saw from the K you cut head count by 1,000 lives year over year.  I know you did an acquisition.  I know you've got Stiften there, but where are the other 999 guys that you let go, what areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, Ed Stiften was an incredibly smart guy, but he only counted as one.  So there was a &#x2013; we sold off our infusion business, and so that was a lot of the head count change.  Pat McNamee, who runs our operations and technology, has actually done a superb job of redeploying technology to take out unneeded steps that aren't really adding value to our clients and our members.  So there has been a real focus around that, keeping head count &#x2013; actually driving head count down in operations and IT and some of the back office type areas.</p>
          <p>But overall, we are still investing.  Our account management side, our CPMs and our salespeople, we've actually grown that side of the business with head count.  So I think to just your earlier point, we are very cognizant of what drives value and we invest heavily in those areas where we believe value can be created, but try to cut back in those areas that aren't adding value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Next question is from John Kreger with William Blair.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much, two unrelated questions.  Jeff, behind the guidance that you reiterated, has your thinking changed at all over the last couple of months about the balance between underlying claims and improving profitability per claim that underpins that guidance?  And then the second question, George, another healthcare reform question, could you help us size your Medicare Part D and PDP business, just how big and how important of a growth driver has that been in recent years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>John, on the first question, the simple is answer is no.  The underlying assumptions around share growth and EBITDA per Rx growth have not changed.  As we look at it, we guided 19% growth.  But what's interesting this year is that of that 19% growth at the midpoint, almost 17% of it is coming from profitability improvements in EBITDA per Rx growth, which is a lot higher percentage of the total than in past years.</p>
          <p>As you know, we stopped our share buyback back in the July timeframe, as we discussed earlier.  And as a result, we aren't seeing the kind of capital structure improvement that we normally see.  So we're actually achieving all the growth this year based on EBITDA per Rx, a lot of programs in here. George was talking about productivity improvements, other efficiency improvements, things we're just doing better and better as time goes on, and that's what's driving the growth.  But again, the underlying assumptions have not changed from what we guided.</p>

          <p>John, from a Medicare perspective, we decided early on we weren't going to compete directly against our clients.  We try very hard to avoid conflict and enforce our model of alignment.  So we work closely with our clients.</p>
          <p>Many of our managed care clients are in the Medicare business, and our job is to help them be competitive and to grow that book of business.  Ed Ignaczak and Larry Zarin on the sales and the marketing side work closely with those clients to put the right products in front of them; but also from Larry's perspective, he goes out and helps our managed care clients in selling the prescription benefits to their ultimate client and helping their sales force understand the nuances of pharmacy.  And I think that's paying big dividends for us.</p>
          <p>Roughly 10% of our total volume is out of the Medicare side of the business.  But again, that's not direct through us.  That's though our managed care programs.  We don't take the reimbursement risk, if you will.  That's not our expertise.  We don't have people that do that.  But we do work, we understand them.  We're sympathetic to the situation that our managed care clients face, so we work very closely with them from our pricing and underwriting individuals to help them figure out ways to stay competitive as the government looks at ratcheting down reimbursement rates and what have you so that they can stay competitive by taking the waste out of the pharmacy benefit area.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks, just a couple quick questions, one on related healthcare reform, just a quick for George; any disproportionate impact relative to you versus your peers from any reform that we could or may see?  And then secondly for Jeff, you have a Generic Pharmaceutical Association conference this week, some more discussion around pricing in generics firming up or stabilizing.  So on that topic, any impact that you're seeing or any way that we should be thinking about either the impact to your business or your sourcing decisions on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the disproportionate side, the only thing I can tell you is that I believe we are second to none from a clinical approach.  Again, it's built into our DNA, if you will, the whole concept of taking waste out of the system.  And so our programs, our systems, our call center associates, everybody in our company understands the drive is to go after the generic opportunities where appropriate and to convert people to mail or specialty where appropriate.</p>
          <p>And so I just think that we're very well positioned to take care of the opportunities as they come down.  It's not like we have to reinvent or put new programs in place.  We've got the programs.  We've got the opportunities, and now we just have to conform them to whatever drugs come to market.  So I don't &#x2013; on its face, there isn't a greater opportunity.  I think our industry leading generic fill rate probably gives us a tremendous opportunity to take that to the next level.  Jeff, do you want to speak to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, on generics overall, the generic industry is a highly competitive commodity business; and as such, it is credibly price competitive.  We haven't seen any change at all in the price competitive nature of that industry nor do we expect to see any change in the price competitive of that industry.  So I mean I've heard the rumors too, but we haven't started seeing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're not seeing any impact from any of the manufacturing issues that we're seeing across some of the smaller manufacturers out there that's impacting your sourcing decisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, we spend a lot of time looking at quality control and analyzing our vendors and making decisions about which vendors we're going to use based on quality, based on manufacturability, based on the controls they have in their plants.  So the simple answer is we aren't seeing any big issues, but we're also spending a lot of time and effort making sure we don't.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning.  George, I know you may have said this, so I apologize if I missed it.  But on the last call, you gave us an update on number of new accounts you had won for '09. I think it's like 226 with 1.4 million lives.  Do you have an update on that today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is basically that same number, that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it; and then with Consumerology, obviously a lot of detail about changing consumer behavior.  As you think about the mail business, you've done a great job of growing your profit per script in your business over the last five years, though you said your mail scripts have been fairly stable, and I know you say some customers are more profitable than others.  Do you think of &#x2013; as you think about 2010 and 2011, do you see that mail script number reaccelerating for you besides the fact that you can still grow your margins as you drive down your customer costs?  Or do you just think of it as a broader look under the covers to think about which customers are more profitable than others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, I think our ROIC speaks to our focus on profitability.  And because we align our business, our focus on profitability isn't at the cost of our members or our plan sponsors.  Our focus on profitability complements what our plan sponsors are trying to accomplish and driving out the cost and the waste.  So we do look at that closely.  I'll be quite honest with you, Larry.  I don't really want to just put pills in bottles.  That doesn't do a whole lot.  It doesn't excite me a whole lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we have a mail-only opportunity and they really don't want anything more than us from us but to put pills in bottles, unless it's going to be at a pretty decent margin, I don't necessarily want to tie up our people on that.  I would rather &#x2013; I think our whole business model is run around alignment, taking out the waste.  And the beauty of it is because that's what we focus and that's what we do.  It's easy to keep our employees focused on what they need to do.  And if all there is, is an external adjudicator that hands us the scripts and we put the pills in the bottle, then we're not really doing anything there except fulfilling an order.</p>
          <p>And so what we've seen over the last couple of years, and Jeff has been a big part of this, is to really help us focus on those clients where we can take our offering to the next level and add more value to our clients in total.  So what we've seen and Jeff referred to was the fact that we've lost some of our mail-only clients.  In the early days when we were pretty small, we looked at scale as a pretty important component to try to be competitive in the marketplace.  I think we have enough scale to be competitive in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>So the question now is how do you make sure that you take that scale to the next level, and that is use that scale to influence the supply chain.  And again, if you don't have any control over a formulary, if you have no control over step therapies or clinical programs, then that scale can actually dilute your overall value proposition of the supply chain.  So we are really focused on ROIC and profitability.  Adding units for the sake of units but destroying shareholder value is not something we're excited about or interested in.  So our growth will come.</p>
          <p>As Jeff said in his comments, if you take out the clients that have gone off the book over the last couple years, mail would have grown by 5%.  I will tell you I'm not happy by a 5% mail order growth rate, and that's the whole idea behind Consumerology.  The financial incentives have got us to the mail penetration rate we have.  The next question is how do you get that number to ultimately get more involved in their healthcare, overall healthcare situations that they are controlling both the outcomes of their healthcare and the costs associated with those outcomes.  And that's what we're dealing with, our consumer centric model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good and then just a quick follow-up, speaking of ROIC, you mentioned consistently the idea about not competing with your customers on Part D.  I certainly understand that.  You said today about 10% of our business Medicare servicing your customers, obviously not directly, but how do you think about that?  If those customers are under margin variability because of reimbursement, do you still feel like there's a good opportunity for you to drive that value and do you do that through various programs?  Or if they are suffering under margin pressure, are you concerned about that spilling back down to you at some point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The people that offer these programs &#x2013; that's a great question by the way, Larry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The people that offer these programs are very sophisticated buyers.  So they are constantly looking at us and trying to figure out how do we help them compete in an extremely competitive marketplace.  I think that's where we are again second to none.  Our account management team has dedicated resources to each of those clients that go out and visit with them on a regular basis, some daily, some monthly.  Sometimes they sit in the clients' offices.  But the whole idea there is to make sure that we stay in front of them, not with opinions but with facts, so that we can show them what's actually taking place and help them fight for the new lives and growth because, as we tell them, their growth is our growth.  So I do think there is constant pressure.  But at the end of the day, Larry, we only make after tax, after all the capital and everything else, not a whole lot over $1 a script.  So there is only so much value you can take out of a PBM.</p>
          <p>The other side to that is there is a lot of value that we gain by driving up the generic fill rate by 400 basis points or driving up the mail penetration rate by 400 basis points.  The dollars saved there far exceeds our profitability.  So the idea is to make sure that we give them those answers to help them implement solutions that can be sold to their clients, not disrupting the members from their work activities but driving out the waste.  And so that remains a big focus for us.</p>
          <p>The last thing here is keep in mind that Medicare reimbursement is somewhat cyclical.  It comes and it goes.  What happens is they keep cutting back providers' reimbursement rates.  People start dropping out, coverage isn't there.  All of a sudden, you've got to start increasing again.  The doctors' lobbying starts to work.  The hospital lobbying starts to work.  So these things all come and go over time.  And the idea is we have to be the constant for those clients that has a constant message of taking out the waste and try to help them fight through those cyclical cycles.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, two quick ones if I could.  George, you've made obviously some very nice progress improving the profitability of your specialty segment.  I know there are a lot of different things in there, but should we expect any additional mix changes in that business?  Are there businesses you're in that you want to get out of?  Are there businesses that you're not in that you'd like to get into?  And then secondarily, Jeff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that it sounds like there is plenty of opportunity to continue to move the generic dispensing rate higher.  I just want to understand. Is that based on the schedule of upcoming generic introductions, or are you suggesting that you can move that number higher even just given the current availability of generics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll address the first part and obviously Jeff can take the second piece.  I think for specialty, here's one of the problems with specialty, just to be totally frank.  If you look at our numbers, and we try to segment this; and as Jeff said earlier, when you look at specialty, it's really in our book we have a small distribution business.  We have what we call HealthBridge, which works for pharmaceutical companies on some reimbursement services.  I can go on for days.  There is a whole hodgepodge of different stuff in there, some of it being very adversely affected by changes such as our PAP programs, our Patient Assistance Programs.  As more and more individuals become eligible for Medicaid and/or for Medicare, those people fall out of the PAP programs.  They're still good programs, still very profitable, but they are declining, so it has a negative impact on profitability for that segment.</p>
          <p>The other side of the equation is specialty is a very important component of the pharmacy benefit management.  We bought CuraScript followed by the Priority acquisition to position us to be able to still compete on what we need to do and that is control trend.  Although specialty spend is relatively small, the fastest component of drug inflation or trend expansion is still around specialty.  It's growing at a fairly fast clip.  And if you look at the pipeline, that's where the big drugs are.  That's were the big dollars of the future are.</p>
          <p>Now here's where it gets complicated.  I believe that that offering needs to be integrated with the overall pharmacy benefit management.  It's not like I can send out an account manager to work with your company on specialty and then have somebody totally different working with you on the pharmacy side.  If you do that, then you've got to still work with the same plan design.  You've still got to work with the same opportunities.  You've got to make sure that if there is a step therapy program, we try the oral solids before we move over to the more expensive specialty therapies first if we truly want to control trend, and that's where that's important or appropriate.  So I think that these lines are becoming very blurred.</p>
          <p>One of the things we do, and I'm not sure how our competitors do it, but all of our specialty runs through our retail, and there is a fair amount of that.  It's still reported in our PBM.  All the specialty goes through our mail order, so that's where we don't actually have the high-touch, hands-on clinical values around specialty.  So if it's being dispensed out of one of our mail order pharmacies because all they want us to do for this client is to deliver the specialty product, that's being driven through our mail order operations and thus reported in our PBM segment or in our PBM component.</p>
          <p>Rebates, we view rebates as something we manage on behalf of our clients, so all of our client rebates are reported in our PBM segment.  And of course to the extent we keep our share, that will go straight down to the bottom line in operating profits.  So the lines are very, very blurred when it comes to specialty.  I will tell you specialty is a very important component of our current PBM as well as our future in controlling drug trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so on generics, we're at 67% today.  We think that number can go a lot higher.  And the answer to your question is really both.  We have clients today that with the current mix of generic drugs have generic fill rates that approach 80%.  Certainly there is a lot of effort on our part to move people along that curve.  Certainly in the economic environment we're facing today, we're seeing a lot of interesting clients to move on to more step therapy programs and to move on the other programs that we have that drive generic fill rate up.</p>
          <p>The other side of that is of course new generics come out of a year.  2009 actually ends up being a pretty light year, down about 30% I think from 2008 in net generic impact, and pretty back-end loaded with two-thirds of the benefit from new generics really coming in the second half of the year.  But over time, we've got some really big years out in the future that we're going to see a lot of new generics come on and that's going to drive up the generic fill rate. And then of course, biogenerics we talked about earlier today.  As we see biogenerics come in, that's going to be a third leg really on this for additional leverage to grow generic fill rates.</p>
