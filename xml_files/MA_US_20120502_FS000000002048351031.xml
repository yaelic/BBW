          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 MasterCard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Pam and I will be your operator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Barbara Gasper, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Pam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today either by phone or webcast for a discussion about our first quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call today are Ajay Banga, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&amp;A session. Up until then no one is actually registered to ask a question.</p>
          <p>This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at MasterCard.com. The earnings release and slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A dial-in replay of this call will be available for one week through May 9.</p>
          <p>Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Ajay Banga. Ajay?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody.</p>
          <p>So the first quarter we reported a net revenue growth as reported of 17%; that's driven by healthy process transaction and volume growth, and this helped to fuel net income growth of 21% and EPS growth of 25%. We continue to see some improvement in U.S. economic news with unemployment dropping to 8.2%, a three-year low, below the 9% we saw a year ago. Consumer confidence while roughly flat to month is higher than a year ago, and of course this was offset by news the housing market has recently hit its lowest level in a decade. You have seen the ADP payroll report this  morning.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, the overall trends continued to have a positive impact on total consumer retail spending as reflected in our SpendingPulse Insight which showed that in March U.S. consumer increased spending in all 11 retail sectors that we track. The strongest growth came from restaurants, apparel, hardware and electronics.</p>
          <p>For this trend to continue for a sustained period of time we're going to look for additional improvement in unemployment and a positive turn in housing prices. Having said all that, this strength in consumer spending as a whole also showed up in MasterCard's own U.S. GDV, which is up 14% for the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In Europe, quarterly volumes remained strong growing 19%, slightly above the level we've actually seen over the recent quarters. This was driven by both strong cross-border and domestic volume growth, and similar to the last quarter processed transactions in the region were up over 40% in the first quarter as we continue to benefit from the roll-on of domestic processing in the Netherlands. And while there has been renewed concerns in the press about European consumer confidence, a little interesting fact, it actually held steady in the Eurozone this past quarter after significant declines in the second half of 2011. It does take a few quarters before changing consumer sentiment impacts our volumes in this region and as such, we are watching our European business very closely.</p>
          <p>Looking at our first quarter we saw process volumes for Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, in aggregate, continue to post growth rates in the mid-teens. New business wins, particularly in Italy and Ireland were compensating for the slowing in Spain and Greece in these peripheral economies, as they are called.</p>
          <p>Elsewhere in the world, Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa, region volume growth remains healthy with domestic and cross-border volume growth rates all greater than 20%. Volume growth in these regions will have difficult comparisons particularly in the second and third quarters of 2012. Also be mindful that any softening in the major economies of Europe or the U.S. would likely negatively impact these regions as well.</p>
          <p>But in the meanwhile, we continue to execute our business strategy. And the first item I want to focus on is the U.S. debit market where we are executing well in a challenging and shifting environment. We mentioned last year that the primary element of our U.S. debit strategy post the Durbin amendment was to maximize our presence on these cards. Before the regulations went into effect, MasterCard functionality was at approximately 25% of U.S. debit cards. Now MasterCard is enabled on about half, including three of the largest portfolios in the market.</p>
          <p>In addition, we estimate that our share of PIN debit transactions exceeded 20% in April, up from high single digits last year. It's too soon to know how routing will play out longer term. In the short term we have roughly doubled our presence in U.S. debit cards and nearly tripled our share of U.S. PIN debit transactions.</p>
          <p>At this point I usually walk through a series of business highlights from around the world but instead, given that we have passed the one-year anniversary of both the acquisitions of DataCash and Access Prepaid, I thought it would be helpful to you this time to update you on the progress we have made with these businesses. Recall that these extend MasterCard capabilities in the payments value chain in fast-growing categories: e-commerce and prepaid.</p>
          <p>In both cases, the integration into the MasterCard business is largely complete and behind us. We have been moving people across the businesses as you would expect, such as Ajay Bhalla, who moved over from our Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa region to run the DataCash business and Neville Hall, MasterCard's new global Head of Compliance, who's coming to us from the Access Prepaid business, and there are others at all levels below them. And this type of movement will continue to ensure that we build over time an integrated culture of innovation and accountability.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about each business in a bit more depth. Let's start with Access Prepaid, which we bought from Travelex in April 2011. For us to be successful in prepaid around the world, we need to have three core capabilities: brand, processing and program management. This Access Prepaid acquisition provides us with program management capabilities across multiple markets with a strong position in the all-important travel vertical and a position we will continue to leverage for future growth. In this past year, 2011, Access Prepaid saw substantial growth. Volume on Access Prepaid cards increased roughly 25% versus 2010. And just as important, we are continuing to build a foundation for future growth.</p>
          <p>Since the end of 2010, we have entered seven additional markets including Germany, China, India and South Korea. In India for example, we signed a deal with Thomas Cook, the largest moneychanger in that country. They will begin issuing Access Prepaid MasterCards in the second half of this year, displacing the competitive cards that they currently distribute. In Australia, we launched a multi-currency purse that can hold as many as 10 currencies. This capability allowed us to gain a foothold with National Australia Bank, which traditionally has been an issuer of a competitor's cards.</p>
          <p>So now let's move on to our DataCash Internet gateway business, which we purchased about 18 months back. DataCash enables acquirers to efficiently gain new business. It also helps merchants and consumers connect via e-commerce over any type of device from personal computer to phone or a tablet, with speed, dependability and security. And as we connect more high-volume merchants and more of the world's leading acquirers together, we increase our opportunity to drive acceptance and preference for MasterCard products.</p>
          <p>Like other e-commerce gateways, DataCash handles non-MasterCard transactions as well. So even if you don't switch the transaction, which does happen as you know in many markets, we'll still see it and we have an opportunity to gain insights from the breadth of transactions we see. Similar to Access Prepaid, we are expanding the geographic reach of DataCash services, helping to drive nearly 25% transaction growth over the past year.</p>
          <p>Let me tell you a little bit about how we're growing this gateway services business. The first way we go-to-market is to sell to merchants directly and then deliver that business to acquirers. Over the past year or so, we have directly signed up several thousand merchants including many in the travel sector. I'll give you a few examples: JetStar and Scoot; both airlines in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa; Artic Air in the U.K.; Eurostar, the European rail operator; Volotea, a Spanish airline; Hertz Africa. We've added these merchants to a portfolio of customers that already included marquee names like Qantas and Singapore Airlines. There have also been numerous merchants beyond the travel sector such as Groupon in Taiwan and several retailers in the U.K. including Ocado, a grocery delivery service, and Sports Direct Group. That's the first way we go-to-market.</p>
          <p>The second go-to-market strategy is to white-label our services for acquirers to include in their offering to merchants. So Unicredit for example, an Italian acquirer, also a big client of ours as a bank, is live with the gateway functionality and first started servicing merchants in Eastern Europe. Elavon, part of U.S. Bancorp, is also actively using our white-label offering for its own newly launched gateway solution in Europe. And there are more of these in the hopper to come.</p>
          <p>The third way we go-to-market is to bundle our capabilities as part of another company's prepackaged e-commerce solution. So take the example of Capgemini, which, as part of its consultancy business, works with large merchants to implement payment solutions, we are prepackaged in there.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are leveraging our Internet gateway capabilities to gain further entry into large and fast-growing markets to maximize our participation in those markets and their growth. So for example, the Japanese e-commerce market is the third largest in the world. DataCash had just completed integration with JCB to enable multinational merchants to accept payments on their websites from JCB cardholders in Japan. Similar example, moving to China, which is projected to be the second-largest e-commerce market in the world by 2016, DataCash successfully completed the integration technical integration with China UnionPay which as you know is part of our MOU with them thereby opening cross-border e-commerce for consumers in China.</p>
          <p>We're already working with a number of larger airlines and retailers, travel agencies to enable use of these services. We're also in the process of customizing our fraud systems for the Chinese market. That's an area of great interest in that location.</p>
          <p>These fraud management tools actually are excellent and as you will recall one of the primary reasons we purchased DataCash. They provide cross-sell opportunities to existing customers as well as open the doors for potential new customers as they address a major pain point with e-commerce merchants. As we connect to more merchants we increase our ability to deliver these fraud management tools as well as other value-added services.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financials for the first quarter. Martina?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>Turning to Page 3 of our slide deck you can see that we're delivering solid top line and bottom-line results. Net revenue grew 17% driven by strong volume and transaction growth as well as new deals. Pricing contributed about three percentage points of this growth. Total operating expenses increased 14%. That resulted in an operating income growth of 20%. Bottom line, we delivered net income of $682 million, up 21% and diluted earnings per share of $5.36, up 25%.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was $427 million and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of about $5.1 billion. While not shown on this chart let me put our results in the same terms as our long-term financial objectives, which are on a constant currency basis. On that basis net revenue growth was 19% and EPS growth was 27% so there was a two-percentage point impact on each quarter from FX. Operating margin was essentially unaffected.</p>
          <p>On the next couple of slides we're presenting the operational metrics for the first quarter of 2012. So let's turn to page 4 and here you can see that worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 18% of a local currency basis including double-digit growth in all regions. U.S. volume growth was 14% driven by almost 21% debit growth as a result of stronger underlying volumes including prepaid as well as recent signature debit wins.</p>
          <p>Credit volumes in the U.S. grew about 7% with consumer credit growth staying steady with previous quarters in the 3% to 4% range and commercial credit posting its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Outside of the United States, our volume growth was 21% on a local currency basis including about 23% growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and 19% growth in Europe. The growth rate of volumes outside of the U.S. were driven by strength in both MasterCard credit and debit volumes which were up 20% and 22% respectively.</p>
          <p>Cross-border volume were 18% on a local currency basis and we saw double-digit growth in every region including growth rates above 20% in Latin America and APMEA. In total, European cross-border volume growth was in the high teens, consistent with previous quarters.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 5 you can see that processed transactions were up 29% and this is the highest quarterly growth rate for processed transactions since we went public in 2006. The growth was primarily driven by the U.S. and Europe, as we continue to see the impact of debit regulation in the U.S. as well as new deal signings in both regions. Global card growth was 9% to 1.8 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to page 6 where we can discuss our revenue growth in a bit more detail. The higher volume trends that I described when discussing GDV drove domestic assessments and cross-border volume fees growth of 16% and 15% respectively. Transaction processing fees grew 21% driven mainly by the 29% processed transaction growth, so there continues to be a gap in these two growth rates. Also this gap is slightly smaller this quarter than it was last quarter due to pricing. If you exclude the impact of pricing, the gap actually widens to about 12 percentage points. The majority of this gap was due to the addition of transactions outside of the U.S. Recall that the incremental revenue from most of these new transactions comes at a lower than average revenue yield.</p>
          <p>Other revenue grew 29% driven by the acquisition of Access Prepaid, which anniversaried at the beginning of April as well as other non-volume related fees. And finally rebates and incentives increased 24%, driven by the impact of new and renewed deals as well as strong volume growth.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 7 for some detail on expenses, so within total operating expenses you see that general and administrative expenses increased 17%, 5 percentage points of this growth came from the inclusion of Access Prepaid and the remaining 12 percentage points primarily came from the investment in strategic growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>Advertising and marketing expense was actually 3% lower than last year's first quarter mainly due to the impact of foreign currency. Depreciation and amortization increased about 30% due to the amortization of intangible assets from Access Prepaid and increased capitalized software associated with our strategic projects.</p>
          <p>Turning now to slide 8, let's discuss 2012 starting with an update of what we have seen for the second quarter through April 28. Our cross-border volumes grew about 18% globally, in line with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. This was driven by continued healthy growth in all regions.</p>
          <p>In April, our U.S. processed volume, a proxy for GDV, grew about 10%. This is somewhat lower than the 15% we saw in the first quarter, largely due to the impact of the extra day in the quarter, leap year, the tax refund programs that we've seen in the first quarter and the lapping of new business wins.</p>
          <p>Processed volume growth outside of the U.S. was just above 16%, slightly below the 19% growth that we saw in the first quarter primarily due to the leap year. And in Europe, which I know is of particular interest to many of you, processed volume growth softened slightly by a couple of percentage points.</p>
          <p>Globally, processed transaction growth was about 32% and reflects the impact of U.S. debit rule changes as well as the continued roll on of domestic transactions in the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Based on what we see now, let me give you some thoughts for full-year 2012. So we had a good start up to the year though we do not expect the first quarter net revenue growth rate to be the run rate for the balance of the year. In addition to the items I just mentioned, which benefited Q1 versus April, there are several other factors that you should keep in mind: the anniversary of the Access Prepaid acquisition, the lapping of our April, 2011 pricing; and the expected timing of new and renewed deals over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>We also have generally tougher comps in the next three quarters given the very strong revenue growth we saw in the last nine months of 2011. So while Q1 saw consumer confidence at decent levels, as Ajay told you, this is an economic indicator that we're watching very carefully, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, so you should keep this in mind as you're looking out over the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Assuming the euro trades around the $1.30 level at the Brazilian Real around the $1.75 level for the rest of the year, we continue to expect about a 2 to 3 percentage point headwind to as reported net revenue, net income and EPS growth for full-year 2012.</p>
          <p>Based on our current plans for 2012 strategic investments we continue to believe that we might have an opportunity to deliver some operating margin expansion this year. However, the amount of any improvement will depend on several factors including: global economic conditions and investment opportunities that might surface during the year. Our plans currently call for G&amp;A growing at a higher rate than advertising and marketing expense. We also expect our depreciation and amortization to grow by roughly $30 million this year as a result of our strategic investment activity.</p>
          <p>And as I said at a conference earlier this year, other income and expense should be negative for the year driven by anticipated equity losses associated with the two Telefonica JVs in Latin America which are typical in the early stages of many JVs especially in these new spaces. Also remember that our cash is held in extremely safe and liquid investments which currently offer de minimis yields.</p>
          <p>Turning to the tax rate. We now believe that we could see a full year tax rate of around 31% versus our previous expectation of slightly below 32%. This is due to certain tax planning initiatives from which we expect to recognize some benefits that were not previously anticipated along with the likelihood that some local tax examinations could result in a one-time benefit to our 2012 full year effective tax rate. So for modeling purposes you should not assume that all of the benefit in the tax line drops to the bottom line since we would opportunistically look to reinvest some of these savings back into the business.</p>
          <p>Finally, we remain focused on our objectives for the 2012 to 2013 period of a net revenue compounded annual growth rate of 12% to 14% and minimum annual operating margin of 50% and an earnings per share CAGR of at least 20%. These objectives are all on a constant currency basis and exclude any new acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&amp;A session. Barbara?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Martina. We're now ready to begin that question-and-answer period, and in order to get to as many people as possible we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and then queue back in for additional questions. Pam?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of David Hochstim with Buckingham Research. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yesterday the Federal Reserve Board put out some updated data on debit interchange, and I wondered if you could comment about their observation that network fees paid by large issuers seem to have declined from 2009 to the end of 2011. They obviously didn't talk about acquirer fees or any other pricing changes you made. Your pricing has held up. But I just wonder if you have a comment on what the Fed seems to be suggesting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, David, I'm going to take that one. First of all, as you said, the results were only released yesterday, so we're still working through the details in terms of what was really released. But when we're looking at the published network fees, there seem to be some potential disconnects in the comparisons, and we want to understand those before we draw any conclusions. So I'm going to give you a couple of disconnects that we need to understand.</p>
          <p>First of all, the Fed compared the network fees in the fourth quarter of 2011 with full year 2009. As you know, any fourth quarter is usually a high-spend quarter so issuers will pay effectively lower fees since core fees are tiered based on volume. So you can't really compare a fourth quarter to a full year, and that's one thing we're just going to have to deep dive into it more.</p>
          <p>The second thing is the Fed had actually requested different categories of network fees for each of these periods. So the calculation and the comparison of the pure cost transaction is unclear. In 2011 I can tell you the Fed had asked the networks to provide only off-clear and settlement fees, and back in 2009 we provided all fees collected on a transaction. So, therefore, the network fees that have been compared in the report might be apples and oranges.</p>
          <p>The last thing I want to tell you is that we have actually not changed our fee structures to issuers on the debit business. In fact, as you know, in every quarter we're going after business very surgically and opportunistically and we're signing deals &#x2013; both signature deals and PIN deals in every quarter and quite frankly you can see those results in our numbers today.</p>
          <p>So lots more to clarify but I told you as much as we know at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. That helps a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could give us a little more detail and a little more color on the U.S. processed transactions. I think you said it was above &#x2013; or globally above 30% in April and some benefit from April 1 exclusivity provision. Can you give us any color on what your U.S. volume looks like in April on a processed transaction basis and where you're seeing those gains? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, April is very similar to the first quarter but it's a higher growth rate, right? So the growth rate in first quarter was 29% in April; we're seeing 32%. And the growth has both benefited by what's happening in the United States as well as in Netherlands, but very, very typical trend.</p>
          <p>In the 29% by the way that we saw in the first quarter, we believe that a fairly significant portion, probably in the neighborhood of 13 percentage points is due to new deals and it really adds to what we need to be doing in the market. April is not shaping up any different. It's the same, just continuing to get the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess my focus was more on the PIN debit business and how much that's moving the needle in April?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, as I said before, it's very similar to the first quarter. April is just an extrapolation for what happened in the first quarter. We're seeing more PIN business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>You just got to remember, Chris, that a lot of the cards that got enabled for PIN didn't get enabled on the first day of January. They got enabled over the course of the first quarter. So over the next two, three, four quarters you will get moving around on the PIN debit transaction growth, because you will get cards coming on, but you'll also see routing changes as merchants and acquirers respond to what issuers' networks do.</p>
          <p>So it's going to be little bit of in and out for the next few months and that's how we think about it. But our first task, as we said, was to get onto these cards and be enabled on them. That's what we've been trying to do over the last few months. And now our next task is to try and surgically manage as much of that routing as makes economic sense for us. That's kind of how we are approaching this business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A question on your EMV initiative, what kind of merchant pushback of late are you getting if any? What do you see as some of the hurdles to completing the migration by the 2015 liability transfer date that you've established?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, the fact is that the way we went about EMV was that we actually created a consultative process with a ton of merchants, issuers and acquirers and had them come in together and talk about what's involved in saying that EMV should happen as compared to just mandating it, which we felt would have been one way of doing it, but probably not the best way to get so many people together on the same page.</p>
          <p>And thus far, by and large, the reaction to the roadmap has kind of been the same consistency of we've got to make sure that we can get this done. We've got to make sure that the investment that goes into it makes sense. There's a lot of moving parts around how it will actually get implemented. You know what we did was we created a set of incentives for merchants and issuers to use the most secure verification methods and created a sliding scale on that security angle.</p>
          <p>So the more secure your verification as an issuer or as a merchant, the liability shifts and the incentives go towards that party. That's what they're trying to work their way through and understand and work with. And so, frankly, right now what we've got is a good dialogue going on. At this early stage you expect some issuers, some merchants to go in slightly different directions and that's what we're seeing. But in truth when they come together we have a healthy dialogue they come around saying makes sense, right thing to do, it gives more security. The question is if they're incented, it makes it easier for us to do it. All that has been factored into the way we constructed our EMV strategy. But it's very early days and it's going to take a few quarters to work its way through the way we actually deliver what they're going to say they will deliver.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Okay. And can you talk about how we should think about the economic impact to your P&amp;L given the EMV economics? Our understanding is they are PIN debit like. How should we think about that? And that's it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, just because by the implementation of EMV you should not be jumping that everything goes to PIN economics. For instance, EMV has been rolled out in a significant way in Europe and you have &#x2013; there's absolutely no difference from a signature credit point of view, for instance, on pricing. So you cannot analogize from EMV everything goes to PIN pricing. It does not.</p>

          <p>So, Bryan, its Ajay. And in truth you've got to ask Visa what they see as the response from merchants to that. From our perspective, it's very early. I haven't seen much happen. Remember the first quarter was when all this was being constructed. It's really over the next few quarters, as I said in response to an earlier question, that these routing transactions have become clearer. And as I've said a couple of times now, our focus is going to be on making sure that we operate strategically and surgically to try and keep those routings with us to the extent we can and to the extent it makes sense economically. We did the same thing with getting ourselves on the back of assuror's cards. We're going to do the same thing with working with merchants and acquirers on the routing. So it's early stages. That's where it is today.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Good morning. Over the past few quarters we've seen, obviously, Huntington, Sovereign, Swedbank and then in Europe, Italy, Netherlands and then PIN debit wins among others. I think you mentioned Italy and now Ireland, actually, which sounds a little newer. Can you just help us understand the opportunity, actually, in Ireland? And then more longer term just overall? Are these opportunities similar to what we've seen in the Netherlands and, obviously, in Italy? And how long is this runway? And then lastly, is there other conversions like the Huntington or the Sovereign's that we can expect in the near few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the fact is that we had a lower market share in some of these markets, as you know, and that's we're basically trying to win back deals in. The Ireland deal win is the beginnings of what we hope will turn our business in Ireland. But it's going to get two, three, four, five years long because, typically, deals with the other banks have signed up with competitor brands for a certain number of years at a time. So I kind of tend to view these as building blocks and I tend to view our business and our approach to selling in these countries as building the right relationships, bringing value to these clients and starting to win small business from the ones that have large business tie-ups with competitors and then wait for our opportunity to get a bigger deal with them.</p>
          <p>That's true of every market around the world. What you're seeing in the last couple of years is an engagement with issuers and merchants, by the way, both financial institution issuers and non-FI issuers as well as merchants around the world, to build our position and our relationship with them so we're in the right place to try and take advantage of opportunities as they come up. It's nothing more strategic or rocket science than that. It's good old-fashioned selling.</p>
          <p>Now as far as what's going on in the Netherlands is concerned, the Netherlands, in particular, was a large one-time switch of the way in which those transactions are processed from a local debit switch to us. That's giving us a lot of benefit; it'll lap. We're working on other such things in SEPA as a whole in the European area are actually our transactions seen are up 280% over the prior quarter which, by the way, is similar to the number in the prior quarter.</p>
          <p>The fact is we're beginning to see transactions in France and Belgium and Germany and Italy, not to the same kind of impact as the Netherlands mass-movement, but we're beginning to see them. Were on this path of building our business bit-by-bit and deal-by-deal and what you're getting is the result of that. So I wouldn't conclude that there's some dramatic thing that's going to happen tomorrow, neither would I conclude that the runway is nearing anywhere near an end. We've got a lot of market share again and, bigger than that, we've got this whole fight against cash which is where our real growth is coming from. So we kind of got both things to do here and it's going to take years to fulfill that strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First off, congrats on the execution on the PIN debit side and the good quarter. I guess when I look at the rebates and incentives line, I look at it relative to gross revenues. That percentage was up 100 basis points to 25%. Can you just talk about how much of that increase was driven by wins versus renewals and then how we should think about that line going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, a lot of this was actually driven by the volume increases that we had. So the business has increased and obviously with volume increases you're paying more rebates out and then a smaller portion of that was related to new and renewed wins. I'm not going to break that up for you, but again, yes, you did see an increase in this quarter. I also said our thoughts of 2012, as Ajay was just saying, we are running after other deals and depending on when they come through, in which quarter, you will see some changes to rebates and incentives, but I know you guys have a love for looking at rebates and incentives as a percent of growth. Look, in 2010 <mark type="ph" /> the contra (38:48) as a percent of growth was actually 27%, it was 25% in 2011, it's now a little higher.</p>
          <p>As you can appreciate over the last five to six years, first of all, it will jump around by year depending on what kind of deals we do and what the volume development is in that particular year and you have the same kind of phenomena also on a quarterly basis. So all I want to tell you with all of this is, there is nothing to read into this. This is just going us after the business the right way.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you help us quantify how much of your revenues today have already benefited from your increased penetration in the U.S. debit business as a result of Durbin? And then looking ahead, can you help us quantify what you see to be the incremental revenue you expect to pick up? I know it's hard to &#x2013; it's probably going to be a range based on your execution of getting your brand put on a lot of the issuer debit cards here in the United States? Just trying to get a revenue impact from all these activities. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I mean, the only statistics that we have from a revenue perspective out there on the debit side is that at one point in time we told you that debit is about what, 14% of revenues. It's a little lower at this point in time at 13% of revenues, but that's just because of how actually our overall business has been growing both in the United States on the credit side as well as overseas outside of the United States. So revenues are growing in the debit business and as you can see from Ajay's remarks earlier this morning, we're winning very nicely both from a signature as well as on a PIN share point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd give you this little additional color. I'm not going to make a prediction going forward on what I think revenue could be from PIN debit because of two reasons. One is I don't like making those predictions and two, I am genuinely unsure of how routing will play out over the next few quarters. So I actually haven't really got a lot of revenue built in from there in my expectations, but you have to remember the dynamics of this revenue. PIN revenue in the United States is a low yield business. And by low I mean substantially lower than the other yields we have.</p>
          <p>The only good news is because we are leveraging our fixed cost infrastructure for driving this volume, even though it's billions of transactions incrementally, the good news is that the profit yield from these transactions is still attractive to our company and so we look at it that way, that our revenue yield will probably be small but our profit yield will be attractive enough for us to keep going after it.</p>
          <p>But it's difficult to predict given that we've just completed one part of the chess board game which is the &#x2013; getting ourselves on the back of the issuer cards. The second part going on right now with the merchant acquirer incentive play and then there will be the third part that will come in a year or two which will be the increased impetus towards EMV, which will also change this mix a little. So I kind of view this as interesting, nice to have, worth showing that we can win our share on it, but move on from it. There's a lot more going on in our business that has greater revenue impact than just the PIN debit business in the United States.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, a couple of questions. Your tax rate is going down quite a bit over the years I guess as the earnings from lower tax jurisdictions become more important. Is that cash now trapped in low tax environments? Or do you have a policy for repatriating it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Patrick. It's Martina. So let me take that. First of all, yes your observation is absolutely right. We have been working on our tax rate quite considerably.</p>
          <p>There are a number of factors that you work on from a tax planning point of view, one of which is obviously the one that you were referencing. You make earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. It's a lower tax there to the extent you can actually lock those earnings into those jurisdictions, and then you have the whole issue of how can you bring the cash back.</p>
          <p>I have to tell you we are in the very early innings of this game. MasterCard essentially was a two-country kind of company, United States as well as Belgium in Europe, and we've been diversifying quite significantly from that. You might, when you read our annual report as well as our Qs, you might be able to pick up that we've been actually trying to make sure that our Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa business gets recognized as such, doesn't get run back into the United States but gets run into Singapore where we obviously negotiated a great tax agreement with the Singaporean Authority.</p>
          <p>And over time, and this will take a long time, we will be having the benefits of those kind of structure. At this point in time we have mostly cash sitting in the United States as well as in Europe. We have not built up a significant amount of cash in other jurisdictions, and with the way that we built up our structure for the foreseeable future, so let's say for the next few years, I see absolutely no restrictions on being able to utilize the cash wherever we need to utilize the cash in the world, be it for what we're doing at the moment from a share repurchase token point of view or at some point in time, acquisitions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You suffer a tax consequence for using that cash in the low tax jurisdiction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I wanted to tell you is at this point in time I don't have that tax consequence because we put some planning strategies in place as well as we're only in the early innings of actually pushing earnings out to lower tax jurisdictions. So it's going to take some years to be building up cash in those lower tax jurisdictions and then it's going to take some time for us to ever having to use that cash somewhere else.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I'd add to that is think about what those jurisdictions are. We are investing a lot of time, effort and energy into building our footprint across Asia, and in Singapore is the hub of where we're putting a lot of this. And in truth I see a lot of opportunity for growth in that part of the world over the next few years. So in fact if that cash were to be there I believe it will give us some opportunity for adding to our footprint and our franchise through an acquisitive nature of growth in that part of the world.</p>
          <p>I think there's going to be opportunities to use that right now. We are fortunately at very early stages of this, so as Martina was trying to tell you, we aren't at the stage where we have this as an issue. We actually see this as a big opportunity for our company over the next four or five years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Ajay, as you talk to the bank issuers on the card side, they clearly seem to be struggling with some regulatory issues from the CFPB and others. I was just curious on your thoughts in the U.S. It seems like a pretty good environment for you right now. Is there anything percolating? Or do you generally feel pretty good about the environment from a reg standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the fact is that I can tell you where my perspective is as the MasterCard guy talking to these banks. I think they're all going through the early stages of trying to figure out their new P&amp;L and its construct given all the regulatory changes. And you know those regulatory changes extend way beyond the card business to very fundamental things in the way the money center banks are constructed, how their capital is used and what they can do with it. So I think they're all going through that phase right now. In our specific space, the fact of the payments industry probably becomes a little more interesting in terms of its capital utilization for banks over a period of time. So they've also realized as we all have that there's an opportunity to grow there.</p>
          <p>How they grow and how they construct their growth is what they're all working their way through. So it's actually good discussions. I feel that these are discussions &#x2013; that change is tough for them, but eventually coming out of this a year or two down the road I suspect we'll all be in a better place and that's what I'm hoping for. So we are engaged in a constructive, practical way on payment strategy with a number of banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. That's where I am right now.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just maybe focusing on credit trends I think Martina you said that credit trends in the U.S. remain stable. I think from a gross dollar volume perspective they're up maybe 6%, 7% for the quarter, similar to last quarter. Rest of the world looked better &#x2013; globally, it looked better. What you think we should look for, for the remainder of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking, "The Question," right? So this is always tough to do. I think you have to put it into the context of what we said about the economic environment. We are very much focused on making sure that we understand where consumer confidence is, what's happening on the unemployment rate, what's happening on housing starts. We're obviously feeling relatively good what we've seen in the first quarter but this has to persist for the rest of the year in order to have these kind of growth rates coming in.</p>
          <p>The other issue that you're going to have to think about is look back to the last three quarters, in particular the last two quarters in 2011. Those had already some fairly healthy rates. The credit growth in the United States in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011 was 7% each, so I would suggest to you that there might be a bit of a tougher comparison coming in. And that's why we also said when we talked about our revenue growth, don't just take the first quarter revenue growth and chart it out for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it's too early to think that this is an inflection point on the credit side? Or as you said we have to keep on looking at that environment...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have to look at it. I think it's far too early to say that there's an inflection point on the credit side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot depends also on the specific institution and its appetite right now. You'll see that over the last few quarters, different banks and institutions have moved differently in terms of acquiring new credit cards. Some banks that were very aggressive until a couple of quarters ago have slowed down. Others have moved up. I've seen that happen with a number of issuers. So I think it's still moving around and it's connected a little bit to Don's question earlier about how the banks are looking at the payments business.</p>
          <p>So it'd be tough to declare this as an inflection point yet. I look at all the banks, I look at their delinquencies improving, I look at early stage delinquencies coming down so I think about all that change in their portfolio and I think about the fact that they do want to grow their revenue. But it's based on their risk appetite, because they need to get into a place depending on how the regulatory capital needs move around and then across their entire franchise. That is happening as we speak so tough to say it's an inflection point. It is not in bad shape.</p>
          <p>April, the month will &#x2013; when you see all the consumer spending, that's the time we'll know how April did, so one month does not a quarter make and does not a trend make. That said, March was a good month. 11 out of 11 retail sectors are positive; by the way, so was February and that is not the case in January. So if that's anything to go by, remember February also had the little benefit of an extra day which is one day out of 90 is more than a percentage point of growth for a company. So you've just got to factor all that in and not conclude yet that we are at that inflection point. That's how I see it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just had a question for Ajay regarding what's going on in the U.S. It seems to me that the U.S. issuers have a complete disconnect versus with merchants and the way U.S. issuers are strategizing around their rates and their product emphasis is in complete opposite of what retailers are thinking about which is pushing large retailers to again discuss their own payment system. I was wondering how you talk to issuers about being more retailer-friendly or else this might become the type of issue that eventually comes back to kill their own business if they don't be careful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Craig. Boy, you chose to put a grenade on the field, which I'm trying to figure out what &#x2013; so here's the thing with that. I think that this disconnect, more is made out of it than is true. At the end of the day, in most of these banks, there is the fact is that merchants have got one perspective in growing their revenue and their P&amp;L and at the other end of the pipe is the bank that's trying to grow its revenue and P&amp;L and all that happens is the natural tension of the two opposing views between these parties.</p>
          <p>I actually think a number of the banks and issuers have built reasonably good relationships with some of the big merchants over the last few years. They're doing a lot of promotions together they're doing a lot of things together. But the fact is that the economic value of what's involved in the payment system is a constant matter of interest to merchants as well as to the banks and so there's always some tussling going on there. But even we ourselves have been in regular contact with a series of merchants over the past few months and I haven't seen anything new in that dimension compared to where it used to be a year or two ago. But it's the natural tension that you're referring to between those two constituents of the payment system. So that's kind of what's going on there. I don't think it's anything more than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ajay or Martina, whoever wants to take it, since the Durbin regulation went into effect you've done a very good job of winning PIN business but if you had to apportion the wins that you got, could you characterize for us what percent of them were winning all the PIN business outright versus just a portion of it being just the second mark on the card?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We aren't at liberty, unfortunately, to tell you that because every single issuer is being cautious and careful in this environment about how this is explained and talked about. Remember, they don't have to reissue the cards with the brands on the</p>
          <p>back and so everyone's on that statement right now. So unfortunately I'm not at liberty to tell you that. We've got a mix of deals where we are the only PIN brand at the back and there are deals where we are an additional PIN brand at the back along with other PIN brands. I just am not at liberty to tell you what the break up is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Fair enough. Just switching to color on investments. It's clear you're still investing, it's what people want to see, but investors always want to be able to characterize the go forward trajectory, the payoff of those investments and how it's going to contribute to revenues and margins. So could you give us perhaps a view on fiscal 2013? I guess every year has a certain amount of revenue growth that's attributable to investments that were made say in the last two or three years. So some of those are now going to be paying off in 2013. So is the contribution of growth investments in 2013 going to be say, bigger than it might have been in 2011 and 2012? Or is it kind of like an average year? How should we think about your investments today and when they're going to be paying off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Glenn, thanks for trying on this one. First of all, I mean you obviously know that for 2012 and 2013 on a combined compound annual growth rate for net revenues we said 12 to 14%, right? So in the 12% to 14% we obviously had to make our judgment of how much our newer investments would be contributing to the top line. And I think you have heard me lay out before, many of you heard that we have investments in the category that are more shorter-term investments, return investments, midterm investments and longer term investments.</p>
          <p>So for instance, when we invest into the commercial businesses or in the prepaid business, we probably get a payoff over an 18 to 24-month period. So of course, you should be seeing in 2013, some contribution of these kind of investments. Conversely, when we go to the longer term, such as for instance the mobile investments that we've been making, you know, we've been very public out there that we might not be seeing a return for four or five years, okay? So we obviously wouldn't be putting a lot of that into our revenue line for 2013. But I think that's how you're going to have to think about it. And when we put out, in a public way, our net revenue growth like we did for the next two years, the 12% to 14% is basically recognizing the investment and how it might come to fruition from a return point of view over time.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. I wanted to just check in on a couple of quick things. On the expense trends for the year and also the joint venture losses for the rest of this year; just how to think about the seasonality of any of that or if there's anything unusual that'd be rolling on, rolling off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me take the last one first because obviously when you look at the other income and expense line it will be tracking differently than what you have seen in the prior years because we are charting the investments that we're making and the joint ventures in Telefonica is in there. So you see almost $1 million negative in Q1 which has a number of components in there, right? Is not just the Telefonica JV, you have what's happening from an interest, income and expense point of view, etcetera. And basically, you should see &#x2013; taking this forward and you should be thinking about negative numbers, a bigger magnitude as the quarters go along because, remember, we only started the investment in the joint venture for Telefonica in Brazil very recently, right? So you have to recognize that every quarter we'll be investing a bit more. So this will be a negative trend.</p>
          <p>From a G&amp;A point of view, I am not sure if I can say more. What we've basically said is you should expect some growth in G&amp;A for sure. I think we gave you a little bit of the split in the first quarter so that you can analyze Access Prepaid, right, which was five percentage points out of the 17%, so the 12% was kind of the baseline. You will continue to see some increase in G&amp;A. Remember we hired about a little over 1,000 people back in 2011 of which around 400 people or so are Access Prepaid; so organic hire was 700 people. That's kind of a 12% increase on our head count which has to work its way through the personnel line. So you're going to have to look at that. And then for Advertising and Marketing, we definitely said that, that will be a lower growth rate than G&amp;A. It will be just slightly higher than what you see in 2012 &#x2013; 2011.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your last question comes from the line of John Williams with UBS. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in here at the end. Just a quick question, Ajay. I know you've mentioned a couple of times between positive trends in the 11 spending categories. I just was hoping you might be able to provide a little color on what you've seen, perhaps, among the high-end, the luxury categories, the shift credit versus debit or perhaps non-discretionary versus discretionary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, I haven't seen a lot of shifts in credit versus debit in total because I think that's still early days and I'm not sure that there's any great trend coming out of that yet. Actually I haven't even seen a big shift between PIN and signature other than the fact that our own volumes, because of the PIN deals we have won over these last two months, are still moving around a little bit. But your question is more about the market and the consumer as a whole, rather than MasterCard per se, right? So I haven't seen any great moves on that.</p>
          <p>What I would tell you is that, what's really been interesting, I've been tracking spending patterns for the better part of two and a half years now because I have a frequent call with some really interested parties who take this information from us and use it as part of their decision-making process in various governmental bodies. And it's fascinating what's happened over the last six, eight months.</p>
          <p>Six, seven months ago hardware, electronics, stuff that had to do with home improvement were actually languishing in pretty negative territory. In the last two months that has moved to the point where now those are actually the growth areas, and that tells me that people are either using that to reinvest in renovating their homes or they're putting it into the homes that they are buying, and it kind of links up with some of the things we're reading about some activity improving in home building and home buying. Still not showing up in the prices of homes, but it has bottomed out. So that's the first thing I'm seeing there.</p>
          <p>The second thing I'm seeing is that in luxury goods, jewelry, fine dining, slightly different trend. Luxury goods and jewelry were doing well, jewelry is moving around a little bit but it depends on festivals and stuff like that, but mostly luxury goods were doing well. Fine dining on the other hand has moved through cycles where they're in great shape and then it's taken a beating. It's actually taken a beating recently again but casual dining and family dining have come back up on that growth rate. So kind of moving around on us a little bit, and I don't yet have a good trend on that aspect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's super helpful. Just one other question on, Martina, I think you had mentioned Europe process volumes had come down by a couple of percentage points. I just wanted to make sure you weren't specifically saying 2% or anything like that. You were just giving kind of a general direction there, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Europe, you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yeah. I was just &#x2013; well, look, I can give the numbers, right? So as you were saying, 19% growth in Europe for the first quarter. When you actually do the analogous process volume calculation as we do it ,it's about 17%. So the 19% is equal to 17%, and what we are seeing in the first quarter of it &#x2013; what we're seeing in April is about 15%. It's a very healthy growth rate let me tell you, 15%, but it's a couple percentage points below what we saw in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you directionally given what an equivalent same I guess card sales metric would be in terms of ex-ing out the impact of perhaps the new portfolios that you have signed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we haven't. We haven't, but I can tell you if you look at things like SpendingPulse you can come to conclusions pretty quickly about what's going on at the core versus new business, and very similarly in Europe spending is actually holding up. What happens, as I said about Europe, very often in the go-go days Europe never went crazy with spending, and now they're in far more stable pattern of saving and spending in Northern Europe. Southern Europe can be a little complicated and can move a little differently from Northern Europe.</p>
          <p>In our company, it's interesting but a majority of our European business because of the way it was constructed from its beginning as well as the acquisition of Europay that happened along the way some years back that my predecessor had done we've actually got a mix of volume that comes more from Northern Europe than from the Southern European countries which actually has seen us have a more stable pattern over the course of this last year or so.</p>
          <p>Now the other good news is we are winning deals in some of those Southern European markets. So even if Spain and Greece are slowing down that's where the Ireland/Italy angle came from. So we've got a mix of portfolio changing along with the nature of the business on how consumers are spending in Europe, but essentially consumer spending as a whole in Europe is holding up and consumer confidence as a whole in the first quarter actually held up. Now it moved differently. Germany went up, the U.K. went up, Spain and Greece went down. But Europe as a whole held up. That's actually public data on consumer confidence that you can get from the Nielsen guys which I just saw again the other day.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me leave you with just a few closing thoughts after those set of questions. We are off to a good start for 2012. We have made some really solid progress, particularly as we have all been discussing, in our U.S. debit business, but of course there's more to come there. Just remember that any incremental PIN debit transactions come at a lower than average yield though with good profitability, and things are moving around with the routing.</p>
          <p>Remember that, as Martina mentioned, our first quarter net revenue growth rate will not be a representative run rate for the balance of the year. That's because we will be faced with more difficult comparisons as the year progresses as well as several items that lap which by the way contribute to the difficult comparisons including the Access acquisition and several new business wins that we had over the course of the previous two years that came up with cards in this period last year.</p>
          <p>I also want to remind you that there is the potential for us to increase our level of investment depending on how much room we have in our P&amp;L. That room could come from things such as stronger than expected top line growth, or the potential lower tax rate that Martina mentioned. There is no shortage of growth opportunities in this business and we want to evaluate as many as we can. We will act on the ones that provide the best potential for maximizing our long-term growth and let anything leftover drop to the bottom line. Net, we're working hard to deliver another good year and meet our performance objectives.</p>
