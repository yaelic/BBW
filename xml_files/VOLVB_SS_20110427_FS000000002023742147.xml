          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volvo's First Quarter for 2011. Today I am pleased to present Mr. Leif Johansson, President and CEO. For the first part of this call all participants will be in listen-only mode and afterwards there will be a question-and-answer session. Mr. Johansson, please begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And most welcome around the world. Good afternoon and good morning to this Volvo first quarter 2012 conference call. We have in the room as we always do &#x2013; we have IR people, we have business area leaders, we have our CFO and we, in the case, we also have our Deputy CEO and CEO-to-be come 1st September, Olof Persson, and now he is actually representing Volvo Construction Equipment.</p>
          <p>We have a pack of slides that's been made available to you over the internet site and if you flick with me to page two, on &#x2013; in that pack, then you'll see a slide of Group Highlights. And we had a first quarter operating income then of 9.5% &#x2013; 9.1% margin, 6.5% in operating income. And the really unusual thing there was the fact that we had SEK 590 million coming in from Brazil as VAT adjustments. Against that we put between SEK 250 million and SEK 300 million from the disaster in Japan.</p>
          <p>Then also to note with you, the difference in currency impact in &#x2013; on operating income. Q1 to Q1 was about SEK 1.3 billion and Q4 to Q1 or Q1 to Q4, about minus SEK 700 million.</p>
          <p>And cash flow, negative amount of SEK 4 billion to say the normal seasons, because we build our inventories especially for quarter two.</p>
          <p>The business environment side in general, we are seeing improving market conditions in &#x2013; Greater Europe. And obviously &#x2013; and that's across Group's that can probably earn during this term. I'll speak more specifically about trucks later on.</p>
          <p>Grade, I think it would now leads to Europe, but overall terribly lower levels of both. Coming back to normal trend lines in Northern parts of Europe and Germany, but well below trend lines in Southern Europe. But all in all, they are improving what we would see as improving market conditions.</p>
          <p>Asia remains very strong. And we have the effect there of India, China, but also many countries around &#x2013; let me, for example, take Indonesia as countries that are growing quite rapidly.</p>
          <p>That is not of course true in Japan. Japan was a slower grower before the disaster of the earthquake and the tsunami in March, and of course have impacted us. We call that effect to be about SEK 250 million in Q1 here really on the fact that we have not been able to deliver &#x2013; we have had in Japan not so much damaged our own facilities. They can actually be used for production &#x2013; we have resumed production, but we have uneven output, because of the effects in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>South America remains very strong. That is especially true of Brazil, which is based on the market in the sale being impacted by growth coming out of construction and also the new oil finds there, combined with an overall raw material boom, you can say, in this area. So far that seems to be coming together very nicely even for 2012.</p>
          <p>North America, perhaps the best news, there we are seeing a significant improvement in demand &#x2013; in demand on everything that is related to long haul, which of course is significant because it represents them a better consumer retail market, but it also represents the manufacturing sector that's beginning to turn on in North America, some of that of course dependent on the very competitive dollar rate right now.</p>
          <p>For us to be genuinely happy with North America, we would have liked to see also a recovery in the broader construction sector, house &#x2013; home and even infrastructure construction and that is yet to come. We haven't seen that come yet.</p>
          <p>If you flip with the page to the Volvo Group on page 3 there, you will see sales coming up at SEK 72 billion for the quarter. If you remember we had a strong crown there so from a growth point of view, in Swedish crowns, that's 22% in &#x2013; already in currency adjusted it is a growth of 33% so very good growth compare to Q1 sales.</p>
          <p>If you look at 12-month rolling we are now coming closer to 280 than the 270. We have an all time high at about 300. But if you look to the right there, with the first quarter 2011, there you see a distinctly different mix, geographic mix, compared to when we were close to the 300 earlier, before the crisis in 2009. What is happening here is that the half of the group, which is North America and Western Europe, continues to grow and, of course, you can see the impact there of Asia and South America. And Asia is now much bigger than North America.</p>
          <p>But what has also happened then in the past couple of quarters and notably so in this quarter is that Western Europe and North America grows at the same pace and all reports come together at 33 and keeps that pie chart almost stable with 50% outside of North America and Western Europe. And if then we think, of course, that's good news.</p>
          <p>The left side of that pie, in North America and Western Europe, it's still far off of a &#x2013; very high fall off coming close to trend lines, but from below while you can say in South America and Asia, there we all have all time highs and looking how that will progress over the next couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>Sales obviously then were impacted by the market growth and then, of course, the increased sales of new products. We've said many times that we kept spending up on R&amp;D. We have a general impression that we have gained market share on the base of new, efficient products coming off of that spend over the crisis. And then as we move forward, you can say &#x2013; or as we look at operating income and then look forward, we see increased volumes there. We are upping our production rate again in Q2 <mark type="audio gap" /> (7:25) slightly less problems or less fewer problems that we had in Q4. Cost control is still a key word. You will find that on many of our charts, as we come up through the &#x2013; ramping up of our production schedules here.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide 4 then, the one that says operating leverage through cost-control, and Mikael Bratt, our CFO, will speak to a couple of slides here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. As you have heard and seen today, we have presented the strongest Q1 in Volvo this third year and I would say that, despite the currency headwind. And a big contributor to that is, of course, the good cost control that we have seen across the globe. I would say both in industrial activities, but also from operational expenses perspective, as you can see on this slide, where we have had the growth on the top-line with more than 24% and OpEx has stayed on I would say moderate 6%, the growth there. And focus to maintain this kind of leverage is, of course, in high priority and in focus as we go forward.</p>
          <p>I will not go through the FX items, as we have done in the last quarter this year. We have attached them as an appendix back in this pack of slides. But in general, I will say that the headwind continues when we have the currency rate where they currently are, and as you know and this is a reminder here, we keep the shorter hedge books than we have had in the past. So new contracts are taking us up to this level, and I would say to a smaller example of course when we have this kind of level. So if you have any questions on that, we can take that during the Q&amp;A, otherwise you have the details in the pack.</p>
          <p>Let's move on then to slide number 5 and the net financial debt position here. We have presented a seasonal cash flow of negative SEK 4 billion, which where Q1 attrition is weaker quarter, but I would say still that the SEK 4 billion is even if it's negative or more on the positive side. And one fact is, of course, the good work that has been done in the working capital end, which I will come to in the next slide &#x2013; with the P&amp;L development.</p>
          <p>Net debt has come back up to &#x2013; to 40, but stays within the range, but we &#x2013; which we have set ourselves to be within. And we comment that last quarter also that we should see this seasonal effect, also, when we look the net debt position here.</p>
          <p>Newly quarter S&amp;P has upgraded us to a little bit up with a stable outlook. And we do not any longer have the rating here. We have both S&amp;P and Moody's at the same level here now. So that is, of course, good news that we have started to move back up on that rating ladder here. I would say in the short-term, the pricing has not had any effect since we were already priced, I would say at this level with the market had recognized the improvements already in the Group here.</p>
          <p>But going forward, of course, it will have a possible effect there. And we see also funding costs come down as we have progressed in the quarters here. And we have improved about SEK 160 million compared to Q1 last year. And so just going forward, with this cash flow and that we have seen and to generate focuses on paying down debt in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Page 6; talking then about the cash conversion cycle, and we are looking at the cash conversion cycle here that has reached a level of &#x2013; level of 23 days. We are close to the 20 days, which is our target which we have communicated to you, I would say in the midst of the crisis, where we were actually moving in the wrong direction at the time, but we're also very convinced that we could do better when it comes to working capital over. And then I would say that the 23 days puts us in very competitive position from the working capital perspective here.</p>
          <p>And I've always said that the key for reaching this kind of levels is that we have good control on the inventory side, which we have seen in the last couple of quarters here. And so well-managed across the board, I would say. And also overdue sees that in the industrial operation is at the lowest level ever and we work continuously to reach to 20 days, the time.</p>
          <p>Let me add comment also very briefly on the PP investments. I would say up to -looking only at the first quarter, it has been stable. We see an upward trend here and we have guided you towards the SEK 10 billion for the full year, and that should be compared then to the SEK 7.1 billion that we have in the north area. That's all I will say on the development so far &#x2013; upward trend.</p>
          <p>I will stop there and hand back to Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, and come with me then on to slide 7, the one that says Flats. There, you see net sales developing by as much as 35% actually, foreign currency adjusted. We see that clearly on an order book which we have delivered on &#x2013; I should say with fewer disturbances in this quarter than we had in Q4 but we also see market share gains as we &#x2013; the menu of the new products that we have introduced are biting, you can say, in the market.</p>
          <p>We are improving our market outlook and I'll speak specifically on that in the next couple of slides. We have an operating margin at 9.4%. Supply chain in Japan is very worried, and specifically in Japan where the UD trucks we expect to see about the same impact on an EBIT line as we had in Q1, I think SEK 250 million to SEK 300 million. And that's really on our ability to get the manufacturing running smoothly in Japan.</p>
          <p>Much, much more different effects &#x2013; if we have any effect outside of Japan and if we &#x2013; if you had asked us a couple of weeks we would have said we were very mightily worried.</p>
          <p>Now we are seeing &#x2013; we have orders of magnitude less of an issue and we could well be that if we lose some production in Q2, we could actually regain that in Q3. So it is an uncertain outside of Japan you can say; still uncertainty of what the impact it would be and the real issue there is not given as the tier two suppliers, the real risk there is that we will find tier three, tier four, even tier five suppliers that will have an impact on our production in different and other parts of the world. But generally, much less concerned than we were only a few weeks ago here and so the problem overtime we think is correcting itself.</p>
          <p>Then we have a production ramp-up in the U.S. based on the very good order intake in the U.S. We're putting in a second shift in Q2. As you are well aware, we have put in shifts, you don't get the immediate effects there that's the utilization that we had in Q4 and did not have in Q1 when we make ramp-up in the U.S. for a much higher than production rate in Q3 than we are putting our shifts there.</p>
          <p>Strict cost control also on the truck side and there we have a number of new production introductions in the truck look as we broaden the product range into segments; for example like medium-duty construction, medium-heavy-duty construction vehicles for Mac in North America.</p>
          <p>Going to Slide 8, you see the heavy-duty truck market in Europe. There we are offering that now into the range of 230-240, we are doing that really on a gradient that will take us back to what we would consider to be a normal market, as you can see the trend line there, depending little away you start, it will come up to 230-240, so good news there from Europe in general compared to earlier quarters.</p>
          <p>And likewise, if you go to Slide 9, you see heavy-duty truck market in North America now coming up to 230 and 240 on the back of the past couple of months where &#x2013; with high order intake. The reason that it isn't even higher here of course is that we see a number of big fleets putting order that have relatively long period for delivery, and we think the combination of what the industry can put out and what customers will want will take us to about 230-240 with heavy-duty truck market in North America and we are up in that also compared to where we were the last &#x2013; latest quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's talk Construction Equipment and, Olof Persson to speak to slide 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Leif. In general you can say that we have seen the quarter one in the Construction Equipment industry with a growing market scenario in all our key markets, and you have the numbers in the quarter report. I would like to mention there perhaps that the China continued to grow in a very good pace. And it's good to see and good to report to you that during Q1 when it comes to adding wheel loaders and excavators together, Volvo and SDLG with Lingong brand actually turned number one position in delivered units, which we are very proud of and we think is a good achievement of the teams in China.</p>
          <p>But we have also seen the other markets like North America and Europe coming in with good growth numbers albeit starting from much, much lower levels of course. This is result that we have acted up our market forecast for 2011 in most of the markets and we are now looking at the total market increased for this year, around between 20% and 30%.</p>
          <p>We then look internal on our quarterly performance, I would say that I am very pleased with the growth, as you take out the currency, we have a 63% growth year-over-year. And it's not very often that we can report Q1 in terms of turnover that is actually higher than Q4 giving our seasonality.</p>
          <p>I will say that the operating margin is the best ever we have had in Q1 and year-over-year leverage of 15%.</p>
          <p>On the side &#x2013; on the headwinds side, you can say that there are two issues there. And the biggest is of course the currency as Mikael mentioned before, there is no secret that the strong SEK is a headwind for VC.</p>
          <p>We also had a huge number of start-ups in the production during Q1 related to the heavy machines on the Tier 4 and actually &#x2013; the legislations, this has resulted into somewhat lower productivity in the Swedish systems that we used to. It's about getting the supply chain up and running, it's about balancing the fact underline and so on and so forth. We have to do that, and now we're delivering three, four machines out of the system as we speak.</p>
          <p>Some other key ratios, we have a capacity utilization globally of 70% substantially up from last year and of course coming from the point of 20 unit prices, We have focused on the productivity and the basic volumes all reduced by 15%, fewer employees if you exclude Lingong then if we compare to August 2008.</p>
          <p>And finally, the Japan impact for Q1 was very close to zero. I thought we will have a Q2 impact of supplier &#x2013; lack of supplier of primarily hydraulic components to the Korean excavator manufacturing. Surely difficult to estimate, but the number that we are looking at right now for to operating result impact is negative SEK 400 million, that is what we can see today. And by that Leif, I think we conclude the report from VCE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>We move the conference phone here and take up slide 11 on Buses, and H&#xE5;kan Karlsson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you, Leif. The first quarter was a fairly good quarter for buses reflecting our seasonality. And the global bus market continue to recover except the city bus market in North America which are heavily affected, budget discussions going on there.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the city bus market is still soft while the coach market is improving and the rest of the world market is growing. So we see a growing trend in front of us except that for city buses in North America.</p>
          <p>The interest for hybrid and also electro-mobility, electrical buses increasing very fast and that is driven by China, and also Germany and Canada is putting a lot of money into developments of these kind of regions. Despite to see the segment down, we have improved our order intake by 7%, and we have received two strategic orders in New York City both for new advanced city buses and cable commuters, and that is accordingly through our strategy to build a volume base in the state of New York.</p>
          <p>The result was SEK 281 million, 5.1 &#x2013; 5.8% of operating margin, well above last year I mean on the similar phase number we show we have fairly good leverage. Going forward, we have some headwinds through the currency development, raw material in combination with the price pressure in the segment. We have &#x2013; we need to focus on profit level growth in all our regions to leverage on our cost current &#x2013; cost structure and continue to improve efficiency in our industrial operations.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we made the strategic investments together with our JV partner site in development that we install hybrid electrical drivelines into Sany and Volvo buses. This is with the ambition to be a market leader in China on the new energy buses, which is very clearly addressed from the Chinese government to be in the range of 10,000 to 15,000 units in the coming two years. So the company will be up and running in the third quarter this year to meet their demands coming out in the Chinese market. We are also there able to export this kind of details out from China to the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I think a decent quarter and we're looking forward to the next quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The one market for industrial engines was continuously strong in the first quarter of this year and with a positive development also in our large markets. The demand for Marine industrial engines in Europe was stronger than during the recent quarters as we now see increased interest in and activity among our customers.</p>
          <p>However in the U.S. the Marine industrial market remained very weak and we are concerned about the retail side of that business going forward. We have had a positive market share development in diesel-powered generator sets, Volvo Penta's four segments for industrial engines with increase sales of both of the Volvo Groups and 13-litre diesel engines.</p>
          <p>We currently have a very positive order situation; the total volume in our order book at quarter end was 122% higher than corresponding the previous year. And our sales in the quarter rose by 9%, a little bit more than SEK 2 billion and we now also see increase sales on Marine leisure side mainly driven down by the stronger demand in Europe.</p>
          <p>Our operating income improved little bit to 35% up actually and driven by the Marine sales and favorable product mix within the industrial segment, so all-in-all a positive development both in terms of sales and profitability. Going forward we focus on securing deliveries within our global manufacturing and logistic systems. Raw material costs development is of concern for us and we are pushing price management active actions to compensate for costs increases in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>As I have said, we have a stronger demand in the European marine industrial business and product wise we are well-positioned to capitalize on this development and we have a very competitive product revenue right now in the marine business.</p>
          <p>Our IPS system continued to gain market shares in the yacht segment and we see more and more projects in this segment in Europe and also in the U.S. where we can use IPS systems and together with the Groups both11 and 13-liter engines.</p>
          <p>We have recently signed an agreement with Garmin regarding joint development of instrumentation, navigation systems and communication equipment with Leisure Marine boats. This allows us to move even further into integrate system and complete the driver environment offering end users turnkey solutions. It is a very promising and exciting corporation that you will hear more about from us later on. So that's the report from me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, gentlemen, then we go to Volvo Aero and Staffan Zackrisson is on slide 13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. The market development is positive in spite of a higher oil prices, the airline industry is very sensitive to the fuel costs. It was 6% up in February. The high fuel cost will affect the profit levels of airlines, but even given that fact the airlines are quite optimistic of the next 12 months when it comes to passenger traffic and cargo.</p>
          <p>The order intake for Boeing and Airbus was up 39% in the Q1. And this has led to a higher plans for production raise, we lead to reappraisal for the supply chain and various base industry.</p>
          <p>At Volvo Aero, we have also seen growth in our commercial component business when we counted in dollar of about 10%, but if you look on the sales number for Volvo Aero, they had decreased 14% that is of course the effect of lower dollar as well as the divestiture of Volvo Aero Services.</p>
          <p>Operating margin for Volvo Aero was at low point, 1.7% and the two reasons for that lower earning of the SEK 28 million only, is due to the lower dollar. It has impacted also &#x2013; of course on the top-line as well as we bought material for six plus months at a higher rate and now about selling that material. That is the biggest impact on the result. That one is manufacturing disturbances, that we have had internally and also supply issues.</p>
          <p>If we look at what we have in focus for next few years is supply management initiative. We are working closely with the suppliers in the integrated teams to solve the capabilities of their processes as well as the capacity issues that the suppliers &#x2013; to get the better flow.</p>
          <p>And also we are working with our productivity improvement program. We are gaining productivity but not enough and this is also adjustment for the lower dollar that we foresee in the future. And it's a long-term program for the next three years that we are conducting.</p>
          <p>As the industry is in a rapid development as they're introducing new aircrafts and engines, we have the number of huge engine programs going on in this time period of Volvo Aero and that's &#x2013; the execution of those projects are vital to us. That concludes the report on Volvo Aero. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Positive trends continued in the first quarter in our customer finance business. New financing volume for Volvo Group customers amounted SEK 9.4 billion in the first quarter and this is a 50% increase over the first quarter of last year as adjusted for the currency. We experienced stronger financial volumes overall, and this is true for all regions and all products.</p>
          <p>Operating income improves with the Q1 results of SEK 179 million, primarily driven by improvement in credit provision expense as compared to both the first quarter of last year and fourth quarter of 2010. As market conditions improved, customers are strengthening and so do their repayment abilities. As we've seen in the highlight section, the first quarter demonstrated improved portfolio performance for VFS in all regions.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we introduced a Volvo Financial Services branded private label alliance in India, our alliance partner is Shray, which is affiliated with BNP Paribas and is well known and well established in India, being in that business providing infrastructure and equipment financing for over 20 years. This allows us to enter in a controlled way into the growing and important Indian market and supportive group sales.</p>
          <p>And focus, of course, remains profitable growth in all regions and as the economic recovery continues, competition for talents in employees increases. So we have strong focus which continues on active recruitment of validate candidates in all of our growth markets in China, Brazil, Russia, etcetera as well as strong focus on retention in all of our markets. In Japan the excellent VFS team continues to work very well with the customers to help them through this time of crisis and I would say this is already progressing in a very good way.</p>
          <p>Down to slide number 15, managed assets for our customer finance business are up slightly over Q4 and prior year Q1 when adjusted for currency. And penetration for the quarter at a result of 23% overall and this is including some good gains in targeted segments. So this is trending well despite increased competition from banks, third-party finance companies who also seek the finance both of our customers and our products. So Leif, that's the Q1 report from Financial Services.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that takes us to Group summary then and that's on slide 16. You see earnings per share that are a shade above SEK 2, six month rolling at 650. Remember our dividend is 250. Then we have an operating cash flow of 12 months rolling there 19 and 17.7. Cash flow we just spoken above as part of our seasonality.</p>
          <p>First quarter then 33% FX adjusted higher sales and costs reductions maintained. In focus as we see it right now we are managing an upturn notably so in Western Europe and even perhaps even more in North America and we are seeing those markets come up to historic trend lines there and at the same time we have a strong order intake coming both from Asia in general India, China and also countries around that, combined with a strong order intake also into the sale.</p>
          <p>A number of supply changes issues we've spoken on some detail about that especially on the Japanese side or the Japanese mix and the possibility and other parts of the group. Again cost control high on the agenda and then we just wanted to make the point clear that you have seen us make investments over the crises, but I think we can see that paying off quite nicely in our both in market shares and margin growth and of course we are continuing to invest at reasonably higher levels for '11 and '12 as we have spoken about before, we haven't changed that. But just to make the point, but of course we are expecting that to provide us with future growth over the years to come there.</p>
          <p>That concludes the presentation of the Volvo Groups first quarter and we will open up, operator for any Q&amp;A that may be.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Frederic Stahl from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentleman. It's Frederic here from UBS. Could I ask you, if you mentioned a bit on improved productivity, but may be if you could describe a bit more what the situation is in the North America and European truck operations when it comes to your productivity, how far are you from being relaxed and very happy with the situation there?</p>
          <p>And then secondly if I can ask you, if you look a bit further out in Japan, you mentioned that you're in &#x2013; at trend roughly speaking in North America. How far are we from trend in Japan do you think? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on, we're never relaxed and happy with productivity. It's not my &#x2013; that's not what I'm paid for. We have specific views we have spoke to about &#x2013; to you about in quarter four. We had much less of that in Q1, but in general you can say we should be expecting without big investments to have a productivity of at least 5% for the year. And better than that when growth increases volumes, and we were there in Q4 and we possibly will be there in Q1. So we will continue to drive productivity to the system, and frankly as always you see more &#x2013; the more productive you become the more productivity measures can you actually identify and see as possible, as long as you don't come close to capacity constraints.</p>
          <p>When it comes to North America and Western Europe, on the assembly side we are far from capacity restraints. We, over time, and I spoke to that over on the press conference, we &#x2013; we will see more of this and somewhere in '12 and '13 we think and we would be coming in close to capacity constraints, and our plan is to address that in the early autumn this year and see where &#x2013; how we see that the investments for engines roll out to meet the capacity demand in that time span. Otherwise, you can say at least five percentage points of productivity, you can't expect &#x2013; for example, when you will be like we are now in quarter two, putting in the complete shift in the U.S., you can't expect that to be immediately as productive as it as when it's in &#x2013; been rolling for a quarter or two. But in general, I'd say we still have good opportunity from productivity side.</p>
          <p>Japan is much more difficult to give a good presentation. I think we are far from what you would call an historic trend line. And in fact if we look at the Japanese economy and the way it is developing, you will have to &#x2013; to say that the markets now are close to where they should be, you would have to make some very, very bad assumptions. One is that the whole of the industrial sector is very low and will continue to be very low. And we actually see &#x2013; I think we see some very competitive companies in Japan who will have the opportunity to improve next quarter the manufacturing base in Japan.</p>
          <p>Second one is that you would see a forever very bleak consumption on the consumer side. And I think there is a good reason to think that they are more bleak now than they normally are. And the third one of course is that we would not see a productivity coming in Japan. And I think, there is reason to expect that the productivity can improve in Japan. So I would say that we are nowhere near what I would call a historic trend line in Japan. So whether that's up 20%, 25% or 30% from where we are now, it's very difficult to call, but I think we are at the low &#x2013; at the bottom cycles of Japan.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Nico Dil from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to ask three questions, please. First of all, sort of wondering the pricing on trucks in Europe and in the U.S., you've put through some price increases in the market. I wonder whether they are sticking, and sort of when you saw them sticking? Whether that's happened in January, March, or potentially whether that's April, or whether that's still supposed to come through?</p>
          <p>Secondly, if I compare your margins with local competitors in construction equipment in China, could you give us a little bit of a flavor of how I should compare that? Are you sort of above or lower than the Sany's or Zoomlion's of this world?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, looking at your chart on working capital, I see that it's a six months chart, now in Q4 we had a phenomenal working capital decline, sort of offset by what we saw now. Can we expect a similar decline again in Q2, and hence keeping that 23 days intact? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Nico Dil. I think on the pricing of trucks in Europe, we've actually said in Q4 that we had good growth increases both in Europe and in North America. We &#x2013; towards the end of the year we saw that rising. So I think fair to say that what you see now is what we did in Q4. Since then we have put across some increases which is more raw material driven, but not price increases coming from the overall fluctuation you can say in the marketplace, most of that was done in Q4.</p>
          <p>And then, I think it's fair to say that while the U.S. is a reasonably homogenous picture where, for example, we have been able to put cost increases in the U.S. down as we turned to it we did in Q4 more scattered place. And obviously some of that is driven by currency fluctuations, but some of that is also driven by very different demand in different parts of Europe. So there is much &#x2013; to could be an overall picture. It is different in different countries they're under different laws. Olof, you want to speak to local Chinese competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as you know, we do not guide on the profitability on a region or product and we stick for that. What I normally have state on those questions is that if you look at the turnaround in China where in Q1 we had a sales of about 40% of our sales was in China and there is no way of course to have a result as we presented here with 11%, almost 11% margin without having China a suitable and contributing market to that margin and I think I speak for them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is poor. I mean, we maintain our advantage for this year, and we believe we should get some advantages. I have not said before, and I will not say it again when we will get there. As I said we are focusing very much on the cash flow as I say in here, and we don't give target. So I don't, we remind you also that the cash conversions exposed is not the answer as well. It's off a straight line of course as we move forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up question here for Olof, I see that Asia is up about 60% year-on-year. You're guiding for up 10% to 20% in Asia, could you clarify that a little bit? Are you gaining market share? What's happening here? Is there a sort of strong tail-off by the end of the year? How should I look at that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's the &#x2013; It's a combination of a couple of things. One is of course that &#x2013; the very strong spring season per se, you're then also looking into a &#x2013; after comparison year-over-year when we're coming back into the backend of the year, this year because last year backend was a pretty good year.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, if you look at &#x2013; of course our ambition is to continue to gain market share in Asia in general and also making sure that our dual brands strategy in China, now with the introduction and ramp up of Excavator for the SPG families is making its portals on the market shares.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Hampus Engellau from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have three questions if I may. First question is on Japan, some of the car OEMs have indicated a 50% downtime in the second quarter on the back of shortages on electronics and also Powertrain components. I was wondering if you could maybe assess a little bit, how you thought about second quarter regarding UD Trucks and also if you have assumed any downtime in your SEK 250 million to SEK 300 million disturbance in cost for second quarter? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question is on lead times. Given the order numbers and also book-to-bill we saw especially on trucks in North America and Europe, what kind of a lead time are we seeing now in North America and Europe?</p>
          <p>And then a final question also coming back on prices here, given that the real price increases we saw in the end of last year coming effective as of January and also I know there are some new mission standards et cetera but where are we in terms of prices compared to maybe mid '07 levels in Europe and maybe comparing North America with '06 levels? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the &#x2013; let me answer on the Japan side, I do trust 50% downtime would mean a lot we are calculating with less of that and if you think about it you can say SEK 250 million to SEK 300 million was the impact after the disaster happened in March. You'd say about the same numbers and you are probably talking 25% or 30% rather than the 50% just came that on quarter two.</p>
          <p>Now, I think I've said that many times today but let me say that again that these are to the best of our ability with the information we have today. And all of them including the ones we gave for BC and the effect here all subject to new information that might come along. So there it is considerable uncertainty here. And I think you can say perhaps both on the upside and on the downside it's genuine uncertainty here. And we will have to inform you of that as we come through there.</p>
          <p>Lead times I think in general are still quite normal. I don't have &#x2013; I am looking at this today &#x2013; If we have any general data but we don't have very extended order boo or problems with lead time either in Europe or America yes. And of course the reason is that we are off of low capacity levels there. We are far from capacity levels yet &#x2013; we have some I think you can say longer lead time when it comes to China on the CE side, is that &#x2013; in general, we have reasonable lead times and of course with the growth we have had the inventory is going down in &#x2013; that's just difficult to answer you're saying are we back to several numbers..</p>
          <p>And of course we are, because in the meanwhile we have got for example mission standards or new year stand with as you know very hefty increases there, so if you look at per truck in dollars yes, &#x2013; the answer is definitely yes.</p>
          <p>If you look from our margin point of view, some of that has been cost related. I would probably say we have compensated for most of that also. Then of course, if you start looking at Swedish Krona then some of you divide sales by number of vehicles and things like that. Swedish Krona with the dollar going from a 50 or nine frankly, you get completely different numbers. So I would probably advise you not to do that exercise.</p>
          <p>Yeah. In general I think on the pricing in Europe and North America, as I said before, we are heading in the right direction there.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Yann Benhamou from Exane. My first question relates to China for construction equipment. Could you help us to understand what is the outlook for the market because you see kind of plateau with 30% growth for the year coming from the Q1 level? What is the outlook there?</p>
          <p>Second question related to the U.S. demand. You have booked a very strong order book. Do you feel that you will be able to fulfill customer demand by the end of this year, or do you think that part of those orders will be delivered next year? In other words what is the bottleneck today?</p>
          <p>Third question related to currency issue. Could you help us to understand what is the split of currency headwinds by division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. China and construction market sales, Olof?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think in general if you look at the Chinese market, it's been a strong first quarter. By all means we have seen some decisions from authorities. I will say that what we have seen so far is that we have managed to in a good way together with the FS and other sources we have funding available for our customers.</p>
          <p>Additional impact going forward is very difficult to say. We &#x2013; so far so good, and we don't see any signs of it. You should remember, however, that the Chinese market with a very strong color and potency, but there is a lot of plus and minuses going through here so this is the best estimate, what you see, that we do for the full year as we can do today with the information we have today. In long term, looking out years ahead on the Chinese market, we seem to lead and that's why we do all this capacity investment in China, and also through the dual brands strategy. So of course that will see over time a continuous increase of time. On account of the growth in China, was that also a VC question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see any &#x2013; in terms of in the U.S. and the U.S. order intake we have capacity in our U.S. facility in Shippensberg and elsewhere in the production system. Again, we should remember that the U.S. coming back from very low levels, even though the growth numbers are high. So no major bottlenecks in the U.S.-produced vehicles and we also look at making sure that vehicles that comes from outside U.S. are supplied in the reasonable way when it comes to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that same comment would be valid for the truck side, if you look at the order intake in North America, there we &#x2013; there was some discussion about very large fleets putting in some orders that would spill all the way into 2012 and in general that's not much of an impact there, even though the order intake, percentage-wise is up we're still talking about 11,700 trucks. Let's talk currencies, Mikael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Breaking it down per specific area here, but what I would say is of course that in absolute demand Volvo C stands for a large portion of that, but &#x2013; and then of course paramount in the truck segments is the size of trucks, but not in I'll say percentage or the impact per se in the truck segment. If you look at percentage-wise, I would say everyone had some examples of countless working, so it depends on our dismount or percentage impact here, but that's the guidance impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe a last question on your production outlook for trucks in Q2 versus Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can basically say that we are increasing production in Q2 versus Q1, we already commented on the increase there in North America, and saying that we are putting a new shift in there, most of the effects of that will come in Q3, some of the costs in the early parts of that ramp-up will be in Q2 and in general you can say probably another 10% up across the group.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi and congratulations on the quarter. I just had a question regarding your balance sheet strength. It looks like right now you are already in the range where you wanted to be when it comes for your net debt to equity. Given your cash position and that it looks like production is still building, when it comes to uses of cash, is there any way that you could use some cash to possibly take out some of your high coupon bond debt that you issued during the crisis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>While we are seeing the cash position improving here, one main task is of course to reduce debt by all different means I would say. Then, of course, it's a question of price when you want to buy back bonds here, and I would say as an investor it was interesting rates that they were issued at, and that's a problem against that. The thing is I would say a breakeven calculation if you see, if we do that in advance the risk we have do is to match elasticity it depends. It's certainly not a possibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And are you still targeting &#x2013; are you pretty -- still pretty comfortable with keeping net debt to equity around 40%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have said around 40%, and we feel comfortable with that. But of course over time it will be fluctuating here and then if it goes below 40%, it requires immediate action or if it goes above, it requires immediate action. As we said, it will be around and depending on where we are in the cycle also we have to look at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think that's important to emphasize. We did have some problem with the rating agencies for a while there, that they sort of read that the Board had announced that we would be at 40% almost per quarter, and we have certainly not said that. We have said that it's a long-term guideline and if there are good reasons to be above or below then we will do what we feel is good from a business point of view.</p>

On the C side, I'd like to understand basically which products of the Volvo C family are you currently not offering in China? And second, is there any major reason why you should not expect you to introduce them in the next &#x2013; as soon as possible?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of, I guess for Mikael, in terms of CapEx to sales level you would think about sustaining over the next &#x2013; I am not thinking 2011, I'm just thinking the next three years, what kind of levels would you be comfortable to support this growth industrially?

          <p>Olof here, products in China, yes, I think there are a number of products that we are not offering in China. I will say that the big volumes are definitely on the wheel loader and the escalator side, and within that family you have a number of models all the way from compact escalator up to very heavy escalators, and the same on the wheel loader side. We are also offering improved machinery equipment, Volvo-branded, produced and built in China. I will say these three categories are the major ones.</p>
          <p>When it comes to introducing products into China, we are always looking at that. And it's a market decision and it's a cost calculation worth doing. It's a &#x2013; an issue about making sure that we not only introduce a number of products, but we also make money on them and that they have the capacity to get it into the dealership, having the right service, and so on and so forth. So it is a rather complex issue, but I can assure you that in our long-term product brand we have defined and also laid out the different activities that we want to do in order to make sure that we are a major player in the Chinese market on different products. But what that looks like in detail, of course, that will be announced when it's attributable.</p>

          <p>On the CapEx side, we don't have a percentage or a target to guide you for a long time here. I would say we provide you with a number for the coming year and that's as far as we can go in terms of giving you guidance there. I mean, of course we need to triangulate as we move forward the means to support the growth, and also looking at the strength of the balance sheet, and the predictions overall in the business environment. So it's an ongoing activity internally I would say, but we don't have a target percentage to be below or above or something like that.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just sort of in terms of acquisition, you are starting to look a little bit more aggressively. It's part made that's complementing part of that CE side portfolio. You're shaking the trees that a little bit stronger to see if there are any opportunities or not really?</p>

          <p>I think we can say in a general sense, we have said that we want to grow over longer term by 10% a year, and we are obviously doing this, this year. So for that has meant when you look at a longer term that we've had a mix of organic growth, market share gains and the acquisitions. And I think given the right set of circumstances and the right set of timing we might well entertain this idea here. To just remind you there that we have probably regulatory limited Europe and then North America of some importance. So it would be more just towards other continents, the Europe and North America and possibly more focused on construction equipment that it would be on truck.</p>
