          <p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Enel Conference Call for nine-month results. We would be starting this presentation with back on and then as you there would be Q&amp;A session. Thanks again and let me hand over to Mr. Fulvio Conti, Chief Executive Officer.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for being here for our conference call for the nine months results. Before we go through the numbers, apology for me let me stress once again on going conferrable comparable economic scenario, we continue to report certain numbers with EBITDA better than market consensus, showing an increase of 11% versus last year. Thanks to the resilience of the Italian operations and the growth of international activities. On top of the report a positive results it also confirm our commitment to consider the reduction of leverage as a key priority. And I would be more specific on this later on.</p>
          <p>Let me start with an update on some relevant commitments we undertook with financial markets back in March this year using the chart number two. We had recently launched a second wave or Zenith efficiency program aiming at reducing operating cost and optimizing working capital. Let me update you on what we are delivering in terms of cash flow optimization. As you know we are committed to delivering 2.7 billion of additional cash flow by 2011 versus 2008 and I'm pleased to state, thanks to all the actions that we have already put in place as of September 30, 2009 we have already reduced our working capital by more than a &#x20AC;150 million.</p>
          <p>We also achieved so far an office reduction of about 240 million of which 170 million are recurring. This cumulates of about 600 million up to 2011. So, we are almost half way through our overall objectives. This also means the cumulative EBITDA will have a benefit of about 600 million in the period of 2009 and 2011. As far as the synergies we have been based are concerned let's move to chart number three, where out of the global program that we have identified back in December 2007, in 2008 we have a straitened synergies for 266 million or 100 million more than the original target across distribution, generation and procurement.</p>
          <p>As of the end of September we have achieved 326 million out of the full year targets, in light of this, we have announced our 2009 commitment raising it from 397 million to 436 million for the full year, but we can add more, we can add additional synergies as we have launched a second wave of synergy program, as well as efficiency program at Endesa's level. And thanks to all of these actions.</p>
          <p>We can now upgrade the 2012 target by about an incremental 250 million just to reach more than total &#x20AC;1 billion of synergies. Let me give you an update on our asset disposal program and the targeted leverage &#x2013; targets leverage on the chart number four. With respect to the commitment we undertook in March consisting of 10 billion of cash available for net debt production by the end of 2010, as you know we have already delivered more than three billion and you have the details of that. And we're now strongly focusing under remaining disposal actions; specifically we are working on the disposal to Spanish high voltage grid, which could be finalized later 2009 or early 2010 spending &#x2013; just spending definition of the final parameter of the assets.</p>
          <p>As far as, the EEB is concerned, we confirmed the commitment to go through a dual track strategy considering both a trade sale to a strategic investor and floatation of the company in 2010. Obviously should the market conditions allow for it? In the meantime the task forces working on the Group's entire renewables portfolio to identify the best options in the interest of both Enel and Endesa.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the overall debt, we do expect to achieve at year-end a level of conservative net debt of 53 billion on a continuous basis. This level of debt could be &#x2013; will be further reduced, thanks to the disposal of the Spanish grid, should it be finalized by year-end, and the accounting of about &#x20AC;2 billion related to the extra-peninsular the entire deficit.</p>
          <p>In this regard, we do expect a specific Spanish decree, ministerial decree to be issued soon. Also, we confirm our commitment to reduce consolidated net debt down to 45 billion by the end of 2010. I thought this was important to, for you to know before handing over to Luigi's, who will be commenting on the actual nine months results.</p>
          <p>Luigi, the floor is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Fulvio and good evening, everyone. Let me give you a snapshot of the financial highlights on chart number six. First let me remind you that in the third quarter 2009 Endesa fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis. Group EBITDA net of non-recurring items increased by 10% or around 4% considering third quarter 2009 with Endesa consolidated on a 67% basis. 2009 Group net income includes mainly the positive contribution of some extraordinary items for a total amount of almost &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>The most important are the following: &#x20AC;970 million Acciona put option, &#x20AC;293 million of capital gain related to the assets sold to turn. Let me remind you that these amounts are not to be included in the order income, and therefore are not to be considered as part of our future dividend. Excluding extraordinary items, both reported in 2008 and 2009, 2009 net profits would be 4% up versus last year, or about &#x20AC;3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now moving to chart number seven, here you have an indication of our nine months 2009 recurring EBITDA with Endesa consolidated on 100% basis for the entire year. Going ahead to chart number eight, EBIT increased by almost 12.6%, due to higher EBITDA, partially balanced by higher D&amp;A for changes in the perimeter of consolidation, mainly in Endesa, OGK-5, and Muntenia South in Romania.</p>
          <p>Our net financial charges amounted to &#x20AC;1 billion. This is mainly the effect of the following. First, higher income resulted from the fair value of the Acciona put option for &#x20AC;970 million recorded in the first half of 2009. Second, lower interest charges of &#x20AC;427 million, mainly due to lower average stock of debts and lower cost of debts, which at the end of September was equal to 4.6%.</p>
          <p>Group's tax rate increased from 8.5% in nine months '08. to 27.7% in nine months '09. On a normalized basis, the nine months '09 tax rate would be equal to about 33%, in line with last year. Before going through the EBITDA composition on chart number nine, you find the reclassification of nine months 2008 EBITDA in order to reflect the new organization of the group and the deconsolidation of Enel rate of gas.</p>
          <p>Now let's have a look at our EBITDA composition starting with chart number 10. Our portfolio benefits from a unique mix of assets and technologies, which creates a good balance between unregulated and regulated activities. As far as our regulated activities are concerned, Enel benefits from technological and geographical diversification focused on minimizing the Group's risk profile, a well-balanced fuel mix with nuclear 12%, hydro and other renewables at more than 33%, coal at 27%, and the balance mainly consisting of CCGT oil and gas open cycles. All of these, coupled with our own joined agent strategy allow us to expect solid cash flow also for the future.</p>
          <p>And now let me give you an update on our Asian strategy in particular for forward electricity sales on chart number 11. As far as Italy is concerned, we have hedged 100% of our 2009 production and about 94% of 2010 production.</p>
          <p>As an average base load price equal to &#x20AC;8 per megawatt hour for 2009 and about &#x20AC;75 per megawatt hour for 2010. As far as Spain is concerned, we're 100% hedged for 2009 and about 60% for 2010, at an average price for 2009 in the range of &#x20AC;60 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Prices for 2010 are currently significantly above the forward curve for calendar 2010. In Latin America, we are about 75% hedged for 2009 and about 67 to 70% hedged for 2010. In Slovakia 2009 and 2010 production are substantially fully hedged at an average price of &#x20AC;65 per megawatt hour for 2009 and 54 for 2010.</p>
          <p>All of these, we will have to explain our EBITDA evolutions in chart number 12, in which you have an overview of all of our operations. But let's start with generation and energy management Italy on chart number 13, the generation margin increased by &#x20AC;133 million mainly thanks to forward context a more favorable fuel mix, which have more than offset volumes decline. The improvements of 147 million in gas sale is the result of favorable gas sourcing mainly during the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>The margin in the ancillary services market has decreased by &#x20AC;200 million mainly because of lower electricity demands. Let's now have a quick look at the fuel cost evolution on chart number 14. Net of ancillary services, the unit margin in the domestic thermal generation increased &#x20AC;28 per megawatt hour from &#x20AC;25 per megawatt hour in 2008 mainly due to our forward sales and commodity hedging activities. The overall generation unit margin net of ancillary services is about &#x20AC;49 per megawatt hour versus 40 in the previous years. Also thanks to the increase in hydro production.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the EBITDA evolution analysis is on the market division on chart number 15. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;268 million versus 330 for nine months '08; this is cumulative effect of the following. First, a decrease of &#x20AC;54 million in the contribution Decree markets mainly due to a lower electricity margin generated by a reduction in selling prices, driven by a drop in the consumption of some specific customers. Second, a decrease of &#x20AC;8 million in the electricity regulated markets. Mainly due to positive no recurring items recorded in nine months '08.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 16, our domestic infrastructure and network division. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;2.8 billion about 1% up versus last year. Main items are the following; first the increase of &#x20AC;74 million in the energy margin, mainly thanks to positive price components partially offset by negative volumes and mix effect. And second lower connection fees for &#x20AC;46 million mainly due to the unfavorable economic environment.</p>
          <p>As far as order is concerned, bear in mind, that we recorded &#x20AC;297 million capital gain from the state of the high-voltage grid to Terna almost totally balanced by regulatory items, restructuring cost and change in the scope of consolidation after the high voltage gird disposal to Terna.</p>
          <p>Moving now to chart number 17, on international operations, EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;1.94 billion, up by 49% versus last year and 40% net on the capital gains of Severenergia for &#x20AC;68 million. This is mainly the results of the following; in the central region we continued to see a positive contribution on Slovensk&#xE9; elektr&#xE1;rne for another &#x20AC;160 million.</p>
          <p>In particular nine months '09 EBITDA of this company was equal to &#x20AC;670 million, Russia contributed for &#x20AC;161 million in the periods of which 68 for Severenergia capital gain and &#x20AC;96 million for OGK-5. In OGK-5 unit energy margin improved either in power and capacity markets. Before I moving on to the following division a quick look at the Russian activities on chart number 18.</p>
          <p>OGK-5 reported nine months '09 EBITDA of &#x20AC;133 million that represents a 28% increase versus last year. This is the result of higher unit margin mainly thanks to higher tariffs better for human conditions, increasing capacity payments, and efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Let's focus on Endesa's results on slide number 19. First, let me underline that the numbers we report in this slide including the negative change of the Iberian EBITDA results from the application of Enel Group Accounting Principle.</p>
          <p>In Iberia net of the above mentioned effects, higher final prices is the results over the Endesa forward standing strategy, a better generation mix more exposed to nuclear and idle capacity and the positive effects of the CO2 grow back to this positions from July this year have offset the effect of lower volumes and coal prices.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, higher food prices in volumes in most of the countries where we are as well as improved distribution margins posted EBITDA by more than 10% versus last year despite a negative impact of &#x20AC;150 million relating to the exchange rate effect.</p>
          <p>And now Enel Green Power on chart number 20. EBITDA totaled &#x20AC;884 million representing 13% increase versus nine months of '08. This improvement is due to the contribution of &#x20AC;100 million from Italy mainly driven by higher generation margin of &#x20AC;95 million, &#x20AC;3 million from the Americas and minus &#x20AC;6 million from Spain. Furthermore, let me just remind you, that we have increased our capacity by 480 megawatts and we still rely on a pipeline of almost 17,000 megawatts. You will find additional details in the annexes. As far as our net debt evolution is concerned, you see on chart number 21 that net of discontinued operations overall net debt stands at about &#x20AC;54 billion.</p>
          <p>The 4 billion increase is mainly driven by the negative impact of Easter holiday activities for almost &#x20AC;2 billion in particular the acquisition of a further 25% stake in Endesa for &#x20AC;12.1 billion, including 100% debt consolidation and renewable assets sold to Acciona. Second the acquisition of ESB, Ireland and other items for another &#x20AC;1 billion. On the positive side, we had a right issue for &#x20AC;8 billion and about &#x20AC;3 billion coming from the delivered assets disposals. On top of this let me also highlight that the change in the working capital versus the end of last year has been mainly affected by the seasonality of the trades, regulatory receivable, and some overdue and commercial issue.</p>
          <p>The &#x20AC;53 billion net debt targets by year end 2009 previously announced by our CEO takes into account an expected improvements in the net working capital of &#x20AC;2 billion by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Finally a quick update on where we stand in terms of maturity profile of our long-term debt. On chart number 22, which after our successful taping of the European and U.S. dollar market has allowed us to smooth our funding requirements with the next relative peak in 2012, lengthen our average maturity to over seven years and switch to higher proportion of fixed rate debt, which will insulate Enel's cost of debt for the coming years under a scenario with an respected increase from the current levels.</p>
          <p>Finally, before ending over to you for your questions let me anticipate that jointly with Endesa we plan to organize an educational Investor Day on the 11 of December in Madrid, entire focus on Latin America. You will have of course more details on a short notice.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and now let's open the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. We are ready to start this Q&amp;A. I see that a lot of you has already dialed in for asking questions. I will start with the first one Ms. Susanna Invernizzi from Barclays. Please Susanna go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of quick question first of all if you can elaborate a bit more on the expected working capital improvement you mentioned for the last quarter and also if you can give us some guidance on the CapEx Fulvio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Susanna, we'll start with expected working capital improvement. As I said we have some overdue commercial receivables that we are attacking through some specific action in order to collect by the end of the year. We are further optimizing our invoicing program mainly in the gas field where we think we have margin to recover something in the region of 400, &#x20AC;500 million we are working on the inventory as well and of course we are also working on some regulatory items in Italy as well. And this altogether sum up to &#x20AC;4 billion or &#x20AC;2 billion of working capital improvements without taking into account the expected improvements in Spain because of the issuance of the decree that our CEO mentioned before. When it comes to our CapEx well we recorded at the end of September &#x20AC;4.2 billion of CapEx consolidated Endesa on 100% basis adjusted for a quarter. Therefore if we consider the next quarter continue to consolidate Endesa on a 100% basis we should be able to stay in the region of six &#x2013; maximum &#x20AC;6.5 billion of CapEx by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Tom Gidney, Credit Suisse (23.53). Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a little bit of clarity on the asset sales and your previous target was &#x20AC;10 billion by the end of next year and this didn't include before the solar energy is at stake. Could you just clarify it is still exactly &#x20AC;10 billion not just sort of about &#x20AC;10 billion and also does the solar energy has stake is that included in the target now and then also you, you had a target for other non strategic assets to sell by the end of this year &#x20AC;1.6 billion and that this target now been abandoned and also do you expect agreement Enel Green Power with private sales and at least by the end of this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to disposal I mentioned to you that we continue to be committed and we're working on a successful construction for Enel Green Power. I think there is latitude for making, as we said, a dual track with strategic investors in a potential floatation.</p>
          <p>I think we have seen a renewed interest by both strategic investors, and it looks to me even the market is capable of taking the floatation as a way for crystallizing the value that we have created in the meantime. I do confirm to you that we are going to handle this program with the successful actions that we have achieved in terms of restructuring our debt profile lately as a result of our initial &#x2013; we can take a bit more of time to make sure that we do extract the maximum value out of it.</p>
          <p>We're not contemplating any quick sales just for the sake of selling things. We want to get the maximum value that we have been creating. When it comes to the remainder of the disposal, I do confirm to you that all of these assets that we have identified will be carried out, names and individual property that we are working on will be disclosed at the time when we'll be clinching a deal, not any earlier. There are ongoing discussions with potential buyers for that, and I am pretty sure that you will be satisfied by the 2010 that we are strongly committed and will be achieving a &#x20AC;45 billion of debt level by the end of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is the solar energy at stake crossed about 10 billion asset sales target now?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Matjia Gergolet at Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good evening. I have two, three questions. The first one was with regard to your guidance. If you can give us target for this year, possibly also whether do you feel confident now you have sold quite a considerable portion of your power for next year, with 16 billion of EBITDA guidance for next year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to the numbers, on the numbers, I see that in the first nine months you have booked 458 million of revenues from commodity risk management, and that's just a quite a volatile number, in Q3 it was about 871 million. Now what should we expect for the &#x2013; for year-end, i.e. is this 458 now fully locked in due to your hedging, or could we have an unwind in the last part of the year?</p>
          <p>And the last question was with regards to just CapEx, just a follow-up: the 6.5 billion of CapEx is for '09, right? Could you give us also some guidance for 2010, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will start from your first question with regard to 2010 guidance. Of course, we will update you about our new strategic plan on March. For the time being, also thanks to our power safety strategy, we consider that target still better.</p>
          <p>When it comes to your second question, I think you are referring to the treatment of our fair value of our commodity hedging strategy. And therefore, probably you have looked at just the revenues and what I can tell you in terms of matching between revenues and cost, which is the way we look at this numbers. The impact on the nine months results, of this fair value is in the region of, say, less than &#x20AC;100 million, it's less than &#x20AC;100 million. And we do not expect major changes by the end of the year. Of course, most could be depending on the variation of the expected level of commodities for the future. But when it comes to the end of September, the impact is really marginal.</p>
          <p>The third question you had was regarding the CapEx. Your question, is next year was the guidance that we gave in our previous plan of course have to be considered revisited now. To taking into account the changes in the market, and that's what we are working on. But I can give you just preliminary indication about we expect to reach or what we expect to reach next year. We will not exceed &#x20AC;7 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Ian Martin, Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi there. It's Martin Ian at Nomura. Couple of questions, the first gets back to the previous question about the disposal, and I think if we cast our mind back to the summer, you were suggesting that you were going to achieve about 7.6 billion with the proceeds for 2009. Given what's in the presentation, it now seems that you are going to achieve less than half of that. I appreciate you don't want to sell assets at any price. But is the sale of Enel Green Power actually running into a few problems in terms of getting that one consummated? And then secondly, in terms of the Spanish market, could you be a little more specific about the price that you are actually obtaining for your board at sales, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer your first comment. There is no obstacle, no impairment, not in any way or fashion, difficulties in placing a solid minority of our Green Power. There is a lot of appetite. Well, I'm saying is that, I want to squeeze the maximum value possible, and therefore, I obviously considering more time and I think we have the luxury of looking at more time to give us the opportunity to scalp the market for our best interest, which is to extract more value. And that's why we took the decision to postpone this disposal. I confirm to you, disposal will be on, and it will be at a maximum value possible. And the second question, I hand it over to Luigi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at today spot price in the Spanish markets, you will see that they are &#x2013; we have a base load price lower than &#x20AC;40 per megawatt hour, 35, &#x20AC;40 per megawatt hour. While, Endesa has delivered a solid second number, as I said before, and as Endesa itself presented to the market yesterday, and this is the results of the forward sales strategy that they put in place last year. Therefore, if you compare the average price of this year versus the spot price of this moment, you see an advantage in the region of 20 or &#x20AC;25 per megawatt-hour, which is one of the reason or the basis of their strong margin we reported in the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about 2010?</p>

          <p>2010, we expect a slight increase in &#x2013; if you look at the calendar, you will see that we are running at 40, in the region of &#x20AC;40 per megawatt-hour. As I said before, we are securing our forward sales at a price higher than this level of 40, which is in the region of 50.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good evening and thank you. I would have few questions; first on the hedging, could you please give us the volumes that you budget instead of the percentages? Second question, would be on the renewables. We heard that Endesa is stressing that they have a huge front line and opportunities in renewables. How does that interact with Enel Green Power, and the potential sales process?</p>
          <p>And third question would be on guidance. I hear that you confirm your 2010 guidance in EBITDA, and net profit. Would you be possible to comment further on the impact of the expected disposals on this guidance? It's a 10 billion asset sales will decrease in EBITDA, and net income and this is obviously included in the guidance, but within what's the impact to it?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sure. Well I will start from the first question. Let's talk about volumes so your question is finally you sold 100% with regards to 2009 and almost 100% in Italy, with regards to 2010. We are talking about a net expected production in the region of 82, &#x20AC;83 per megawatt-hour. Therefore -- terawatt-hour &#x2013; sorry, therefore we are talking about 80, 82 terawatt-hours sold for 2010. When it comes to Spain, which is our second market, we are referring to an average of forward sales of 64 or 60, 65%, which is &#x2013; which means 40 terawatt-hours sold and secured. When it comes to Slovakia, we are basically secure 100% over the production, which is in the region of 20, 22 terawatt-hours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question is on renewables. Pipeline is, in our conception of pipeline, solid, hard projects that we are slowly progressing and putting in the market. You will hear more in the next few weeks about projects that we are developing in the United States and Latin America. And some projects that we are developing in the European different countries. There will be no hindrance for disposing of the Green Power for the pipeline. As a matter of fact, we are selecting our projects on a very hard base facts. We are not selling pie in the sky. We never did it, we are not doing now. Therefore, this will enhance our value as a matter of fact. And the reason why we're postponing is also because of and there is lot of interesting projects that we are developing right now. And we'll be better off to show it after one full year operations, to give credibility on our plan. And we are pretty sure that this will result in higher value for us. I hand it over to Luigi for the third question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Fulvio. Well, when it comes to your third question, and with regards to the target that we have committed to for 2010. What I confirm you this &#x20AC;10 billion &#x2013; &#x20AC;16 billion EBITDA is net already of the assets sold. Therefore, this net of EBITDA that we can have coming from that disposal we are planning to. As long as the &#x20AC;4 billion net ordinary income expected in 2010.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, on renewables, do you plan to combine and Enel Green Power with the projects of Endesa at some point? And on the guidance and impact of asset sales, can you quantify a bit more please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I keep saying that there is a working group that is assessing the &#x2013; the potential for, assessing the best interest of both Enel and Endesa. You will have to await the outcome of that working group. Let me add on to this, that one of the reasons why I postponed that disposal is that I also wanted to have a full year of operation. As you know, we started this Enel Green Power in December 2008. And in order to go into the market, I'd rather have a full year of results, a full disclosure on the balance sheet, and the potential growth of the company that will demonstrate more the value that we have created.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we continue to create, and this will continue to be a very important step forward. I think Endesa's assets have quality on their own. They have 1000 megawatts of capacity today. They are developing 7000 megawatts of pipeline. They're making more than &#x20AC;200 million of EBITDA today. It's a wealth of the assets and it makes sense to evaluate any potential combination.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Three questions, if I may. One is related to the competitive scenario in thermal generation in Italy in 2010. If you can give us your view, particularly in terms of load factors for the GPs and the coal plants, considering the capacity additions in the market, and compared to 2009? Then I have a question on Enel Green Power. If you can give some details on the under the &#x20AC;1 million increase in EBITDA in Italy, considering that phase prices should be lower than in 2008? And finally, if you can break down the 1 billion synergies effected in 2012, between the CapEx and OpEx? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luigi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, I will start with your second question, regarding the EBITDA improvements of Enel Green Power. Well, of course, Enel Green Power benefited of two things in Italy. First, of a better hydro condition and second, which is equal to 700, I would &#x2013; very close to 1 terawatt-hour of additional production. And then, we have also the forward selling strategy in Enel Green Power as well, because they have sold forward the electricity as long as we have done in our generation energy management division. And they have benefited of these difference between this spot price and their forward sales concepts.</p>
          <p>Moving on to your first question, I would say that in terms of competitive scenario when it comes to Italy, and when we look at the load factor, we don't see any major difference between 2009, 2010. Possibly we should expect some slight improvement in 2010, since, as you know, we are facing a huge decline in the electricity demand. At the end of September, we have seen more than 7% decline versus last year. Therefore, when it comes to the load factor, for instance of the gas combined cycle, well, I would say that this year we are working at 2500 hours per year. And we do not expect any major changes next year, or possibly some improvements.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the coal, the story is totally different. Of course, the assets that we have, including the new one, which is Slovakia, this year is not fully contributing to our results because we just had one unit fully functioning and next year we will have the entire plant functioning and therefore, it would contribute with a large sector of 80% mass plus, especially next year.</p>
          <p>When it comes to synergies the &#x20AC;1 billion expected and as our CEO mentioned before namely I referred to improvements in the distribution fields. Let me remind you that we are implementing in Spain, the new digital meters so we are installing to all to our medium customer, the digital meters. We expect improvement in the distribution not only because of this but also because of some improvements in the organization in the way of running the natural business.</p>
          <p>We expect improvements through the integration of our better coordination in the fuel procurement activities. The same could be said for the trading activities, which today is pleasing too and then we have in the procurement field in general. Coming back to your question, I would say that also this &#x20AC;1 billion, one-third is CapEx and the remaining is OpEx and therefore EBITDA improvements.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I would like to know in terms of your covenant structure, what is your feeling in terms of Endesa gearing levels being so much lower than Enel? Endesa yesterday said, during the call that they don't plan any extraordinary dividend, I just would like to understand what is in terms of efficient capital structure your feeling and with Endesa being so let's get an Enel? And the second question is if we should keep outcome indication in terms of spark had now supplied or actually launching in Italy for next year? And finally, can you give us an indication in terms of your CapEx especially for 2009 in your international businesses? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For your first question, I may hand it over to Luigi to second or the third but Endesa is fully consolidated by us. We manage separately, but we also consider Endesa to be intimate part of our consolidation. We make no significant difference between the two sets of books. So what is important to me is the fully consolidated number and therefore we continued to see the potential foreign business as an opportunity for us, as not an entrance. Second and third?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. Sparks spread and dark spread in Italy 2010, when it comes to the sparks &#x2013; the clean spark spreads, expected in 2010, in our house we see &#x20AC;17 per megawatt hour. When it comes to the clean dark spread, again in our house, therefore taking into account the new technology and the new power plants just built right through Slovakia. We are higher than &#x20AC;35 per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Moving on to your third question, about the expected CapEx in our international division, well, let me remind you that our international division next year and the coming year is investing mainly in Slovakia in our &#x2013; more than three or four nuclear power plants in Russia. And therefore 2010 is a sort of peak of spending in particular when it comes to Slovakia. The number we are expecting that we see next year will be just slightly higher than &#x20AC;1.5 billion versus &#x20AC;1 billion of this year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Two questions, first one, a very specific one, if you look at the &#x2013; in this report in depth of your nine-month results, the figure was &#x20AC;19.3 billion. We adjust for the 30% are being in mainly in Spain, that would drop to &#x20AC;15.2 billion and you are reporting in your number net debts for Endesa of &#x20AC;12.4 billion. I would like if possible to have estimation of &#x20AC;2.8 billion up.</p>
          <p>And the second question is very generic one, we've seen the, that is the demand in Italy being very weak in the third quarter of the year as you mentioned, will this have any indication in your fuel purchasing strategy. Is there any increase that you are &#x2013; long gas or long haul in your purchases in Italy? And what's your expectation for the outlook for the sector in &#x2013; for demand in Italy in 2010. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me handle the second part of the question. The bureau of Italy, so to some extent is that, even at the lower up time of the combined cycle plants, there was less of a tension of a problem than in other countries because we tend to have contracts with limited take-or-pay provision, or there is a flexibility build in and the process that will definitely help keeping the &#x2013; a good common sense approach to the market, so to speak and I'll stop over here. So I don't see major risks out of that, even in the future. For the reconsideration of the GAAP between Endesa1 and Enel I'll turn it over to Luigi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. Well as you said, there is a first item, with regards to total deficits, which we consider according to let's say the Enel principles not &#x20AC;4 billion, but &#x20AC;4.8 billion taking into account also a receivable that we have for the CO2, which is consider financial.</p>
          <p>Then we have &#x2013; therefore we were talking about 5 billion then we have other financial receivable, which at Endesa level are not needed. You will see a change starting from the first of January 2010 after that the two groups will have of course the same language .We couldn't do that during this year because we reached the entire control just at the end of June, after that movement we had the joint control. And in order to maintain the comparison of the numbers we had to leave things how they were. But by the first of June it will be in light. So, the difference with regards to just some financial receivable of which you can find more detail also in our first &#x2013; third quarter reports in the annexes in all the charts, including in the package.</p>

          <p>Sorry. Another question, so the second question is that on the renewable, Ferraris in the past guided to a target for 2009 of &#x2013; in effect of 1.2 billion EBITDA. I wonder if that is concerned following the results? And finally just to be sure on the question of on the debt of Endesa, how does it compared to one to the destination of Enel, if there are any change over the last few months?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure, when it comes to your third question, the answer is no, there were no changes, so we are comparing Endesa level at the Enel level our net financial position on a consistency basis. When it comes to the forward sales in 2011, let's start from Italy first. We &#x2013; of course, we are setting forward also in 2011. For now, we have reached something very close to 16 to 17%. And when it comes to Slovakia, which is our third markets we are close to 23, 25% and when it comes to the Endesa level, we are in the region of 15% as well. When it comes to Latin America, this is not an issue because on a rolling basis, we always stay in the region of 70, 75% every year. For now, we are already at 65%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi good evening and I have several questions please hopefully quite quick Could you first of all has thoughts on minorities for 2010, which could be big swing for your net income line and could you specify if you're already speaking out I guess a 30% stake for Green Power or you can help us to see how much you expect net income from Green Power for next year.</p>
          <p>And secondly as you talk about 80 hour of forward sales in Italy, do you include any Green Power in there and if still can you specify otherwise if you hedge any of this forward selling any of the volumes from Green Power in Italy and was priced.</p>
          <p>And continuing on these &#x2013; along these lines in Italy and generally, it was very strong there was a swing from gas supply, could you specify what is purely Italian generation, and can you breakdown champion in between anecdotal fuel and energy management because of the and everything else effectively.</p>
          <p>And very last one please for Chief Executive, we've been recent about in the press potential interest being developing nuclear in Russia and potential acquiring North Sea gas assets from NI. Could you confirm any interest in there and explain the strategic rationale behind it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one, there is no strategic rationale because there is no interest. If this is clear for you. When it comes to your quoting about probably the break up in minorities in 2010, I mean we have to finished the transaction before, but if you assume that we are progressing our numbers, the way we are progressing for Green Power, you can easily calculate in your model, what you might expect out of minority for that where our disclosure will be of course available at the time we will be announcing the transaction for the remainder of the question Luigi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. We said 82 terawatt hour was sold, we included &#x2013; we also included Enel Green Power. The average prices for Enel Green Power was in the region of &#x20AC;80 per megawatts hour. When it comes to the split between generation and energy management and <mark type="inaudible" /> in the other company that we have in Italy well the way we manage and we work in terms of transfer price, basically say that we have most of the profits in our generation assets at company or legal entity.</p>
          <p>By the way on chart number 45, you have the total amount of the generation energy management in Italy also which coming through the EBITDA 80% of debt is Enel positive which is the one of the assets, the remaining is basically in our let's say trading company which buy and sells the electricity and sell also to the final customer through the retailer as well. So this is it basically is very simple the way we work, we try to have a perfect integration between the final customer and the generation assets and therefore, we secure the entire margins. When we talk about the entire margin, we talk about the margin between the final customer in our generation assets in the cost of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Forgive me the follow-up that means also the 1.2 billion EBITDA for Green Power for this year pretty much include prices of about &#x20AC;80 per megawatt hour is that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Enel Green Power is an independent company of course but anyway they have sold forward as I said in the very beginning and they benefited of this strategy of securing their margin as well and therefore last year when we have incorporated these assets in this company we have also offer for them some contracts as long as all the other generation assets in Italy.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I have one just one remaining question on Green Power I was wondering whether the delay on the disposal closing a 100 could you &#x2013; any question or issue on the rating from the agency because the capital ratio at the end of the year would be different from the expected one with the guidance over debt below 50 billion and the other one regarding ancillary service and if I'm not wrong if I got it correctly you said that the difference ancillary service increase just caused by the lower volume so there is no impact from the region of market yet into these margin component probably we can expect a better contribution from the ancillary service net next year is that correct? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me handle the first question of course we don't do anything of this manage it without being touched with the rating agencies we continue to lease with them as much as we are committed to maintain a single A rating of course we are maintaining a open book transparency to the rating agencies and we will continue to do so in the future. And not to expect note nothing sizable or important to come out of this deferral of the disposal. The deferral of the disposal is made on a purpose as I keep saying capturing the most value for the entire benefits of bond over still call those and the company. And this is much appreciated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the second question ancillary services well what I said before is basically the following we had a decline in the ancillary services mainly because of the decline in the electricity demands. The new rules are already in place of course therefore I don't think we can expect next year should the demand going back to normality to reach the same level we had in the past. As we said many times we expected on a normal course of business to a reduction of &#x20AC;200 million in the ancillary services versus what was in 2007 and therefore I think that will be the range.</p>

          <p>If I may just one more question shortly but if you are taking already a higher than expected savings in the Endesa is that mean that we can already assume that the target in EBITDA will be higher than the strategic plan, or do you expect those additional savings to be absorbed by the worse market conditions?</p>

          <p>Well, we confirm &#x20AC;16 billion target in 2010 taking into account that the electricity demand further decreased in the meantime. Therefore all the actions that we put in place to reduce the cost will support such results.</p>

          <p>Yes, good evening. Good evening, gentlemen. A quick question on your bond issues as you just announced that you may issue up to and over four billion next year and Europe current market appetite I mean these should be equal to for the retail bond in Italy. As would you be ready to reconsider again later in 2010 this target i.e. issuing more bonds in order to prepare 2012 reduction. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your voice came a bit grumbled. I'm not sure what I got your question but I will try to answer to what I &#x2013; for what I understood. As you might have seen we are today announcing the bond issue of &#x20AC;4 billion, to talk up for what we have been doing during 2009 so our board has decided to go on forward with area of launching a retail power placement and additional institution placing into 2010, this will be of course helping to stand maturities lock in interest rates to our benefit and this will be what we intend to do and we'll do it.</p>
