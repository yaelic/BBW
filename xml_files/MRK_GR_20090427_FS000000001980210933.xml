          <p>Good day and welcome to the First Quarter 2009 Earnings Release of Merck KGaA Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to your host today Dr. Michael Becker. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss the first quarter results. With me today are Elmar Schnee, my Board colleague in charge of the Pharmaceuticals Business Sector and our IR Team Uta Kemmerich-Keil, Head of Finance, Claudia Nickolaus and Thomas Kornek.</p>
          <p>First, I will guide you through the financials of the Group and our four divisions. After that, Elmar will provide you with the details of finance of Merck Serono with regard to products, markets, and pipeline. This kind of job sharing leads to a deviation from the sequence of the presentation that we sent to you through this morning. We will try to mitigate this by indicating which slides of the presentation we refer to.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide six, the global economic downturn left traces in our figures. We kept total revenues for the first quarter 2009 with &#x20AC;1.9 billion at prior year's level. Merck Serono achieved good revenue growth, but the Chemicals division had a weak quarter. As costs were not at all in line with revenues, the core operating result dropped 32% to &#x20AC;343 million and core earnings per share by the same percentage to &#x20AC;1.14. The details regarding costs I will provide when I comment on the development of the divisions.</p>
          <p>In Q1, we charged an amount of &#x20AC;70 million to exceptionals to cover cost associated with the withdrawal of our psoriasis product Raptiva. With that, we intend to cover all potential costs that may occur.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow before acquisitions and divestitures was down 40%. Our underlying tax rate, which excludes exceptionals was 24.7%, a further improvement compared with 26.4% of 2008. Net debt shrank to &#x20AC;358 million.</p>
          <p>The revenue growth analysis on slide eight is meant to highlight that on Group level currency effects are negligible.</p>
          <p>Slide nine confirms that Merck Serono is now the growth driver of the Group and also the cash provider of the Group. The 9% increase in sales is driven by double-digit growth of our top products Rebif, Erbitux, and Gonal-f. Royalty income went up 37% giving an extra push to the gross margins which went up by 12%. The 17% increase of marketing and selling expenses is among others due to the launches and the increase in commission payments.</p>
          <p>Sales increase of Rebif in the U.S lead to higher commission payments to Pfizer, our co-promotion partner in the USA. Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone received commission payments related to Erbitux sales in Japan; which increases steeply in the launch phase. Free cash flow was up nicely by 66 million to &#x20AC;227 million compared to previous year first quarter.</p>
          <p>Consumer Health Care revenues as shown on slide 18, dropped by 3% to &#x20AC;108 million. Taking out the negative currency effects mainly from the UK business, revenue grew by 1.1%. Higher marketing and selling expenses were expected and are dedicated to our strong brands such as BION and Kytta. Both brands, BION in France, Kytta in Germany, gained market share. Comparing the operating results and cash flow one should be aware that the one-off gain from the divestment of the biMan&#xE1;n in Spain CFC brand in the first quarter of last year, that's when that 11 million and -- is missing in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystals' key financials are on slide 20. Revenues of Liquid Crystals went down by 44% to &#x20AC;131 million compared to the first quarter 2008. The gross margin decrease was accelerated by low capacity utilization. We are convinced that Liquid Crystals hit the bottom in the first quarter. We now see increases in sales month over month, but there's still a long way to go to reach meaningful EBIT margin unaffected by idle capacity.</p>
          <p>Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals, please go to slide 22 now. The pigment business suffered from the economic situation. We had a continuous growth from Pharma end-markets though. Total revenues were down 6% to &#x20AC;305 million for first three months of the year despite a positive currency effect of nearly 2%. High marketing and selling expenses are driven by investment in focused regions and projects. The only remarkable movement in our strong balance sheet, which is shown on slide 24, are the increases from the &#x20AC;750 million Eurobond issued in March 20. So, on both sides financial liabilities and cash both rise by 750 million.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, you will find the breakdown of the Group's free cash flow, which fell 40% because of the weak profit. Please note that the exceptional of &#x20AC;70 million, mentioned earlier, reduces the profit after-tax but not the cash flow and is therefore added back in the item Other, which shows a positive comparison to last year. Merck Serono, as said, is now by far the main cash flow contributor of the Group.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn to our outlook for the full year 2009. It is given on slide 26. We expect Merck Serono to turn in a revenue growth of 6 to 9% and a core return on sales of 20 to 25%. Please remember that the return on sales is calculated from the total revenues. The withdrawal of Raptiva in the U.S. market, selling costs, and research and development are causing us to be cautious in the ROS of Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>Liquid Crystals will shrink by 20 to 30% and will have an EBIT margin of 20 to 30%; still heavily affected by idle capacity. All in all, we expect for 2009 a Group revenue growth ranging from 0 to 5% and a Group core ROS ranging between 15 and 20%.</p>
          <p>If we also go to other divisions, you see that we guide Consumer Health Care revenue growth of 5 to 9% and a return on sales of 5 to 10%, which is lower than is the norm for this division. This is down to the already mentioned marketing expenses, which will not go away.</p>
          <p>In the Performance &amp; Life Science Chemicals, we expect an unchanged revenue development and a return on sales of 5 to 10% as we at the moment have to brace ourselves continuous weaknesses of the pigment business.</p>
          <p>And for -- as a matter of completeness, corporate and others will have the same amount as last year that is only in the operating result and is a very small number from corporate costs. The Merck Group will grow, as I said, from zero to 5% at core operating result, ROS 15 to 20%.</p>
          <p>This is all from my side. Thank you for your attention, Elmar, please join the half now.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome to all of you on the phone. <mark type="inaudible" /> Michael reported revenue growth at Merck Serono. I will now explain the reasons of what really is an impressive performance. Let's start with Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>Details of sales growth by therapeutic area and by product is shown on slide 10. I will comment on oncology separately. As in the previous quarter, Rebif showed again, a healthy growth as worldwide sales up 18% in the first quarter of 2009. Organic growth was 14%. The U.S. franchise had been supported by strong price increases in 2008 in a favorable currency exchange rate development.</p>
          <p>Compared with previous year's first quarter, European sales grew by almost 5% mainly due to the successful launch of RNF, Rebif New Formulation. We boosted endocrinology sales by 17%. This is due to the expanded use of the new electronic injection device Easypod for our growth hormone Saizen and the chunk 18% of our other growth hormone Serostim. The cardiometabolic care franchise was strongly supported by outstanding life cycle management efforts. Metformin and its newer versions are the worldwide gold standard for first line treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.</p>
          <p>We continued to transfer part of the general physician sales organization while cardiometabolic products to DAIICHI SANKYO. This is in line with our strategy to focus on specialist targeted innovative medicine.</p>
          <p>Let's talk now about our growth engines to be found on slides 11 to 14. On slide 11 you will see the Oncology. In first line metastatic colorectal cancer, we experienced a transition period in Europe due to the KRAS label restriction during the second half of 2008. KRAS screening is now available at the majority of the EU oncology centers and reimbursement of the drug was secured in 18 markets meanwhile. We saw an improved first line colorectal cancer uptake already in Q4 2008, and a further sales growth in Q1 2009 as predicted. We started again sequential growth in the first quarter and we expect this to continue. We expect Erbitux to achieve blockbuster status in the year 2010 and further penetration in first line colorectal cancer; through the launch of first line recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer, through further market penetration in the second and the third line in colorectal cancer in Japan, and the launch of the first line non-small lung cancer therapy in Europe.</p>
          <p>In mid-March, we announced the start of our phase II clinical study CERTOa. This trial is investing efficacy and safety of the novel combination of Cilengitide with Erbitux, and, a platinum-based chemotherapy as first line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. We are very confident to advance our neurodegenerative diseases franchise through key activities also present on slide 12.</p>
          <p>We disclosed top line data from our CLARITY Phase III trial in January, ahead of the timeline initially planned. The study showed a 58% clinical reduction in relapse rate when using oral Cladribine to treat multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the trial proved a good safety profile for the treatment with Cladribine. The submission for registration is planned for mid-2009 for the EMEA as well as for FDA. More details about Phase III data will be presented in two days from now at the American Academy of Neurology. We will have an Analyst and Investor Conference thereafter. Furthermore, partnering is key to our strategy and we strengthen our leadership in multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>In January, we signed a licensing agreement with Apitope Technology. We now have worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Apitope's MS product, ATX-MS-1467. The partnership with Fast Forward, a subsidiary of the American National Multiple Sclerosis Society covers research and clinical development on new targets in multiple sclerosis.</p>
          <p>On slide 13, we present information on the result of our Phase III pivotal trial 016 for safinamide reported at the beginning of February. This drug is currently being developed jointly by Merck Serono and Newron as an add-on treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease.</p>
          <p>The primary efficacy endpoint was met. The ON time of motor functioning <mark type="inaudible" /> Parkinson's patients experienced the best level of motor functioning benefits with regards to mobility, slowness, and stiffness improved significantly.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, secondary efficacy endpoints of the study were met, including decrease in daily OFF time. We'll presents full study results at the upcoming scientific meetings once the ongoing <mark type="inaudible" /> will be completed.</p>
          <p>Now some remarks to HPA as shown on page 14. Last week, we announced the launch of Kuvan in Europe. It will be available in more than ten European countries by end of this year. The drug was developed by Merck's Serono's BioMarin and has been available in the U.S. since 2007.</p>
          <p>We have the exclusive rights to market Kuvan in territories outside North America and Japan. Kuvan is the only drug approved in Europe for the treatment of HPA due to PKU or BH4 deficiency. As a result of global newborn screening efforts, all PKU patient in developed countries are diagnosed at birth. So far the only treatment is a highly restrictive medical food diet. With Kuvan patients are able to substantially improve their quality of life by preventing neurological problems. The number of affected patients is approximately 35,000 in the European Union. 20 to 50% of those are responsive to treatment with Kuvan.</p>
          <p>There is nothing to add on what Michael outlined regarding the suspension of Raptiva. Slide 14 provides an overview of the main issues. Also, the FDA and Genentech agreed to retract Raptiva.</p>
          <p>I would now like to give an overview of the pipeline as shown on slides 15 and 16. On slide 15, you can see that we delivered as promised &#x2013; Erbitux head and neck first line and Kuvan are launched.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline portfolio is shown on slide 16. Our strategic focus is oncology, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. They offer in our view, the best growth opportunities for Merck. Despite the fact that in autoimmune and inflammation through Raptiva, we developed promising assets such as FGF-18 and <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline portfolio is well balanced with again 60% of the portfolio being biologics and around the remainder being small molecules. Furthermore, we developed products in fertility and endocrinology to exploit the growth potential within these established markets.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 summarizes our expected news flow within the next 12 months as already presented to you earlier.</p>
          <p>Now let's move on to Consumer Healthcare, CHC, which is a solid business that will grow further by focusing on strategic brands in the four health themes as presented on slide 19. The strategic brands now account for 53% of the total CHC business.</p>
          <p>To conclude my presentation, I would like to point out to you that our Pharmaceutical business is the growth driver for the Group and we are relentlessly building on an innovative and risk balanced pipeline.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention. Michael and I are now ready to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Doctor. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll now take our first question from Mr. Jack Scannell from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks very much, Jack Scannell here, just two questions. First, I'm still scratching my head about the currency adjustments on Liquid Crystals. Certainly, I think you gave some comments last year, which might have led people to think that dollar and yen were the currencies to keep an eye on. Those have strengthened against the euro but we still see a negative currency effect for Liquid Crystals. If you could explain that that'd be great.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, could you partition the Erbitux growth a little bit more. I'm intrigued to know how much of this is a sort of resumption of second and third line use in colorectal given KRAS testing -- how much is first line use in colorectal and may be how much is the head and neck or a geographic expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will take on the very complicated currency questions first. I think it is very easy to get confused about the dollar won situation. If we look at the business as a whole and the currency effect as a whole, then it is of course through that &#x2013; on that currency the dollar we invoice in dollar in Korea, the yen -- say is it yen in Japan and the Taiwan dollar are the currencies that influence the whole picture. You have to be aware though that in Korea, invoicing in dollar means that we have a currency effect on transaction -- on the sales transaction.</p>
          <p>What we show in our overview in the adjusted sales is only reflecting the translation effect. So translating one P&amp;L and one currency into our leading currency euro. And the currency in which the balance sheet in Korea is made up is won. And therefore the sales are recorded in won and then translated into euro and there we have a negative influence on our sales from currency translation.</p>
          <p>Now, in the best of both worlds the transaction, invoicing in dollar would then balance this effect. So, we have more wons because we invoice in dollar and these more wons are then translated into less euros. And the euro-dollar situation should be the same. This is only if we don't have to give back prices in dollar, so the prices are not reduced in dollar, so that would be the same prices. But if we only look at the currency, you are all right to be confused, the dollar is only transactional, which we cannot really show in our adjustment. The adjustment only reflects the won.</p>
          <p>Now to sort of ease your pain; from the middle of the year the functional currency in Korea will be the dollar, so this effect will be out of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding to Erbitux, I can only give you what we think is happening because market research is not detailing by line. Currently, I believe that the sales increase we will we see in first line, because these are the trends in the earlier quarter, to replace the losing third and second line. And as you know, the normal third line treatment is 16 weeks, where first line is somewhere 28 to 32 weeks. So you need actually four months and you add something on our sales book. But currently I believe that roughly 20% of our sales are maybe head and neck and we start just now to penetrate the first line colorectal cancer in the view of sales. We started this to do already last year, of course, but we had to replace the fast falling second and third line therapies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Dani Saurymper from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good afternoon. Dani Saurymper from Goldman Sachs. Three questions, if I may? Just firstly on Liquid Crystals, can you just maybe give a little bit more color on the pricing outlook that you are envisaging I notice you say you obviously -- the sales are down, but also are seeing some price softness? So, can you maybe give us a little bit of perspective on that and how you seeing that will persist for the remainder of the year? Do you anticipate being able to claw pricing back as demand strengthens?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on working capital, just trying to understand a bit more -- another quarter of negative working capital. I'm just trying to work through what the dynamics at play are there. Obviously, some launch inventory build maybe perhaps explain some of it? But just trying to understand the receivables and payables.</p>
          <p>And then, just lastly on Merck Serono Pharma margins; if we were to have not seen such a strong performance at the royalty income line, I suspect the operating margin wouldn't have been as stronger as seen. Does that perhaps explain your guidance for the remainder of 2009 on the Merck Serono Pharma margin? Is it related to a slowdown in royalty income or is it just an anticipation of higher costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I can -- I will answer Liquid Crystals and the working capital question, Elmar will tell you what caused us to be conservative on the Merck Serono guidance. The pricing issue in Liquid Crystals is a very difficult issue. And I think, we -- at least we regard ourselves brave that we have now given a Liquid Crystal guidance. But as you can see from the wide corridor of the guidance, there are still a lot of uncertainties. I think the most stupid thing you can do is if you have a downturn and a record downturn that you then also give away prices; you better give away market shares.</p>
          <p>If then in the upturn, you want to regain these market shares; you will have to be a bit more soft on prices. At the moment, our visibility about market share isn't very complete. We don't say we have lost significant market share but we see that our competition has achieved more inroads in the CV sector. At the moment, therefore, there is clearly visible a price pressure, but to more concern to us is the question of capacity utilization. It is not decided yet how the pricing will look like in the second half of this year, when we expect to become stronger as you can see from our guidance. But the old equation that we had more efficiency in production and we're thus able to balance price concessions and if their currency -- that is of course interrupted while we have low capacity utilization. We cannot have low capacity utilization and better efficiency because most of the efficiency stems from higher quantities.</p>
          <p>It is also not clear how big the differential will be for our new technology PSVA; Polymer Stabilized Vertical Aligned, which is a successor technology to VA. And, therefore, it would be irresponsible for me to give you more concrete indications on where prices may go.</p>
          <p>On the working capital side, I think we have brought the growth of working capital down in line with the slowdown in the Chemicals business. But, of course, we have a strongly growing Pharmaceuticals business and this business requires more working capital in line with the growth. That's why if you look at the absolute figure alone, you see a 120 million increase in working capital, which is more or less in line with the growth of our Pharmaceutical division and the drastic &#x2013; dramatic reduction in Liquid Crystals sales could of course not be accompanied immediately with an according reduction of inventories. And that is the explanation for the working capital. I hand over to Elmar for the Merck Serono question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the guidance of 20 to 25% core ROS, royalty is not the main thing, there might be a softening of the income. The main areas are the following. The first one is R&amp;D. We will keep up our R&amp;D spend because the results which we have seen lately actually are more positive than we expected and I think we have now to make the necessary investment to establish these drugs as key drivers for the future.</p>
          <p>Secondly, after IMS reduced markedly its forecast for the world's pharmaceutical markets and we see signs, though not yet confirmed, but we see signs of softening of out-of-pocket expense of drugs, which is mainly in the growth areas of Latin America and Asia. We think maybe we will see a reduced market growth in those markets.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, we will hopefully, if we get approval by the FDA, launch Cladribine in next year. And we would like to do a fabulous job to establish this drug very early on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now take our next question from Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch. Just a few questions if I could please. First is just to follow-on from that last question and you mentioning of Cladribine, just a bit of color on two aspects. One, the extent you would expect to use your existing Rebif sales force and B) just a bit color on SG&amp;A growth relative to your revenue growth guidance. I wonder if you could just give us a bit of color on the extent on which you expect that to be great in revenue growth guidance?</p>
          <p>And secondly just whether you have any timelines on the COIN? Do you expect <mark type="inaudible" /> perspective relative to the upcoming <mark type="inaudible" /> data? And then finally just a quick question on Liquid Crystals. There was mention of inventory level work down at your customers. I just wonder if you have any color on that? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with COIN. We thought we'd get the results for ASCO, but we do not, which <mark type="inaudible" /> is good news because it's an event driven trial. So we think maybe that in autumn there might be a possibility to see this important information.</p>
          <p>Regarding Rebif, of course we are currently doing all the work and we have to see based on the full data that -- which &#x2013; get presented in Japan in two days how we position Cladribine into the market.</p>
          <p>Regarding <mark type="inaudible" /> whatever you'd like to call it, we will invest in some activities to launch this drug. But we have established for Cladribine actually our infrastructure because -- which will be targeted with the same physicians as Rebif is prescribed to. So there might be a short-term hike because we have to launch a new product and we maintain the pressure on Rebif.</p>
          <p>But over the long term, I think there should be not a growth, which is above our top line. Except that in the line of marketing you have also commissions which are paid to Pfizer, which is half of our share in Japan, and other royalties from ImClome and other <mark type="inaudible" /> drive as we grow this product. But if net for net which is true marketing and selling, I do not expect that we'll accelerate the path growth of top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the inventory question in the Liquid Crystal business, we have said before that we think there is a quite substantial inventory effect in the downturn of Liquid Crystals. There have been inventories worked off in the retail chain. There have been inventories sold off at the GB producers, there have been inventories being sold of at the display producers.</p>
          <p>The prediction that we have and which we think is not so wrong is that the sales of TVs this year will be flat at best and we see that customers are restarting their factories. As I said, we see sales growth month-on-month. We expect that to continue although in a very modest growth rate. But I think that the inventory is all but -- inventory problem is all but over. Factories will restart to work, but I do not expect from the end user to apply a substantial boost to that area.</p>
          <p>So, in a nutshell the answer is we don't know exactly, but at least the sharpness of the inventory effect is now out of the system.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, yes, thank you. Amit Roy from Nomura. First question on ROCD. You've given the guidance margins of between 20 to 30%, I understand there's an extra cost obviously on the plants idle. Can you give any sort of any color or guidance as to what level of sales translates into approximately what kind of margin? It's quite difficult for us to get a handle on the incremental costs that are associated with idle plant on that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, regarding the REFLEX study, any kind of upgrade as to when we'll be getting data on Rebif in clinically isolated syndrome.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, just coming back to the first line penetration of Erbitux in colon cancer, any idea what sort of penetration -- early penetration figures you may have in the <mark type="inaudible" /> population? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Steve. LC effect of fixed and variable costs. It's regrettable that you find it difficult to get your hand around the problem, if we thought it &#x2013; could find it easy to get our hands around the problem, we wouldn't give guidance of ten percentage points. The guidance is so wide because we also have our problems to get our hands around the development and idle capacity is only one influence.</p>
          <p>Another influence is how quickly can we go back to improvements in our production efficiency and how heavily influenced will the whole picture be by price pressure. So, we give guidance to our best knowledge, but we do not discuss scenarios, if when and selected influencing factors in public. Please understand we also have a competition who would love to know what our fixed manufacturing costs are.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding the REFLEX study, you are absolutely right that we all foresee that we might have results in the second half. We decided that we would like to modify the protocol because the treatment span has been somewhat changed and maybe the next dose criteria is not anymore the most adapted one to get approval. Therefore we will see a delayed relaunch, but it will also allow us to have more security that we will obtain an indication with this study. Therefore, I think we will add one year or one and half years' time to this trial, but the benefit will be that we will be -- open up hopefully more potential for our drug. And I didn't hear the second question which you had.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That was just a simple question on any sort of early indication of sort of penetration you're getting in the care of positive patients, first line colorectal cancer?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Four very quick questions, if I may. So just first on COIN, my understanding was the delay is due to the KRAS analysis rather than the maturing to your survival data, which has been around for a while. If you could confirm that that will be helpful.</p>
          <p>Second on Kuvan you referred to 10 European countries launched by year-end. Will you have reimbursements in place for all those countries at that time or is this going to take a further period of negotiation?</p>
          <p>Number three, could you give us the penetration in the extreme indication for head-and-neck. And then finally what percentage of patients receiving Erbitux in the colorectal setting are receiving it currently without prior KRAS testing? I'm just trying to get at what the residual potential risk to your in-market Erbitux sales is, or whether it's been truly washed out? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Andrew, for the COIN study; the COIN study is a study, which is prospect, as you said into KRAS environment. So therefore KRAS is not the reason why we should have a delay in the study because it will be prospective results which we expect. And as the study is event driven it is a primary a mortality study. This is good news.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Kuvan, there might be -- not in all of the 10 countries reimbursement by year-end. But so far we have been positively surprised about the reimbursement willingness of the countries. Obviously it's a very small indication and there is a lot of need for these patients, for example, France and Italy already signaled that they will reimburse the drug immediately.</p>
          <p>Regarding EXTREME in head and neck, I have not seen in the last few months some penetration data. My guesstimate is somewhere around approaching double-digit. And the last question was...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question was, what percentage of patients getting Erbitux currently in colorectal are receiving it without prior KRAS testing?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know this. May be I'll ask Mr. <mark type="inaudible" />, but I doubt that he knows it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I just have -- sneak in one last question, you referred to 28 to 32 weeks as being the standard treatment duration in first line. Are you really seeing that in those patients that are getting Erbitux? One would imagine it would be much shorter given the resection target patient population what seems to being used?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean there might be a difference between resection and not-resectable tumor shrinkage that might be truth. But since I alluded already we see now the first patients really coming out of third line going into the &#x2013; perhaps we lost the third line patients -- and we see them now and we will get more information as we go, but so far there is no indication to believe that it will be very short on average.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Fist question is -- sorry is if I missed that somewhere in your disclosure -- a lot of your reference on the SG&amp;A -- increased SG&amp;A in Pharma is attributing this to the fact that you're paying Bristol-Myers in Japan. Can you -- could you actually disclose how much Erbitux is in Japan so that allow us to better model this going forward?</p>
          <p>Also on SG&amp;A, you just provided a lot more disclosure in your interim report on that line item breaking that down by components. And obviously what is quite noticeable is a strong increase in other operating income and could you just give a little bit more detail on that whether that's just a quarterly effect or whether that is actually the key contributor for the increase?</p>
          <p>And the final question is on Consumer. I was actually quite surprised about your guidance of ROS of only 5 to 10% here, which I'm wondering whether that means the division is earning a cost of capital &#x2013; the cost of capital this year. Is that just going to be a 2009 effect because you're making a big push on your core brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me start with the Erbitux business Japan. In Japan, Merck books 100% of the sales. But then the agreement between Bristol-Myers and us says that they have a 50-50 profit split. Of which it's known that half of this profit from Bristol-Myers goes to ImClone, but we deal with Bristol-Myers. But still --</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's our Japanese sales? We are not guiding sales levels per territory. But they are very good. Better than our planning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So has that been a key component of the growth spend...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They helped, but they are not at the level now where they are the entire growth by no means.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Will you contribute that -- will you provide that information at some point later on or when it becomes a larger proportion? Just -- as I said, because this is kind of a significant input into understanding the margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Normally we do not. But you can find just by IMS if you look carefully, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And regarding Consumer, yes, we have a clear push and that's our strategy on our core brands and every quarter we go steadily up quarter-by-quarter, which is the part of this seven brands. We are now at 53% and we keep going with this strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me comment on other operating income and expenses. This is a line, which we separate so not to disturb the comparison on the total SG&amp;A because the G -- the general, which we call other operating income and expenses is very volatile and there are influences for expenses from income, which make compares more difficult. So that's why I can't go to the total. We had the 85 million charge, which is about 50 million more than last year. And there are one-offs, especially in income that were there last year and didn't reoccur and expenses are different and very high this year.</p>
          <p>So, if I start with Merck Serono, we have 55 million and that was 20 million so we have 35 million increase. We had -- last year we had the dissolution of a provision to the tune of -- the old <mark type="inaudible" /> for this was &#x2013; there was a release of nine million and we have this year a provision for a patent dispute, which is long running and will still be with us for a long time, which we sort of have to bit -- not a bit, have to consider it in order to have a higher amount just in case. And that is the difference in Merck Serono.</p>
          <p>Then if you look at Consumer Health Care that was nine million plus last year, and is now one million minus. Included in the nine million plus last year was an 11 million income from the sale of the biMan&#xE1;n brand of CHC in Spain last year. So that is only two income sides already covered; one was the 11 million, and the other was the litigation.</p>
          <p>The effects in the Chemicals area are more normal fluctuations on expenses. But, these are the main influencing factors, which are contributing to this oscillation of the other operating income and expenses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen, few questions if I may. The first one is on Liquid Crystals and the capacities. Is there any possibility for you to further downsize the capacities over the year if the performance of the division is weak and there's not really a rebound?</p>
          <p>The next question is on Rebif. Can you give us an update on Rebif New Formulation in the U.S?</p>
          <p>And the last question is on Atacicept in lupus, when can we expect Phase III results to be published?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the capacity on Liquid Crystals, it is not possible to really reduce the capacities when we are convinced that the business model is still intact. I mean we are not like the car industry that will come out of the crisis in a totally different shape. This business will come out of the crisis in the same shape. We have no structural problems, we have no competitive changes, we have no changes at our customers. There are five big customers and they will survive, they will stay there. We have three countries. We have the technological need for the product. We have basically a growing market because there's still the whole cathodic ray market to capture for us. So, we need this capacity. And the only way to reduce capacity is not to work and this is just a phasing. So, we take holidays. We had four weeks holidays over Easter. We would have four weeks holidays in summer. We would have no short work. We have no lay-offs and we're certainly not going to reduce our capacities because they will be needed in the not too distant future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding to Rebif New Formulation, there is only to report as the last time that we are in good discussions with SK about it. And there is somewhat &#x2013; there are discussions going on, but it takes sometime and I reported to you before that it has to do with really a -- by a similar type new formulation or not. And for me, by a similar classification is not acceptable and I will fight whatever it takes to fight. But maybe with Cladribine we get here actually a good handle to this issue, should the FDA approve the drug beginning of next year.</p>
          <p>Regarding on Atacicept in lupus the results, I'm not 100% sure because I can't find my information, but I think it's end of 2010.</p>

          <p>Hi good afternoon, Cornelia Thomas from WestLB here. All my other questions have already been asked. There's just one left. You booked exceptionals of &#x20AC;70 million for Raptiva in Q1. I was just wondering, are we supposed to expect any more of that in the coming quarters or is that it for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the provision is meant to be all for ever, not only for 2009, but for the rest of our &#x2013; of MS service minus <mark type="inaudible" />. So the rest MS service. The only little caution, I must say, this is very early time. So, normally we would say this is a year-end measure. But since <mark type="inaudible" /> before it was appropriate to book that provision already in the first quarter. It is a generous provision. It maybe adjusted even downwards towards the end of the year. But from our intention and from our expectation, there will be no further adding to this provision, not this year, not next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Three questions, if I may. First of all on PLS, and please correct me if I'm not right, but I thought around 25% is related to the automotive industry and if I have a look on your sales and your operating results, it seem that it's not only the automotive pigments parts which is suffering, and so if you can give me clarification on this?</p>
          <p>So the second question is on Rebif. Can you explain the current market situation with it as one of your competitors increased prices by 10%, if I'm right? And this has helped you in the first quarter and/or do you also planning price increases? And what are the effects on the -- expect -- you expect from the blend?</p>
          <p>And the third and last question, Liquid Crystals, can you give us an update on your inventory levels in Liquid Crystals? Any contrast to the &#x2013; contrast in normal times and to what you expect for the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And can you quantify positive net working capital effect for your free cash flow? That would be all from my side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think that 25% of the total PLS is for automotive. I don't think that that is right. I think the real answer is more 15% than 25%. It is now more than 15% because we see also the cosmetic industry being affected. The cosmetic industry is also a contributor, a part of the pigment business. So the pigment business in total is not 20% of the PLS division. And there are in pigments industrial, cosmetics, and automotive. So the 25% is a bit high.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And so the fixed costs must be very higher at pigments, otherwise they would...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is a quarterly view. You shouldn't look at these figures on a quarterly basis because the other operating expenses are, as I said, oscillating. That is also true for pigments.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to the inventories of Liquid Crystals, I think we have only slightly reduced inventories because although we had a Christmas break, but that was a very normal Christmas break and the breakdown of our sales was pretty significant, and then we had towards the end of March we had holidays' production. So, I don't think that the inventory level could be reduced that dramatically. Anyway, from our inventory levels, our inventories are always half a year and at the moment we haven't increased them. I think that is all we can expect until we have the true breaks behind us and then we will have the lower inventory levels. I think to expect a substantial cost -- cash flow contribution from the reduction of inventories isn't really the right angle. I would suggest that if we can keep working capital at the same level as we are now, working capital -- I mean inventories, not the receivables, of course -- the inventories at the same level then that's a good thing.</p>

          <p>Regarding Rebif, yes you are right, there are some competitive increased prices, roughly 10% in the first quarter. We have not done so far and I have no intention to guide you what we are doing with our prices.</p>
          <p>Regarding Obama, well I mean there are ten people, twelve opinions about it. I don't know, what he's going to do? Personally, if you want my personal view I think maybe that he will rebate in Medicare or Medicaid very fast and let this noninterference clause drop, which will be a short-term win. The other things take may be a little bit longer. He will rule by similar issues how to get approval &#x2013; then these are the two things, which I think will come. A wider healthcare reform will take more time, depends how fast he can do these two things to get us some thing.</p>

          <p>Yes good afternoon, Gianmarco Bonacina from Equita. Had a question on the Merck Serono division. Basically, if you were to reach your -- the low end of your guidance of 20% core EBIT margin instead of 25, what is the difference in terms of spending and are the -- basically, I suppose you're investing more? But on which product you are going to invest more to be at 20% rather than 25% apart from I suppose Erbitux and Cladribine? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will see the result after you have seen the numbers so it might get clear to you. But I have no intention to announce here. But if we do increase our spending, then it will be more in clinical trials department. And in this area, in our pipeline, and not in marketing as I already said that I basically we are convinced <mark type="inaudible" /> that our marketing expenditure will not grow faster than our top line.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to be sure what I understood, so you have plans to invest R&amp;D apart from Erbitux and Cladribine and this will lead basically margin go down from 25 to 20%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's the guidance from 20 to 25, you can pick any number which you want in your model and we will see if you're right at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think it is not a good way to proceed, that if we give a guidance from 20 to 25, you pick the 20. If we think 20 is more realistic then we would have given you 17.5 to 22.5.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll now take our next from Mr. Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question, actually two remaining for me. Firstly, in regarding Cladribine I wonder if you could remind me again of the patent situation and I believe you've filed for patents as well, if I recall that right.</p>
          <p>And second question on Rebif regarding the Q1 performance, very good in your terms. Could you elaborate a bit on how that splits up into the U.S. and rest of world and how price increases affects the U.S. performance, if that's possible to breakout that would be helpful? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regarding the Cladibrine patent, we will be comfortable that we have sufficient protection to launch after approval to this product on a worldwide basis.</p>
          <p>Regarding Rebif, yes I can. In the U.S; we had growth of a little bit more than 40% of which 8.5% has been price increases last year. In Europe, we had growth of 5%, which obviously is everything; volume because as you know, unfortunately in Europe, you cannot increase prices. These are the main <mark type="inaudible" /> Rebif, overall, remind you 18%.</p>
