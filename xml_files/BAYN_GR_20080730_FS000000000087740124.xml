          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2008 Results Conference Call of Bayer AG for investor analysts on the 30th of July, 2008. Throughout today's recorded presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alexander Rosar, Head of Investor Relations of Bayer AG. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joanna . Good afternoon everybody and welcome also on behalf of my colleagues to our call. During this call we will review our Q2 financial results that were released earlier this morning.</p>
          <p>With us on the call today are our CEO, Werner Wenning; our CFO, Klaus K&#xFC;hn; and the CEOs from our subgroups Arthur Higgins from HealthCare; Friedrich Berschauer of CropScience; and Patrick Thomas from MaterialScience.</p>
          <p>Before handing over to Mr. Wenning for his introduction, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statements, which governs our call. Thank you. Mr. Wenning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. In the second quarter the upward trend at Bayer continued unabated. We captured strong growth in our portfolio and in emerging markets. The performance of our CropScience business was outstanding, strong execution and the operational leverage, growth earnings and margins. Further strategic progress was made with the acquisition of the hematology portfolio of Maxygene and the closing of the Topsun and Sagmel acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we signed an agreement with Barr on the supply of Yasmin and YAZ in the US. Our key pipeline assets are ready to achieve major milestones. In the RECORD-4 trial we demonstrated superior efficacy of Xarelto over the US regimen of enoxaparin.</p>
          <p>The recommendation for approval of Xarelto by the CHMP marks another significant milestone. We received it only nine months after the submission. This morning we announced the filing of Xarelto for approval in VTE prevention in the US and provided the longer-term safety update.</p>
          <p>Based on the clinical evidence reported to date from over 22,000 patients of which more than 18,000 patients have been exposed to Xarelto, no safety issues attributable to Xarelto have been observed. This includes long-term exposure of approximately 10,000 patients treated with Xarelto for at least 3 months, some 4,500 of whom were treated with Xarelto for six to 12 months or longer.</p>
          <p>In CropScience, significant progress to enhance the product portfolio has been made. Sales of new products advanced by 50%. We now expect to achieve the 2 billion turnover target already next year.</p>
          <p>The strong performance in the first half of this year strengthened our optimism for 2008. We are raising the Group sales guidance and reconfirming our profitability targets despite increasing headwinds from currencies and from higher raw materials and energy costs.</p>
          <p>Now let's run through our Q2 numbers together. In the second quarter all our subgroups extended their business, lifting Group sales by almost 10% if adjusted for portfolio and currency effects.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBIT and EBITDA gained 5%, and core earnings per share 15%. Strong demand was the main reason for these improvements. Volumes were up more than 8%. Selling prices added 1.5% to the business expansion. Currency effects, on the other hand, significantly restrained our performance.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter negative currency effects diminished sales by &#x20AC;530 million. The greatest impact was on our HealthCare business where the euro figure was diminished by 250 million due to exchange rates. At CropScience the impact was 130 and at MaterialScience &#x20AC;150 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at the earnings impact, we see that Group underlying EBITDA was diminished by 190 million. Again, the impact in absolute terms was most pronounced in HealthCare followed by CropScience. For the remainder of the year our guidance is based on second quarter currency and rates. The full year impact is thus estimated at minus 1.6 to 1.7 billion on sales and approximately 600 million on underlying EBITDA.</p>
          <p>An additional 1% change of the euro against our currency basket would translate into minus 100 million on sales and minus 25 on underlying EBITDA. The 25 million underlying EBITDA impact relates largely half to cash relevant transaction effects and half to non-cash translation only. I hope that these numbers are helpful for your modeling.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a brief look at the developments in our subgroups. The changes I will be talking about here are adjusted for currency and portfolio effects unless I say otherwise.</p>
          <p>All our HealthCare divisions continued to grow in the second quarter, with Consumer Health posting an especially pleasing 8% increase. Pharmaceutical sales rose by 6% driven by the strong performance of key brands. Yasmin sales gained 32% thanks to the strong performance of the US YAZ and strong growth in Europe and Latin America.</p>
          <p>Mirena continued to make outstanding progress with sales up by 47%. Betaseron sales improved 14%, Levitra 12% and Nexavar sales were up by an impressive 90%. Nexavar has been recently approved for the treatment of liver cancer in China.</p>
          <p>Not unexpectedly Kogenate sales were weaker in the quarter. Sales were down 7% due to the phasing of <mark type="inaudible" /> treatment to CSL. The Kogenate brand, however, gained 10% in the quarter. As I already mentioned, our consumer business reported a very strong quarter with OTC up 9 and diabetes care up 10 and animal health up 6%.</p>
          <p>Underlying EBITDA of HealthCare was up almost 3% on higher sales and realized synergies. Currencies, some 30 million in smaller one-time effects and higher investments in marketing and sales were more than compensated.</p>
          <p>We significantly invested in marketing and sales to prepare for the launches of JAZ in Europe and Xarelto and to drive our sales in emerging markets in the quarter. All these investments are paying off. Year-to-date, sales in the so-called BRICMS countries -- in other words, Brazil, Russia, India, China, Mexico and South Korea  -- together advanced 24% to almost &#x20AC;900 million.</p>
          <p>After very strong start to the 2008 season, our CropScience business gained momentum in the second quarter. This was driven by the stellar performance of our Crop Protection business where we increased sales by 29%. We are particularly pleased about the trend in the sales of our new products, which climbed by 50% in euros. Our original target for these products was 2 billion in sales by 2011 but we expect to reach this level by next year already. That's two years earlier than planned. Crop Protection increased sales in all business units and regions. Our largest sales increase in percentage terms was achieved in Latin America where business was up by 63%. Sales in Brazil increased by 150%.</p>
          <p>Our North American business expanded considerably with sales rising by 26%. There was an especially sharp increase in the demand for our fungicides and our seeds-treatment products. Sales rose by 25% in Europe and by 21% in Asia Pacific. The Bio Science business also showed an encouraging improvement, with sales up 14%. Only Environmental Science experienced a drop in sales. EBITDA of the CropScience subgroup advanced by almost 27% to 501 million. This sharp rise in earnings was largely the result of higher volumes and price increases. Negative currency effects ran counter to this.</p>
          <p>Based on the strong performance seen so far as a positive development including the higher selling prices we expect in the second half, we are aiming to update our CropScience financial outlook. We are now targeting sales growth of well above 10% on a currency-adjusted basis and an underlying EBITDA margin of approximately 25%. With that we will achieve our 2009 margin target for CropScience one year earlier than originally planned.</p>
          <p>The underlying business trends in the MaterialScience subgroup remains broadly unchanged in the second quarter. Strong growth and stable earnings in the Systems business and some headwinds resulting in lower sales and margin pressure in the Materials business. Overall, sales were up 5% on higher volumes and prices. All Systems businesses posted strong growth lifting sales by 8%. Poyurethanes grew 9% boosted by a very strong TDI growth in all regions, probably also driven by some pre-buying ahead of price increases.</p>
          <p>Our coatings unit expanded business by 5% predominantly in Asia. Polycarbonates in price were generally lower, resulting in a 2% sale decline in the Materials segment. Underlying EBITDA of the subgroup was 372 million down 9% and slightly short of expectations. Higher raw material prices were offset by higher selling prices, strong volumes and sales from our restructuring program.</p>
          <p>However, energy cost increases of more than 20 million quarter-on-quarter were higher than expected and could not be completely compensated. But our assumptions for the remainder of the year for the MaterialScience subgroup anticipate increasing headwinds from raw materials and energy costs and economic developments. We expect that through higher prices, volume growth and additional savings we can compensate for the further increase in raw material cost. However, it will be difficult to offset the expected energy cost increase of 50 to 100 million in the second half.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have an aggressive and very successful strategy in place for growth in emerging markets. The acquisitions of Topsun and Sagmel will further strengthen our OTC business in this region. In the so-called BRIC countries we expanded our business by an impressive 32% to 1.1 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the pleasing business performance gross cash flow improved by 11%, and net cash flow by 9%. Free operating cash flow advanced 44% to 542 million. Net debt was higher in the quarter due to the typical second quarter cash outs, namely dividend payment, annual employee bonuses and interest coupons.</p>
          <p>We continue to target lower net debt by year-end compared to the end of 2007. As always this target is pre-any M&amp;A activity. The performance generated during the first half allows us to target higher organic sales growth for the Group and to reconfirm our profitability targets. We are now targeting organic growth of more than 5% higher underlying EBITDA and improved margins. We confirm our HealthCare outlook and are raising our CropScience outlook includes three -- we expect underlying EBITDA for MaterialScience to come in below the Q2 level.</p>
          <p>So much ladies and gentlemen to the quarter and our outlook, we will now be happy to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Paul Mann. Please state your company name, followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was Paul Mann from Morgan Stanley. I've got three questions if that's okay? The first question is on Kogenate, you said it was a little weak in the quarter. Is that a one-time effect or do we expect to see that weakness continuing further on? Then secondly on margin outlook in second half given that Yasmin is turning generic, what should we assume for the contribution margin of Yasmin. And are there any additional cost-savings you can make associated with the sales force in the women's health franchise? And finally on Rivaroxaban are we going to see a more detailed safety update at some point in the future? Is there any data you can share around the elevated level -- any elevated levels of bilirubin or ALT in the independent patient population you're talking about? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Arthur Higgins is going to answer your questions, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Paul. First of all, in terms of Kogenate we do see this is as a timing effect of shipments to our partner CSL. You'll recall we had a very strong first quarter. So this really is a timing &#x2013; also as Mr. Wenning mentioned we are very pleased with the underlying performance of our own brand, Kogenate, which grew 10% in the quarter. So, Paul we remain committed to our guidance for Kogenate of 8 to 10%. So, one-time effect. Yeah.</p>
          <p>On Yasmin, we really are not going to discuss margins but perhaps just to say that you should expect to see Yasmin be effected quite radically in the US but that's all included in our forecast for the year and whatever the effect &#x2013; I'm not going to guesstimate what that could be because whatever number I give you will come out to be the wrong number -- but the most important message this morning is with Yasmin in the US, we still remain comfortable in our full year forecast for pharmaceuticals.</p>
          <p>And, then, your final question on Rivaroxaban. First of all, I hope everybody had a chance to see the press release this morning in terms of our submission in the US. We obviously shared then data on patients exposed to the product. I believe, Paul that gives a very clear statement in respect to safety of the product. I don't think it's our intention to do any more interim analysis. I think we have clearly conveyed a very extensive amount of data. You have the number, over 4,500 patients treated for more than six to 12 months and some longer than 12 months. And then your final question regarding, ALTs I think, again an important message here without getting into the details as we have no cases of high blood loss and the issues around ALTs are very much consistent with an excellent safety profile for this product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just also on the cost savings, are there any cost savings you can maybe take out or make in association with Yasmin turning generic or should we wait to see maybe competition for YAZ in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are doing and again, I think the overall message today in HealthCare is we're very much in line with our guidance. We are very sensitive in terms of finding the right balance between supporting the growth that we need to drive in the emerging markets, supporting the launches of YAZ and Xarelto and we cover our expenses to find that right balance between a focus on growth but delivering on our commitments to underlying EBITDA margins in Pharma and they will continue to improve this year and next year. So I think the message is we do what we need to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks so much. Well done -- a good set of results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Thomas Gilbert. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, UBS in London. Good morning. I've got really three very small questions, housekeeping. Betaseron/Betaferon again just checking the lumpiness; where the -- did you do any major shipments into certain countries like, did you provide all of the Russian requirements in the first half already for example? Because again the growth rate was above the  corridor that you've indicated. If you could split the 13.6 then into price and volume, that will be very helpful. Secondly, could you quantify the integration costs for the various acquisitions in Consumer Health and how much that burdened underlying EBITDA in the subgroup in the quarter? And then finally on CropScience, I know one of your competitors has announced a fairly extensive capital expenditure expansion program. Do you think you can nurture the growth for 2009 and beyond with the existing asset base or have you also cut back too much on fixed assets in the previous years and now have to basically ramp up the plants again? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mr. Gilbert, Arthur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again we were, Thomas, very pleased with the performance of Betaseron in the quarter. You were right to identify we had an improvement in our business in Russia but we did not do anything extraordinary in terms of shipment. We expect to continue to see good business in Russia throughout the year.</p>
          <p>We are benefiting obviously from price increases that we took predominantly in the US. We took a 13% price increase in January and we saw the benefit of that in the second quarter. So price was a key contributor in the quarter to the overall performance obviously offset by currency impact. Your integration costs, those were part of, you may have noted Mr. Wenning's comment about, we had about 30 million of one-time costs we do not expect to recur; some of that was related to Consumer acquisitions, that was roughly below 10 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And CropScience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of production, after the acquisition of Aventis, we are implementing a significant re-structuring program, which is working according to our plans. We are seeing now, of course, a significantly increased demand. So far we were able to manage it rather well. In terms of further investments we plan investments in 2009 in the range of 245 million, which is round about 20 million more than this year. So there is investment, we already talked once about our investment in ph] tuplepeno phosphate capacity expansion and we are investing also in debottlenecking. So we are clearly seeing a further increased demand and I think we can manage it with our present programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Paul Major, please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Paul Major from Redburn Partners. Just one question in relation to CropScience. You've obviously had very strong volume growth on the fungicides product lines and I mean at least by my thinking some of that is weather related. So just thinking about how we forecast this business in 2009, do you think that 2008 is a solid base from which we should forecast further growth or would you expect volumes to drop back in '09 compared to what you've seen in '08? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very important question of course. So of course we have &#x2013; I think we have an excellent performance so far. The fundamentals are still positive, so demand side is still unchanged, very positive in terms of weather -- and I need to mention weather on each conference call -- weather so far, in a nutshell, was supportive, no doubt in the first half. And of course all our &#x2013; estimation that we have &#x2013; we are talking about 2009-10 is always based on this normal weather conditions. So but handling your question, what we assume, best guess, that the Crop Protection market also will grow in 2009 and of course by you will ask us, what &#x2013; which to which extent, we believe in the range of 3 to 5%. And we plan to grow above the market, that's our --  the present situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your 3 to 5 is that your estimate of volume or value growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's both &#x2013; it's volume as well as prices. We implemented price increases in the first half of this year, 2 to 3%. We  plan price increases for the second half also in the range of 2 to 3%, then when we are talking about 2009 it will be both volume as well as price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and you don't expect a contraction in fungicide volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, under normal weather conditions it's clear, but still on the demand side the fundamentals as discussed as are more or less unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from Sachin Jain, please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Sachin Jain from Merrill Lynch, thanks for my questions. Just a couple on Xarelto and a couple of housekeeping financials. Firstly, on Xarelto following the European decision wondered, Arthur, whether you might willing to comment on pricing at all and what you thought of Xarelto levinox. Second question related to that, obviously second quarter HealthCare margins were a little lower than the first quarter, one of the reasons you suggested is product investments ahead of launch and I guess one of those is Xarelto. So I just wondered if you could provide any color on the extent of the market invest you're willing to provide for the product relative to the market opportunities you see in the initial indication and how you frame your level of investment versus a longer term opportunity at the moment? And, then, just two housekeeping on the numbers. Whether you could provide the synergies achieved in the quarter incrementally within Pharma, and finally on the tax rate &#x2013; guidance unchanged at 32% suggest a big pick up in the second half of the year; just any color you could provide there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, let's start first with the tax rate question. Klaus K&#xFC;hn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we always provide two tax rate, one the reported tax rate and we keep that unchanged but we anticipate that it is at 32%.  And for the payment tax rate we have the guidance that you take our profit before tax, add on the Schering amortization, the D&amp;A effect for the year and based on that number we anticipate the payment -- a tax payment of roughly 30% for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Margin. I think again, same reply I tried to give to Paul. We are clearly investing in our growth assets -- Xarelto, Yasmin, emerging markets -- but we are taking the discipline to then look at our mature products and to really squeeze and make sure that we're moving our investment from low yield assets to high yield assets. So I don't think you can read into our marketing expense in the second quarter how we will deal with marketing for the full year. What's more important, again I want to come back to this message is that we are very comfortable with our guidance, which means we have to improve our margins and obviously that requires good control of selling and general admin expenses despite what we need to do ensure we adequately fund Xarelto. But especially for Xarelto very clear message is that we will pay whatever funds we need to ensure Xarelto fulfills its very very significant potential.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Richard Vosser from JPMorgan. Couple of extra questions on Xarelto, if I may. Could you confirm whether you have or will go through a priority review in the US, for Xarelto on the filing? And also whether you are &#x2013; if you could give the timelines for the data from the new chronic trials. I believe, we're looking at ATLAS possibly by the end of this year and then the ROCKET-AS trial possibly in '09. Could you give some clarity on those timelines as I see you're not going to give any further updates in the interim?</p>
          <p>And then a couple of questions on Nexavar, just seeing the approval in China, I was wondering, if you could comment on the level of pricing you could -- you will potentially achieve in China relative to the global price for Nexavar. And I wondered, if you could also split the current sales of Nexavar between HCC and renal cancer, and elaborate on the response you're getting from physicians to the -- to your marketing message in liver cancer? And then finally, a question on diabetes care, looking at the IMS data it appears that the market share of the Ascensia devices are starting to plateau. I was wondering if you could comment on that? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah. First of all, looking to status, the US submission, we will of course request priority review, but I can't tell you whether that will be successful or not. The question regarding updates on ACS, we will provide an update later, this year or early next year. But, we haven't provided no guidance as to when we will give diesels on ROCKET, which is a still fibrillation study, but we have indicated that we remain confident of a filing for that indication in 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Nexavar in China, we're very pleased with again getting approval in this important market. As you are aware the incidence of HCC is very significant in this market. The challenge will be how we can penetrate it. On pricing, as we've discussed in the past, the product is not reimbursed in China. It's potentially a private or private insurance-based. And we price it very much in line with our European average pricing so there is no significant discounting in China. We do, however, have a patient assistance program for those patients who cannot afford the product. So we've been be very disciplined in terms of global pricing with Nexavar and that includes our Asian markets.</p>
          <p>As to the split between HCC and renal, we're really not comfortable providing that, because our visibility in various markets is not all it should be. What is clear however is currently the bulk of the growth is coming from HCC. On diabetes care again the IMS data for this type of product is not always accurate. From our own assessment we continue to gain market share with our Ascensia  franchise.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, just a couple. I see that you took a one-time cost of 54 million for Trasylol. Are there any one-time costs likely to come for Yasmin now that we know the date when there will be generic entry? So I was just wondering if there are any adjustments that come from that? And I wonder if you could also talk a little bit more about your Chinese market exposure? I know that you've got one of the largest markets there, but perhaps you could take this opportunity to tell us at what sort of reach you have in China? I assume you've got reps in Beijing, I mean of the biggest cities. What sort of depth and reach do you have? Just give us a little bit more of a sense because I don't want to end up thinking that you could access all of the 300,000 potential liver cancer cases that you have there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jo. First of all, we expect more one-times related to Yasmin genericization in the US. As to the Chinese market, yeah, we are very proud of our performance there. The Chinese market is attracting everybody's attention so you'll hear everybody mention that they believe they're number one at the moment. According to IMS we are the number one pharmaceutical company in China, but obviously, this is a very dynamic market. But just to give you a sense, currency-adjusted our grow up in the first half of the year in China was close to 60%. We have significantly expanded our organization there. We mention that again in Mr. Wenning's comment about our investment in emerging markets such as China and Russia. And our field force now is in excess of 1,500 representatives and they are covering Tier 1 and Tier 2 and now entering into Tier 3 cities. So we have good coverage as you say, not access completely. But we are I think no other company who understands the Chinese market and are comfortable that we are doing what we need to do to ensure that Nexavar is properly introduced. Nexavar in China will probably mean that China will be our fourth largest market for Nexavar after the US, Germany, Spain. Okay?</p>

So what you're seeing in terms of order flow? And in back Dr. Berschauer, your comments on pricing, just wondered if you had any thoughts for 2009 season in terms of negotiating price increases?

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Outlook for the second half, so it will be -- that our -- what we believe will be inline with our guidance for the full year. This means that top line growth for the full year clearly above 10% and clean EBITDA margin approximately 25%. Latin America, we have seen an excellent performance in Brazil. We are still very optimistic in terms of Brazil for the rest of the year. Argentina, although mixed messages so far, it's okay. But it's a rather unstable political environment so let's wait and see. It's very difficult to really foresee what will happen there. But overall, we are optimistic in terms of the performance of our business in Latin America for the second half.</p>

          <p>Pricing, of course, price increases in Europe. It's very important because we set the tone more or less with <mark type="inaudible" /> in France. And we will implement price increases as discussed before. It's not &#x2013; before, in the range of  2%, 2 to 3% for the second half. And this of course, sets the overall  the tone for 2009. So overall, we are now fortunately in the situation that we can implement price increases and if you have a look on the numbers of our competitors, I think it's more or less in line.</p>

          <p>Hi, Markus Metzger Bank Vontobel. I have a follow-up on CropScience, looking at the strong business and the capacity expansion, I wonder whether you plan to revisit your restructuring program on the exceptionals in the second quarter have been lower than in the first quarter and I am actually missing the margin outlook beyond 2008? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we have as discussed before, we have our restructuring program and you can believe and please accept that of course, we are -- we considered our restructuring program in IOP, considering the overall booming market environment and strong demand. So we came to the conclusion, there was no need to change this restructuring program, as discussed before, we have some projects in terms of debottlenecking, people making to fulfill the requirement of the market. So we continue with our plans and I think we will manage this very professionally.</p>

          <p>In terms of respect to our guidance, margin guidance for 2009 and following years, we will continued to do what we so far have done at the beginning of next year, that means in March next year when we will publish our 2008 results. We will also give you the guidance for margins, for our expectations on margins in 2009.</p>

          <p>And I think one aspect of keen importance -- Mr. Wenning mentioned is -- performance of our new products.

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning Matthias Cornu calling from Exane BNP Paribas. I have a few question on MaterialScience. First of all, materials you were talking about price decrease in your introduction, Mr. Wenning. Did I understand correctly, the minus 2% is for the materials and -- but could you elaborate on this drop? I mean, is this related to an aggressive pricing policy of SABIC and in June I thought that you had announced price increase for polycarbonate. Have you been successful so far in implementing this increases in other words, do we expect maybe Q2 to be a bottom for this year, for this part of the MaterialScience. And on Systems, can you update us on market dynamics in MDI and TDI and how do you see supply demand going forward for the end of the year? And do you think that the upcoming capacities that you will put into the market over the next 12, 18 months would change this market balances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Patrick?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, first of all on the Material segment, which as you say, Science is dominated by the polycarbonate story. Certainly from quarter one to quarter two sequentially this year, we saw an adverse pricing effect, which was actually offset slightly by volume. So the overall reduction performance in polycarbonate segment materials was driven by raw material costs on a sequential quarterly basis. If we then say what's going on in the market, the polycarbonate market is still growing at a lower level than last year. But that's still 6 to 7%, we expect that growth rates decline slightly to probably 5 to 6% towards the end of the decade primarily driven by the optical discs storage market. We believe that market has now peaked and further development in the market will depend upon the penetration of Blu-ray or blue laser format disks.</p>
          <p>As you said, there's been a little bit of shake up in the industry with the entry or the change in ownership of GE Plastics and Dow's businesses. There's also been some dynamic competitive change in Asia, Hunan and Chael and Korea have come onstream. And Asia is really the backhaul ground and the price setter for the global prices in polycarbonate. Crudely, you can take the Asian price plus freight plus duty and apply that to the global market.</p>
          <p>So there have been a number of positive signals on polycarbonate in terms of postponed projects. Mitsubishi Chemical and Kawasaki have decided to postpone their project from public announcements and Mitsubishi Gas Chemical in the Shanghai development <mark type="inaudible" /> also seem to have delayed their project, it hasn't been approved. And the number of the projects that were slated are being delayed. Mitsubishi Chemical and the Sinopec joint venture in Northern China appears to currently be under delay and Kazan Orgsintez in Russia seems to also be under some sort of delay. And what we can see the SABIC unit or should I say the SABIC joint venture, Saudi Kayan in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia also seems to be delayed now as they're reviewing which technology to use for that particular process. So there's been a number of delays to new capacity in polycarbonate and a number of investments postponed.</p>
          <p>As you said most producers, certainly Dow, Bayer and SABIC, have announced price increases typically around about $0.25 a lb for June, July to offset the very high raw material costs and only time will tell how much of that will pick up. It's very, very difficult to judge so despite all the pushing, I think, it will be next quarter where we will see whether those prices are being accepted. Certainly in some industry segments we are seeing those prices being affected. So the overall supply/demand balance is not as good as we would like to see it, but the growth rate is still sufficiently high. It will allow that to balance out over the next year.</p>
          <p>I think we then switch to what's going on dynamically in MDI, TDI and polyether &#x2013; polyurethane zone. On MDI we are still seeing strong growth rates. In Europe that's primarily driven by the very high energy prices which give very high demand for insulation. In North America there's been a ban or proposed ban on formaldehyde resin for use in the wood industry. That means that MDI is then used for wood lamination adhesion and for wood binding in the particleboard or in place of strand board in chipboard industries, which increases the volume demand even in North America and in Asia although most of the plants are running well, there is also strong growth. So we haven't seen as much price pressures as we might have expected given the new capacities that have been onstream for most of the year to-date. As you said, we are adding to that supply/demand balance with our new unit towards the end of this year, but to be honest we were already pre-marketing significant quantities of material. And we because of the design of the unit we're able to balance supply/demand perfectly as we introduce that new asset.</p>
          <p>So MDI -- I'm not too concerned about. The growth rate is still strong up around about 7 to 8%. And that equates to consuming our entire new capacity in China in just over one year. And as we don't see major other expansions over the following years and that should underpin our ability in MDI to maintain prices and also to match the raw material increases.</p>
          <p>TDI, a very balanced market in Europe, strong growth in Eastern Europe. In America the market is lower, mixed signals, IKEA are actually saying that furniture sales are increasing as people are not moving out, which is always a positive benefit for TDI. But prices are okay because of the availability is still being tight in the US. In Asia very strong and pre-buying ahead of the Olympics, as TDI will not be allowed to be transported during the period of the Olympics. So we saw a very strong June sales for TDI, surprising why it's still in fairly high territory and staying there. On the polyethers, very stable demand and price increases in Europe around about &#x20AC;0.15 a kilo. In that weaker demand with very high propylene pricing makes the market more difficult. In Asia, very high demand, prices are very high driven by high propylene prices. So that's a overview of the polyurethane business. In coatings, there's generally there's been some softening in the US on back of automotive and construction, but otherwise very, very strong growth in Asia.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much. If I can just follow-up very quickly on your guidance for Q3 when you said that expected DBA to be below Q2 level, is that valid for both of the sub division Materials and Systems?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's fair to say that the difficulty we're suffering with raw materials is the difficulty to pass on those costs in the Materials segment. So the majority of the difference in our guidance is around Materials as you suggest. In Systems, we pretty much managed to pass on the full raw material and energy costs. It's much, much more difficult in a market, which has oversupply like polycarbonate.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Jean De Watteville Lehman Brothers. Three questions, two on CropScience and one in MaterialScience. In CropScience, again, Syngenta talked about very optimistic sales forecast for their leading strobilurine, and their decontinoids(5320), talking about sales multiplied by 3 in the next five years compared to 2007. I just curious to know, do you share this forecast, I mean, we know you are major competitors with Syngenta in these two chemical class, do you agree with this forecast, you think it's valid for you? And if that is so, following up on Thomas question at the beginning of the Q&amp;A, do you believe your current capacity would allow you to match such a significant growth?</p>
          <p>The second question is on seed treatment, we've seen the agreement between Syngenta and DuPont. DuPont still has a big market share in seeds in the US. I'm curious to know how big is the business you already do with them, and if that agreement means that we should be cautions about your market share in seed treatment in the United States. We know you're a market leader and I would be curious to see the impact? The last question is on polycarbonate; obviously, we are -- have seen pretty poor results in this quarter, pricing is poor, as you've said. I'm just curious at what level of pricing will you take action on your capacity? When will you close your high cost plants in order to improve supply-demand balance in the market and reduce your fixed cost? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The CropScience, the market development, the demand side is on -- to make it rather simple. So we have -- of course our significantly improved demand because commodity prices are very high, they are up. And we expect that commodity price in the year to come will remain on a high level. Why is the volume up? Very simple, the farmers are using crop protection products because it's a good investment and of course they see a yield increase. So I believe from logical point of view, that already is here in this overall positive market environment the use rate of petrochemicals is more or less already on very high level, so we follow this logic to believe that the volumes would whatever, go through the roof in years to come is, at least, not my opinion.</p>
          <p>So, overall we are seeing a positive market environment and I will not further comment what our competitors are announcing. So we have our plans. We expect further volume increase and our &#x2013; we plan our capacities and production according to our plans. And I am very confident that we do it right because in IOP we have an excellent management in place with Tokoben and his people.</p>
          <p>Answering your question on seed treatment it's of course a very important business for us. We are very successful, we have our customers, of course, DuPont is one of our key customers.

          <p>Okay. Polycarbonate and capacity utilization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Jean, good question in polycarbonate, of course it's not just about prices, it's about margin. and as I said earlier, quarter-to-quarter we actually offset oil pricing with volume, interestingly enough, and the margin is the important thing which is driven by raw materials. So clearly with unsatisfactory margins we have already been managing our assets quite tightly and idling some of the assets on some of the manufacturing sites globally. So we've been optimizing logistics, using the assets as best we can to supply local markets, and now we have our line operating in China of course; that gives us much less exposure to currency with material having to be exported into the region.</p>
          <p>Just to say something about China, we have the first line up and running and have that running for some time. We're completing line two at the moment which we will probably start up early next year now, slightly later than originally forecast. And we've also introduced some flexibility into the operations of these lines so that we can operate both the lines together around about 50 to 60% capacity rate, and that gives us benefit in flexibility to the market but also efficiencies in product manufacturing, because it involves less turnarounds and changeovers. When line two in China is operational we will use both the lines at the same time and then closely follow the market dynamics.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the point I made earlier about delayed investments are probably the most important changes, because I think I can't really comment on what other assets may be consolidated. Without doubt, with the size of the assets we are operating in China and in Thailand at over 200,000-ton units, there are a large number of units in the world with the current pricing schedule of raw materials and market prices margins, those are going to be very uncompetitive.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Michi Ana calling from ECM in London. I just have a question about your outlook statement for the year-end and net debt. Assuming that you're hoping to have the net debt below year-end to last year which is 12.2 so that implies you need to decrease a bit over a billion. And considering that you do have probably I don't know I mean remaining CapEx for the second half of the year 700, 750 and you have net interest payments 350. So if you adopt that implies that you need to have net operating cash flow probably north of 2 billion, is that the correct calculation or am I missing something, or you're expecting some seasonal swing in the second half of the year for the working capital, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. K&#xFC;hn is going to answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I see you already did you do your calculations, but there is again some input about the guidance you mentioned the financial the interest is as we expect as financial result for the full year will be in the area of minus &#x20AC;1.45 billion and with regards to CapEx unchanged, we think that the CapEx related to property, plant and equipment will be in the region of &#x20AC;1.7 billion and with regard to working capital, we think that roughly, we will improve that on a normal seasonal pattern over the year and so that over and all in performance there, we will see a slight improvement so that the overall working capital will be roughly, let's say in line, with inventories, receivables and payables as they will stay at a similar level as at the beginning of the year. And this all comes, if you calculate that to our statement that we will be able to reduce our net debt below 12 billion, the uncertainty might be, as we always mention, M&amp;A activity which cannot be planned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay just looking at your bond maturity profile. I know there's still some time ahead. But you don't really have much to repay this year, but you have fairly large bond maturing in the first half next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We have overall maturities next year of roughly &#x20AC;2 billion. But we think that usually, we anticipate that again, excluding M&amp;A activity that we should be able to pay the repayments from our operating cash inflows normally.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Florent Cespedes from Exane BNP Paribas. Two quick questions on the healthcare side, please. First of all, on Xarelto, do you confirm that you won't make any long term safety update before, let's say second half of next year and if you prefer to assume that next year we will have the Phase III data of the <mark type="inaudible" /> trial before the ROCKET ones. Secondly, on the Diagnostic Imaging, can you give us your view on this business going forward and as &#x2013; let's see where did I put my my Q2 numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, but I couldn't quite hear that second part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but the second part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the Diagnostic Imaging, is it possible to have your view on this business going forward following the relatively mixed Q2 numbers, especially excluding the MedRad performance. And the last point, some of your competitors are writing that on the OTC area, they're observing some switch from branded product to unbranded drugs. Is it the same thing for you, and is it something that maybe you anticipate going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Arthur Higgins is going to answer your HealthCare related question followed with Xarelto update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again if I could -- excuse for repeating myself. I think today, we -- our submission for the US gave a very clear update on safety with Xarelto again I remind people of the numbers 7,000 patients treated for at least three months. 4,500 treated for between six and somewhat longer than 12 months, with no safety issues identified. So we do not feel that we need to provide any further update, clearly with new studies completing then we may provide other information. But, I think we have to really step back and say that if you consider the amount of data we have, we have great comfort in the safety profile of Xarelto.</p>
          <p>In terms of Diagnostic Imaging, we are a market leader in this segment. We remain committed to the business. We've seen some softening in the magnetic resonance market in the US. But we've seen good recovery with Ultravist, so overall, we are comfortable with this business and we remain committed to it.</p>
          <p>Your question on the OTC market, again, we delivered very pleasing performance in our consumer care business almost 10% growth in CC. The comment that you have made regarding own label -- clearly, we have seen particularly in the US where this market is most developed a switch from branded products to own label. Fortunately, I think our branch has performed reasonably well. But this is something we are monitoring. It's only natural when consumers are feeling under pressure that they may look to own label brands, but at the moment as you saw in our second quarter results, we are not seeing any direct effect, we will continue to monitor this. But the trend is clear. That the major retailers, Walgreen, Wal-Mart, CDS are clearly putting significant effort behind their own label brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. May I come back on the timelines for the Phase III Xarelto, <mark type="inaudible" /> and the ROCKET I was asking if....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Again, all we will say is we remain confident in our submission timelines of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll see. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Benson. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Citigroup. Most of my questions have been answered. I didn't -- sorry Klaus, I couldn't hear you on the cash flow and the net debt. I just wondered if you could clarify that in terms of net debt reduction, that the financial charges working capital and so on, an so sorry couldn't hear that. On Magnevist and Gadovist can you just explain what's going on there because all we can see is a sharp decline of Magnevist and there's I don't believe there is any split out date on Gadovist, and can you give us a peak sales on Mirena. And lastly can you just give us an update on what you're going to do about the declines within the Environmental Science part of CropScience. And the last point, Brazil sales are up 150% I mean that's a staggering achievement and no doubt there will be lots more stuff grown in Brazil but is there a significant stock effect I mean that sort of growth is quite extraordinary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Andrew, again from the financial guidance. I repeated financial result for the full year expect at roughly at &#x20AC;1.05 billion. We expect to have CapEx and property, plant and equipment the magnitude are probably &#x20AC;1.7 billion. Working capital, we think is roughly unchanged plus some minor plus the negative impact some minor negative impacts in the other working capital most probably and so that means that excluding M&amp;A, which could always change the picture we should be below &#x20AC;12 billion at the end of the year in our total net debt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then Arthur on the Magnevist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andrew, as you're aware we are in the process of converting Magnevist to Gadovist. Gadovist is our next generation high flexibility MR contrast agent. It can be administered in smaller volumes, which is important, this leads to higher quality images, which is obviously greatly appreciated by our customers.</p>
          <p>If you look at the combined Magnevist- Gadovist the picture is that we were only slightly down in the quarter about, currency-adjusted actually flat 0.1%. As I mentioned in the US, the magnetic resonance space Magnevist and Gadovist would compete has been affected by something called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, which has been a sort of issue surrounding these agents. Magnevist is seen to be and Gadovist is seen to be less prone to that. So, we are actually gaining share -- significant share in the US market but the overall market is down because people are using less MR. So, I think that summarizes the situation so net-net we are pleased with the conversion from Magnevist to Gadovist.</p>
          <p>And on Mirena, I think, how can we say I think we are demonstrating again, some of the strengths we're bringing to the new combined BSP, we saw an asset in Mirena that was being underdeveloped. We began direct-to-consumer advertising in the US. We have increased our promotion outside of the US, and you saw in the quarter, 47% currency-adjusted growth revenues of 180 million, sorry, &#x20AC;180 million. So as for how high it can be, let's keep watching, but clearly, it's going to be a very significant asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, now, Andrew, going to Environmental Science in Brazil....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you've talked about 150% in Brazil, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, first of all comment on Environmental Science. This is <mark type="inaudible" /> our performance in Environmental Science clearly is disappointing. I believe after the first quarter that we could recover for 2008, the second half now a second quarter, I think, it's highly obviously we will not recover. So we will have not a good deal in Environmental Sciences this year. What are we doing? We have really a fighting spirit in the organization, they try to do everything -- but again, the market environment really is not positive. We had here for this business not favorable weather conditions. And the major hit we have in the United States, the consumer market is not in a good shape and what we are doing now is really to adapt our cost structure to this overall situation and we hope that after this disappointing 2008 that we can show further progress in the years to come. Comment on Brazil so....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And was stocking related.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, because we see the consumer spending this is very low. So the big boxes are as a key to very, very low stocks there is of course a significant impact so overall again it's all the arguments why we have a very disappointing year this year. Your question in terms of Brazil crop protections all the second quarter in Brazil was outstanding. We doubled, more than doubled our business in Brazil. There's also some phasing, some pre-order so let's wait and see how the final result will look like, but I just can repeat myself, we are for 2008 also for 2009 very optimistic in terms of our business performance in Brazil. And it looks like at least according to our numbers that we gained market share in Brazil.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Andreas Heine. Please state your company name followed by your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andreas Heine from UniCredit. Two questions if I may? The first once again on Crop Protection and pricing. Can you elaborate a little bit whether these differences in the pricing dynamics between the segments, between fungicide, insecticides and herbicides. And secondly as far as I understand the price increases are basically, try to put through at the beginning of the season then it is more difficult to change it within the season. As you have now seen only one season there is a tremendous growth and the second season is approaching in Latin America and next year, then in the Northern Hemisphere. Is it fair to assume that the pricing dynamics would increase that is at least what Syngenta is saying so that the price momentum might increase from 2008 to 2009 for these reasons? And the second question on MaterialScience, could you remind me a little bit how the economics are in the value chain of propylene oxide? As far as I know you have a participation in joint-venture with Lyondell but at the same time you buy propylene oxide. So is buyer involved on a net base, positively or negative if the propylene oxide margins are going down? And how do you see these propylene oxide margins progressing in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Answering your question in terms of CropScience pricing in the different segments, well, it's not a major difference. I see, clear, let's say, the difference in terms of regions. So we clearly have been in a position to increase, implement price increases in Latin America for example in Brazil. Over the full portfolio we are now also in a position to increase prices in Europe although a good environment still rather difficult in the United States, still rather difficult for example in Japan. So it's much more depending on the region other than depending on the various segments.</p>
          <p>And your comment on in terms of price increases this year and the next year, of course, we are shooting for higher price increases. You can assume this and that's very clear. And so we have been, I would say have been successful and we are optimistic that we can implement further price increases. And now again let's wait and see what the final result will be but overall because the market environment is positive we are optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, MaterialScience economics on polyether.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Andreas your question on polyether is interesting. I mean it's a big part of our business. Overall, polyether volumes are up year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter and prices are positive year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. So the problem is the propylene price, and the margin squeeze that occurs in that chain. At the moment it depends upon which region of the world we're talking about and clearly in Europe and America that propylene price is squeezed margins for us on propylene oxide. In Asia, where we do not have physical assets and we're much more in the open market in fact we're able to pass on those prices. Of course, we sell very little propylene oxide, we sell very small quantities, we're actually selling polyethers and other types of polyols. So the margin squeeze occurs at the point where we sell a system to a customer. So, high propylene price in Asia has been pretty much compensated for and in the rest of the world quite difficult at the moment. As propylene prices drop of course there will be resilience in the price in the polyol market and that's when the margins expand again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you elaborate a little bit how do, are you backward integrated into propylene oxide? Is it that you are fully backward integrated into the production of propylene oxide in Europe and North America and only not in Asia whereas do you only participate due to the share you have in the joint venture with Lyondell?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Majority of our propylene oxide is producer economics. We have some independent supply in Europe. And we tend to purchase and not manufacture propylene oxide in Asia. So in fact because there is so many highly competitive small polyol producers in Asia, it makes sense to not even to be involved in that chain.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Christian Faitz from Oppenheim. Most of my questions have been answered, but a few on MaterialScience, please. First of all, could you comment on the sequential month-on-month performance in Q2 in MaterialScience, maybe divided in the two divisions? Because we have seen quite a few quarter reports so far, where all of the sudden June was rather weak for your important customer industries. It would be interested to know what's going on on your side. And then, do you see any impact -- and you mentioned the Olympics already, do you see any impact in Q3 on either your customer or supplier levels in MaterialScience because of the Olympics that would be helpful to know. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Christian. Month-on-month guidance is always very difficult because of incidence of shipping and other things. We tend to try and aggregate the quarter. There is no doubt there has been some fluctuation, which resulted in a fairly strong June. And the reason June was strong, probably two reasons. One was there were a lot of price increases posted for the 1st of July. So there was certainly a large element of pre-purchasing at the end of June. And that's probably the most significant factor in quarter two. For quarter three, the Olympic impact is really one that relates to a very narrow range of products. Probably, the biggest effect in China was pre-buying ahead of the price increases and the Olympics was a secondary effect. The Olympics primarily affects chemicals that are classified in a certain group, which include TDI. And during the Olympics, TDI will not be allowed to be shipped anywhere throughout China because of potential hazards and concern about incidents on road traffic accidents, as most of the distribution is by road tanker. To be honest, the actual movement is less than 20,000 tons of TDI between the quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what do you see any effect on pre-closures of your chemical products specifically NDI and TDI in China? Would that affect your production during Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No. Most of the production is in-bound by shipping and not a problem or directly connected by pipeline.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Neil Tyler. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. JPMorgan. Just one last please. For Arthur, just following up from one of your earlier comments you made with relation to the full year HealthCare margin target. You mentioned that -- the intention was still very much that you saw a need to improve margins further. Is that comment relative to the Q2 performance or the first half performance in terms of the HealthCare margin that you see that having to improve beyond the level that you have reached thus far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil, again I think what I was talking about was our commitment over the short medium term to look to improve our HealthCare margins and in particular margins in Bayer Schering Pharma. So, it wasn't related to performance in the quarter. Again if you look at performance in the half-year, we're very much in line with our guidance and I think the overall message here was that we'll remain very disciplined in respect to selling and general admin expenses. So if they go up in a quarter. I guess what I was trying to convey was do not multiply that by four because that's not the way we look at our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine. Thank you very much. Very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Ronald K&#xF6;hler. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. It's Ronald K&#xF6;hler from MainFirst. My first question is on woman health and once again Yasmin. Obviously, you issued with the Barr announcement the new guidance regarding woman healthcare growth of high figure digit if I remember right? I've seen in the first week IMS data for Yasmin in the United States after the Barr launch and it seems to be down by around 50%. Meaning obviously, your franchise is getting some problems there? Is it still in the area of your budgeted expectations here to achieve your woman healthcare growth target and can you a little bit elaborate on how you can make that target if we would see such a kind of hit in Yasmin? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is regarding polycarbonate; I was astonished to hear that you will ramp up your second line in China beginning of the year. I would have assumed that you would have delayed further actually now you go for that. Can you a little bit tell us about your current utilization rate, is it really necessary or is it so low cost that you believe it's best even to go in this market with this additional capacity despite the pricing pressures? So what's behind your thinking here to bring that capacity in that rather depressed market?</p>
          <p>And my third question is a financial question to pension, obviously, you have a lot of off-balance sheet pension funded pensions and the market is sharply down, can you give us any insight about a potential pension gap, is there any risk from your side, with this market movement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, let's start with sales in Yasmin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, let me make it again, clear that we have fully considered the impact of Yasmin in the US when we gave our guidance. We remain very committed and confident in the performance of our women's health franchise. And the reason we feel so positive is obviously, we are seeing even stronger performance of YAZ, YAZ is up 131% year-to-date. I mentioned the performance of Mirena. Mirena is in fact a larger product in the US rather than Yasmin was in this quarter. So we readily offset a lot of the Yasmin impact in the US specifically, because really again, and I remind people here. The exposure on our women's health franchise is with Yasmin in the US. We don't have that issue, outside of the US. And we offset the majority of that exposure by the significant improvement in the performance of Mirena. So, net-net, the women's health franchise is actually in very good shape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And polycarbonate utilization rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the point you make about the units in China is, of course, an important one. And it's one we thought about a great deal. The unit in China is not two separate plants, it's actually one plant with two lines inside it. And therefore, the differential fixed costs associated with running the second line are very low. That allows us to increase our flexibility in terms of manufacturing grades of polycarbonate, which is very important and it means we get less waste and less out-of-spec material, which lowers our working capital. So from a cash perspective, that's very effective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you say your current utilization rate or give any kind of indication for polycarbonate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Globally, the utilization rate is in the low 80% region; that's changing because the growth rate overall in the market is still at the 6 to 7% level. So, I don't see a real problem in the growth rate in the polycarbonate market, perhaps in the optical disc area but we're in &#x2013; in Bayer we're operating the units around about 8%, slightly above.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But additional 100,000 capacity this means you would have been on today's basis around low 70s then, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we do is we balance units all over the world, depending upon the different grades and materials that are being made. So in some units we might be running in the 50% and in some we might be running them flat out because there is particularly high margin segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your last question I think was related to pensions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we don't have any, let's say, off-balance issue schemes. We have a portion of our pension liability is unfunded according to the -- to the German liabilities. Overall our, let's say gross liabilities have decreased -- liabilities have decreased due to the increase in capital market yields on a run back, basis, this year by 1.6 billion, so from 15 billion to 13.4 billion and our assets have decreased for the same reason but some of the equity in performances by roughly 0.5 billion. So overall our net pension liabilities for the first six months have decreased by 1.1 billion. What could happen is -- the only thing which could happen is that there maybe in some, lets say out of funded schemes that we might fund them additionally with some cash input, but that would be let's say no clear and relevant effect and only if which from let's say reducing the pension liabilities and increasing some financial liabilities, but that would be the only, let's say, possible effect here.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Irene Banani. Please state your company name followed by your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Irene Banani from Exane BNP Paribas. First question on well -- two questions on BCN, the first one is, are you seeing with the astonishing growth in fungicide, creation of new markets such as fungicide for rice and wheat and how are you seeing the corn fungicide market evolving? I know some competitive consultants have recently upgraded their outlook for the market from something like 300 to over 500 market peak sales. And do you believe this would justify for higher growth in 2008?</p>
          <p>Second question, can we have a feel on pricing in insecticides compared to the Group and do you confirm it it is positive in, so it's in positive territory? And the second -- sorry, the third question is on your volume growth assumptions for 2009 for the market in Crop Protection, between zero and 3% considering 2 to 3% is pricing. Could you maybe explain how you link that to a potential rebound in corn acreages in the USA to potentially more land in the EU with sound commodity prices and increased usage rate, and soybean prices boding well for the market -- I am just wondering here, if I am missing something and what are your underlying assumptions for the zero to 3% volume growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So answering your question, corn fungicide, fungicides in similar terms, its excellent performance although with our business and also having a look at our major competitors. In terms of what we are expecting for the years to come, next few years to come, I just need to repeat my comments I made before because the application of fungicides and other products, herbicides but mainly fungicides based on the excellent price level of commodity prices, this application is very, very high. In following this logic again, I don't believe that there will be a, let's say, that we would enter into a new dimension. I am expecting for the growth no doubt and finally -- a little bit careful I clearly stated that this year we had overall a very positive weather conditions supporting our business. And you can't expect that every year we would have overall such a positive, say weather conditions supporting our business. So again, it depends also on the overall weather situation in next years. But in general terms, it's absolutely correct. We are seeing now, for example, the use of fungicides in crops where fungicides have not been used in the past, because it's not economically justified, again, it's a good investment. That's the main reason why we are positive, but again, I don't believe that volumes would go in a totally different dimension.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing of insecticides, having a look on our portfolio, as you know imidacloprid is our most important insecticide. It's off-patent now and of course, we have generic pressure and that we have been able to keep our top line on the level -- similar level like in 2010. I think it's quite an achievement, so having a look in our insecticide portfolio, we have a price decline in imidacloprid  compensated by high prices or price increases with some other insecticides, is the overall situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The final question comes from Andrew Scott of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a very quick follow-up, question for Patrick, the 100 million increase in energy and raw materials for Q2, I think I missed your comments on the second half guidance or maybe the third quarter, I wondered, if you could just clarify? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah. This is the overall picture on raw materials for the full year and probably the most useful. I think if we look at additional raw material and energy costs together for full year 2008, we're up positive or negative depending on which way you look at it, 450 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>450?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>450, yeah, relative to 2007. Most of that due to propylene oxide energy and benzene is slightly less affected, which is unusual. We expect to compensate most of that cost increase comparing it to our previous guidance. So I think when the dollar -- $80 oil was around of 250 million, we will compensate most of the 450 with higher prices, higher volumes and our savings programs. But this is going to be tough is to close the final gap on the 50 to 100 million of energy cost, which we hadn't really factored in when we did our initial forecasting at $80 oil. We're assuming at the moment for the second half an average oil price at around about $130.</p>
