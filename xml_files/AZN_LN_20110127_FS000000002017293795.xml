      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry for the slight delay. There were a few other people coming in and so we thought we'd give them just a couple more minutes. I'd like to welcome all of you and say good afternoon to those of you that are with us here in London. And I'd also like to thank the people that are joining us on the Webcast for our full year results conference today.</p>
          <p>I'm going to start a review of what I consider to be the key events of the past year. Take a look at the headline results for the full year 2010. And I'll give some highlights on the revenues on both a regional and a brand basis. Martin MacKay who's here will then follow with his review of the year from an R&amp;D perspective and give you a pipeline update.</p>
          <p>And then finally Simon will do a quick review of the fourth quarter results, but focus more on a review of the P&amp;L for the full year. He'll also go through the midterm planning assumptions that we provided at this time last year to give you a sense of how we updated them, and then he'll conclude with our 2011 guidance, and then we'll open up questions for from both here on the floor as well as from on the conference.</p>
          <p>We've got members from our executive team here as well from global &#x2013; the commercial organization, from R&amp;D and from the legal area. So we'll probably have some other people participate in Q&amp;A as well.</p>
          <p>Now at last year's presentation, we affirmed our commitment to the business model that at its core is driven by investment in innovative, prescription-based biopharmaceutical research and development combined with world-class supply capability and of course commercial excellence on a global basis. There are other business models, but our view is that if shareholders want to diversify their portfolio, they don't need us to do that for them. So we are going to focus on what we believe we do best, where we have the requisite skills to succeed, and where we believe we can deliver real value for patients and for shareholders.</p>
          <p>In the end it comes down to execution, and against the four pillars of our strategy that you see here, we continue to make good progress. On growing the business despite the generic competition, we've generated strong growth in key brands such as Crestor, Seroquel XR and Seroquel Symbicort, and we're driving double digit revenue growth in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>On the business reshaping, the first phase of our restructuring program has delivered $2.4 billion in annual benefits, and we're now well into Phase 2, and there's another $1.9 billion to go for over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>And on the pipeline, although there were some disappointments this year, we're tackling the issue of R&amp;D productivity head-on with energy and with conviction, and we're doing it all within a culture that stresses innovation, that stresses accountability and integrity. So overall I would say good progress on those fronts.</p>
          <p>In my view, here are some of the key developments from last year. I certainly believe that the company turned in a very resilient performance, given the market challenges that we faced in 2010. We were able to hold revenue flat with 2009 on a constant currency basis despite having to absorb $1.6 billion revenue hit in the U.S. from generic competition on several of our products, combined with the absence of the H1 pandemic flu vaccine revenues that we had in 2009, like the rest of the industry. We also had to navigate through U.S. healthcare reform and European government pricing intervention. So I think a number of moving parts there, but pretty good performance when you look at it year on year.</p>
          <p>I think we were able to accomplish this by the result by driving good growth in our ex-U.S. markets, which were up 7% and that includes a strong 16% growth in our emerging markets business which grew to over $5 billion in revenue and we're well on our track, on track towards our 2014 goal of doubling this business from last year. And to note, China became an over $1 billion revenue market for us last year as well. So good growth there.</p>
          <p>Two key brands also achieved $5 billion milestones, Crestor and the Seroquel franchise, fueled by a strong performance for Seroquel XR which in its own right grew to over $1 billion.</p>
          <p>2010 was a year where our commitment to driving shareholder returns was visibly evident. We increased the dividend by 11% to $2.55 for the full year in keeping with our progressive policy to maintain or grow the annual dividend each year. We were also slightly ahead of our net share repurchase target for the year executing a $2.1 billion net share buyback in 2010, and Simon will have more to say about this during the financial review.</p>
          <p>The year was also marked by some significant developments on the legal front. We won an important affirmation of the strength of our intellectual property with the U.S. Court decision upholding our patent for Crestor in the United States. Secondly, we've reached agreements in principle to settle nearly 25,000 claimants in respect to product liability litigation for Seroquel.</p>
          <p>On the research and development front some good progress was made, tempered by some disappointing news on some of our pipeline projects. The entire R&amp;D organization has embraced the comprehensive change program we set in motion last year with energy and with commitment; led by a group of strong leaders, and that headed of course now by Martin who's the president of our R&amp;D organization.</p>
          <p>The highlight of the year I think was the first regulatory approvals for Brilinta, or Brilique as it's known in Europe, where we received approval in December. As you all know, in December we also received the Complete Response Letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And I'm very proud of the way Martin's organization marshaled its efforts to provide our response to that Complete Response Letter just last week. I think it was a real achievement and a quick turn-around to respond to the questions we were asked.</p>
          <p>While Brilique was the highlight, it was not the only approval we received last year. We also had approvals for Vimovo in the United States and Europe, Kombiglyze XR in the United States and some important lifecycle management indications for both Crestor and for Seroquel XR. So some good news.</p>
          <p>Together with Bristol-Myers Squibb we submitted regulatory files in the U.S. and in Europe before the end of the year for Dapagliflozin. It's potentially a first-in-class new medicine for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>As for the disappointments, as you know we stopped further development of Motavizumab for RSV prophylaxis, and we stopped developing Certriad for mixed dyslipidemia. We had some disappointing results for Recentin in the colorectal cancer and glioblastoma trials. The first of the Phase 3 trial results for Zibotentan also missed their primary end point, although work continues in other areas of the prostate cancer spectrum.</p>
          <p>So with that as a backdrop, let me now turn to the headline results for the full year, and when I refer to growth rates they'll be on a constant currency basis. Excuse me. Revenue for the year was unchanged compared with 2009 at $33.3 billion. As I mentioned at the opening, we overcame some revenue headwinds in the U.S. with very good performance in our rest-of-world markets.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit was $13.6 billion. That was also unchanged from the prior year. Core earnings per share were $6.71. That was slightly ahead of our latest guidance and up 5% for the full-year on a lower tax rate and lower net finance expense combined with the impact of fewer shares outstanding as a result of the buybacks. In bridging from core to reported earnings, adjusting items in aggregate were broadly similar year-on-year. But there were some large swings on some individual items.</p>
          <p>Restructuring costs and intangible impairments, for example, were nearly two times the 2009 level. These were largely offset though by the $0.40 gain this year that arose from changes made to the benefits under certain of our groups' post-retirement benefit plans, chiefly the UK pension plan. The net effect of that is that the reported earnings was $5.60, which was up 7% and that was broadly in line with the growth in core earnings as well. The dividend, as I said, was increased by 11% to $2.55, and the cash returns to shareholders were further enhanced by the $2.1 billion net share buyback program, so a good return profile.</p>
          <p>Looking at the regional revenue performance, I'd point to the 16% growth in emerging markets as a key highlight. We did also manage to grow revenue in Western Europe as volume growth was able to more than offset the government interventions that we experienced on pricing. If you look in the established rest-of-world markets, our Canadian business had mid-teens growth and we also grew revenue in Japan despite the biannual price reduction, another good performance.</p>
          <p>An overview of the key brand shows two $5 billion franchises as I said earlier: Crestor and Seroquel, and they're growing strongly, a Nexium franchise that was just under $5 billion and it's holding up very well as it is in its mature phase. Symbicort was another strong performer. Our overall business was up 20%. The Arimidex performance this year reflects the onset of generic competition in the U.S. from mid-2010, and generics are expected in Europe from February 2011 onwards, from next month.</p>
          <p>If we look at the brands in detail, once again, growth rates are quoted on in constant concurrency terms. The Crestor sales were up 24% for the year, as I said over $5 billion now to $5.7 billion globally. It's growing well ahead of the Statin market in all major regions of the world. In the U.S., for example, total prescriptions were up 12% against a market growth of just 3%. New indications based on the JUPITER study are supporting this growth. Our strong brand position for patients at elevated cardiovascular risk is the key to supporting the brand once Lipitor's patent expires. You can see that we also achieved at least 20% growth in all three of the rest of the world regions, as well. So a great performance for Crestor.</p>
          <p>The Seroquel franchise reached sales of $5.3 billion. That was a 9% increase. That performance was driven by the 67% increase for Seroquel XR, which is, as I said before, is now a billion dollar product in its own right. By year's end, Seroquel XR accounted for 24% of the global franchise revenue; that was 17% of franchise revenue in the U.S. and 38% in the rest of the world. For 2011, we look for continued growth for XR including further rollouts of the MDD indication in Europe as well as launches for both bipolar disease and MDD in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Nexium. Nexium sales were unchanged at just under $5 billion. Sales in the U.S. were down 5%, but the whole PPI market was down 0.5% in dispensed volume, so our market share held up reasonably well. And we did this without direct sales force support in the U.S.; just the new channels that we've put in place, things like digital customer service representatives, and telemarketing, all new and different ways to reach our customers there.</p>
          <p>You can see that we grew Nexium across the rest of the world markets. Sales in Europe were up 2% despite the onset of generic competition in some markets that lost data exclusivity in March of last year. But on balance, the generic approvals have just come through more slowly than our planning assumptions from last year.</p>
          <p>We had 18% growth in emerging markets that was led by a 36% increase in our business in China. And as we continue to defend our intellectual property, the pace of generic approvals and launches will really determine how Nexium sales evolve during 2011.</p>
          <p>Symbicort. Symbicort sales were up 20% for the year to $2.7 billion. Sales in the U.S. were up 48%. Total prescriptions were up 44% compared to a 4% increase for the overall fixed combination class. So Symbicort's share of new prescriptions for the steroid/LABA combination products increased to 19.5% in December. That was up another 2 percentage points in the year.</p>
          <p>The 59% increase in established rest of world is driven by the strong launch uptake up Symbicort in Japan, where our volume share grew to over 23% in November. Western Europe was up 5%. As yet, we've not seen any generic approvals since the data exclusivity in the 10-year markets expired last August. And we all know that the regulatory path to approval in this product category is challenging. Sales in emerging markets also showed strong growth. They were up 23%.</p>
          <p>On Arimidex, there's not really much new to say about Arimidex. The 22% decline in sales was driven, as I said, by the launch of generics in the U.S. at midyear. So U.S. sales were down 44% in the year. Exclusivity expires in the major European markets next month.</p>
          <p>So that's a quick review of some of the key brand performances. As you all know, the press release contains a lot more detail on the key brands and any products that I've not covered.</p>
          <p>Now, next year Brilinta will be included in the key brand commentary, so I think I'll finish my portion of this presentation with just a few words of how we're approaching the launch of this important new medicine. Brilinta has now been approved in 30 countries, including those in the European Union, Iceland, Norway and others under the name, trade name Brilique, and most recently in Brazil, it was also approved there. It will be called Brilinta. It's under regulatory review in a further 21 countries, including the Unites States, where as I said we made a rapid response to the CRL, and I know Martin will touch on this in his remarks.</p>
          <p>It's a great opportunity to launch a very important new medicine, bringing to the market a more effective antiplatelet treatment to reduce the risk of heart attack and cardiovascular death in patients with acute coronary syndrome, or ACS. As you may have seen from the published prices in some of the early launch markets, our pricing approach I think reflects a strong value proposition based on the PLATO data.</p>
          <p>The burden that acute coronary syndrome places on patients and the healthcare system is high. More than 3 million new cases of ACS present annually in the G8 markets alone, and that includes more than one million in the top five European markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of our plans for launch, as you would expect the U.S. launch is dependent upon completing the FDA review. And we are awaiting confirmation on the timeline for the FDA's review of our recent submission. We have started the launch process in the UK, in Germany and Denmark this month. However, the majority of the European launches will occur in the second half of this year, following the pricing and reimbursement negotiations and approvals that need to take place.</p>
          <p>Besides the regulatory approvals and pricing, there are two other factors that I think are going to influence the ramp up, the rate of the ramp up of this launch as we get started. Brilinta's a product where most therapy starts occur in the hospital rather than in the doctor's office. With these products, you have to the formulary and treatment protocol reviews before you can get usage. The reviews happen on a local, hospital-by-hospital basis and the timeline for this process is in the hands of the institutions, not ours.</p>
          <p>The final factor that will certainly govern the pace of uptake in year one is the rate at which new ACS patients present over the course of the year in relation to where and when we have launched the product.</p>
          <p>These are all worth keeping in mind, these things, when you're considering how quickly the market can be penetrated in the first launch year; however large your sales aspirations really are.</p>
          <p>That concludes my overview of the 2010 performance. What I'll do now is hand over to Martin who will review 2010 from the research and development perspective. Martin, over to you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks David. Well thank you David and good afternoon. Today I'm going to give a brief update on where we are with the R&amp;D strategy and our transformation goals. I will also talk about our portfolio performance in 2010. And then finish with a review of a selection of our late-stage programs.</p>
          <p>Our strategy recognized that we needed to &#x2013; a dramatic change in R&amp;D performance. Last year we decided to address this in the leadership and operating model transformation. In terms of the portfolio, we conducted a root and branch attrition analysis to make sure we learned from our failures. And we reviewed every single R&amp;D program.</p>
          <p>We decided to invest in a number of key capabilities and also set out to access the very best of external science. Lastly we made hard decisions to close some of our sites and to reduce our internal head count. I will show some examples in the next few slides.</p>
          <p>I would not normally show a slide of leaders to this audience but I thought it was the best way to illustrate the extent of change we've seen with a few examples. We conducted an extensive review across the R&amp;D organization. And this resulted in a large-scale change in who leads R&amp;D. We've attracted talented people from across the industry and globe, as well as appointing superb talent from within AstraZeneca. In fact, over half of our senior leadership has now changed. I believe that the changes were necessary and now it's about pipeline delivery.</p>
          <p>My second focus was to set clear accountabilities for leaders. We constructed a simple operating model with Mene Pangalos and Bahija Jallal leading our small molecule and large molecule research engines respectively. At proof of concept, Anders Ekblom and a very experienced team of drug developers take ownership of the programs. The model has single points of accountabilities actually with fewer but higher hurdles.</p>
          <p>We also conducted a root and branch review of our portfolio to learn from the failures and there were some very clear issues that came to light. We asked a number of fundamental questions: did we have the right target engagement? Were we confident in efficacy based on the level of understanding of human biology? Did we have the right tissue exposure and duration suitable to deliver clinical efficacy? Was pre-clinical and clinical safety supported by the knowledge of both on- and off-target toxicity.</p>
          <p>Did we have the evidence and ability to identify the patients most likely to respond to our medicines? And did we have a differentiated value proposition against current and future standard of care? Successes across the industry invariably scored highly against these criteria whilst failure scored poorly. We have applied this framework to our portfolio.</p>
          <p>If we turn now to the latest update on the R&amp;D pipeline, you can see an early impact. We've made tough decisions in terms of terminating programs as well as progressing those considered to have the highest potential. For the first time since 2004 we see a total reduction in the total number in our pipeline. In addition, and not shown on this slide, the portfolio review has reduced the number of compounds in the pre-clinical phase. In fact, approximately 30% of programs were stopped here.</p>
          <p>In the long-term we believe that a smaller pipeline, which is more carefully scrutinized for quality and value will serve us well. I will certainly not be seduced by the vanity of large numbers, but rather we will be very careful stewards of the money invested in us. We believe that building the capabilities shown here will be essential to improve our productivity.</p>
          <p>The R&amp;D and commercial organizations are working together on an integrated payer strategy to deliver the best reimbursement dossier. Personalized healthcare aims to deliver the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right dose, at the right time. This enables us to focus our discovery and translational efforts to the right disease segment. In terms of clinical trial design and interpretation, we are identifying best practices to improve the overall effectiveness and speed of clinical decisions. And for predictive sciences, we are using translational medicine to better link pre-clinical and clinical data helping us to make earlier decisions.</p>
          <p>How is our core business doing in the meantime? And David alluded to some of the programs I'll discuss. 2010 was a year of some good successes tempered by those very clear disappointments. The approval of Brilique and Vimovo has been mentioned. And together with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we have a new, once daily fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA Metformin called Kombiglyze XR which we recently launched in the United States. We have also submitted ONGLYZA Metformin IR fixed dose combination in the E.U. David talked about Brilinta and I will speak about the complete response later in a moment.</p>
          <p>We have made submissions in the E.U and U.S. for Dapagliflozin and Vandetanib, and we submitted our antibiotic ceftaroline, now branded Zinforo and Axanum in the E.U. At the same time, lifecycle management continues to add value. We have had new indications for Crestor in the U.S. and the E.U. based on data from the landmark JUPITER trial. And for Seroquel XR in the E.U. as an add-on treatment for major depressive disorders.</p>
          <p>We have started Phase III programs for TC-5214 and Fostamatinib. However, our internal performance has been disappointing in terms of securing approval for late-stage projects, and we have had Complete Response Letters for Motavizumab and Certriad which we have since discontinued. David also mentioned we had disappointing trial results in Recentin and Zibotentan.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to our late-stage assets where I'm going to highlight five of our projects. In December last year, December 16 to be precise, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for Brilinta. This is our top priority in R&amp;D. The additional analysis requested were produced by a team, and last week we announced that we had replied. The additional analysis of the PLATO trial requested in the Complete Response Letter focused on interactions between ticagrelor and high-dose aspirin. We believe these supplementary analysis support the hypothesis that the apparent difference in treatment effect observed in the U.S. and non-U.S. patient subsets in PLATO is most slightly a reflection of an underlying interaction between ticagrelor and high-dose aspirin.</p>
          <p>We remain of the view that either a play of chance or this interaction are viable explanations for the efficacy differences observed in this subset of U.S. patients in the PLATO trial. The CRL did not request that additional studies be conducted as a prerequisite for approval of the NDA. We remain confident in the submission, and are now waiting to hear if we can expect a two-month or six-month review period.</p>
          <p>The next program I will update you on is Fostamatinib that we in-licensed from Rigel last year. It is the first oral spleen tyrosine kinase or syk inhibitor in development as a novel approach for rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have failed to respond adequately to therapy. We commenced our Phase III program called OSKIRA in September last year, and this was only six months after the deal was signed. Recruitment is going according to plan, and we will meet our 2000 regulatory filing dates, of course assuming positive results. We intend to commence a Phase IIb study that explores Fostamatinib as a monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis, and this will provide information in the absence of DMARDS.</p>
          <p>In the neuroscience area, our most advanced program is TC-5214, which we have licensed from Targacept. It is a neuronal nicotinic receptor modulator, a novel mechanism of action relative to standard antidepressant agents and is initially being developed for major depressive disorder in patients with inadequate response to first-line SSRIs or SNRIs .</p>
          <p>More than 50% of MDD patients currently don't achieve remission after initial antidepressant therapy. The key Phase IIb results are shown on the right. All patients received Citalopram during the first eight weeks, and were then randomized to either TC-5214 or placebo. All patients continued to receive Citalopram throughout the study. The placebo group is denoted in red, the TC-5214 group in blue.</p>
          <p>Dosing in the Phase III Renaissance program commenced last summer, and the program is again progressing to schedule. In addition, a long-term safety study has completed enrollment. We anticipate a U.S. NDA submission in the second half of 2012 and EU filing in 2015. In addition, a Phase II study to assess TC-5214 as a switch monotherapy treatment for MDD is targeted to start in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our next generation cephalosporin antibiotic, Zinforo which forms part of our collaboration with Forest Laboratories. We have the responsibility for the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of Zinforo in all markets outside of the U.S., Canada, and Japan. Zinforo is a new extended spectrum and well tolerated antibiotic which has shown good activity important, to important types of hospital infections, namely complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community acquired pneumonia.</p>
          <p>The key clinical data supporting our Zinforo filing in Europe is depicted on the right of the slide. There were four pivotal Phase III studies, two CANVAS studies in cSSTI and two focus studies in CAP. All four studies were non-inferiority designs versus active comparators, and met their primary end points, demonstrating a good efficacy and tolerability profile, including MSRA activity in the skin trials. Our EU regulatory filing was submitted in December last year, and today, I can confirm that EMA has accepted our filing earlier this week.</p>
          <p>One of the most exciting projects in the late-stage portfolio is a first-in-class SGLT2 inhibitor, Dapagliflozin, which we are co-developing with Bristol-Myers Squibb. On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see a depiction of the mechanism of action of Dapagliflozin, which is novel for antibiotic drugs and works independently of insulin resulting in excretion of glucose and associated calories in the urine.</p>
          <p>Data from five pivotal Phase III studies are now in the public domain and suggest a product profile that is encouraging with differentiated patient benefits. This includes a potential benefit in uncontrolled patients with Type 2 diabetes who require HbA1c reduction and the additional benefit of weight loss. In the Phase III studies, genital infections and urinary tract infections were generally higher in the Dapagliflozin group, but they were mild or moderate, generally responded to an initial course of standard treatment and very rarely led to discontinuation. Further data from the Phase III program will be presented later this year. Together with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we filed in December 2010 for regulatory approvals in both the United States and E.U.</p>
          <p>So in summary, 2010 was a year of significant change for AstraZeneca R&amp;D. We made hard decisions around people, our portfolio, and the way that we work. I came to AstraZeneca to lead a successful R&amp;D organization, one that will create value for shareholders, help patients and be admired by our colleagues. I believe that we have set a clear path, and now we must focus on delivery of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to our Chief Financial Officer, Simon Lowth.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Martin, and good afternoon to everyone. Today I'm going to cover six topics. First, I will briefly summarize the headline numbers for the fourth quarter. I will then return to the results for the full-year for my review of our financial performance in 2010 with a focus on the core P&amp;L. I'll provide an update on our restructuring and productivity improvement program. I'll then touch on cash performance, and the increased cash returns to shareholders delivered this year. I will revisit the midterm planning assumptions for 2010 to 2014. And finally, I'll review our financial guidance for 2011.</p>
          <p>So turning first to the headline numbers for the fourth quarter, we achieved revenue of $8.6 billion; that's a 3% decline in constant currency terms, or minus 4% if you include the negative impact of currency movements. The revenue decline in the U.S. was 12% as a result of the generic inroads and the H1N1 flu vaccine comparisons. This was only partially mitigated by the 5% growth in the rest of world.</p>
          <p>Core operating profit for the quarter was down 2% at constant currency, slightly less than the decline in revenue as a result of operating efficiencies and higher other income. Core EPS was up 1% at constant currency to $1.39. Lowered net finance expense and fewer shares outstanding as a result of the buyback provided the uplift to core EPS growth compared with the slight decline in core operating profit.</p>
          <p>Now making the bridge from core EPS to reported EPS in the quarter, total net adjusting items in the fourth quarter of 2010 were $0.11 lower than last year. Restructuring charges and intangible impairments, that's chiefly Motavizumab, were higher than last year, but the increase was more than offset by the 40%, $0.40 gain related to retirement benefit changes that David mentioned earlier. Net of these adjusting factors, the growth rate in reported earnings per share was 11% in constant currency terms to $1.15 compared with $1.07 in the fourth quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>I'll now return to the results for the full year, and for a review of the main elements of the P&amp;L. And I'll focus here on core margins and profit. The press release does of course contain the statutory numbers and a detailed reconciliation to the core measures. And when I refer to growth rates, they will all be on a constant currency basis. Now the starting point is revenue, which for the full year was $33.3 billion; that's unchanged compared to 2009. Core gross margin at 81.2% of sales was 160 basis points lower than last year.</p>
          <p>Now you'll recall that we took an intangible impairment on Lesogaberan in the third quarter of 2010, and there was a provision release that benefited the third quarter of 2009, and this large unfavorable variance in Q3 accounts for more than half of the full year decline. The balance of the declining gross margin for the full year is due to higher royalties and an adverse regional and product mix that was only partially offset by operating efficiencies and lower Merck payments.</p>
          <p>There will be further pressures on gross margin for 2011 as a result of the enactment of the excise tax on product produced in Puerto Rico, which will be recorded in cost of goods, not on the tax line. However, I still expect core gross margin to be above 80% consistent with our midterm planning assumptions.</p>
          <p>Core SG&amp;A expense was just under $9.8 billion, that's 2% lower than last year as investments in emerging markets and recent launches were more than offset by operational efficiencies across our established markets. Now as expected and flagged, this investment was weighted to the fourth quarter, but that said, the fourth quarter spend in absolute terms was below the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Core other income of $910 million was a touch under 2009. Now last year we had the disposal gains related to Abraxane and the Nordic OTC business. 2010 included the royalties on Teva's sales of generic Pulmicort Respules. Core pre-R&amp;D margin, therefore, was 53.5% of revenue, and that's right at the top end of our planning range, although it is lower than last year, as the gross margin decline was only partially offset by the efficiencies in SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Core R&amp;D expenditures were 4% lower for the full year. Increased investment in biologics was more than offset by lower project costs and by operational efficiencies. The lower project costs are the result of several late-stage projects completing their clinical trials. This was partially offset by the start of Phase III programs for TC-5214 and Fostamatinib in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Our core operating profit was $13.6 billion. That's unchanged at constant currency. Core operating margin was 40 basis points lower, with the impact of lower R&amp;D expense and operating efficiencies only partially offsetting the decline in gross margin.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to an update on the progress of our restructuring programs. The first phase of the restructuring program is now complete, and it's delivered exactly as planned. We've achieved annual benefits of $2.4 billion by the end of 2010, and a gross head count reduction prior to reinvestment decisions of 12,600 positions. The cumulative restructuring costs associated with Phase 1, which were incurred over the 2007 to 2009 period were $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now we kicked off Phase 2 of restructuring with our financial results announcement last year. This included additional productivity improvement initiatives in the supply chain and in SG&amp;A in addition to the significant change program within research and development. When completed, these will result in the realization of a further $1.9 billion in estimated annual benefits by the end of 2014. Now in terms of phasing, around half will be realized by the end of 2011, with most but not all of the remainder by the end of 2013. Of the estimated $2 billion in costs anticipated for this phase of the program, we charged $1.2 billion in 2010, and the remainder will largely be taken in 2011.</p>
          <p>So how has total head count been affected to date as a result of our business reshaping efforts? Well, through the end of 2010, we've reduced head count by the 12,600 positions from the first phase, together with nearly 2,700 from early returns on the second phase, amounting to a total of more than 14,000. This has provided the headroom to increase our investments in biologics and emerging markets, leaving a net reduction in 6,400 fulltime equivalents. And this has been an important driver of the more than 9 percentage point improvement in our core operating margin over this period.</p>
          <p>So I think I'll turn to cash flow. Net cash from operating activities would have been more or less in line with last year were it not for the payments related to Seroquel sales and marketing practices in the U.S. and the payment of the first installment in respect of the U.K. tax settlement. These payments contributed to the $1.1 billion decline in net cash from operating activities to $10.7 billion in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now, for management purposes, we make our investment decisions on the basis of pre-R&amp;D post-tax cash flow. This is a non-GAAP measure. It amounted to $13.5 billion in 2010. Of this, we invested $3.3 billion in after-tax R&amp;D expenditures, including the acquisition of Novexel and late-stage in-licensing deals with Targacept and Rigel. There was $1 billion in capital expenditures as well as the $647 million payment on the Merck First Option. This represents a re-investment rate of around 37% of cash flow to drive future growth and value. This is a bit under our planning assumption of a 40% to 50% reinvestment rate, but that is taking a view over the entirety of the planning cycle, not a point estimate in any single year.</p>
          <p>Now, our commitment to shareholder value is evidenced by the $5.5 billion in cash returned to shareholders, that's a nearly two-fold increase in cash returns compared to 2009. It's a result of an increased dividend, and the resumption of share repurchases.</p>
          <p>After the increased levels of investment and returns to shareholders, the residual cash flow increased our net cash position to $3.7 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $535 million in 2009. Our net cash position of $3.7 billion is comprised of gross debt of $9.1 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $12.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Let me just put our net cash position in the context of the board's thinking on capital structure. The board intends to maintain a strong, investment grade credit rating. It also believes that it's important to preserve balance sheet strength particularly during periods of revenue transition. Given our rating objective and the pension position we remain comfortable with carrying gross debt at the same order of magnitude as our current position. Alongside gross debt, we do need to hold a meaningful cash balance to meet operational funding needs and periodic settlements of liabilities.</p>
          <p>We don't have a fixed target for our cash balance, it will fluctuate with business needs, but the size of the current balance is clearly considered in the board's decision to target $4 billion in net share repurchases in 2011.</p>
          <p>This is the first year of implementation for our progressive dividend policy by which we aim to maintain or grow the dividend each year over the planning cycle. With the announcement of the second interim dividend of $1.85, this brings the dividend for the full year to $2.55, so that's an 11% increase. You'll recall that when we declared the first interim dividend at the half-year results, we said that the board intended to rebalance the first and second interim dividends with the aim of setting the first interim dividend at around a third of the prior year dividend. So I would expect to see the same manifest when the first interim dividend for 2011 is declared in July.</p>
          <p>As previously stated we executed $2.1 billion in net share repurchases in 2010. And based on its annual review of the cash position of the group, our investment priorities and other anticipated calls on cash, the board has approved a target of $4 billion in net share repurchases for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now last year we outlined our planning assumptions for the 2010 to 2014 period, and over the course of the year I said that we would aim to review these on an annual basis and assess the need for any midcourse calibration. In the main, our assumptions remain robust over the period. The macro assumptions remain valid. There was a lot of attention last year as U.S. healthcare reform and government interventions in Europe. And whilst these pressures remain a key factor in the environment, we still don't think of them as step changes that would require a material rethink of our assumptions.</p>
          <p>Let me now review our specific assumptions for revenue, for margins, cash flow and business reinvestment. Well first and most importantly we continue to plan on the basis that total company revenue will be in the range of $28 billion to $34 billion over the 2010 to '14 period. The key drivers will continue to be strong commercial execution that will fuel the growth for our key brands that retain exclusivity and drive continued double digit growth in our emerging markets, while patent expirations will be the chief source of downward pressure on the top line. Not surprisingly, given the pipeline developments over the course of 2010, we have lowered our latest risk-adjusted view of the potential revenue contribution from the recently launched and pipeline products.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that our starting point last year was in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. We've adjusted this down to the range of $3 billion to $5 billion. It is important to keep in mind that pipeline estimates are dynamic. They fluctuate based on news flow from the data that's continuously being generated during the development program, from regulatory actions and indeed from competitive developments in the marketplace. If, in the end, it turns out that estimates for pipeline revenue stay in line with this lower planning assumption, then total company revenue in 2014 is more likely to be around the middle of the $28 billion to $34 billion planning range. And you'll recall last year our aspirations leaned closer to the top than bottom of the range.</p>
          <p>Based on continued strong execution on productivity improvement programs, disciplined management of costs, we still plan for core, pre-R&amp;D operating margin in the range of 48% to 54% of revenue. And our plans for driving strong cash performance over the period and the allocation between reinvestment for future growth and value and cash returns to shareholders remain firmly in place.</p>
          <p>My last topic before handing back to David is our guidance for 2011. Revenue comparisons in the U.S. market related to Toprol-XL, Pulmicort Respules and pandemic flu vaccine should moderate over the course of the year. For Arimidex however, we will feel the full effect of the generic competition in the U.S. that started mid-2010, and then beginning in February in Europe as well. So this would suggest a quarterly phasing to year-on-year performance in comparisons that will be more difficult in the first half of the year than the second.</p>
          <p>We will also have to navigate the full year impact of healthcare reform in the U.S. Our latest estimates suggests around a $700 million impact for the full year of 2011. We estimate that between a quarter and third of this will hit the SG&amp;A line via the excise tax. The rest will be absorbed on the revenue line. Now in line with recent experience, we also continue to expect a negative impact on revenue in Europe from government interventions that will be around mid single-digit levels. On balance, we anticipate that revenue in 2011 could range from flat to a low single-digit decline compared to 2010 on a constant currency basis. The extent of generic competition will be among the variables that could determine where we land within that range.</p>
          <p>Consistent with what I said earlier, core gross margin should be above 80% but will probably be lower than 2010. Core pre-R&amp;D operating margin should remain comfortably near the top of the planning range but below 2010's level. Net finance expense should be broadly in line with last year and core other income, barring any unusual items, should be around $800 million. We expect the tax rate to be around 27%.</p>
          <p>Our core EPS target is based on the January 2011 average exchange rates for our principal currencies, and on that basis we anticipate core earnings per share to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.75. Of course we're taking no view of the future movements for currency, so going forward this guidance takes no account of the likelihood that average exchange rates for the remainder of the year may differ materially from the January 2011 average. As usual, I would point you to our currency sensitivity chart to help you flex your own estimates on the currency impact for sales and earnings.</p>
          <p>So that concludes my review of 2010 performance and our outlook for 2011. I will now hand back over to David.</p>

          <p>Great. Well thank you, Simon, for that update, and Martin, for your update as well. We'll move on now to the question and answer session. Just before I take the first question, to remind everyone we have people on WebEx, a couple of hundred people as well as about 150 people in teleconference. [Instructions]</p>
          <p>So with that though, I'll open up questions to the floor here. Let's get started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jo? I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three quick questions. Crestor you saw very strong revenue growth last year, which is sort of half RX, half price benefit. As we move into a period with generic Lipitor in the U.S. can you give us some idea of what you would expect, whether in the last year before this major Statin goes off-market you would expect everyone to benefit from strong prices? Or whether you're already having to provide additional discounts to position yourself in a post-generic Lipitor phase?</p>
          <p>Secondly on R&amp;D, you've cleared out a lot of projects. If we look at this, are we seeing more than the normal rate of attrition? I mean this industry needs to see an improvement in R&amp;D productivity. But if we look and see what's happening it seems to be going down. Is there just an additional clear-out, or are we still seeing an ongoing decline in the rate of R&amp;D productivity?</p>
          <p>And related to that, a final question on the biologics side. You've got nearly around 3,000 more people in biologics. What are they actually doing? And when are you going to get a return for that investment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. We have Tony, who is running our global commercial organization here. Tony, I would certainly make the comment about the Crestor revenues in a post-generic Lipitor world. To say our belief is that that is going to put some pressure on managed care formularies, as well as on physicians, nonetheless. So I think we've positioned the product reasonably well. So I'll throw that to you in just a minute. And then, Martin, maybe I'd ask you after that to comment on the R&amp;D attrition rates as well as what's going on in biologics. But, Tony, why don't you start with just your views about the world around generic Lipitor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Because your question was specific to the run up, what do we see happening? As you know, we've positioned Crestor in the marketplace for the patients with dyslipidemia, but also with risk factors and so by doing so, we've actually been able to have a positive impact on our price year-on-year. And so while there is discounting in the marketplace, our actual net price per tablet has actually had slight improvements year-on-year.</p>
          <p>This year, our access rates for Crestor are as good as they have ever been. In fact, if you look to the commercial book of business, our access rates are in the mid-80% ranges. And if you look to Medicare, our reimbursement rates for access are in the mid-90s. And we have not had to see differential price adjustments at all in the run up. We are seeing some of our competitors becoming more aggressive in that space, but we've resisted that price battle because of our positioning and we think we can do the same as we head into this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, Martin, you want to comment on attrition rates, changes, what you see happening in the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, certainly, David. I'll make a couple points about productivity and then move to your biologics question. Actually, rather than reducing R&amp;D productivity by cutting the pipeline, I think it will have the opposite effect. And I say that because for the last 10 years, a lot of the industry was predicated on this notion that if you increase the numbers going into first-in-human testing, you would get more out the other end.</p>
          <p>Well, it's been clear from 10 years' analysis, that whilst we certainly put more into development, we haven't had more out the other end; so hence our focus much more now on the quality and the value of those programs rather than the numbers going into the pipeline.  So the slide that I showed where we look now &#x2013; are we engaging the target, do we get the right tissue exposure, are we hitting the right patient population are much better predictors of success than our numbers total. So my sincere view is that we'll move to a time where you'll see that upturn in productivity because of this.</p>
          <p>In terms of biologics, I'd mention a couple of things. We have about 25% of our portfolio now that have, that are of a biologic nature. So that's what they're working on. It's clearly an early portfolio with our MedImmune group in Gaithersburg and the group in Cambridge, it's early. They're working on some, I think, terrific targets. I could talk at some length about early programs but I won't, that I think are doing very well.</p>
          <p>But I'd like you to think about it in this way: One of the reasons I joined AstraZeneca was this notion that we had a very replete toolkit. So the idea that a scientist, a Chief Scientific Officer can say, here is great target in oncology, and now we will apply the best modality to it, whether it be a small molecule, a large molecule, a vaccine, and have all those tools to hand with our magnificent arrange of tools in AstraZeneca, and that's exactly what's happening in the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, Martin. I'll take one more from the floor here, then I'm going to go to Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein on the next one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. It's Mark Purcell from Barclays Capital. The first question, in terms of emerging markets, can you discuss your view of pricing pressure in this market as an aggregate, I guess, especially for branded generics in light of the Chinese price cuts last year? Secondly, there was a quote on the news wires about single billion dollar acquisition opportunities. Could describe what a single billion-dollar acquisition opportunity is? And which areas you're looking in?</p>
          <p>Number three, turning to R&amp;D, on Olaparib, you've terminated the breast cancer development program. I just wondered if you could share your reasoning with us on that. And whether ovarian cancer is the only area in terms of solid tumors you're looking to progress that compound?</p>
          <p>And then on Fostamatinib, the syk inhibitor, I wondered how you're using predictive biomarkers at the moment to determine how you take the RA monotherapy trial forward? And the potential in oncology indications such as NHL? Certainly a number of players are using gene panels to look at TNF responder and non-responders at the moment. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thanks, Mark. I'll save the Fostamatinib and Olaparib for Martin and the single billion dollar acquisition for Simon. Tony, maybe you want to make a comment?</p>
          <p>I'll make a comment about branded generics generally, and that is because it is an out-of-pocket market primarily in the emerging markets. There is pricing pressure. As you would expect, the prices don't get to the same level as you see in the developed markets. But nonetheless there's an appreciation of the brand, primarily from a quality perspective, and I think the ability to associate our name, for example, AstraZeneca, with products and use our organizations to represent them in the market conveys the quality message that we really want to get across to customers and to payers. And I think Asia is a great example of that because there's a high degree of attention paid to quality.</p>
          <p>As to the China price cuts, Tony, I don't have a specific answer on that. I don't know if you want to make a comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would echo much of what you said. Mark, with the emerging markets, it's hard to give you one answer because there are so many diverse models that are in place. But David is right on the branded generic side, it's very much an out-of-pocket market. And that's why we want to be very specific in the branded generic segment, and not the generic segment, because there, we have seen the prices go down as you would have expected them to.</p>
          <p>In China what we are seeing, and in a number of our markets, we're seeing exceptional volume growth. You know the pricing system is there just to start first with the national reimbursement drug lists and then go to the provincial drug lists. And once they get to the provincial drug lists is when we really begin to see volume uptake. And of course that triggers a little bit of pricing pressures that then comes back to us from the market. But it's not significant and it's not suppressing the volume growth that we see for the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks. Simon, do you want to comment about our acquisition approach in general? I'm not sure the single billion dollar aspect of it is perfect, but how do you want to characterize that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. No. Thanks, Mark. The strategy for the company, Mark, as you know, is a very clear focus on innovation driven pharmaceuticals. We've set out a strategy that is principally organic in nature. And as we set out our midterm planning assumptions, we laid out our view on revenue and pre-R&amp;D margin which then drives, as I described, the pre-R&amp;D cash flow. And our strategy is investment of 40% to 50% of that in essentially organic investment in our business and in in-licensing. And the majority of that 40% to 50% is into R&amp;D. And that's absolutely the core of the strategic development of the company.</p>
          <p>We've got a very strong commercial capability. We've got a very strong position in markets around the world. We've also, and I think you've seen this over the results, we've got an operational capability and a discipline in driving cost management and productivity. We do look at opportunities to leverage that commercial capability, operational capability to drive revenue and cost synergies, and we will look at small bolt-on acquisitions. Our primary focus has been looking at that to aid our emerging market business. We might look also at some of our established markets, but these are very much in the mode of small, bolt-on acquisitions, leveraging revenue and cost synergies, and obviously at all times bringing the sort of investment discipline that you'd expect us to.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of product questions. Over to you, Martin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. As you know, Olaparib is our PARP inhibitor. At least ostensibly, you could use that as a pan-tumor treatment. I mean, that's the basis of it. We decided to focus on serious ovarian cancer, and really focus our attention to that in the first instance and wait to see how those results play out in Phase III. Then we'll revisit because obviously breast cancer and the medical need there is hugely important and other tumor types. But we'll revisit that on the basis of Phase III results. That's Olaparib.</p>
          <p>And in Fostamatinib, the quick answer is yes, absolutely. As you know, there's been an explosion of science around the pathways and pathway mining. And in fact we're using it in two ways; not only in terms of the clinical trials we're running, but also in terms of looking for new mechanisms and new targets in this area. Because as much as we've done to date, there's massive room for medical need in indication and we want to do even more.</p>
          <p>Lastly I would just say not restricted to rheumatoid arthritis, both this mechanism and others that we're unfolding you could see being applied to autoimmune diseases in general. So it's a very full program at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm here. Thank you. A couple of questions. The first is on your long-term guidance that goes to 2014, you now say it may come in the middle of that range. The prior guidance was for the upper end of that range. So it seems like that's a delta of maybe $2 billion or $3 billion, and it looks like only $1 billion of that delta is explained by the lower pipeline estimates. So I'm wondering what the difference where that's coming from. And also previously you talked about returning to sustained revenue growth after 2014, but I don't think I saw that language now and I'm hoping you can clarify.</p>
          <p>Second question is on the SATURN trial and the timing of that. When would be the earliest that we could see any form of results? And am I wrong to think that, that is a very important trial to get right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Thanks, Tim. Simon, maybe I'd let you talk a little bit about the guidance especially at the end of the period and the impact of both the reduction in the sales from expected new products being slightly reduced. But does that in some way suggest that we're not coming out of the period with sustained growth post-2014, I think is the question. And then, Martin, I'll go back to you, and there is a written question there around SATURN so maybe you can incorporate your answer around both. You read that one and this. Simon, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tim, thanks very much for the question. As I said in my remarks, we absolutely reaffirm the primary components of our midterm planning assumptions. We will remain in that revenue corridor of $28 billion to $34 billion pre-R&amp;D margins in the range of 48% to 54%. The only refinement we've made having looked at developments over the year is on that pipeline component. Reflecting the developments during 2010 we've moved it from four to six, down from three to five. I think that, that's the only change; I wouldn't read any more into our remarks.</p>
          <p>So obviously if you bring that in, reaching towards the top-end of the range, which was our aspiration, we now see that perhaps more towards the middle. But I think the key thing to focus on is only one change, which is in the pipeline from four to six to three to five.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a pretty dynamic situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's a dynamic situation. The second part of your question we haven't changed our view on the outlook beyond the 2010 to '14 period. The focus of our planning assumptions though is in that time period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. That's great. SATURN.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As you suggest, David, I'll combine both Tim's question and Vishal's question that's come up on the screen there. The quick answer to your question, Tim, is that we will have results in the second half of this year. There may be a tiny bit of detail, which gets to one of Vishal's points. As you know, this is a study to compare 40 milligrams of rosuvastatin with 80 milligrams of atorvastatin. I think it asks the important clinical question in terms of the effect of lowering the LDL-C, raising HDL-C on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in an IVUS study.</p>
          <p>There's around 650 patients in either leg, there was a run-in period and then a 24-month follow-up. The one thing I would say having come into this and reviewed SATURN and the other studies around Crestor, as you can imagine I've been quite interested in this area. I think you have to look at the body of clinical evidence for Crestor and look at the ASTEROID study, the METEOR study, and of course JUPITER, magnificent pieces of work really showing the benefit of the Statin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. Thank you. Let's go back to the floor here. In front, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch. Actually my first question would just be a follow-on to your SATURN comments. My understanding from the trial design publication was the study was predominantly designed to detect differences in HDL between Lipitor and Crestor given that the LDL and CRP changes at the two doses you've chosen, they're very similar. So I wondered if you could just clarify your comments on that. And then the second question was a very quick one for Simon. On Astra Tech, any color on the process, and how would you use the cash proceeds from that should they come this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Why don't you comment on the SATURN question and the HDL aspect of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Very simple, Sachin. You're right. It was predominantly around HDL-C raising.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Jeff Stevens asked a similar question on Astra Tech on the screen here. Just how should we be thinking about the potential disposal on cash. So you want to handle both of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well thanks to both of you with the question. Astra Tech is a very good business. It's in some fast growing markets, which is dental implant and it's been performing well. We get &#x2013; it's not a business, which is central to AstraZeneca's strategy. We've had a lot of interest expressed in the business over time. We felt that it would be responsible and in our shareholders' interest to undertake a process to evaluate options for the business, and that's the process that we have just initiated.</p>
          <p>It's very early in the process. I'm not going to pre-judge the outcome of it. What I would say is that the board's decision on share repurchases for this year of $4 billion net repurchases is independent of the outcome of the Astra Tech strategic review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I get a quick follow-on?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, quick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Just on the HDL issue, do you have any data that supports the 5% difference in HDL, that can support the way the study is powered? And then a follow-on. Should SATURN then be negative, how do you think about Crestor next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So on the former, we have some evidence but not on a trial this size or this controlled. And second, in terms of the negative piece, I would rather wait on the results to see this. To speculate on what we will see there; it's just too early.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a question in the back there.  Yeah, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Peter Verdult here from Morgan Stanley. Just two industry questions for you, David, and a quick one on tax for Simon, please. And then a question on R&amp;D, please Martin.</p>
          <p>The market's clearly attuned recently to the rising risk from enforcement actions across the industry. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter both from an industry perspective and how it relates to Astra going forward. Also we've seen moves in the industry to change the U.S. sales model away from centralization based on prescriptions. Do you see this being adopted widely across the industry?</p>
          <p>And also, there's a Supreme Court case coming up in March between the State of Vermont and IMS regarding the freedom of the industry to use individual prescribing records. I was wondering if Astra intended to submit any amicus briefs relating to that case. I'll start with those two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good. Thanks. Well, our General Counsel's here; I'll let him comment on the IMS and Vermont thing. I'm not sure exactly where we've got to.</p>
          <p>Relative to the enforcement, and I'll let Tony comment on incentives, although I have a comment about it, too. This is a very serious issue in terms of the increase in enforcement actions, and you see it across the industry. It relates primarily to sales and marketing practices and to some degree, to manufacturing practices. And it has accelerated in the last couple of years especially.</p>
          <p>So it's something that I think we take very, very seriously, both at a company level, I can assure you we can. But being a member of the industry trade group, PhRMA in the United States as well as EFPIA for Europe and IFPMA, our NGO in Geneva, which I'm now President of. I can tell you that this is a topic where the industry has stepped up significantly in terms of trying to put in place more general codes of practice that we all adhere to which we think going forward position the way we do business with, in a much better way than some of the things that have happened in the past.</p>
          <p>Certainly, within AstraZeneca, we focused a great deal on implementing our own code of conduct. We train 60 plus thousand employees, every single person, every year on the subject, and then we have special training programs in the marketing and sales areas as well as in the R&amp;D area to make sure people really understand the standards by which we want to operate.</p>
          <p>As it relates to the future that we've disclosed there are other investigations and things going on there in the press release and you can read what we've said about them, which is we can't disclose a lot of information about them. They're ongoing investigations, as you would expect. We're cooperating, but more importantly within our own organization, we're trying to deliver the message about how we want to operate in the future.</p>
          <p>On the incentive side of things, I would just say that the incentive systems vary across markets and across regions just based on the quality of information that's available. And while IMS data in the United States gets down to very, very significant levels of detail, that's just not the case in other places around the world. And so its utility relative to that kind of information varies greatly, and we have other systems in place. As it relates to what's going on specifically with incentives, Tony took over the Global Commercial organization last year; maybe you just want to comment about your view on incentives in general because you're changing some things, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would only be adding on much of what David has already said on how we view our responsibility and accountability to look not just at incentives but at the total program on how we interact with our stakeholders. From an incentive perspective, we have evolved our thinking relative to financial measures as being the dominant driver and have begun to expand out a number of other parameters.</p>
          <p>And it, as David says, it differs by geographic region based on availability of data. We think of things like customer service, quality of interaction. We have broadened it out to include a lot more than just pure financial. And so we can't speak to what industry will do, but from our own perspective we're going to continue to evolve. Will there be a member of financial in the future? I can't say specifically, but we are evolving our thinking and have done so this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Jeff do you want to comment at all on IMS Vermont amicus briefs in the industry or us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not aware that we have any intention to do our own individual brief, but we'll look at it and determine whether we're going to join in, in an industry brief as the time comes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the financial questions, Simon quick one. On tax, you're obviously 27% for the year 2011. Could you make any broad comments about the potential sustainability of that longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We provide guidance on our tax rate for just the one year ahead. What I would say though is that you've seen our tax rate trending down. We've guided to 29% a couple of years ago; we're at 27% for 2011. That reflects really the trends in corporate tax rates in many of the markets that we're operating in. If you look at the U.K. and Sweden, two big important markets for us, you're now at 27% in the U.K., 26.3 in Sweden. And you can see that in the U.K., for example, there's trends down to 24%. So a reduction from history through to 2011, I think 2011 is a good place to start as we look forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks, all right, I'm going to take on the floor. Then I will go to the telephones for Mattias and Gbola Amusa, but give us one minute to get to the phones. In the back first, the guy behind you. You.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, it's Keyur Parekh from Goldman Sachs, and I've  got four questions. Simon, starting with the fourth quarter gross margin. You speak about pressure on gross margins from a geographical mix perspective. Can you elaborate a bit on that and specifically tell us how much of that is from emerging markets?</p>
          <p>Secondly, as you look at 2011 guidance and think about the midpoint of that range relative to where consensus was, the $2 billion incremental buyback over what consensus was modeling and the 200 basis points lower tax rate gives you about $0.40 in additional earnings for 2011. What were we getting wrong on the operating line for 2011?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, Martin, on Brilinta. I mean obviously AstraZeneca has done a lot of work on trying to understand interactions between aspirin and Brilinta. We've seen the Ad Comm [Advisory Committee] discuss and debate this a lot. Can you give us some flavor on what the FDA was looking for in sense of the initial analysis? Should we think of it as being of impact from a labeling perspective? Or is it more fundamental to the actual approvability of the drug in the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And lastly Tony, if you can update us on what your TA2 status is for Crestor in the U.S. and what it was in 2010? And lastly just to specify, you do expect positive pricing impact for Crestor in the U.S. in 2011. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's a handful of questions. Simon, I'm going to throw gross margin and geographic mix to you. Kevin Wilson wrote a bit of a question about emerging market cost inflation and expectations on revenues as well. I don't know if you want to maybe just include that in your response, and I'll let you also cover guidance and tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's start with gross margin. I think the business has faced some pressures on gross margin for mix. These are partly to do with geographic market, but more actually to do with products. As you think about some of the oncology products that have faced patents expiry over the last couple of years, that's been a pressure for us. And that's the principal pressure, a little bit from markets. So I'll come back and talk more generally about emerging markets in a moment. So some product and to a lesser extent geographic market pressures on gross margin.</p>
          <p>The other factor that I drew out in my remarks, you'll recall, was the impact of the Puerto Rico excise tax. And that as we say is accounted for through the cost of goods, so that's a second pressure.</p>
          <p>But bear in mind, a very significant component of our restructuring program has been focused on making our supply chain activities across the world more efficient. We've made very good progress on that, and we continue to see further opportunity to drive efficiencies across our supply chain. Secondly the procurement program, which we've now had up and running, we're probably into the third year of that is continuing to deliver very good savings for us year in/year out. And it's the combination of some of those pressures on mix, but offset by the continued progress of making and driving efficiencies, which gives us confidence to stand behind the view on gross margin of being at the above 80% level as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Before I move and talk about the sort of broader point, let me touch on Kevin's question, it's asking to discuss emerging market cost inflation and the impact on expectations of the costs of growing revenues in these markets. He also asked about our ERP programs, which link into it. So I'm going to just deal with those two, if I may, specific questions.</p>
          <p>So Kevin, in our emerging markets, yes, there typically is higher cost inflation, particularly if it's personnel-driven in our emerging markets. We had another inflationary pressure in our emerging markets, which is that we're investing very hard in markets which are giving us very strong growth, and it's among the fast track, best investments that we make.</p>
          <p>So there are some pressures on the cost line, particularly at SG&amp;A. However, we've got a number of levers that we can and are pulling hard to offset those. Obviously when you're growing your business at 16% per annum and you're doing it through an infrastructure you've established, you get operating leverage. In addition to that, we've got now a strong track record in introducing different approaches to sales and marketing of our product in our established markets. And Tony is engaged in a very active program in bringing some of those approaches, different approaches to sales and marketing &#x2013; more efficient approaches in a targeted way across our emerging market portfolio as well.</p>
          <p>So there's a second innovation in the way that we go about our business. And thirdly, we're involved in looking at each of our activities around our markets and thinking about activities that can be performed centrally in shared service centers, prospectively outsourcing them. My own function finance would be a good example; our finance activities for our emerging markets are now principally driven out of shared services in India and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
          <p>So we can offset some of those pressures with those three levers, and those are in fact driving over time movement up in our emerging market country contribution as we shared with you in this room 12 months ago at our emerging market presentation.</p>
          <p>And, Kevin, to your point about global ERP which links into supply chain, three or four years ago we had almost 20 instances of SAP around AstraZeneca. We've now since essentially moved to three primary instances in a relatively short period of time. As you know, Kevin, probably behind your question, we are in the final phases of implementing a, bringing all of our operations sites onto an ERP. So we're making good progress, and that's part of what brings us supply chain efficiencies, it also obviously helps with working capital.</p>
          <p>If I then move from those topics to your other question, I wouldn't dare to suggest where you're all wrong. Obviously we're very focused on how our business comes together. But I think what we've seen in our range, we've given you some range in terms of what we think's happening on the top line. We've given you some guidance on the pre-R&amp;D margin which we think will stay again within the sort of top end of the range that we've provided in our planning assumptions, maybe a little bit down from 2010. And clearly we've got some additional benefits from tax rates and the share repurchase program. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I'm going to ask us to go a little bit faster so we can get a few more questions in. Brilinta, aspirin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Very quickly, the focus of the Complete Response Letter was on the interaction between ticagrelor and high-dose aspirin. The FDA asked for a number of sub-analysis of the PLATO data. As you know, this an 18,624 patient study across 43 countries. The vast majority of patients, 92% were on low-dose aspirin. In the United States it was 50-50 between low-dose and high-dose. So that was the subject of the sub-analysis that we worked through. Too premature to talk about labeling. We will continue to work closely with the agency as we are on our response to the Complete Response Letter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Tony, do you want to comment on Tier 2, 2010 versus 2011? Give them some -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You were asking very specifically about preferreds, so I'm assuming you want Tier 1, Tier 2. And if I look through the two books of business, if we look at our commercial, our access rates through all of 2010 showed slight improvement quarter-on-quarter. We were vacillating between that 80% to 85% access rate which was among some of the very best access rates. From a Medicare Part D, we were right around the 80% access rate across the books of business.</p>
          <p>And by the way, the reimbursed numbers are in the low 90s. So we have very good access and I think this is an area where our team in the U.S. is quite good. They look at the value proposition of the brand and they stick very much to the positioning. And then you asked about the result and impact on net price expectation. And I do believe that it'll be a slight positive. We have been able to demonstrate that year-on-year and I believe from a percentage, we're talking a very low single digits. But it's still a positive versus our competitors which have been showing a negative.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you, Tony. Listen, we are at 1:30 but we started late, so we're going to stay and do a few more questions. I just want to respect, if there are people here who need to go, please go. I'm going to go to the phones, I'm going to ask everybody to limit themselves to one question. Mattias, you're up.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mattias H&#xE4;ggblom, Danske Markets. Apologies for coming back to Brilinta in U.S. but I guess it's a lot of interest around this. I'd just like to understand better, why did FDA issue the Complete Response Letter instead of just extending the review period by another three months? When based on your very quick turnaround indicated rather simple questions and at least answers that you were having more or less already in place. Any clarity on that for us, to better understand of the complexity of the process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, sometimes I get asked, when are generics coming to the market in a particular place or product? And I would say you need to ask the generic companies that question because we don't control it. And I'll let Martin make a comment because he has some of the FDA insight. But I think that is a question for the FDA. Martin?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, absolutely, the FDA needs to be asked. In terms of we had a three month delay on the PDUFA date as you know, so as I say best to ask the FDA why. The most important thing for us is, we've answered all the questions in the Complete Response Letter. We did it in double quick time. We had a small team of statisticians working over the holidays to put this together. We submitted on the 17th of January and now we're looking forward to hearing from the agency and entering into further discussions on the submission.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my call. Just given the deals you've done on emerging markets last year, going forward for '11 and '12, is your strategy more to enhance distribution of existing products in new markets? Or is it more to enhance the number of new products you can deliver to existing markets?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>It's an interesting question. And it is a bit of both. Clearly, one &#x2013; we are taking advantage of the opportunity to take our existing product line into markets where previously we have not been successful &#x2013; not been successful, we just hadn't yet accomplished what we set out to do. And of course the best example is in China, where our last &#x2013; about 14 months ago we received regional approval from a pricing perspective for four products, products like Nexium I.V., and Seroquel, things that have been around for awhile.</p>
          <p>So we are expanding our existing line but we've made it very clear that we are also looking where it is appropriate, because the branded generics type of strategy is not a global strategy, it's a regional or a country-by-country strategy to acquire some additional products and bring them to the countries where it is appropriate.</p>
          <p>We have gone country-by-country, prioritized the products we might get, might want, gone back out. You've seen we've announced some relationships with some Indian companies to access those products. We're in the process of gearing up to get the dossiers filed in some places, in other places we've filed. So we are bringing some new products to it too. We see some upside to this in our business in the not too distant future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Nicolas Bertrand from Exane BNP Paribas. Just a very quick one on Brilinta further up, sorry. Specifically did you provide any scientific evidence of interval interaction between <mark type="inaudible" /> aspirin and Brilinta? And secondly, on the share buyback. How shall we forecast the share buyback program beyond 2012? Is it fair to assume that it's an ongoing and that it will last, it will continue? Or is it just a one-year program? Thanks.</p>

          <p>All right. Martin, over to you on.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just respond very quick on the first one. No, that was not a part of the questions from the Complete Response Letter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again on the share buyback, we do it one year at a time and we can't forecast it out beyond that. The board takes a look every &#x2013; with our year end results in January as to what the opportunity looks like. Simon, I think, lays out some options and helps them understand what the implications are. But we will doing that on a year-by-year basis so our guidance on the buyback is for 2011.</p>
          <p>I'll take one more question from the floor here and then I'll go to the telephone for one last question because we're over time. Anymore here? Okay. I'll take Justin Smith's question, number one, on the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. It was just a quick question actually on the buyback. I'm still trying to understand this extra $2 billion delta of buy back because clearly a driver that must have been the victory in the Crestor litigation 12 months ago. Given that we've got so much time left on the Crestor patent, I'm just trying to understand why some of that $2 billion delta on the buyback didn't get delivered as dividend? So if I could get some help on that, it'd be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Simon, over to you for that one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we made a decision to undertake $2 billion net share repurchases in 2010 and that was the decision for 2010. We've now made a decision to do net share repurchases of $4 billion in 2011 and that's the 2011 decision. I wouldn't &#x2013; I don't think there's a $2 billion gap there from our perspective. It's one program for '10, the next for '11.</p>

          <p>Well, let me just close by thanking everyone certainly for your attendance, both live as well as by WebEx and by telephone. Remind you that we've got a very strong focus on continuing to deliver a good performance. I think 2010 was an example of that and we look forward to 2011 and the challenges and opportunities that it brings. So thank you all very much.</p>
