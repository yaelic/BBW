          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Ericsson Analyst and Media Conference Call for their Fourth Quarter Report. To view visual aids for this call, please log on to www.ericsson.com/press, or www.ericsson.com/investors. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, replay will be available one hour after today's conference. Mr. Gary Pinkham, Vice President, Investor Relations will now open the call.</p>

          <p>Thank you, operator and hello everyone, and welcome to a New Year and to our conference call for the fourth quarter 2008. With me here in Stockholm is Ericsson's CEO, Carl-Henric Svanberg and Hans Vestberg, the Chief Financial Officer. As you know, we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call today and these statements are based on our current expectations and certain planning assumptions.</p>
          <p>There are risks and uncertainties associated with these planning assumptions and the actual results may be different due to a number of factors. And we encourage you to use caution when considering such forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that out of the way, I would like to hand over to Carl-Henric for comments about our results and plans going forward. Carl-Henric?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gary, and let me be rather brief as some -- several of you may have followed us on the webcast and let me start on an overall comment on the telecom market in 2008.</p>
          <p>We passed a four billion subscription milestone, a pretty amazing number, especially for us working for an all communicating world. It was also a year of a mobile broadband breakthrough, it's no longer concepts and visions, ideas. It is happening and I'm sure that most of you around this call, you are using your BlackBerries or smartphones or laptops, and you're accessing Internet and dealing with your mails wherever you are at every moment whenever you want.</p>
          <p>There is also a -- it's basically becoming standard with built-in modules, via HSPA modules in PCs. But we're also seeing a real convergence trend, now focus on migration of networks to all-IP convergence and it &#x2013; all-IP networks, and it also affecting our way of working.</p>
          <p>The financial crisis is obviously a focus, and I'll get back to that. But we must remember that the long-term positive fundamentals are intact here for where we see this. It is not a telecom crisis, it is a financial slowdown with the effects that it has on the society.</p>
          <p>We just remindedt everybody on the call that Jeffrey Sachs, the special adviser to UN Secretary General, about telephony, where he says that the mobile phone is the single most transformational tool for development in Africa. It is important to remember the huge importance of build-out mobile telephony in all parts of the world. And that only as a first step, then comes the connection to Internet and the importance of that.</p>
          <p>But going into 2008 and how we performed, we reached sales of 208.9 with a growth of 11%. And here it's important to note that the currency rate that have been swinging up and down are basically back where we started, which means that the 11% growth is intact even with the currency changes.</p>
          <p>Operating income of 23.5, which is on par with last year, but last year started with a stronger first half &#x2013; and 2007 started with a stronger first half, weaker autumn. This in 2008, it was a weaker start and a stronger autumn. So we have actually turned the trend and we have a positive trend here through the last half-year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow reached 24 billion. After a lot of hard work we have seen a year of 11% growth, whereas working capital is up 3%. Cash conversion reached 92% and well exceeded our targets of about 70%. We are now at with a cash position at 34.7%. And I think this is a strategic -- amount of strategic importance. In this time of bank crisis and financial crisis it is important that we have the strength and the capabilities for different scenarios here.</p>
          <p>Restructuring charges were announced a year ago with ambitions of reaching 4 billion in savings as 4 billion of charges. We accelerated that as we saw more opportunities throughout the year and we ended up with 6.7 billion.</p>
          <p>The Board is going to propose a dividend to the shareholders meeting of 185. This corresponds to a total dividend of six billion to be compared to last year's eight billion. Basically reflecting the fact that the Ericsson earnings is intact, but we've had a dramatic decline in the contribution from Sony Ericsson. So in terms of all the dividend versus all earnings, it's an unchanged ratio there. Of course, we are all aware of how Sony Ericsson has been affected and the whole handset market is. So I'll come back and talk more about that in a second.</p>
          <p>If we then look at the global economic slowdown, first of all, as I said, this is not a telecom crisis, this is a financial crisis that have turned into an economic slowdown. If we look at our market, operators are in good shape, they have strong financial positions most of them with very, very few exceptions, four, five exceptions.</p>
          <p>The networks are fairly fully loaded and there is strong traffic increase almost everywhere. And, therefore, there are fundamentals in place for continued expansions and investments in networks. And the effect on the mobile network market for therefore not be that significant.</p>
          <p>So far we have hardly seen any effects at all in the mobile network investments. We can see some on the fixed side. People this time are rather abandoning their fixed lines but they keep their mobile phone. However, having said that, when we are experiencing in the world today, the most severe economic decline that we have seen since the thirties and now it's across the world. It seems unreasonable to assume that our industry would be untouched and that is also why we are taking precautious actions here.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the handset market is affected, primarily on the replacement side. So far we haven't seen much of a falling build-up of further subscriptions in the world that continues, but replacement phones sales is declining as people continue to use their existing ones and they don't call us, but they use the existing phones.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the cost reduction in 2008, I can be brief. We wanted to do 4 billion. We ended up doing 6.5 billion. All of this is now basically in place. So we should have full effects from the 1st of January. But more importantly is that we will continue to do more. And let me -- what we will do is basically the same amount of charges, but we will -- this time we believe we will have effects of around 10 billion by next summer, by mid-year 2010, again, 50-50 split between cost of sales and operating expenses.</p>
          <p>But it's important to understand that the underlying rationale for this cost efficiency actions is the fact that we moving towards all-IP technology. This means that we will be able to use or we are able to leverage synergies between different technologies, to work with fewer software platforms, to have a higher degree of hardware re-use. And that means that we can simply put work in a more efficient way. So the savings we are doing were planned anyway to come for the -- during the next several years. We are accelerating it because we want to make sure that we prepare for tougher times here. But it also means that we are not changing our strategy. We are not losing any of our capabilities by doing this.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; it will result in further consolidation of R&amp;D science. We've done that already through the years. We will do more of that. There will be some layoffs, but it will also be fewer temporary workers and consultants. All in all, it will affect some 5000 employees in the world, of which a thousand will be laid off here in Sweden. This is on par with what we did in 2008.</p>
          <p>If we then look at Q4, we had a strong quarter. We ended up at 67 billion. This obviously corresponds to a growth &#x2013; a strong growth of 23%. Not fully half of that were currency effect. More than half was the effect of an higher business activity than we and most, I guess expected. It was not any particular market, not any particular product area, just generally across the board. And even with no currency changes, we would &#x2013; this would have been our strongest growth quarter in the &#x2013; throughout the year.</p>
          <p>And operating income &#x2013; we reached an operating income of 9.2 billion with a capital gain from the Symbian share divestiture offset by the loss in Sony Ericsson. And excluding Sony Ericsson, this number 9 billion for the Ericsson business, it's on par with the highest earnings that we've had before.</p>
          <p>Cash flow was 7 billion, as I talked about, Hans will come back and comment in a minute. I'll just give a couple of comments around the regions before I hand over to Hans. Europe showed a breaking &#x2013; break of trend here, getting back to growth 5%, obviously with some effects from the currency side.</p>
          <p>We are generally seeing a growing demand for &#x2013; for mobile broadband. Services is obviously a bigger part of our sales in Western Europe than anywhere else in the world, close to 50%. And then &#x2013; and even increased focus now on managed services in various forms. We had countries like Germany, Denmark and Italy that are sticking out a little bit stronger than others.</p>
          <p>But you can see on the graph that Q4 was a strong quarter here. If we look at them, the CEMEA region, Central Europe, Middle East Africa sales were up 24%. You've heard us comment on several times that we were seeing an underlying business activity healthy &#x2013; healthy growing and now it translates into sales growth. And you can see on the graphs again that there's a &#x2013; that's an interesting trend there.</p>
          <p>It is about 2G; it's about 3G across the region. Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa all involved in primarily 2G and some 3G projects, but we also had Russia where we have a major 3G rollouts going on.</p>
          <p>If we then go into the Asia Pacific, the strongest growing region in this quarter, 49%, with a lot activity in many markets. For the first time, India for the full year is our largest market and it's also the fastest growing market. Japan and Indonesia are other strong markets. Japan, we've talked about Japan several times, we have had several great years but we were slower in the beginning of the year. Q4 was a strong quarter and Japan is now &#x2013; was now the fifth largest market. Indonesia is another strong growing market here.</p>
          <p>We have also 3G licenses that were issued just a few weeks ago, immediately leading to RFQs and an award process going on. It won't be &#x2013; it won't take long now before the outcome &#x2013; we see the outcome of the Wideband CDMA rolling out for Unicom. And we continue to hope for a good outcome as we've talked about before.</p>
          <p>If you look at Latin America, and you look at the chart, you can see it's a strong &#x2013; the strong growth trend continues there but the comparison got a little bit tougher because Q4, 2007 was strong. Here again, it's a lot about both 2G and 3G, new builds and expansions.</p>
          <p>Mexico and Brazil are obviously still the most important countries. Brazil the biggest but Mexico the one right now, with the strongest growth. We haven't really seen any financial implications yet but obviously Brazil like Indonesia and that there are some markets here where have &#x2013; where we've seen a very strong decline in the local currency that may get some effect here over time. But 3G is well established across the region.</p>
          <p>If we look at North America, we have a 13% sales growth less than we've seen in the previous quarters. But if you look at the chart, you will see that it's more the comparison that gets difficult here, more more challenging. Q4 last year was when the stronger sales started. We &#x2013; it is all driven by a consumer demand for mobile broadband. It is really picking up in US, everybody wants mobility wherever they are now and it's a lot of focus on continued rollouts on HSPA and expansions. Obviously, we have currency effects here as well in US, as the dollar come up as much as it has. So let's go into more details on the financial numbers, Hans.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carl-Henric. Hello, everybody. And I will comment financial figures a little bit more in detail, and I will comment excluding restructuring charges, if I don't state otherwise.</p>
          <p>Sales of SEK 67 billion in the fourth quarter, giving a full year sales of 208.9. The full-year growth is 11%, and as Carl-Henric mentioned the currency impact is very limited on year-to-year basis. In the fourth quarter with growth of 23%, we had an impact of the weakening Swedish krona by the year-end, which has given us some extra growth in the fourth quarter. However, even excluding that that still would be our best quarter, strongest quarter the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Margins, the gross margins is going down to 35.2%, which is a decline with the some 1% compared to the fourth quarter last year. More, I would say a mix issue. We had a lot of completions of projects, especially this new network rollout, and you can see on the acceleration on our network rollout services that has a sequential growth of 61%.</p>
          <p>OpEx continued to come down, and we can see that our cost rationalization program during the year has given effect. However somewhat offset of the currencies in the fourth quarter. All-in-all ending on an operating margin of 13.7% for Ericsson, whereas we have a negative contribution from Sony Ericsson on 0.6 and then a positive contribution for a capital gain from Symbian in those numbers.</p>
          <p>Net income ended at SEK 3.9 billion and that's a number including restructuring charges and also the full contribution from Sony Ericsson, which includes also restructuring charges. So that's coming down to a earnings per share to 1.21.</p>
          <p>If you then look at the cash flow, the cash flow full year ended at SEK 24 billion, which in the fourth quarter we made some SEK 7 billion in the operating cash flow. This has been done through hard work through across all the Company; of course, with a focus we've had cash flow.</p>
          <p>On the working capital side, we have improved our inventory and the trade payables and the trade receivables went up in the fourth quarter. And the main reason is, of course, the volumes at the end of the year, but also the currency exchange rates as we used the closing rates here so, then we get an extra increase on our receivables there. Anyhow that led us to a 92% cash conversion, compared with 66% cash conversion last year.</p>
          <p>If we then just get a little feeling about our financial situation, we added some SEK 10.4 billion in net cash in the last 12 months going up to SEK 34.7 billion in net cash adding some 4.4 in the quarter. And if we also look into our debt structure, which has not changed since the last quarter we reported it but we have some repayments falling due in the second quarter of 3.5, the rest is fairly good spread out -- well, up to 2020 or 2017. All in all, a very balanced situation on the balance sheet, in addition is that we have undrawn credit facilities of some US$2 billion as well.</p>
          <p>So let us look into the three segments, starting in networks, which had a very strong ending on the year, growing some 22%. Of course, there is a dollar effect in the quarter, but full year growth of 10 has very little currency changes. So, still a good year and a good growth for networks.</p>
          <p>We can see that last year we had a record deliveries for GSM and as Carl-Henric mentioned, we have now the two last markets, basically going 3G, that China has decided, India most probably will be taking a final decision in this side of the year. So that's very encouraging.</p>
          <p>But also we had very good progress in our IP broadband portfolio with a lot of first contracts. Of course, based on our Redback and Entrisphere business, we can also say that Redback had a very good fourth quarter continued growth, really very good growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, clear leadership in the softswitch and the blade cluster which is next software -- softswitch or switching technology, which also is very important. All in all, leading to an operating more than 14% and that increase or improvement during the year is, of course, driven by volume, but not only that, also the cost efficiency gains that we've done during the year.</p>
          <p>Multimedia, a growth of 4%, but for comparable units 21% in the fourth quarter. We can see that we had good growth and in both Tandberg Television and revenue management in the fourth quarter. We can see some slowdown impact in EMP, Ericsson Mobile Platforms, due to the global handset market. Other than that we ended on an operating margin of 12%. That includes, of course, then the 0.8 on the sale of the Symbian shares. So that will lead multimedia to the fourth quarter to a slight loss and also for the full year.</p>
          <p>As I've said before, this is a business where we have good growth areas and good profit areas and we have investment areas. And that is panning out to be somewhat a slight loss for the full year.</p>
          <p>Professional Services, the last segment, had a very good quarter growing some 34% in the quarter, and 26 in constant currency; full year growth of 14%, which is good. You can also see that now that we have a sales growth in all the different segments or product areas within Professional Services from managed services, system integration, customer support, education, and consulting.</p>
          <p>Managed Services has definitely been developing good this year. And we believe we are the leader in the managed services industry for the telecoms, ending with 11 new manage services contracts and 250 million subscribers in our operations right now. So that has been growing nicely.</p>
          <p>Finally, we recorded a all-time high operating margin on 18% for the quarter in Professional Services and full year 16. This is of course driven by the high volumes in the fourth quarter, but also of the continuously efficiency gains that we're doing global services, and a favorable mix in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So by that, I hand back to you Carl-Henric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just say before we hand over to Q&amp;A here, Sony Ericssons, in the handset market, is well known, I think. We are seeing declining in demand for handsets, especially replacement phones, and Sony Ericsson is affected with a 23% decline. They are therefore taking pretty strong measures. They are adjusting their OpEx cost structure with some &#x20AC;480 million, which is quite a lot for a company with about 11,000, 10,000 employees.</p>
          <p>We are confident that these are activities that will be very meaningful in the situation that they have. They have continued to bring out great phones to the markets. So they are -- they should be well equipped to drive a good turnaround here, but it's of course a challenging market that they are in right now.</p>
          <p>Finish off here with our focus for 2009, it's quite obvious we are spending more time than ever to be close to our customers and make sure we understand, not only their principal sets and ideas, but how they are actually going to run projects and if there's any sign of any delay or any change in their view. And make sure that we are well-positioned to grab every opportunity that is out there. We are preparing for tougher times, there are uncertainties and it's not easy to predict exactly how things has going to develop here.</p>
          <p>We will have a continued focus on margins and cash generation. I think there are lots of opportunities to take market share here and I don't think it's -- this is the time to buy market share. I think it will come a little bit by itself because there are weaker players out there. We'll continue with tight operational governance and make sure that we are well positioned to take. to grab opportunities as they come along and extend our leadership.</p>
          <p>So, with that I'll hand back to Gary for Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Detailed information is provided in the report and Ericsson's Investor Relations and Media Relations team will be happy to take additional questions and discuss further details with you after the call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Our first question today comes from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead. Mr. Snyder &#x2013; Edward Snyder, your line is open to ask a question.</p>
          <p>We will take our next question from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Recognizing you are withdrawing your full year guidance, can you perhaps give us your thoughts on how we might see seasonality develop for 2009 and also maybe if you could tell us which regions you feel most comfortable with and conversely which regions you are concerned with from a growth point of view as we start the New Year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just remind you of the obvious in our report. We are concluding that fundamentals are in place for continued investments in our space but there are higher uncertainties due to the very dramatic economic decline than we usually see. And that is why we are more focused on presenting how we see things and presenting what we do to make sure that we stay competitive and can defend margins even in a tougher scenario.</p>
          <p>So with that said, there's nothing fundamental that should be out there changing seasonality, but with a larger uncertainty, I guess I'd put in inferences even that part. I don't think that there is any &#x2013; either any particular factors that would make one country more or less attractive than it would normally be.</p>
          <p>One can of course argue that countries with very sharp declining local currencies and operators, some of them depending on how they have structured their balance sheet, could have lesser capacity to invest. I mean that's a clear one. But I think it's also clear that these market tend to be the fast-growing ones, in terms of subscriptions, and everybody knows that this is a competitive game where it's about grabbing market share. So anyone that hesitates on their buildouts will immediately lose to someone else that is more aggressive. So even there, that has its pros and cons. I don't think there's anything in the situation otherwise that would change a normal year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, and Carl-Henric you didn't mention anything about swapping out Nortel's gear. Is there a plan in place for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, absolutely yes, in the sense that if you look at where we were in 2003 with a market share of 30 plus some and there were 12 competitors. Today there are maybe three, four strong ones left, and we have well over forty. All of that is market share growth on -- as a result of companies leaving or contracting here, and Nortel is one of them, so obviously Nortel's market share is gladly picked up. I guess we haven't seen the end of the story of Nortel yet, they're doing Chapter 11, and they may come back in a new format or sold bits and pieces, but certainty that's market share expansion opportunity.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my questions. With regard to managed services, you've had a very strong quarter, and a lot of that of course is currency, but I was wondering how much of that is more of, one of -- consulting related to your, to your rollout contracts, for instance, and how much is more of a recurring nature? And when looking into 2009, we see a lot of operators considering outsourcing to cut costs. So I was wondering how your pipeline looks like, and if you expect a significant number of outsourcing deals for 2009? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regarding everything that is reported in managed services is recurring business so it's nothing else, but if you look at the whole professional services, roughly two-thirds is recurring business and the rest, one-third, is more project -- projects or assignments on system integration together with some solution, or consulting, et cetera. So that's how the structure is. Regarding going into 2009, I tend to agree with Carl-Henric there, there are of course opportunities also in a little bit more uncertain marketplace, going into 2009. For example, managed services could be a very interesting product for operators if they are seeking efficiency gains. So, we are feeling fairly confident. We have a very good solution, and we're a leader in managed services, so if that market will grow in importance, we will be definitely well-positioned.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. My question really relates to competitive pressures and pricing dynamics. You alluded that some of the smaller players are going away. Can you maybe update us on how you see the competitive dynamics changing over the next 12 months? Specifically, on pricing of new contracts -- and maybe, added to that, given all the concerns about credit availability, what the role of credit export agencies will play, or have played, in your market share gains over the last 12 months? And perhaps more importantly for your competitors, particularly the Chinese? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say in general that in tough situations, if there was, which we haven't really said, but even if there was some market decline or a tougher situation, I guess you could on one hand argue that everybody will be more cautious around their margins and protect their bottom line. One could probably also argue that one would protect their volume and make sure that you fill up your business. Now most of us are not sitting with any factors so we don't have that issue. I am not able to say whether it's going to go one or the other way. I would rather say that I don't expect pricing pressure to accelerate here. I think it's also quite important to remember where everybody is in their earnings. We are making some decent margins and we have a pretty solid cash position. I think we're the only one in that position. Everybody else is basically in various forms of debts, with poor margins. So I think we do not foresee any particular increased competitive price pressure here. Maybe Hans should talk us through financing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As you know, we've had a clear policy the last five years on vendor financing that we use our balance sheet to a very little extent, and you can see it on the balance sheet. However, of course we're working with the credit agencies around the world to support our operators, especially of course the Swedish credit agencies. I would say, lately they have been supportive in supporting us in making deals all around the world. So I cannot quantify if that has increased our market share particularly not. But they are important in these times of course when operators are looking into their cash position and a little bit more challenging times ahead. So, yes, we work with the credit agencies as usual.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a quick follow-up. Are you seeing any evidence of your Chinese competitors seeing any form of financing strains in the current environment? Is that maybe causing them to be slightly less aggressive, or offering slightly less favorable payment terms to your potential customers?</p>

          <p>I think in general when, with the sort of growth that they have seen, they are &#x2013; they're not living in any other world than we are, so they will have the same constraints as anybody else. With strong growth they need strong finances. And that is probably not their best game right now. I think they have in, a pretty amazing way, been able to support a lot of growth from a not-too-strong position, and they seem able to do that.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Can you hear me now? So, Carl, you've seen a very strong performance in networks rollouts in Asia. How much of that is an effort, do you think, to use up money budgeted for '08, before, say, the end of the years, versus ongoing spending? And should we expect the new network rollouts in 3G in China, which you alluded to &#x2013; into RFQs, to also carry the lower margins typical of GSM's initial network rollouts? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, every time that you look at project that where there are very large quantities, where there is a lot of footprint being secured and many years of expansions. You can expect the battle to be pretty tough, and that is always the case. There is no difference whether it happens to be China or Latin America, or anywhere else. So, of course, it will be tough margins initially there. But it's a, one of the greater business opportunities for -- since several years, and for several years I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so then in terms of the strong performance in the fourth quarter, so, especially in India and the rest of Asia, is -- do you see that more as ongoing business, or how much of this was to use up budget that'd already been allocated for '08 before the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's -- these are not state-owned companies that have budgets where you can use up money, otherwise it's getting lost. These are private companies or public companies and they are -- and they -- doesn't matter if they spend it now or later. It's the same investment anyway. But there is an element of what you're saying. There is always an element of increasing the short thing and some years it's more, some years it's less. We would probably have expected it to be a little bit less this year, and it wasn't, it was a pretty good year in that sense.</p>

          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. Carl-Henric, on the dividend it seems just looking back a bit that the dividend reduction is higher than Sony Ericsson's contribution has been in the past. So, should we be -- should we read into this, worry about Sony Ericsson going forward, or are you being just careful about your cash heading into 2009 given your uncertain view? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, if I should speak for, just interpret the Board discussion -- I'm part of the Board by the way, but this is not a management decision, obviously, --and eventually it's going to be a shareholder decision. But I think the view is that on one &#x2013; to reflect the fact that our earnings, including Sony Ericsson, has come down and therefore, if our total earnings have gone from 31 to 24, so a reduction &#x2013; similar reduction of dividend seems appropriate. I think also the Board wants to, on one hand, signal that it is good to be cautious in these times. On the other hand not overreact, because we are in a good position. Ericsson is well-positioned to grab opportunities and continue to develop well. When it comes to Sony Ericsson, they have a quite strong financial position. They have net cash of &#x20AC;1.1 billion. So they should be able to deal themselves with even a tougher development -- of course, not for too long, but there's nothing around the corner that we are planning for there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I wanted to follow-up on the questions related to your -- particularly Chinese competitors, and I'm just wondering, obviously there &#x2013; they &#x2013; you would think they'd be subject to the same conditions of difficult repayment or payment terms, et cetera. But I'm wondering how, if any, the impact of currency moves may have affected their competitiveness, particularly in emerging markets where contracts seem to be driven primarily by price? The Yuan obviously has been quite strong, whereas the Swedish Krona has been weak, along with a lot of these emerging market currencies. So, I'm just wondering if you feel like this improves your ability to compete with them specifically on price, or if we haven't seen much change in that respect yet? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they are hard to read at times, and they have done -- I guess, we must just conclude that they've done a good job in building up a position in a rather rapid time. Obviously, it's easier to take a reference project and so when you take a few or your first one. The more you grow your portfolio and your sales, and you have considerations to take left and right too, you cannot sell cheap to one customer to someone else, and so on. They will end up in a more normalized way, I would think. They will, I'm sure, continue to fight hard to grow their position. If you look at currency wise, they are not vending on the strengthening dollar in R&amp;D. Their cost position is -- we are gaining position versus them, that is clear. Exactly how it's going to play out, I think it's hard to say, but I don't think it's working against us right now.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question today comes from Rod Hall of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hans, I just wanted to ask you, as the CFO, if you're finding -- the hedging costs are going up with all of the currency volatility that we've seen recently. And I wonder &#x2013; I know there's a practice at Ericsson to hedge costs on deals you're bidding and there are a lot of deals up for bid at the moment. Do you find it now more difficult to hedge costs moving forward? Do you think you'll be able to hedge less costs than you have been able to in the past, or do you still feel pretty confident that you can lock in margins as you bid these deals going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You're right. We are pretty conservative on the hedging and we have been keeping the same policy for quite a while. There might be some currencies that are a little bit more difficult to hedge in these times especially some emerging market currencies, but other than that I don't see any major challenges with that. Of course it's always a cost, but if you have a policy and you follow that all the time, I think that's the best way to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to follow-up on the margins. Multimedia now this year is a negative margin for the full year and it's been very volatile as you guys know. I wonder if you could you talk to us about how we should be thinking about that going forward? Most of us keep taking the last quarter and then sort of extrapolating and increasing margin off of that, it doesn't really feel like that business is going to necessarily generate any kind of significant positive margin in the next year. Can you just talk to us about how you see that developing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's our smallest area obviously and it's a new area, growth area. And we have &#x2013; as we've said I mean we have the majority of the business' activity is charging service delivery platforms, Tandberg Television and so on. These are areas where we have both strong earnings and strong growth and strong earnings, but then we have the large investment areas and then nature especially maybe on the charging side are pretty large projects and we can have more of that in one quarter, we can have less of that in another quarter. So I can understand that it can be hard for you guys to model it. The important thing for us is of course that we have the strong growth that we have, 20% where we are because this is an investment area. Obviously, it's important to maximize profitability here, but how that swings is more how each quarter gets the combination of the different businesses, how they coincide in each quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That we have been reshaping the multimedia segment quite a lot during the year. I mean enterprise has been divested. We will, during the year 2009, we'll also make the joint venture with ST. But of course we're going to have a little bit smaller unit, that's probably going to be a little bit easier to follow, because we've had a couple of other areas in there. So hopefully it's going to be easier for you to model going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Hans. And then I had &#x2013; just had one last question and I know Carl-Henric you've addressed this to some extent, but I wanted to get more specific about the cuts in R&amp;D personnel. In your Annual Report in 2007 you were talking about something just over 19,000 people in R&amp;D, and you're now talking about this incremental cut to cost which adds 5,000 cuts to the R&amp;D staffing, if I got that right. And then you're talking about that being on par with the original 2008 restructuring program, so that feels like you're reducing your R&amp;D staffing by almost half, I mean down toward maybe 10, 12,000 people and I wonder, I know you're saying that the convergence of networks toward IP and the simplification that comes along with that allows you to make those decreases. But those are pretty &#x2013; those are very extreme decreases in the levels of staffing and I just wondered, if you could get a little bit more specific and talk to us about maybe some of the &#x2013; give us a couple of examples of how this move toward IP is allowing you to get rid of or reduce certain areas of R&amp;D that you previously would have needed to staff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I'm glad you put the question. It is a misunderstanding that the $5,000 primarily in R&amp;D is still positive, primarily in other areas than R&amp;D. And therefore, it's important if others have arrived at the same conclusion. We are not cutting back particularly much on R&amp;D. However, we are and the bulk of the cutbacks is across the Company, in services, in general administration, in sale support and so on, as we simplify our product portfolio. But it does mean that when we arrive in an all-IP technology world, it means that we can reduce software platforms. I mean we are &#x2013; we believe that of the today 15 to 20 R&amp;D platforms we have, we can probably reduce that over time down to say five. When it comes to hardware, if you just think 20 years back, you guys all know this, but if you think 20 years back how every category of people had different computers, they had &#x2013; today whether you are a music composer or whether you are an engineer or whether you're a journalist writing papers you're all sitting with your laptop and it's all different software. So, it's the same thing here, we get less hardware boxes, less hardware software platforms, more reuse of technologies, we're building Redback capabilities into base stations. So every base stations can deal with its IP traffic directly from the base station backwards on an basically an n-router technology board. So this is all what actually takes down the need for both R&amp;D but also for support price through the Company.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you -- since that isn't completely clear, could you talk about how many R&amp;D staff you'd expect to have by the time the program is finished say mid 2010 roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not necessarily want to tell that number in that detail &#x2013; level of detail, because we are in the midst of these activities. And we start by talking about that internally with everybody that is related and unions and so on but eventually of course we will be able to show you how it develops. But I think it is very important to state we are not going to compromise on our technology leadership, that is what have brought our success and that is not the route we're going to go.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi I'd like to ask you a question on mobile broadband and the real impact that have on your business. Can you really confirm because you've been rather coy previously on this, that the growth in Europe in particular is now effectively down to the impact of mobile broadband or are there any other mechanisms in place there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have said already before that, first of all the uptake of mobile broadband is strong. It is strong across the world, of course, this year. It has really taken off in US, it's the same thing in Australia, same thing in Japan, same thing in Europe. We said in the last report, I believe that we have already a pretty good growth with a strong growth actually from operators investing in capacity for 3G for example in Europe. So far it's been offset by a parallel decline on the GSM side. But now we have passed the level of that the 3G build out or expansion sales are now higher than GSM in Europe and therefore the trend should get stronger and stronger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I remember you saying that particularly in the Nordic countries, but also I noted you pointed out some countries where you had, said, strong mobile broadband uptake that actually generated growth. So are there any other countries that you can point to now like the UK, where you see that or, I don't know, Spain maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Spain in particular is probably the worst country in Europe when it comes to economic development. So they are actually somewhat touched also here. But in general, my comment was for the development for Europe as a whole and the countries you are mentioning are sticking out even more so in this development, but this was the case. Remember also but maybe that was not your &#x2013; exactly your question, but we have equally much it's also affecting the transmission part of the network as it is the radio interface.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Carl-Henric you singled out China Unicom's WCDMA buildout as I guess the primary opportunity for Ericsson. And I'd like you to outline your expectations for Ericsson on that Unicom buildout. Specifically, would you be disappointed if Ericsson with anything less than the primary contractor on that Unicom buildout? And also outline whether you think Huawei and ZTE whether they have the capabilities to lead such a huge effort? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's as I said Ericsson sales is extremely distributed around the world in 150 markets. So there are always more exciting projects than others, but it's nothing that no project's ever that sort of makes a huge difference from us however they turn. We have good hopes that we will play a lead role, I'm sure that it could very well be that we could end up on par with Huawei or something here because this is a major Chinese rollout and like it would be if there was a major rollout in Sweden or U.S. or whatever countries there is always better to be a local than to be a foreigner and our position in China is that it's strong and we have actually good hopes that we will continue to hold our position well in China. We have been there since 1892 and so we are foreigners, but we are foreigners with quite a strong local touch.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Great.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we would expect that to be a good margin business over a three, four-year period. I think we can expect it to be a pretty tough initial period. There's no difference for that rollout than for any other major rollout. It's the same thing as it was when we did the American rollouts or other in Australia or whatever, I mean initial rollouts are always rather tough as competition is and follows many, many years of expansion.</p>

I was wondering if you could just give us an update on your progress <mark type="inaudible" /> optics, broadband access, perhaps not data and whether you're happy with the margin structure there and whether you might be inclined to try and look for ways to improve your scale in those business, perhaps using your balance sheet to look at some of the M&amp;A opportunities out there? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Well if you look at how much money that is spent on mobile access, fixed access, transmission and core, those four areas <mark type="inaudible" /> even routers and big routers. In these four areas they are about equally big, and you know that we are the clear world leader in the fields of mobile access with mobile core is almost part of that thing, but there we are strong leaders. We have invested in core, in key technologies to pick up the most important strategic pieces in fixed broadband. For example, GPON where we see that -- this -- a technology shift like that is when you can break in and actually grab a position. I don't think we are particularly interested in expanding other area in fixed access than in the fiber area.</p>
          <p>When it comes to transmission that is where both Marconi and Redback matters, so that they were important there. I would still think that transmission of fixed -- transmission is an area where we could probably grow even stronger and we are always looking at alternatives. We -- the basic strategy is own development and if something comes around maybe we -- we will evaluate. We will always evaluate it. On the router side is where again, Redback came in. I don't think we want to deviate too much from our base strategy with organic growth. That have served as well. That's how we've advanced our position through the years. It could be of interest to look at something, but I don't think that we would be particularly interested in acquiring something and just to restructure and close down activities. That would take away our focus.</p>

          <p>Thanks, a few questions mainly around currency and can you just clarify, did you say that the currency impact was just under half of your sales growth year-on-year? So that would have been I guess, around by 11% or so, and also was there a sequential currency impact, that's my first question? The second one is, what was the bottom line impact, could you give us some quantification on that? And the third is on your receivables, I take the point on exchange rates. But if you look at your receivables as a percentage of sales it's a probably 46% of annual sales now, the highest it's ever been for five years. And I'm wondering whether &#x2013; what checks you've done with respect to the quality of those receivables, whether you're confident you can collect or are you having to in the current credit environment extend more generous terms to your customers? Many thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me see if I can sort out the questions that you have. The first was regarding the currency impact year-over-year, meaning quarter-to-quarter &#x2013; quarter four to quarter four. As I said before it is an impact, significant impact in the fourth quarter less than the half of it. We don't go into an exact number because it becomes a little bit academic as we're moving so much, in the quarter what we're doing or not doing, but it's &#x2013; it's less than half of it. We still had the strongest quarter, the fourth quarter for the year excluding that. That means sequentially also we had with us some improvements on currency as we are using the translation, the average rate on a translation effect and of course we've got with us a little bit from the nine first month into the fourth quarter as well, so that's correct.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter you asked us how the bottom line impact was and we &#x2013; that is basically very small positive sign but nothing else than that, because we have also the hedges going one way and then offset by the translation, was that all questions?</p>
          <p>The receivables, the receivables, yes they are high and as I try to explain in the beginning we had very strong sales by year-end then we also need to remind ourselves that we are using the closing rate on the balance sheet when we close the receivables sides, so that is of course a substantially higher for example dollar-rate than their average rate which we divide with, which giving the high proportion when you do it. That I think is also an important reminder now that we have been running on for example, U.S. dollar which is one of the most important currencies that we have been running on an average rate of <mark type="inaudible" /> for the full year. Now we are going to 2008 then of course we start with a high ending currency here of almost SEK 8 and depending on how it will continue in the quarter that will of course be a big important factor as well when going into the first quarter.</p>

          <p>Let me just add one thing about currencies that I think is important, we -- remember that go back to 2003, we were about 47,000 people, half of which was employed in Sweden. Today, we are 78,000 people and we are some 19,000 in Sweden. 75% of all our employees are outside Sweden, which means that they are principally affected by the same when the currency goes up, it affects cost as well. If you look at our supply chain, we have similar effects on our suppliers, and where we buy component. So, I'm sure this is all clear to you, but it's far from when you have manufacturing in Sweden and selling it in a foreign currency. There is a lot of natural fluctuations also on the cost side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And then just one follow up there just on the currency rate, you translate your revenues are in for the fourth quarter was just a Q4 average or the year-to-date average? How do -- which rate do you actually use, just so that I know how to model this going forward?</p>
