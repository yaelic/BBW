        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you for joining us today for CN's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2009 results. I'd like to remind you again of the comments that have already been made regarding the forward-looking statements. And I'd also like to remind you that today we are going to have four speakers, and I believe that we have at least 24 sell-side analysts that are following us. So after the presentation, we will take questions from those that are listening on the call. But in order to be fair and if you can be ladies and gentlemen, could you please limit the number of questions that you're asking to two, so that we can accommodate everybody that's there.</p>
          <p>With that and to move things along it's my distinct pleasure to introduce Mr. Claude Mongeau, CN's Chief Executive Officer and President of CN. Thank you, Claude.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, thank you, Bob. Thank you and good afternoon everybody. We have an entirely new lineup today for this call, other than Bob actually. Maybe we should call Bob "Mr. Bob", because he's the only one who has been here for three Presidents so far.</p>
          <p>We have Keith Creel, our newly-minted Chief Operating Officer. Keith has been partnering with Hunter in running our operations for a couple of years now, but it is his first call with analysts. We have &#x2013; Keith will report to you on your Q4 railroad performance, which was stellar and in spite of weather challenges and labor disruption in December you will see that we are making inroads on a continual basis to improve our key metrics.</p>
          <p>Our new Chief Marketing Officer, Jean-Jacques Ruest is the star rookie today. He's fresh off the bench and he's full of energy. He also has a very positive story to tell with our volume finally turning the corner in Q4, and his outlook for solid growth and sustained pricing in 2010.</p>
          <p>Luc Jobin, our CFO, I guess, is the veteran today. It's his second call and Luc will give us a full account of our Q4 results and also talk about guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>And then finally, yours truly. You've heard my voice before over the last 10 years actually. But I'm wearing new shoes today. I have big shoes to fill, but I'm excited about the opportunity to lead CN. I have a great organization, a great team, and I'm ready for the challenge.</p>
          <p>Someone asked me recently and maybe he just wanted to put me at ease. But he said, Claude, how do you step in for a legend like Hunter Harrison? And I said to him, well, it is tough but you try to keep your feet on the ground, you focus on protecting the legacy, and you build from there. And that's exactly what we're going to do.</p>
          <p>We have Sean Finn, who today is here to keep us honest, but is also a great member of our team. We have the leadership team of CN and we are ready for the challenge.</p>
          <p>Let me just say a few words in terms of the highlights. We did have a strong fourth quarter finish, solid EPS growth. If I look at it adjusted at C$0.90; this is good performance in spite of the head winds we faced.</p>
          <p>We turned the corner on volume, as I said earlier. And our revenues is down, but it's down only because of fuel surcharge and because of the FX impact. Our volumes actually were essentially flat on a carload basis year-over-year. And we have strong free cash flow, a very good finish to the year with C$790 million. Luc will tell you little bit about some of the details and what helped us to finish the year strongly like this.</p>
          <p>But it is that kind of performance. Earnings, free cash flow, and the confidence we have that we are turning the corner in the economy that gave our Board of Directors the confidence to increase our dividend to 10 from 7%.You recall that's the promise I made to Hunter and so we are delivering on it. And also to announce a share buy-back program of 15 million shares, which we will execute as we deliver our performance and as the economy recovers over the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>So again, a solid finish and a confident team taking the helm going forward. And with this, I will turn it to Keith.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Claude. Newly-minted, I guess, that's a good way of saying it. Sometimes though with the years of working here, I feel truly weathered. Certainly, I look forward to the challenge. I'm excited to be part of this operating team, as well as this executive leadership team you put together. And I think, I know, I'm certain that given the legacy that Hunter has left us and trained us, and taught us over the years; he's served us well. He always told me, as a leader the true legacy is not how the railway runs when you're there, it's how it runs when you're not there. And as you've said, we have got a legacy to protect and we fully intend to do that.</p>
          <p>So, let me start by highlighting some of the operational highlights this fourth quarter. I'll start by saying that proud is an understatement. These results that I'm going to talk about were produced facing some extremely significant headwinds that we dealt with, more specifically, the last six weeks of the quarter. These results are encouraging. I will say that, but they underestimate and they don't truly reflect the true performance of this team and this operating model.</p>
          <p>And why do I say that? Let me quickly cap, highlight the three issues that we faced. We started off towards the end of November, first part of December faced with a significant and unfortunate strike disruption with our engineers here on the Canadian side of the operations, which lasted from the 28th of November to the 2nd of December.</p>
          <p>We engaged early in this process. We spent considerable effort, time and energy planning for this, training our officers who we deployed to go out and effectively run this railway at about 70% of our business during that transition time and during that time. And we were very successful and we did it safely.</p>
          <p>But needless to say, when you take away 1,400 engineers and you're doing the work, with 250 trained officers, as efficient as we are, we're not as efficient as those 1,400 and it did have an impact that are some included in the velocity numbers.</p>
          <p>We came out of that effectively a day after those engineers came back to work. We had about 24 hours to run the railway full force and then we were faced with a very significant and challenging derailment that occurred on the second heaviest corridor we have in our system, which is west of Winnipeg kind of the river stub.</p>
          <p>Pretty significant derailment. When I say significant, about 30 cars, 22 of which were DCs, and if any of you have ever worked a derailment on a main line that's involving DCs, it's a complicated web that you have to manage. We ended up having 16 of those being LPGs. We had our mainline out for five days which is unheard of on this railway. Typically, an outage would be somewhere, a significant outage would be qualified as 24 hours, very significant 36, so five days sustained was a big challenge for the team. We ended up having to blow up about 11 of those cars. So, we can just imagine that trying to put that in context how tough that challenge was. But we came out of that as well, trying to finish the year out very strongly.</p>
          <p>And lo and behold, the fifth day, we were about to open the main line, we had a deep freeze that set in for about 10 days straight that effectively covered Western Canada and across the NOD to Toronto and down to Chicago like a blanket. In fact, we had one night in Edmonton at the airport it was actually made &#x2013; made a world record, being the coldest city on the face of the planet, hitting about 51 degrees negative Fahrenheit, that's ambient temperature, that's not wind chill, that's true temperature outside.</p>
          <p>So you can just imagine the challenge that had on this operating model as well in the face of coming off the work stoppage and then the derailment and then we had this cold. So any one of these would be a challenge for any operating team, but it's the compounding effect of all three of those, some might have thought was insurmountable but we were able to overcome it, effectively executing this operating model that has been tried and true for this company. We have an intense focus on the precision operating model. We were able to effectively close out the year recovering much of what we lost the first half of December and had a very strong 10 days closing out 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about some of the metrics that we produced, train load up 8%, 7805 as you see on the chart there. Effectively, this says the story of balance between your service, your velocity, your asset expense, and your train mile expense. A key enabler here, performance enabler for us, was this long, long &#x2013; it's a long neat fleet plan that we put in effect last year on the NOD that paid off in spades for us and as we deploy or distribute power, we're actually able to run those trains longer, coupled with the strategic investments we made on long sidings on the NOD that to drive a lot of these synergies on the train load side.</p>
          <p>AP plan, we continue to roll that out, which is paying dividends for us in the fourth quarter as well as in 2010 allowing us to run longer, heavier trains in the winter. Effectively trying to run a more normalized operation in winter-like conditions. So that's another key investment that's been strategic in producing some of these train load gains.</p>
          <p>Cars rental per yard switching hour up 21%. Once again, that's simple focus, intense blocking and tackling. You manage inventory, you manage your yard efficiencies. The switching strategy, utilizing the investments we've made with Harrison Yard, Simonton, McMillan be in all those a key sort of satellite centers where we concentrate a lot of our blocking, our switching, and allows us to dry out some of those outlying terminals and save synergies and increase throughput and velocity and cost, which of course that drives the terminal dwell results.</p>
          <p>And as I said, 5% worse for the quarter. But if you think about the impact of those three items that I talked about, that deterioration for the quarter was focused in those last six weeks of the year, more specifically, three very concentrated weeks, effective with the strike through until the last 10 days of the year.</p>
          <p>Locomotive productivity up 7%. Once again increased train load. We're matching our horsepower to available tonnage. We're focusing on locomotives dwells; we developed once again some best in class I think measurement systems that allow some visibility for our operating guys. Effectively tracking our locomotive status, continually updated, so we know where all of our locomotives are, the ones that are being utilized, and the ones that are not being utilized across the system. And then also we implemented and deploy a locomotive management system, which is in platform in SAP, which is working extremely well for us.</p>
          <p>Car velocity up 1% for the quarter. Once again that's adversely impacted to a point by those operating challenges I talked about, but in comparison 16% for the year, so certainly an outstanding performance on the car velocity as well. Train velocity similar story. Story of speed, story of moving the trains 5% for the quarter, 12% for year. That's more the total quality approach we talked about with our QAT teams. And its basic blocking and tackling, locomotive reliability, car failures, inner train issues, drilling into signal problems, line-up accuracy, this is all just blocking and tackling, roll your sleeves up and get at the noise that prevents you from running efficient railroad stuff. So it's not rocket science, it's just disciplined execution.</p>
          <p>Now moving to the operational overview. As we now, right now we're navigating and I think, and I say this with confidence very successfully this important leadership transition here at CN. A lot of people on the outside and a lot of on the inside internally they are looking at us. They want to know what's going to change, what's going to stay the same. And as Claude articulated just a moment ago, we've got a legacy to protect this company. And there is one thing that will not change and that's the focus on executional excellence at this company that we've been known by, that we produce results by based on the foundation of precision railroading.</p>
          <p>This operating model has been a foundation of our success. I myself have been fortunate enough the past 13 years to become a disciple of this model working with Hunter. And I guarantee you the operating team that we have in this company, is woven in our DNA. So that will change as we go forward. We'll continue to measure, we'll continue to execute, we'll continue to improve and tweak our execution, learn from our mistakes and develop and improve our weaknesses.</p>
          <p>Some of the concrete initiatives I'll highlight quickly. Fuel productivity very exciting for this company. We made some pretty significant improvement in our fuel productivity measures last year of about 4%. We're tracking and targeting additional improvements this year. Some of the key things that will help us get there above and beyond what we did in 2009. Got some very exciting technology that we're out testing now in the field from GE Trip Optimizer. Equipping the locomotors, we've got locomotives currently retrofitted now and as we go forward through 2010 and bring home locomotives fourth quarter of '10 and into 2011 in a go forward basis. I fully anticipate and expect those new locomotives will be equipped with this trip plan optimizer which effectively at a target about a 5% fuel improvement.</p>
          <p>Train speed continued focus. We'll continue to work on our pinch points. I'll say anecdotally, some of that &#x2013; those encouraging metrics I talked about in that first quarter performance were breaking records that we set in the past on train speed. Train speed effectively hits every operating metric we have. It allows us to turn those assets, run more tonnage, fewer locomotives, fewer cars and as the progress made last year has continued into 2010 and fully anticipate us to continue to gain momentum there.</p>
          <p>Mechanical productivity, some exciting initiatives there, work center consolidation. As we've grown the footprint of this company through acquisitions, we are going to take the time in 2010 to create the right footprint in our shop utilization where we have our mechanical folks and we are doing our work.</p>
          <p>Today, that's another exciting piece for us. We have implemented that well. On the safety standpoint I can tell you that things are going extremely well specific to the J. Year-over-year as I look at the number this morning, it's about a 30% improvement from our FRA main track, it's for all FRA accidents, which is very significant progress. It's very encouraging. Big year for us on the infrastructure side converting some of the connections that we've got against converted to fully implement and utilize that railway. So that's how looking very favorable for us as well.</p>
          <p>And finally on the safety side overall for the system; once again, we at this railroad build our operating model on a foundation of a safe railway. Safety is a key performance enabler. If we don't run a safe railway, we're not going to run a fluid railway; we're not going to have an ability to run a precision operating model.</p>
          <p>2009, we produced some pretty significant gains, about a 30% year-over-year improvement on main track derailments. That's not enough though; we are not satisfied. We finished the year out about second among class one with our FRA accident ratios. It's our challenge, my challenge this operating team and our objective to finish 2010, top of class in that regard.</p>
          <p>We'll do that through our continued basic plant renewal RFB. Our rail flaw detection will continue to increase, track geometry. Those metrics and based all of the foundation on the safety culture of this company.</p>
          <p>So with that, I've probably gone a little bit over my allotted time, but as I know and I trust you can tell, I'm very passionate about this business, this company, this team, this equipment, our plans, and most importantly the people that are going to make this thing happen as they have in the past and will produce in spades going forward.</p>
          <p>I'll turn it over now to J.J.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, Keith, thank you. And before I start the review, there's three special people I would like to thank here today. Claude, for putting his confidence in me. Hunter Harrison, for teaching me the intricacy of rail operation and especially namely the seven months of my boots on the ground during my railroad MBA from coast to coast. And Jim, Jim Foote who I worked for, worked with, and worked with pride since 1997. So Jim and Hunter if you are listening in, I salute you both.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let's turn to the revenue result, the fourth quarter result of 2009. The revenue decreased 14%, but 8% on an exchange adjusted basis. And I'd like to give a layer of revenue on an exchange adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>First, the volume. We've seen sequential improvement in our car loan volume since the second quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter of 2009 was compared to 2008 was a flat quarter. But it was different kind of flat, meaning that in fourth quarter 2008, we were downward spiral and as we got through Christmas things were looking pretty bleak. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we were in a steady mild, but steady improvement and things were looking pretty good again in the year, especially after the labor disruption that Keith referred to and the cold snap and a very nice finish that we have.</p>
          <p>Fuel surcharge brought down the revenue by a significant 7%, for the fuel surcharge coverage and program is working very well and doing what it's supposed to do when it comes to fluctuation of price of oil. Same store price, very important for performance, was in the range of 4% for the quarter, so kudos was to our sales force for negotiating service for market price with our customers.</p>
          <p>One notable factor I'd like to bring to attention, as you would remember that the Canadian government actually adjusted down the Canadian grain cap last summer and we did make that price reduction for over &#x2013; as of October 1 of 2009 in our pricing program and that'll be the case after July 2010 at which time the grain cap revenue will start to go back the other way on a positive side. The remaining is business mix and other revenue.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the segmentation of our book of business. Merchandise overall remains stable. We've seen improvement in petroleum based car load, namely, heavy fuel oil. We've been moving quite a few jet fuel tank cars around. We've seen continued shares of the market share gain in plastics, namely polyethylene, which is a poly sensitive product which is nice to see, coming back of that commodities, which and those have offset lower operating rate in the industrial chemical plants during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>However, as you have seen the fourth quarter result for the chemical companies are showing that they're having better days in their own business environment, so that bodes well.</p>
          <p>The level of the steel production in North America has improved. It has now reached 65% operating level in the third week of January. And that drove our iron ore business and car loads in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The forest products was challenged by the economy condition. Lumber, panel, and paper did suffer. However, our wood pulp business continued to show sequential volume improvement to both our North American and Chinese destination. Our bulk business is doing pretty good and I like the outlook of what I see entering into this year.</p>
          <p>Coal volume was higher on the volume year-over-year basis. During the quarter, the Chinese steel mills have increased our Canadian net coal export via the three west coast coal terminals that we serve. And as a reminder, China was 44% of the world steel market in 2009.</p>
          <p>Our coal mine in Canada running strong and the new coal mine opened last fall. This was offset by reduced steam coal volume in the U.S. Electricity production in the U.S. was reported down. Utility had high stockpile on hand and natural gas was abundant and affordable.</p>
          <p>Other bright spots are the strong Canadian export program for grain. We also had a strong internal; carload growth, which &#x2013; and that was offset partly by the slow U.S. corn export program in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Recent improvement in the potash carload &#x2013; in our potash carload to the U.S., helped to partly recover what would have been otherwise a very anemic fertilizer quarter for last year.</p>
          <p>Add to more volume our Prince Rupert is alive and strong. The port of Prince Rupert, the volume is up. And the product continued you to prove itself in the marketplace. This was offset in part by the year-over-year decline in and out of the Port of Vancouver and for an export. On the East Coast, it's been good to see the container export growing out of Halifax, especially on the back of export out of Halifax to overseas country and that's been driving the positive numbers. Domestic volume have remained stable.</p>
          <p>Automotive has seen improvement in the fourth quarter. We've seen the Asian import over Vancouver as well as European import over our own facility in Halifax going up. As well as we've also production level in 2008 &#x2013; versus 2008 in the North American assembly plants that we serve or physically serve.</p>
          <p>We got to our next slide and look at our 2010 revenue outlook. What we see in general is a modest recovery in our volume and our carload. However, I like what I see looking the last three weeks and all of you looking at our carload on a weekly basis. Merchandise will improve. What I feel and what I see shows that it's an improved sentiment in manufacturing sector.</p>
          <p>We see a turnaround in the auto production, which is helpful to our automotive carloads, fuel carloads and chemical carloads. We foresee improvement in the housing starts, which would bode well for number of carload panel, chemical and overseas. And we also have seen already improvement in steel operating rate, even though a steady, a small but steady, which bodes well for our production. All of that support our first mile and last mile initiative, which is also related to support our growth on the merchandise sector.</p>
          <p>The bulk side looks pretty good and I like what I see for the first quarter. The Canadian volume for Canadian grain looks good and the Canadian Wheat Board has a record program for the season 2009/2010 at 18.7 million tons. Mike Cory and his team or Senior VP of operations in Western Canada has also put in place a new grain schedule service program for Canadian export grain which are improving both the customer satisfaction and our ability to gain some more volume.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. in our draw territory, which is Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, the corn production is up 4 to 5% from last year. So that should be helpful. Again, in the U.S. draw territory the soya crop is 4% ahead of last year.</p>
          <p>Our thermal coal is expected to remain soft in the first half and maybe all of 2010, because of stock pile level ability already at a conformable level. The Canadian coal which is all export will run at or near the limit of the capacity of the mine and that showed we are doing very well on that front. Potash, which is case of CN is a North American story, is improving and 2010 will definitely be a better year for our fertilizer business.</p>
          <p>Intermodal volume will be trending up. The Prince Rupert story remains strong and robust and the proven product that we have in this marketplace for the last two year is attracting the interest of the receiver, the people who buy the product, meanings the retailer.</p>
          <p>We should show some sequential improvement in and out of the Port of Vancouver. And we are looking to make use, good use of the new delta port which was opened this month. Our door to door domestic retail program is taking hold with the manufacturing sector, as well as taking hold with the consumer retailer.</p>
          <p>All in all, when you put all of this together, we're looking for high single-digit volume growth in 2009 and sustained pricing discipline. Luc?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, J.J. Well, as Claude indicated earlier, we achieved some outstanding quarterly results all around in what was a very challenging environment in this last quarter. Financially this translated into a reported EPS of C$1.23 which was up 2% versus 2008.</p>
          <p>There were two noteworthy items. One was the sale of our new market sub to the transit rail in Toronto Metrolinx, which contributed C$0.12 to the EPS on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we had the benefit of a deferred income tax recovery coming from the Ontario Province adjusting their corporate tax rates going forward. And that have brought us C$0.21 of favorable EPS.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, our EPS came in at C$0.90 which was 20% lower than 2008. Now, I need to point out as I did in our last conference call that we knew going into the fourth quarter that we had a couple of major headwinds that we were facing.</p>
          <p>And looking at the quarter 2008 fourth quarter to &#x2013; the fourth quarter of 2009 the two items were the foreign exchange which actually was a headwind of C$0.07 for us as the Canadian dollar averaged around $0.83 in 2008 versus $0.95 in the last quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>The other and even more significant item was the fuel lag. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of 2008, there was a very significant drop in the price of oil. And the WTI actually shot down from $118 all the way to $59. And that provided us back then with a favorable lag. This year obviously, we were competing against that and the WTI was actually going up from 68 to 76 during the quarter.</p>
          <p>So that combined those two elements actually amounted to about C$0.25 of EPS headwinds which excluding those items actually our adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2009 would have been up a couple of percentage points.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses, we continue to see some very solid cost management in the fourth quarter. Our expenses came in at 1.2 billion, which was down &#x2013; which was actually 5% lower than our 2008 exchange adjusted comparison. Our labor expense was impacted by a much higher stock-based compensation expense to the tune of about C$50 million. As our stock was down significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 to about C$6 a share, where as in the fourth quarter of 2009 it was actually up over C$4. So a net change of over C$10. Excluding this item, our labor expense was actually lower than in 2008 by about 3%, as we reduce our workforce by about 7% in the fourth quarter, excluding obviously the acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Our T&amp;E personnel was reduced in the fourth quarter by about 10% or actually over 10%. And we were able to redeploy many of these people within the organization, thanks to our contract insourcing initiatives.</p>
          <p>On the fuel category standpoint, we had much lower costs by about 18% on an FX adjusted basis. A good chunk of that was due to volume and price to the tune of about C$30 million. But I think one noteworthy item was the fact that our fuel productivity was up a full 7% during the fourth quarter and that contributed around C$20 million to our operating income performance. Very good performance obviously from Keith and his team on that front.</p>
          <p>Casualty and other, our expenses came in some C$20 million lower than last year, mostly due to lower legal claims and adjustment to our U.S. liabilities in this particular area.</p>
          <p>I must point out that these achievements are quite exceptional, and Keith and his entire operations team did a very impressive job, very impressive performance. The cost management that we see in these results were achieved while we were dealing with labor and network disruption, Keith and J.J. were actually working hand-in-hand to maintain service level while this was going on.</p>
          <p>Our carloads were growing by 4% sequentially. And at the same time, we were delivering continued improvement in our productivity in the fourth quarter. As Keith pointed out, our train miles were up 8%; our yard productivity was up by a full 21%, while train velocity was also up 5%. Very impressive indeed.</p>
          <p>Turning over to our full year free cash flow. We had an excellent performance in 2009. We generated C$790 million of free cash flow, which was essentially flat to our performance in 2008. This obviously was helped by some C$230 million of asset sales relating to the new market and western subs that we sold during the course of the year.</p>
          <p>We fulfilled our capital expenditure program, which was nearly 1.5 billion. And the number that you'll see on the slide is actually the cash portion; we also had some C$75 million of capital leases.</p>
          <p>One great performance was actually our DSO, which came in at 21 days at the end of 2009. And that compared to about 27 days at the end of 2008. Clearly, an outstanding performance in terms of managing our receivables.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position stood at C$6.1 billion at the end of the year, which was a full 1.4 billion lower than last year. This performance was due to some obviously repayment of some debt maturity during the course of the year, very strong cash generation, and a higher Canada dollar at the close of the year. We have obviously, as you can see from the slide, excellent debt coverage ratios, in fact, better &#x2013; much better than our targets. And so, we start 2010 with a very strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Turning to our 2010 financial outlook, a couple of comments of context. First, we continue to see a gradual economic recovery unfolding. Several of our market sectors appear to have bottomed out. And we have been witnessing some sequential growth over the last couple of quarters. As J.J. also indicated, we continue to see some positive signs in 2010. J.J. also pointed out that we're looking for high single-digit growth in our carloads in 2010 and a continuation of our solid pricing policy of our around 4%.</p>
          <p>Now we're still facing a few head winds, one of which is the strength of the Canadian dollar. Last year, you may recall the average Canadian dollar was around $0.88, but it did start as low as $0.80 in the beginning of the year in the first quarter of 2009. So something to keep an eye on.</p>
          <p>Also, I need to bring your attention to the fact that we will be having some higher depreciation and casualty expenses in 2010, probably a number of around $100 million for those two items combined. In spite of that however, we're pleased to provide guidance for 2010. We are aiming for double-digit EPS growth in 2010 from the adjusted EPS base of 3.24, which was achieved in 2009. Now also just keeping in mind the FX &#x2013; the foreign exchange headwind that I described, this guidance would be solid double-digit growth, if it wasn't for the headwind. We're also targeting for free cash flow to be in the order of C$700 million. Very solid, in fact it's, if you exclude the asset sales that were &#x2013; that occurred in 2009, this is a full 25% increase.</p>
          <p>So we are keeping to our strong shareholder value focus. As you can see from this outlook, we're confident in our business model and this team's ability to leverage the gradual economic recovery. Our 2010 capital investment program will be a 1.5 billion. The dividend increase of 7%, the stock buy-back program, all are consistent with this view.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will turn it back over to you, Claude.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luc. Thank you, Keith and J.J. As you can see, the theme is clicking. I'm very, very pleased with the way we were able to finish the fourth quarter of 2009. We have turned the corner in the last part of that quarter in terms of year-over-year growth, and that's continuing into January. We have sequentially growth, we have had sequential improvement in operating metrics despite the sequentially growth, which bodes well to our ability to maintain velocity and fluidity into next year and accommodate the growth at low incremental cost.</p>
          <p>And we've also had improved earnings, as Luc explained, if you exclude some of the headwinds and you focus on our core operating rhythms. This positions us very, very well for 2010; if the economy stays on track, we should be able to grow earnings and deliver solid free cash flow. And our focus is going to be on doing exactly that.</p>
          <p>I feel pretty good about the team. We have a great franchise. I like the leadership team that I've just assembled. But more than anything, I like the 22,000 railroaders, which are making this railroad click day in and day out. At the end of the day, it's not the logo, which is the beautiful one, it's not the color of our locomotives, it's the strength of this team and our ability to deliver results in good and bad times. We are going to be focusing, as Keith mentioned, on our operational excellence. There is nothing that will change in that regard.</p>
          <p>Our focus, our foundation, is on our ability to deliver. But we will also be focusing on new growth opportunities. We are hopeful, as I said, that this economy will gain traction. And with that, and our initiatives to improve service, the focus on first mile, last mile, that J.J. has talked about, our ability to monitor and act on the opportunities that are in front of us, will give us opportunities in terms of volume growth.</p>
          <p>And we will do it going forward with a view to align ourselves with our customers and key stakeholders. We are determined to take our game to the next level. I'm very confident. We have challenge, but we are geared up to seize on opportunity.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will open for question-and-answers.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to get a sense of &#x2013; I think your view on volumes and pricing with respect to that. I think J.J. had mentioned kind of high single digit volumes. And I'm not sure if he explicitly mentioned a kind of a target base rate increase in 2010. But I wanted to get a sense of what you expect for base pricing, and given that pretty good volume growth that you're seeing, is it possible that you do better on pricing than you would have done 2009 and the markets a little tighter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The market pricing that we forecast for 2010 is 4% range type price increase on a same store basis. And as I explained we have one headwind, the Canadian wheat &#x2013; the Canadian regulated grain, which go from October to August, and after that, we'll see how that goes. But we're running with a 4% range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And does the 4% include the headwind from Canadian Grain? Or is it 4%, but then it's going to be less because of the Canadian Grain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It includes the Canadian Grain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on your, I guess, outlook for the double-digit earnings growth, what kind of headwinds do you except in terms of incentive comp and some other things. I guess you mentioned a few of that expense side headwinds, but what kind of headwind do you have in terms of incentive comp or pension coming back? And is there some element of conservatism in the guidance that you're giving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of pension, we foresee pretty well the same level as we did last year. I mean, again, it's an area that is evolving and we're going to wait and see what the new rules are and where the discount rates are going go. But generally speaking, it would be same level. On stock based compensation, I guess as a metric when you've got about four or C$5 a share of movement, that translates roughly into about a penny or a penny and a half in terms of EPS impact. So obviously, there is some of that that is in the plan.</p>
          <p>And I think generally speaking, I mean, our plan is solid. It does look to the recovery. And it does assume that obviously, we'll be maintaining our productivity and all of the great results that we have achieved on an operational dimension during the course of the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, to be clear, as Luc said, those are some of the key headwinds, but the two big ones are the casualty claims, which was a recovery in 2009 of 60 million. And this C$30 million of increased depreciation that we will face. Right there, you have the 100 million of headwind, but we have enough momentum on the top line and enough momentum on the productivity to offset that and grow our earnings in line with the guidance we just gave.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Just, Keith, you did a great job of explaining those three issues, and obviously they are very substantial, but I'm wondering if you might be able to give us a sense of, or if you could quantify what those issues were in the quarter? And specifically around on the strike, if there was any &#x2013; if there's going to be any follow-on impact from perhaps any lost business either to CP or to the trucks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me say this, as far as quantifying the numbers, that's a pretty slippery slope. I am not concerned that there'll be any lost business to CP or to the trucks. I think we did a phenomenal job. If you talk to some of our key customers, we surpassed their expectations; we surpassed our own expectations, to be quite frank. With the preparation, with the execution of these officers, what they were able to do is second to none, and I'm not concerned about that at all. As far as the financial impact, I'd lean to Luc to bring that up and quantify that as much as he feels is appropriate, but suffice it to say, in my mind, given the potential that was there, it was nil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, just to add to Keith's comment, and I think, the team did an outstanding job of containing the impact. Approximately C$10 million or so of it on our operating income was essentially what we see as the impact of the strike, which is very commendable given the circumstances. So it's a great job.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and as it relates to truck, I mean, what we lost to truck was just temporary was just for that period of time, and in fact we did some recoveries in truck ourselves and it's also to make sure that we were doing it in service work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In actual fact, we lost very, very little business in the end, and we recovered most of the business at the end of the day, the 10 million is the net of five days, it's quite remarkable that we were able to keep it at that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'll say this, Walter, as well. Like any other unfortunate work stoppage, which we've had in this company or any company has, when you have to go out and do these things yourself day in and day out, you identify opportunities. So it maybe some short-term pain, but from a long term standpoint certainly develops new and improved ways to be more efficient, more productive on a go forward basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Those were some pretty big issues. Congratulations on dealing with those. The second question I have now is on the guidance of the double digits, I guess. Double-digit is quite a large range, when you think about it. Now you mentioned there are some headwinds that stop you from solid double-digit so I am trying to get, to get a sense there, are we talking 10 to 15% growth? Is that where you want us to sort of get our heads around here for your earnings growth for 2010 or are we somewhere higher than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Walter, you have to listen to Luc carefully, he said that he's aiming for double digits, and I support that. That's what we have to face with the exchange that we face and with some of the headwinds that we talked about. Aiming for double digits EPS growth with the assumptions we have communicated is the right one. Now, if you exclude the FX headwinds, then we will be solidly double-digit, and that's consistent with the gradual recovery that we see in front of us, and our abilities to accommodate that business at low incremental cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the fuel, at current levels here, you have you're calling for high single-digit carload growth and pricing of around 4%. So somewhere in the range of 10 to 12% on that alone. If fuel stayed at current levels, what do you think the fuel surcharge mechanism could throw on the top line on top of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, our fuel surcharge program is basically recover, if you track our costs to revenue over time, they kind of match one another. I don't really have specific numbers to tie in on a dollar wise WTI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the key is that &#x2013; the key to monitor is really the lag effect. And from where we are at the moment, the fuel price has been hovering around $75. We see it in WTI terms in the range of 75 to 80 bucks. If that's the case, then we'll have a very minimal headwind from a fuel lag standpoint. But it's kind of a crap shoot to monitor because you know that lag goes up and down from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's difficult to track, for sure, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. But big picture it's not a big factor if it stays within the band that we're assuming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to remind me, how much of your fuel surcharge cover the on-highway diesel versus WTI? Are you pretty much covered there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little more on the highway diesel side than WTI. Over time, we've migrated and shift from WTI to highway diesel. So it's probably 60% highway diesel, 40% WTI, that type of range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there an ongoing effort to get that trued up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But I think we're probably in the range right now that we would like to be. That was a big effort last year and the year before. There's a range that we have right now. It's probably the range that we're comfortable with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my last question, just on the utilization, Claude, where do you think you are on the utilization level? And I guess to your previous question, a couple of things is, if the utilization starts to tighten up, can you get more than the 4%? And similarly, on the cost side, at what point do you have to start layering cost back on? Not looking for specific numbers, but just conceptually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're ready to accommodate the business that's in front of us. We obviously have a lot of locomotive power that's available to us. We have a lot of car fleet available. You might have a few car types to deal with as the business comes back. But really in terms of our ability to accommodate growth, we have a lot of capacity, and we're preparing ourselves to accommodate the business and hopefully gain some market share as our customers ramp up.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing, a lot of the pricing that J.J. is targeting is already kind of baked in. Those are the agreements that we have been negotiating throughout the year. And we've kept a consistent approach to manage our pricing year-over-year in that 4% range, a little bit more in the recent years and more like 4% this year, and that includes the impact of the grain, regulated grain escalation down this year. So we have that consistent approach. It's been tried and true, and that's what we're going to continue to price our services with a view to getting the value that we offer to our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your book of business? How much is covered by the 4% for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have about 80% of our pricing, if you wish, which is already done for the year. So there's a good part which is done already. Obviously, a very high percent for the first quarter, and declining toward the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Typically our agreement, either tariffs like would be in six months or contract of one year, contract of two years. So they give you the band as to how much &#x2013; how far out we price. We tend to go for a shorter agreement, as arose what we did in the past, and right now we're about 80% done for this year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Claude, question for you, as it relates to the U.S. regulatory environment. I was wondering if you could just give us a refresher in terms of how much of your business would be covered by changes in the U.S. regulatory environment. I thought it was, if I remember certainly; correctly me something closer to a third, certainly the minority. But if you could give us the directional bogie there? And then just give us a sense in terms of your reaction in terms of what you've seen, with what's been proposed. Is it relatively benign? Do you need to see more, what are the areas of sensitivity you have or interest in and as that legislation progresses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Matt, to your first question, our overall business in the U.S., that is domestic U.S., would be closer to 20% overall and a lot of that is really not impacted by the new regulations, because we do have a network that is in many respects highly competitive. We have the Mississippi River. We have &#x2013; we're right there in the middle of mid-America. So we don't have some of the concentration of shippers that are so called captive on our U.S. franchise. More broadly, if you ask me about what we're seeing, I would react in the following way. And I have the same view whether it's Canada or U.S.</p>
          <p>We've been going through a tough time with this recent downturn. And in tough times, it's expected that customers and shippers all are going to looking for every angle they can find to improve their leverage and negotiations. And some of it is fair game. Some of it though you have to step back and ask yourself, is it good public policy for the long term?</p>
          <p>It's not so much the details of the new regulation. It's more the risk of mindset and not going in the right direction. I have a firm view that the railroad industry in North America is on a solid footing. It is a highly capital intensive business. It is fully 100% privately funded. And there's just no other way about it.</p>
          <p>If a market based system that allows the railroads to earn a decedent return is the key to what got us here, it is even more the key to what will we need going forward. Railroads are sustainably; from an environmental standpoint they are far superior to other modes. We have an ability to grow and serve our customers on both sides of the border. And that's the investment that's required to do so is dependent on our ability to earn a decent return. And so, I'm hopeful that policy makers will focus on the big picture and if there are tweaks that are required to improve the safeguards in the U.S. for instance in terms of regulatory measures, that's fine. But let's make sure that we don't go overboard and start to cloud the picture and move away from the market based system that got us to where we are.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Understand. Thank you for that. My second last question is if I could perhaps ask of Luc, if I think about your guidance with carloadings volumes are up high single-digit pricing 4%; that alone would get you to the target range of double-digits. You articulated quite clearly some of the headwinds you face with FX. I was wondering if you can help us, that carloading or that volume figure-From a mix perspective, might RTMs come in at half of that level, will RTM has come in at a comparable level. CN's always done a great job of articulating the difference between relying too heavily on carloads and focusing more on economic activity in RTMs. I was wondering, if you could just help me reconcile your volume patterns to what RTMs might look like. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to comment specifically on RTMs. But maybe I can speak a little bit to some of the assumptions that underpin our guidance in terms of economic recovery. I mean, for instance, one of the things that we're looking at is that North American progress in terms of industrial production. Somewhere in the 3 to 4% range. We're looking at things that influence our business such as U.S. housing starts where we are looking at somewhere around 750,000 units in 2010. Another metrics that we look at and we base our plans on are U.S. motor vehicle sales. And that we see roughly 11.5 million units.</p>
          <p>We're also thinking that the grain crop for the Canadian side will be pretty well in line with the five year &#x2013; last five year average. And we look at the good carryover into -- from 2009 into this year. So those are more specifically linked to the businesses and to the areas that drive our carloads and our RTMs. So I mean, for us at this point, these are the underpinnings and I don't really have more to say in terms of specifically RTMs versus carloads at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good afternoon. Wondered if I could just ask a question on your deployment of distributed power. If you could just give us a sense of where you ended the year in terms of the percentage of your, I believe it's DTU and where you hope to be about the end of 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Currently, now about 25, 26% end of the year DTU equipped. We're moving; that's 270 total locomotives. By the end of 2010, we be at just over 400. And then on a go forward basis, everything that we effectively transition out and bring in online, as well as anything where it's economically feasible to convert locomotives. We'll continue to do that with an eye to work towards I would say an operating model if we can get about 75% of our locomotives, mainline locomotives, equipped DT, we would not have a challenge matching it a contest to effectively utilize that technology. To get that all done, I think we're looking at into 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second and last question, just on the EJ&amp;E. I guess the STD has announced that they are going to investigate some of the community concerns. I was just wondering to what extent that's a nuisance in terms of your ability to operate that line. And beyond that, just what do you think you can do with that property in 2010? What further integration progress could be made?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quite frankly, I don't see it as a nuisance. I think if anything, it's going to be something that will help us as they audit. Effectively they are just checking to see if we're doing what we said we were going to do with the transition, which is a fair game in my mind.</p>
          <p>And certainly we have a vigilance operating that railroad. We clearly understand that we're under a microscope. We're people of our words; we intend to fulfill every commitment that we've made and in fact where it's speeding on those commitments.</p>
          <p>So that's a matter of concern. We're going to work closely with the communities as we have. We're up to 21 effective voluntary mitigation agreements of the 31 or 32, that's a very substantial portion. Very pleased there.</p>
          <p>So not too concerned about that piece. As we go forward, what we're going to do in 2010, converting we got effectively now the first big piece of interchange and the Chicago corridor converted. We did effectively deliver all CFX traffic to the belt. We're still delivering CFX traffic to the belt but not at CN's expense and CSX effectively is delivering all of our interchange to Kirk Yard, switching that traffic and effectively putting it into our system. So already developing some operating synergies and savings associated with that transaction.</p>
          <p>As we continue the investments, putting these connections on. We certainly have some boundaries of what we can move around the line in line with our environmental assessment. We do not anticipate violating that at all. The business level is nowhere close to where we getting concern with that. We'll continue to march through our plan to shut down eventually or rationalize Markham and put the switching into Kirk. So we're going to invest in dollars as we go forward building physical plant in Kirk to handle that. And this year specifically in 2010, we're working with those other farm line carriers in the Chicago market to shift interchange from inside the ark so to speak to some of those connecting carriers on the outside which will drive some additional operating synergies and speed up velocity and improve throughput through the Chicago corridor for not just CN, but for those foreign lines.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Claude, I'm wondering if you can outline for us a little bit some of the targets that the Board has set for the management incentive comp this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our targets are in line with the guidance that we're providing you. As you know, we have five core metrics. First and foremost revenue, then operating income, EPS, the free cash flow, and ROI. And our target if we don't deliver on these &#x2013; on this guidance, we don't get paid a big bonus. And we have every intention to hopefully to have a first good year and pay a bonus to the management employees who have done a great work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Claude, I think I remember last year, you'd you mentioned to me that you're going to need to find to get your cash flow targets for '09, you're going to need to find some things to do on the non-operating side and you did, is that still the case this year because the &#x2013; just the headline cash flow number as a target that you gave us would be below. So do you have more assets to sell the hit that, or how will that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, what the 700 million is an aggressive target. If you take into account and look at the details, we did make basically C$200 million worth of sales here a quarter or during the year. And we are always looking to monetize underutilized assets, but you cannot necessarily count on them ahead of time.  We are dependent on other parties to step up to the plate, and so if we can deliver C$700 million following a year where we have this lines sales that would be strong performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. What is your view on acquisitions? We know what Hunter was sort of saying. I'm curious what you're thoughts are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Hunter and I were working together for last 10 years on acquisition. So whatever you heard from Hunter, I share his view. I believe that our focus is on driving organic growth, leveraging the franchise that we've build. And we are always looking for tuck-in niche acquisitions, if they become available. But that's not the way we plan on our earnings. We drive the business that we have. And we are disciplined in monitoring the opportunities. And if they come about, the one thing you can count on is we know how to integrate them and get the value for our customers and for our shareholders. But we don't put ourselves on the clock.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good afternoon, I just wanted to clarify a couple things on the casualty side. Claude, I want to make sure what you're saying is that there was a C$60 million impact that you're fighting against in 2009. Or are you saying that suggesting that the costs themselves are going to go up in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Ken, as Luc explained during the year, we have recoveries on our asbestos and occupational disease claims to the tune during the year of 60 million. So that this is a fairly large recovery, most of it in Q3 and then some of it in Q4. And we are continuing to make good progress. Our safety statistics are improving. We are planning to continue to reduce casualty claims. But the probability of having another C$60 million recovery is not there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So should we look at that as being kind of a C$90 million run rate for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably more in the neighborhood of C$100 million run rate, really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Claude. And then my last question is on the EL I just want to understand the mix. You ran through a bunch of numbers there, and if we got pure pricing of 4%, the fuel surcharge was down 7%, the currency was 6%. The overall average revenue per carload was down 15. So that leaves a large negative impact from mix. Am I reading that right, kind of in the mid-teens, a negative impact from mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's mix and other revenue. But we have a couple of other &#x2013; a bit of business for example, we were moving iron ore at the dock and vessel and the like. So a combination of mix, a combination of the other line of business that we have, which are beyond the veil of activity of serving the first mile and last mile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is this largely impacted by things like short haul coal coming online from the new contract and mix issues like that. Are there any large impact issues like that that you can highlight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing to do with coal itself. If you look at our book of business in the fourth quarter 2008, we had a drastic move in some business going down like <mark type="inaudible" /> and iron ore, which went down the tube very quickly, while some other segments held up. And the book of business in the fourth quarter 2009 was quite different, because you had some industries recovering and some industries going down. So when you look at our book of business for these two quarters, because one was spiraling down and one was recovering. There's a lot of the so called non-same store business that you can't otherwise in a normal steady economy, that you'd have more of it. So the mix is a bigger factor when you compare these two quarters because how these things were evolving very fast, that's more of the down side and the recovery in the other way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The important point for you to remember, Ken, is that our pricing if we exclude grain was around 4% during the third quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. You quantified the impact of the strike at $10 million. Can you talk about the operating impact from the derailment and from the weather that you talked about as well in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think they were, as Keith mentioned, I don't think they were material in the end because we were able to recover in the last two weeks of the year. So I think 10 million for the strike. We did struggle with weather disruption and the derailment, but we caught up at year end. And so I think on a go forward basis, we're focused on running the railway.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Claude. J.J. mentioned something that sounded fairly bullish about potash. Can you talk a little more about potash and if all that's domestic or if there's some export that you're seeing improvement in, and kind of what your expectations are for the ramp throughout the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ed. Our potash business at CN is all of within North America. It's not overseas export business. We do some out of the New Brunswick mine. But that's a significant car load, but it's very short haul business.</p>
          <p>And our potash business last year was very, very weak. So when you look at the comp, I mean the comp last &#x2013; the potash business last year, as much as in the phase in the fall, was very weak. And what we've seen since the beginning of the year is a nice recovery for to the United States. So compared with the comp it's hard to get any worse. We've seen the bottom and so far, so good this year these early months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would add to J.J's comment the way it is at the moment, the Canadian mines don't seem to have huge inroads into the Asian market, China in particular. So it's possible that in 2010, we'll have more of it moving towards North America.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at something like &#x2013; the commodities that we have which were probably the most under the gun during the recession like potash and iron ore. Obviously, these will come out strong. And those that held up better like petroleum and chemicals segment held up even better. You won't see as much of a collar growth. So they were two commodities the really went down and the one they are going to come back bigger for us. And that's --</p>

But I mean your first quarter in your new position to come out with a big dividend and a decent size share repurchase. Is that a tone that you want to set going forward or is it just it was the right time and it's year end and would have happened no matter what &#x2013; how should we look at that?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Let me say a couple of things. The first is we are very confident about our ability to continue to deliver results going forward. The fact that the economy is appears to be on a firm footing, I mean it's still fragile. We all don't know exactly what's happening in all sectors. But it looks like we have a firm ground. Those are the two underpinnings. And it's that confidence that our Board is counting on to support our recommendation. And I have made a promise to give a dividend to Hunter and I was not about to not do that. So that's where we &#x2013; that's where we're coming from.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. First I want to commend you for generous donation to the Haiti Relief Fund. First question, in regards to head count, you mentioned double-digit or high single digit car loading increase, are we going to need much in the way of head count increases could you handle that, or do you think you have enough now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can tell you this. Our attrition as I said, we're about 2000 on run rate on a go forward basis for the next several years. Specific to the running trade side, rough numbers I've still got about five, 600 surplus employees in attrition. I can eat half of that and not hire an employee. So we've got a surplus still on employees, I'm not concerned about that at all.</p>
          <p>And on the other pieces of the operating side on the mechanical side, very aggressive plan as well with our productivity initiatives and with our improvements. So we're not going to replace one for one, that's for certain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the end of the day, we are &#x2013; the one thing you don't want to make is a mistake to hire too soon and a mistake to hire too late. And so it's really a balancing act. It's about reading the market. It's about seeing what's coming. And that's our challenge. And we've done it well in the past and we will continue to focus on trying to balance that fine line. But the key is we want to be ready to accommodate the business. If there's a golden opportunity as our customers are ramping up to seize on market share and keep it for the long-term. And we're well resourced as Keith said and we'll be there to accommodate the business.</p>

          <p>Capacity wise, it looks pretty because we do have a very young fleet on the coal &#x2013; Canadian coal side. We've actually refurbished that fleet in the last three years. Pretty much all of our fleet is <mark type="inaudible" /> and now we can with Keith's model and we run with DP power. And one of the terminals on the west coast is actually going to extend the length of its track so sometime late spring we'll be able to run longer trains. So between longer train and newer car from that point of view, we're doing pretty good.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just echo the same thing. The operating model itself from people and from locomotives is not an issue as well. So you put all those together and there's no issue on capacity.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can answer that as well. Yeah, and we're part of a supply chain, so when we look at our Canadian coal customers and us &#x2013; using our services and railroad and they are using the service also the terminal we see this as a three way mandate working with the stakeholders and terminal operators to set some record to move whatever they need to move that we can move it in a timely and right that way as it's there.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I guess one quick question with reference to &#x2013; coming back to the coal side of the equation. You guys took or you got 5 million tons I think from Teck Cominco, in the fourth quarter was that reflective of the actual 5 million ton run rate or is there still some volume to come on that side of the equation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not comment on how much business we have at one of our specific customers. But, our fourth quarter run rate for coal is a combination of more of the I would call historical portfolio excluding the new business we have with Teck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And you've talked a lot about the opportunities to sort of grow market share. You got a couple of assets in place that maybe weren't fully developed in 2009. You obviously the Memphis Yard being one with EJ&amp;E. So when you're talking about sort of high single-digit volume growth, is it fair to say that maybe one or two points of that growth is going to come from your taking market share either in truck to train conversion or other modal opportunities or just simply market share that you find out there because you've got a more competitive product. How should we think about sort of growth that's or that's CNR market share type growth as opposed to sort of a bet on what housing starts are or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely. Some of it comes from either the North America economy coming back. Some of it depend also on the strength of the Asian economy. But in all cases where it's the strong economy, weak economy, we're always going after market share using our product to get some share away from the highway and from the other sourcing. So part of it is using our product and first mile, last mile initiative to be nimble and pick up some extra point. Part has to do with the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Randy, just to give you a sense typically, if you get half a point to a point of additional growth from a volume standpoint, some years if you have an initiative that can extent you might be closer to a point. Other years you might be half a point that's the kind of band that you would focus on in terms of market share gain on a sustainable basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So really when we think about sort of the volume number, it really is going to come to &#x2013; come down to a bet as to what you think the degree of this recovery is. You guys have given our framework. But if it's positive you do better, if it's less you do worse is that the way to really think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's why you paid the big bucks Randy, and we're here to run the railroad. And we'll accommodate the business that's in front of us.</p>

          <p>Okay. I think that makes it for our call today. I'm very, very pleased. We feel good about this economy. We feel good about the operating momentum that we're building. The team is engaged and we will be looking forward to see you again on our call at the end of the first quarter reporting some good results. Thank you very much.</p>
