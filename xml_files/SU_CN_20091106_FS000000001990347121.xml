          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Suncor Third Quarter Results Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would like to remind everyone that this conference call is being recorded on Friday, November 6, 2009 at 9:30 A.M. Eastern time and we'll now turn the conference over to Mr. John Rogers, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for listening in to our third quarter conference call. I have in the room with me Rick George, our President and CEO; Steve Williams, our Chief Operating Officer; Bart Demosky, our CFO; Maureen Cormier, our VP Controller; Jolene Gilna, who works in the Controller's department; and Helen Chan who works with me in Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>We're going to follow the regular format. Rick is going to give you a bit of an overview in terms of how he was thinking about the quarter. Bart will give you bit of a sense in terms of financially how we felt the quarter turned out. I'll give you a bit of an update in terms of our outlook for the fourth quarter and then we'll open it up to your strategic Q&amp;A questions. So why don't we turn it right over to Rick, and go with that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John. And great to be with you this morning, and looking forward to your questions and having a bit of a dialogue. Obviously, this has been a very busy year. So as you know, we worked on this merger heading into March, which we announced the end of March, held our shareholders meeting, got our vote in, in early June and now we're some 13 or 14 weeks since we closed this merger on August 1. Obviously, a big milestone for this company, and a big change for where we're going overall.</p>
          <p>So I thought what I would do is update you on operations, update you on the merger, and then we'll get a chance to talk about strategy as well. So that's kind of where I'm going with my discussion.</p>
          <p>So, listen, from a financial reporting perspective, and Bart's going to take you through that, but a pretty messy quarter when you combine three months of Suncor and two months of Petro-Canada, legacy Petro-Canada assets. And we also in the period had significant planned maintenance going on as well. First of all, our vacuum tower maintenance, our vacuum tower on Upgrader 1 in the oil sands was down, it was completed, the planned maintenance was completed ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p>We also had significant planned maintenance on Buzzard and Triton in the North Sea, and on Terra Nova and White Rose on the East Coast, all of which by the way are now complete and we would expect to have a much better fourth quarter in terms of our planned maintenance schedule.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter obviously will be much better in terms of full production, less turnarounds. Our normalized production rate is roughly 700,000 barrels a day, but that will over time here be reduced by some depositions, which I'm going to talk about here in just a moment.</p>
          <p>So overall right now, here's what it feels like from an operational viewpoint, and Steve is sitting here with me, is listen, what we can control is being controlled. We feel in very good shape, especially given kind of a year in which you're going through a merger as we've taken on. The work that Steve has led around operational excellence has really taken hold. Our Oil Sands operation for the quarter averaged 305,000 barrels a day, and that's not without some challenges. And included a turnaround of the vacuum tower, which by the way, was on costs, and as I mentioned, ahead of schedule. So even in October, you would have noticed an announcement that we averaged 307,000 barrels a day despite a problem with the U2 charge pump.</p>
          <p>So what we're seeing is much better controllables, we're seeing much more ability to control our destiny, much more flexibility around delivering on our set of goals. And real kudos to the Oil Sands group and to Steve, and how the whole operational excellence has taken hold.</p>
          <p>In situ, Makai River we had both planned and some unplanned maintenance at Firebag. We've had a couple of problems with the steam gen. So the average run rate for the quarter from total in situ from the two operations is about 80,000 barrels a day. Our expectation is that we'll hit 90,000 barrels a day heading into 2010 and then we'll be ramping up from there, and we'll be talking about that a little later on.</p>
          <p>We did have two unplanned incidents at the Edmonton refinery in the third quarter, and part of that's really a result of the amount of capital that's been put in that refinery over the last three years. There's been just over $3 billion of capital put in that refinery. And now that that spending is done, this is about getting back to operational excellence, and I know the guys at the refinery are working very hard on that. So overall, Operations feel very good about where we are. You never let your guard down, there's still a lot of work ahead. But considering the kind of year we've had, we feel very good about it.</p>
          <p>On the mergers, obviously since August 1, there's been a lot of work done on getting the organization in place. In mid-September, the positions here in Canada have been confirmed. Unfortunately, that has resulted in about 1,000 layoffs to date. And that's the unfortunate part of any merger, but it's one that we moved through relatively quick. And listen, we fully understand that in these kind of areas, the quicker you move and the faster that you make these changes, the better you're going to feel about it overall as we get to the new state of the new Suncor.</p>
          <p>So feel very good about the plans we did going into August, the end of August. We feel very good about where we are in terms of the organization. And as you know, when we announced the merger, we announced an expectation of 300 million in expense reductions and a billion in capital efficiencies. I can just tell you that we're very confident that we're going to exceed those synergy targets and we'll get more precise about that over the next several months in terms of how much we're going to exceed those targets.</p>
          <p>Having said how pleased I am about where we are in the merger, I'd say we still have a lot of do. The first on the list, of course, is some asset dispositions, so we are going to be selling some of the assets, the weaker assets in the portfolio or the ones who do not fit our strategy. And that includes some natural gas assets, some small North Sea assets, Trinidad and Tobago assets. We have a corporate plane up for sale. We've got real state consolidation going on. In total, the target we have is about two to $4 billion worth of asset sales. Most of that will take place in 2010. And we'll reduce our production by 10% or maybe just slightly over. That of course will be quickly replaced by new projects coming on line, and that, we'll be talking about later on.</p>
          <p>The other things that we're working beyond the asset disposition, is supply chain efficiencies. We'll be working very hard with the international organization. Right now, we're in the tail end of a 90-day consultative process, which is required under European rules with our international organization and would expect to be working through that here in the next 30 to 45 days. And we're preparing the organization for steady and reliable growth from a very strong base overall. So what you're going to hear more from us on a go forward basis is, is a lot more about where we're going.</p>
          <p>So the last thing I want to talk about is around strategy. And it's very important that everyone understand that first and most importantly, we are an Oil Sands dominated and integrated energy company. Today, before these asset dispositions, we're about 85% oil, about 15% gas on the upstream side of this company, and our investments over the next five years will obviously by oil dominated.</p>
          <p>The new Suncor is going to look a lot like the old Suncor. It'll be based around operational excellence. It'll be based around the development of 26 billion barrels of reserves and resources. It will be certainly about a disciplined capital investment profile on a go forward basis. We will obviously also continue to focus on reducing our environmental footprint. And our recent announcement around our Tailings Reduction Program is a great example of that. That's a technology that we're very excited about, and I think is going to make a step change in terms of our footprint overall as a company.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I'm really looking forward to is we only have 55 days left &#x2013; not that I'm counting, but 55 days of what I would call our big hedge position. And so that runs out at the end of this year. So expect to go into 2010 a lot cleaner than we have 2009 here. In 2010, we do have 55,000 barrels a day of 50 to $70 cost as collars. Obviously, if crude oil is above 70, we'll pay a slight penalty for that. But again, it's 55,000 barrels on 700,000 barrels equivalent, so certainly not the kind of position we have this year. And don't really see any time in the near term taking any more hedge positions, so we'll head that question off.</p>
          <p>So I do know there is a lot of interest out there in the capital budget for 2010, and the order of projects in terms of its growth profile going forward. This is actually, this coming week, we have a Suncor Board meeting. So I'll be in a position to discuss our 2010 capital program in some detail. And unfortunately, we're going to have another phone call next Friday morning, which we're going to update you on that. We expect to have a very quick call, but I don't want to take precedence in terms I want to make sure that the Board is on side before we actually announce that.</p>
          <p>So that's really what I wanted to talk about. Bart, take it to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone, welcome. Just by a way of a bit of introduction, I think for most of you on the line, I haven't had a chance yet to meet with you face-to-face or speak with you personally, and that's something I'm very much looking forward to doing over the coming months and quarters as we get out and start to communicate with you about our business priorities, and including our growth plans.</p>
          <p>Just turning to the third quarter, I'll share a couple of thoughts with you. And Rick had mentioned that this quarter was really all about bringing the two companies together, and that includes the books. It was a bit of a messy quarter from a reporting perspective, just given all the one-time items that we've had to deal with. Financially speaking as well, it was challenging, as there were a lot of factors influencing our earnings and cash flow, very few of which quite honestly benefited us.</p>
          <p>So obviously, looking at Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year, we are in a much lower commodity price environment. WTI was roughly $50 lower this quarter than where we were at the same time last year, and margins were much lower as well. Looking at the natural gas side, AECO and Henry Hub were only about a third of where we saw prices last year. And overlaying that was a strengthening dollar throughout the quarter. So a lot of challenges, and Rick highlighted the drag on our cash flow and earnings from the hedges that we had out there as well.</p>
          <p>So quite frankly, as the new CFO, I'm relieved actually to be through the first quarter, so we can now really start to focus on what the true financial potential the company is, which should become more apparent here in Q4 when we have far less noise in the numbers to deal with.</p>
          <p>And just to give you a little bit of a sense of what that can look like, if we all just stand back for a moment and strip away the turnarounds and factor in a full quarter of production from all the Petro-Canada assets and the Suncor-producing assets. All else being equal, I would estimate that cash flow from operations would have improved by about 400 to $500 million, and that's just from the upstream part of the business. So we are expecting improved financial results as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Just a couple of other things to highlight, on the net debt side, we ended the quarter just over 13 billion. As Rick mentioned, through the asset sales, we are targeting a two to four billion of proceeds there. And that fits with our target to bring our debt levels down to about $10 billion, and we believe that will be largely achievable through 2010. Our goal ultimately is to get our debt to cash flow down to about two times, and that's at the bottom of the commodity price cycle.</p>
          <p>Just one thing I'd emphasis though, when it comes to the asset sales, it's not a fire sale. Time and liquidity are on our side, and we have about 4.5 to five billion of available credit lines with us to support us through this period.</p>
          <p>As far as being the company's new CFO, the one key message I'd like you to take away from today's call is that it's definitely part of my plan to ensure that the company maintains a very strong financial position as we embark on our growth journey ahead.</p>
          <p>So that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks Rick and Bart for those comments. I'm just going to give you a bit of a pr&#xE9;cis in terms of the outlook really for the rest of this year and a few other things of a modeling nature, and then we'll open it up to strategic question.</p>
          <p>The outlook for the Oil Sands, you can see, it's on page 4 of the press release. All we're really doing is tightening up the range from the range that we had previously, 290 to 305. Obviously, with the numbers coming out for October yesterday of 307, we're in a very strong position to be well within this range and feeling very comfortable where we are. And I think again, this just illustrates how well we're doing on the operational side. And there were some questions earlier that when you get into a merger of this size, you may take your eye off the ball in terms of operations, and I think this just flies dead in the face of that. Clearly, the Oil Sands has been very solid and their production has been very, very good through this.</p>
          <p>We have adjusted a bit of the sales mix, and that's just to illustrate a bit of the &#x2013; we did have a bit of bitumen sales and a bit of sour production sales, and that's just where that is. And that's also reflected in the realization price that we have.</p>
          <p>Cash operating costs, we are lowering the guidance, so we're feeling pretty good about that. 32 to 34 is where we feel we'll come out for the year, so we're very comfortable with that. And again, I think just illustrative of what we're doing in terms of managing the costs and increasing production up at Oil Sands, and really helping us that way.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the divisions, the Natural Gas, East Coast and International, these are specific fourth quarter outlooks. Obviously, we only had two months of production from the former Petro-Canada assets during the third quarter. So we chose to just put out a guidance for the fourth quarter, and you can see those numbers there. I won't actually read them to you, but all very strong and looking very comfortable with that.</p>
          <p>Just a few other points just for your edification is the income tax that we felt that we were going to pay this year, the cash taxes, they're somewhere in the neighborhood of 950 million to $1 billion, and we paid a good chunk of that already.</p>
          <p>The royalties, the Oil Sands and the East Coast, that's actually in the documents, the royalty guidance both for the Oil Sands and the East Coast is in the documents. And the last point I was going to make, and I know some people do like this, the LIFO/FIFO adjustment for the downstream is about 35 million for the quarter, so it'd been 35 million, the downstream would have been 35 million higher had it been in the &#x2013; had we used LIFO versus FIFO.</p>
          <p>So that's really all we're hoping to deal with or going to deal with in terms of specific modeling questions. Rick and Bart and Steve are here to answer your questions of a strategic nature and then of course Maureen and Jolene and Helen and I will be around after the call to deal with many of your modeling questions. And I'm sure there will be, after a quarter like this, the first quarter we come out, we'll happy to deal with you one-on-one to deal with that.</p>
          <p>So with that, Operator, we'd like to turn it over to the large audience we have listening in and entertain their questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Robert Kessler of Simmons &amp; Company. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Rick, just thinking in terms of asset sales and Syncrude in particular, is that something you really need in the long term? I guess, Conoco's got their interest on the block, appears to be getting fairly decent indications of interest there. Just thinking why not on the margin, take some capital off the table in that project and redirect it to what you can control in the Oil Sands a little bit more directly in line with your long-term strategy to really focus on operations and manage those effectively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think it's a great question, and obviously, one that we've thought through a bit. I think our position right now is we're quite happy with our 9% interest in Syncrude. We do think it does give us a really window into some of the operations of Syncrude. Sorry I said 9%, I think it's a 12% interest. And it also in a way helps us in terms of our customer base. So we're a big producer of synthetic crude oil. So when we have upsets on either the Syncrude or Suncor, then we'll still be able to kind of meet our delivery targets.</p>
          <p>So overall, like our position, we think it gives a window into some of the technologies and the operational improvements that Syncrude's trying to make. And so there's probably more advantages to us right now staying in that asset then selling it. And to be honest with you, what I see on a go forward basis in terms of our capital plans, and we'll talk about this more next Friday, is I want to see a really disciplined approach. This Oil Sands business in my mind is going to be dominated by Exxon, Shell, Suncor and CNRL, and then some other players. But what I think you're going to see through this next cycle is sort of a much more disciplined approach.</p>
          <p>So it isn't though you could take those billions of dollars and then immediately deploy them, otherwise you'll create your own kind of inflation spiral again, which is not a position that I want to rush to. So we have many assets that are much weaker than that one, I think, to put on the block.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that makes sense. And then on perhaps the weaker assets on the block, looking at kind of North American Natural Gas, as you prepare to divest some of those assets. Can you give us any color in terms of what you're doing on drilling activity? Are you taking a step down there in preparation for sale, or just general outlook on activity in North American Natural Gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve will answer that question for you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're putting the packages together. We're watching the operating costs in those businesses. So you've seen us manage the rates of drilling and expiration in those areas. So you sort of nailed it really. We're in the process of putting those packages together and they come out in the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. One thing I would add, and we've said this a few times, is if you look at the combined Natural Gas business that came from Petro-Canada and we have at Suncor, if you look at the combined capital that we're going to be spending on exploration development, it's going to be less than the two companies would have spent separately. So clearly, we're looking at Natural Gas to be that natural hedge for the Oil Sands, and not be a growth part of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Andrew Fairbanks of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning guys. Just had another asset sale question. I wonder if you could give us a little better sense of scale of the Natural Gas and North Sea assets that you're looking at divesting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah. I mean, we're looking at around a 30% level, is the simple answer. So if you think of the size of the Gas business and think of 30%, that'll get you there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would it be the same for the North Sea assets or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit different ratio there. So what I would say is there we're looking at &#x2013; we have a number of fields, which we have a very small interest, which are not necessarily strategic to us. It's not that they're weak assets; they're just either not material or not strategic. Obviously, Buzzard and Hobby are the key parts of that North Sea asset base. There's some of the assets, for example, like our very small interest in Scott/Telford, which are not key. So you would not see the same kind of scale in terms of asset dispositions there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it makes sense, and then I noticed that Libya and Syria weren't on that list. Do you think longer term, those are keepers for you, or you may divest them, but it just could be a longer timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah listen, my position on those two are, first of all, they're both large assets, they're both fairly material. I have not been to Libya yet, that's on my agenda here in the next two weeks. The one thing I like about Libya is its oil, and I understand fully the view of the market there and the risk that people kind of see to that. So I'll be making my own kind of independent view of that. What I would say is right now we're going to fulfill our obligations.</p>
          <p>I have made a trip to Syria. That project, by the way, is about 90% complete. It is gas with an oil rim and some oil discoveries actually already drilled. So that asset looks actually quite strong to me, and the fact that we're 90% complete, that's not a great time. We should have that asset online here in the first or second quarter 2010. The spending is largely behind us. There's still some spending to go, but, so I look at that one as one, we're going to fulfill our obligations, get this online, and then determine where we go from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's great. And then just a last one if I could, a couple of years ago, Petro-Canada decided to try and sell some of their non-core oil leases, and I don't know if that's something you would look at. I know Rick, you've not been a fan of selling bitumen leases in the past. But do you think there could be some little pieces and bits within the portfolio that would make sense just putting out on the market value as bitumen values are coming up a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, you're right. I am pretty hard on this one. So &#x2013; and listen, we do discuss this internally a lot. I'm kind of not a seller of Oil Sands leases because it's our heartland and it's the core of this company on a go-forward basis. And I'm not saying that we've looked at every single lease in the company because we're not actually at that point. But I'm not really a seller of Oil Sands leases because that's our backyard. It's the area that we're going to compete on a worldwide basis. If anything, I'd say down the road, I'd be more of an acquirer or maybe a better way to put that, a consolidator than I would be a seller.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just a question on Libya. I think you mentioned that you had fulfilled obligations there. Can you just remind us what &#x2013; like what is the minimum spending level over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's roughly a billion dollars over a five-year period. You've got to remember, we also produce there, so you have revenue coming in against that as well. And so I'm not saying it's insignificant, but on the size and scale of this company, it's not a huge, huge portion of the overall spend or the overall production rate. So it's material, and it's one of those things we want to make sure that we get full cooperation and that everyone lives us to their agreements in the arrangement. And again, I need to do a lot more review, and as I'm over there in a couple of weeks time.</p>

          <p>Sure. And then just one question on what's going to be announced next week, so next week, we'll see 2010 guidance. Should we also be expecting a bit of color kind of on more of the strategic side beyond 2010? Or is that still further out after you finish a review of all the other different growth projects?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Yeah, thanks, Andrew, it's John. What we intend to talk about next week is first and foremost, the 2010 capital program, so we'll give you a bit of a sense of that. We'll give you an update in terms of where we are in terms of the strategy and the business plan, and begin to roll that out.</p>
          <p>So give you a sense as to where the company is going to be growing over the next period of time. And to the extent that we can, we'll give you a bit of an update in terms of an update on the strategy. If we can, what we'd like to do is keep the guidance for 2010 the way we've always said in the guidance, which typically is in fourth quarter. So we'll give you the guidance for production, specific guidance for production for 2010 during the fourth quarter conference call, which has been our pattern over the last five or six years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Actually, most of my questions have been answered, maybe just one other one on the production outlook for the rest of the year. With only two months left and looking at obviously tightened up the production range a bit, but implies a fairly wide range for November/December. Are there any sort of risks to that outlook that you've seen that warranted keeping that wider? And in that vein, do you still see Firebag exiting the year around 70,000?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's just a question of prudence, our practice this year has been to understate and over-deliver. We see Firebag exiting &#x2013; we see total in situ exiting at about 90 this year, and we normally will quote the two together now as we go forward. So we see &#x2013; we're looking as I said, we've narrowed the guidance, so we'll see a good performance for the last two months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, let me just talk, William, in general. Things will get more specific as we talk about the capital budget and then move into next year. But think of this project as having a return versus our base case. So this project is actually in net terms versus the base mining plan with tailings ponds in there, going to give us a fairly healthy economic return. So don't view it as just a cost; this brings with it income.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Rick, in the quarterly report, you point towards the improvement in the reliability of the base business being a significant factor contributing to the production at Oil Sands this year. Could you give us some indications or insight as to why that's happening? And with the new Steepbank facility coming on stream, how does that play into improving the reliability of the business as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll turn it over to Steve for a little more detailed explanation. But what I will tell you is we talked about the last two or three years, about the need for a real focus and our focus on operational excellent. And it comes from a whole range of things, which Steve can talk to you about. But I've been very proud of the group in terms of that really hard work that's gone into that. And so, it's not one thing, but it's a whole series of things.</p>
          <p>From my viewpoint, what I'm seeing here is much fewer incidents, much better in terms of planned maintenance, much better in terms of even when we do have an issue, the flexibility around the asset base to work around that and continue to export. And that comes from in situ. It comes from more assets.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Steepbank extraction plant, first of all, we did go through one period where we did increase the capital costs of that project. They did bring it in, in that, it came online very smoothly. So kudos to our major projects group in terms of that facility coming on and working very well as it started up, and that was a big investment for us. Steve, you might want to talk a little bit about operational excellence and your views about really what makes the difference there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me just color in a few of those comments. So you should think of it, Brian, as a comprehensive change in the way we are operating that business. It is around systems, it's around procedures, it's around the full engagement of employees, which is actually part of the magic potion there. So think of it as a thousand little things, not one big one, and therefore it becomes much more difficult, then, to answer your question.</p>
          <p>The good news is that we've absolutely laid the foundation. It's broad-based. We've seen the improvements break away through the business. We've seen them in the mine. We've seen them in extraction. We've seen them in upgrading, and we are now seeing them in, in situ. So as Rick said there, what that does is it gives you a great deal of flexibility to recover if you have a particular issue in any part of that sequence of operations, and you've seen that. We've had some problems in Firebag. We've been able to accommodate it in extraction and in the mine. We've seen some problems on a vacuum tower; we've been able to fully work that around with flexibility in other parts of the plant.</p>
          <p>So the bottom line of that is what you've seen is a trend, which will continue. We will continue to see the sorts of improvements we've been seeing this year. The final piece, and really just to underline what Rick was saying on the new extraction plant there, on the revised budget, that plant came up on the new budget on time, and was fully delivered without an interruption to the operation. And we did that through the new operating system as well. So the relationship between major projects and operations significantly improved through that, and that project has fully delivered for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the other one, Brian, is as we go forward here and as we do &#x2013; and have more time in terms of the flexibility between in situ, the base plant, and then Edmonton refinery and Sarnia and Denver, in particular, I think you'll see that flexibility and that ability to move volumes and assets around will actually also improve. Soon kind of a couple different levels, that's the one thing about this merger; it does give us a lot more flexibility and a lot more control over our destiny here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Rick, if you have to do a strategic rank based on the resource quality, looking at the Firebag 3 to 6, the Makai River expansion leases, and the Fort Hills, how will you rank those resource?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll get to that next Friday, but what I would say is this is all about three things, and I've been very consistent about this over the last six months, is our investments on a go-forward basis will be based upon return on capital calculations, up around near term cash flow, and with some equation there around risk. And so that's the criteria against which I've been very consistent with this internally and externally, dogmatic, it's not about, so it's really around &#x2013; and that's one of the reasons that we've taken our time here is to try to do as good a job as we can on the calculation of that on all of the assets on a core basis.</p>
          <p>What makes this company unusual, Paul, this is going to sound like a lecture here, is unlike most companies around the world, we actually have more opportunities than we have capital to invest. And so this is about ranking them and then hitting them in the order, and that's the luxury we have and that's the one thing that distinguishes us, and we want to do that extremely well. Again, without creating a firestorm of inflation up north that we've kind of experienced the last, up until for five years up until last September.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, I don't think that you have mentioned about the legacy Petro-Canada operation in the U.S. Rockies for the <mark type="inaudible" />. Looking at the location, is it really strategically fit into your rest of your portfolio on that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, listen, we would expect most if not all of those U.S. Rocky assets to be on the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and you made a comment saying that we should not expect any more hedges into the 2010. Is that a more longer term shift saying that, given your current portfolio, you no longer believe that you need to engage in the hedging activity as you maybe in the even the last two or three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, it's Bart here. I think that the short answer to your question is yes. If you look at our overall profile now, and Rick's talked about the ratable way we plan to invest our capital going forward, and really with a focus on making those investments through free cash flow as opposed to having to take on more debt.</p>
          <p>We don't have a compelling reason to need to protect the balance sheet and put insurance on, which is what during those period of capital investment that we've had in the past. So we've got much stronger cash flows, we've got producing assets in the North Sea and East Coast that are very low operating cost. And as I say, our capital investments are largely going to be made from free cash flow going forward. So there's not a compelling need to put hedges on going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Two short one, final one. One, maybe I missed it. Is the hydro treater repair from the fire is now all done, and is back to normal? The second one, John, earlier you were talking about the FIFO inventory. You say 35 million. Is that an after tax or before tax number? If it is after tax, do you have a before tax number? And you say that it's a loss, I just want to clarify. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yeah, the repairs for the fire were over about ten days ago, Paul. So we're back up and running and at the full production. And the 35 million was after tax, and so we would have been &#x2013; it was a negative draw on earnings, so if you added it back, it would have been.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning, guys. My first question, you look at the balance sheet right now, you have about 3.1 billion Canadian of CP and bank debt. Any plans to term that out in the near future given where rates are right now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Harry, our focus in the near term, and this goes through 2010, is to divest of those non-core assets and utilize the proceeds from there to pay debt down. So that doesn't give us a real strong reason to get into the markets and do a bond deal right now. We'll always be opportunistic and look at those things, but it's not on our radar screen right at this moment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then a follow-up question to Paul's question on &#x2013; or I guess your answer to Paul's question on hedging, and why you don't feel the need to hedge as much as in the past. Is it fair to say that when you were thinking about the capital budget for 2010, your intent was to try and match up spending with projected cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Guys, good morning. I had two questions. One relating to your intentions regarding the Montreal refinery in the wake of, I believe, the decision not to proceed with Petro-Canada's coker project. The second one relates to purchase accounting, and whether there might be adjustments going forward either as a result of asset sales or other events to the three billion or so of goodwill that you're putting on the books?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll take a pass at the first one and then see if Steve's got anything to add there. Listen, we have no intent here to sell our Montreal refinery. One of the things we will be working on is reversal of Line 9, and so those of you on the call that don't know Line 9, Line 9 was a pipeline that originally ran from Ontario into Montreal. It was reversed by the industry about 12 years ago. We'll be working hard with the industry and with the owners to see if we can reverse that.</p>
          <p>So one of the things I'm very interested in is running Western Canadian crudes into Montreal. Also very interested to see what Shell ends up doing with theirs, so it kind of goes into that overall equation. And so, but we do see that as an asset that we'll keep long term. Steve, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only comment I would add to it, and I don't want to preempt the phone call next Friday, but you can take it as an insight into the capital allocation process. At this stage, we are confident we have better places to put that capital after 2010 and '11. So these projects are on hold, not completely shut down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mark, I get to answer the question on purchase accounting. Thank you very much. After thirty years as a CA, I finally get to answer one of these questions. When you do the purchase accounting, you certainly assign the value to the assets and the resulting goodwill. Then after disposition, if there is a difference between your carrying value that you have assigned to that asset versus the potential purchase price, that's how that would affect the actual assets, but it wouldn't affect goodwill. You wouldn't make a retroactive adjustment to goodwill.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just a strategy question actually. Do you have any thoughts on the dividend policy going forward? I know obviously, that's a Board decision, but any other thoughts there in terms of the degree of dividend that you would see offering going forward, and how that would &#x2013; with the overall value proposition? And then in a similar vein, share repurchases, would you return cash to shareholders through more share repurchases and less dividends or how do you see that mix going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Andrew, just on the first question of dividends. Where we're at right now is, and this is obviously always subject to Board approval, but the plan right now is to continue to have the same cash equivalent amount of dividends going out to shareholders, so as the combined companies would have been paying out previously.</p>
          <p>So that's where we're at right now. I think directionally, Rick and Steve have talked about all of the growth opportunities we have, and we would see the &#x2013; generally, the plan to grow dividends as we grow profitable production going forward. So it won't necessarily be in lock step, but directionally, that's how we would see that part of it unfolding. The second part of the question, sorry, was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
