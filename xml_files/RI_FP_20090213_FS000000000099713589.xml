          <p>Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our auditorium here. Now for those of you who are tuned in on the web, I'll ask &#x2013; well not you, but the people in the room here to turn off your BlackBerries or cellphones to avoid anybody logged on to the net having the inconvenience of hearing cellphones going off.</p>
          <p>Very rapidly this morning I'm going to talk to you about the Pernod Ricard Group's Half-Yearly Results for the First Half of our Financial '08,' 09. That's the period from the 1st of July until the 31st of December, 2008.</p>
          <p>And the presentation will be made by Pierre Pringuet and Emmanuel Babeau. It will last between 45 minutes and an hour. And as is now customary, we will take three questions from the auditorium and then three over internet. Now as we have a very busy schedule, we are going to talk you about sales and results in general. I'm going to give the floor straight away to Pierre Pringuet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I don't know if I should dare say this because apparently it's not very fashionable to congratulate oneself on results. But our results are very good. I would even venture to say that they are excellent.</p>
          <p>As you can see on our first slide, profit from recurring operations, or PRO as we call it, is up 24% and our Group share of net PRO is up 15%. But I imagine you are equally if not more interested in the future. Well we can confirm our guidance of double-digit growth in Group share of net profit from recurring operations over the full financial year. That I think is the main message which we will now explain in much greater detail.</p>
          <p>First of all, sales of 4.2 billion. That is 13% growth but 5% organic growth, if you prefer. There has of course been a change in our scope of consolidation. Our top 14, now we can't compare with the previous year because this is our first year with Absolut. But the top 14 saw its volume of 1% and in value the increase was 6%, so things are going well.</p>
          <p>Profit from recurring operations of almost 1.2 billion, that's up 24% on the same period last year, including a &#x20AC;164 million contribution from Vin &amp; Sprit, that's over a period of slightly over five months. So that clearly confirms our expectations of Vin &amp; Sprit.</p>
          <p>Group share of net profit from recurring operations totaled 685 million, that's up 15%. And Group share of net profit, that's including recur &#x2013; or non-recurring items totaled 615 million, up 5%. So good results, even taking into account the non-recurring costs of integrating Vin &amp; Sprit. Despite that our Group share of net profit was up 5%.</p>
          <p>I think that's all evidence of the fact that our results are very good but there is figure that isn't on that slide that I would like to mention briefly now before commenting in greater detail later on. That is that we have continued to increase our investment in advertising and promotion. We've increased that budget by 8% over the year, so we are not letting up our efforts to defend the brands. I think this is further evidence of how good these figures are.</p>
          <p>What about the highlights in the first half? Well strong growth in profit from recurring operations but also, and especially, strong growth of our operating margin, which is up to 28.4%. That is an all-time high. We hope to beat it in the future but that is, for the moment, the record. This was due to sustained organic growth and you will see that we have mentioned the higher advertising and promotional expenditure. Also due to the rapid and successful integration of Vin &amp; Sprit helped by the fact of course that the trend in foreign exchange rates has worked in our favor. So of course this has also been helped &#x2013; further enhanced, should I say, by good control of our financial costs.</p>
          <p>Now we're going to look into all these aspects in greater detail. Now I'm going to begin with sales. Now over the full half year, sales grew 13%. That's the upward arrow. Under the bridge you have the effects of our organic growth, 5%, currency effect, 4%. Group structure changed by &#x2013; made a positive contribution of 12%. We have a number of disposals as well, mainly the impact of Stolichnaya, which of course will reduce these corporate consolidation. So very good figures for the first half here.</p>
          <p>Let's focus for a few seconds on the second quarter. Growth is of the same magnitude. That's sales growth of 14%, organic growth of 3%. Not quite as good as the first quarter but still positive organic growth all the same.</p>
          <p>Now in the second quarter our top 14 continued to perform very well. I talked to you about organic growth of 6% for the top 14 in Q2. Well in the second quarter, the organic growth was exactly the same, 6%.</p>
          <p>Second highlight I want to mention was the takeover of the distribution of Absolut from October 1. That was distribution almost worldwide. It wasn't altogether a surprise &#x2013; well not for us anyway because we'd been negotiating, but it was to some extent a surprise for the markets. But this was the end also of our joint venture with Fortune Brands. And we exited Maxxium. One or two exceptions, I say this is worldwide, but there was a third-party distributor for Absolut in Greece but we have taken over from him on the 1st of January.</p>
          <p>Now the economic background is more difficult and much more volatile. Of course this was of course partly due to the liquidity crisis, which has an impact on stocks, of course. Inventory is down in a certain number of countries, not just wholesalers but retailers as well.</p>
          <p>Secondly, there was a sharp depreciation of some currencies and a strong appreciation of others. The Australian dollar, the won were down sharply. The Chinese yuan and U.S. dollar strengthened. This has an impact on foreign exchange rates but also interest rates changed with a strong rise in the short-term interest rates in September and October followed by a sharp drop at the end of October.</p>
          <p>Let me now say a few words about the brands. The &#x2013; Absolut Vodka. Over the six months, we sold 5.8 million cases. Now that is a successful integration on the face of which apparent volume trend was up 2% &#x2013; or down 2% should I say, sorry. But this is not a comparable figure because we're comparing sales through a third-party network with sales that are now fully integrated into the Group. So the minus 2% isn't altogether comparable.</p>
          <p>There was a slight decline of Absolut sales in the U.S. due on the one hand to the fact that last year the promotions was really a very active promotional drive put prices down. Now we do not want to sell Absolut well below $15 a bottle. In fact there were even promotional drives at 10, $12, something that we cannot accept. So we've stopped that type of promotion even though it did boost the volume of sales.</p>
          <p>It should also be said that in the U.S. towards the end of the year, towards the end of 2008 there was a tendency to downtrade. So, value and standard products sold better than a number of premium products. But as far as we are concerned Absolut has not lost any market share in the Premium Vodkas segment.</p>
          <p>Now elsewhere, that's outside the U.S., we have conformation of the fact that Absolut has posted strong growth in other markets. Now we've taken the Nielsen figures, and the U.S. was down 3%, that's in line with the Premium Vodka segment in the U.S. But I'm not going to read all the figures but you have them in front of you. A certain number of countries where the growth was double-digit growth and I see a plus 23, plus 24, plus 38%, so very strong sales in a large number of countries. As I said earlier on, this is a highly profitable brand that has contributed significantly to our results.</p>
          <p>Chivas. Volumes were up 4%, sales up 6%, so premiumization is continuing. 16% growth for Chivas 18-Year-Old and 25-Year-Old, plus 3% for 12-Year-Old Chivas. In Asia, while we were slightly down in China, partly due to the Olympic Games effect, but we caught up on that in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In Europe, the situation was quite contrasted but Eastern Europe performed very well. In the Americas and particularly in the United States we had persistent difficulties with Chivas, but in Latin America Chivas performed very well. This is something we will come back on later on, that's the strong sales in South America.</p>
          <p>Ballantine's. Volume up 3%, sales up 5%. Ballantine's Finest, which is the standard or premium quality, that's the rectangular bottle you're familiar with. Well, volumes were up 2%. Spain performed well, considering that we outperformed the market. If I remember correctly we were down 4.5% in a market that was down something like 5-point &#x2013; down 6%, in fact. So that shows that our campaign and strategy with Ballantine's is working well. The slogan is, of course, Leave An Impression, as you know. As for the higher qualities, the more superior qualities, volumes were up 11%, primarily due to Asia.</p>
          <p>Jameson. Well the success story goes on and on. Volumes up 7%, sales up 14%. In the U.S., we barely dare say it, Nielsen up 29%, NABCA up 24%, so very strong sales. This was due to the fact that the distribution network is being expanded over the entire United States. Jameson is in a segment that is very buoyant.</p>
          <p>Jameson sales in Europe were up slightly. We were hit in our top two historical markets, namely Ireland, and I don't think there's any need to tell you about how poorly the Irish economy is faring. Secondly, in the U.K. we also increased prices. Between sales and volume, what we do is we increase the Jameson sales price. We wanted to be positioned above scotches so that has had an adverse effect, as you can imagine. We've also performed well and increased our sales in France, Eastern Europe, Africa and South Africa.</p>
          <p>The Glenlivet saw its volumes up 7%, sales up 12%. In the U.S., The Glenlivet is still performing very well. You have the Nielsen and NABCA figures. These are the so-called monopoly states. In Asia sales are up. We've started internationalizing The Glenlivet throughout Asia, particularly China and the duty free sales. And in Europe, The Glenlivet performed well, particularly well in Germany.</p>
          <p>Martell, volumes were down 6%. May I remind you that we are still reducing the volume of sales but the sales figure was up 21%. This is evidence of the fact that our strategy with Martell is paying off.</p>
          <p>Now, on the top right, you'll see a photograph of the new quality called L'Or. There was a similar quality sold around &#x20AC;1,000 a bottle. Well this new flacon, I think it weighs about two kilos empty, this is Baccarat crystal. So it sells for 2,200 or &#x20AC;2,300. That is the retail price.</p>
          <p>Now we can produce this quality because we bought old spirits but this is a much superior product. If you really want some I could take a few orders but there are very, very few available. This is really a product aimed at enhancing the brand's image, particularly in the duty free stores and then a certain number of very high-end karaoke centers in China.</p>
          <p>We've done very, very well in China but let me reassure you we've had an excellent year with Martell, particularly the Chinese New Year, which went very well. We've just received the figures for retail sales. As you know, in December, we made our sales in December but consumers bought in retail stores in January and sales were up some 15%. That's retail sales in China.  Now, the Chinese economy may have slowed up somewhat but at least for spirits and brandies, things are going very well.  Well, the &#x2013; I'm not going to repeat what I said about premiumization and the impact on the unit sales price.</p>
          <p>Havana Club saw its volumes up 12%, sales up 11%. So double-digit growth in most of the countries in Europe with the exception unfortunately of two of our historical markets, namely Italy and Spain, which aren't the strongest economies in Europe at the moment, as we all know. In France however, Havana Club fared remarkably. We are almost certainly the leader in this category.</p>
          <p>Good development in North America, the U.S. of course, but also Canada, not to mention Mexico. Elsewhere in Chile, Argentina and Peru, we did very well, not forgetting Cuba.</p>
          <p>Ricard. Pastis, maybe it's because of the winter weather here but this is the only category that is down in France. And we'll show you our figures for France a little bit later on. We have seen growth in all our categories except the Pastis and Aniseed Flavor drinks. We have outperformed the market all the same, so if anything we've won market share, despite the fact that volumes were down 1%.</p>
          <p>Beefeater gin. As you know the Gin market is a difficult market at the moment. The reality of the situation is that vodka is replacing gin to some extent. In Spain, we achieved moderate growth with Beefeater. But in the U.K. &#x2013; in fact Beefeater's biggest market in Europe is Spain, but in the U.K., France and Italy sales were down. In the U.S. we performed reasonably well.</p>
          <p>Malibu, volume down 1%, sales up 1%. In the U.S. the brand is down. First of all, retailers are reducing stock. Second is the fact that this is a brand that is often consumed on what the Americans call Casual On-Trade. This is restaurant chains, suburban bars and so on. Casual On-Trade, which is the most severely hit segment. When you go to a restaurant in Manhattan, you'll find that they're still fairly full but unfortunately Malibu has not fared well.</p>
          <p>Down slightly in Europe, sales down in the U.K. Again the U.K. economy is kicking in. Sales were stable in France and strong growth in Germany, and I think Eastern Europe in general including Russia. Also good sales in Japan, Central America and Australia.</p>
          <p>If I could add one final point concerning Malibu. We sold a little less of the flavored versions of Malibu. The flavored versions did not fare as well as we thought. This is a project we inherited from Allied Domecq, and it has not worked as well as we thought.</p>
          <p>Kahl&#xF9;a is still a difficult brand to operate. We did have a problem with our marketing platform that we have since solved with the new campaign, Dare To Be Curious. Problem is, with a very good platform but a poor economy, well the platform isn't good enough. So the sales were not particularly good.</p>
          <p>Jacob's Creek, volume down 5%, sales down 1%, so we nonetheless created value as you can see, particularly in the U.K. Particularly in the U.K. because we defended our prices, but the market was severely affected. We've just had to accept a lower volume of sales. In the U.S., Jacob's Creek saw inventory down. They're de-stocking throughout the whole chain, the wholesalers but in particular retailers. The recent figure was up plus two. However, Jacob's Creek performed very well starting from a very low level. In Asia and Oceania, which is a domestic market.</p>
          <p>Montana. So it's volumes up 3%, sales up 3% as well. Good performance in Oceania, Australia, New Zealand. Slightly down in the U.K. in a very competitive market. We substantially increased the Montana prices in the U.K., but the British market is still driven by promotional prices. Finally in the U.S, Montana, well we've sold out less, inventory is down in the trade, but the Nielsen figure is very positive at plus 14%.</p>
          <p>Mumm. As everybody says, champagne is faring very, very poorly. Well our volume of sales was stable, and our sales were up 8%, Mumm champagne. This is partly due to the French market. Now the French champagne market was down 5%, but in the French market Mumm sales of &#x2013; volume sales were stable but the value was actually up 8%.</p>
          <p>That's thanks to the strategy, our advertising campaign, where we have re-emphasized the brand rather than promotional prices, as has been the case in the past. There's also the fact that in France the brand is sold by Pernod, which is the second-biggest sales network in the industry after Ricard, need I add. But all the indicators are positive. Mumm is the French people's favorite champagne brand, which just goes to show that even in a difficult market we can resist well. We performed well elsewhere too.</p>
          <p>Perrier Jou&#xEB;t. Now the figures aren't quite as flattering. Firstly, because the market is -well we've much more exposure in the U.S., which is faring very poorly. We're talking about negative growth of nearly 20% in the U.S. Very importantly for Perrier Jou&#xEB;t, sales are driven by Belle Epoque, the high end of the range. We have, however, performed well in a certain number of markets including Switzerland and the U.K.</p>
          <p>Okay. Moving on, all this will now be reflected in financial figures that I expect Emmanuel Babeau will enjoy telling you about.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Without a doubt, Pierre. I suggest we begin with the summarized consolidated income instatement. In blue you have the performance for the first half of 2008, 2009, as against the first half of the previous fiscal period, in green for your information. And for the sake of comparison you have the numbers as would have been the case on a constant foreign exchange and Group structure basis.</p>
          <p>To look at the essentials first, first of all let's take a look at the sharp rise in profit from recurring operations, nearly &#x20AC;1.2 billion, a 24% increase. And just as remarkable, the operating margin, 28.4% as against 26% last year. So in the half year we enjoyed a strong growth in profit from recurring operations, and a sharp growth in our operating margins.</p>
          <p>So there are three driving forces that underpin this performance. First of all, the fact that our historical business performed very well, further growth, further margin growth, business and profit growth. Also the contribution of Vin &amp; Sprit. Absolut is a super-profitable brand. It delivered in excess of our expectations in terms of profit over the half year and it provides additional profitability. To illustrate what I'm saying bear in mind that, when it comes to Absolut, we're talking about gross margin above 70%. So you see the contribution that Absolut makes to the Pernod Ricard business.</p>
          <p>Also ForEx has beneficial. Not so much on sales, it was still negative there, but on the profit from recurring operations. It was positive &#x20AC;30 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;230 million.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you a detailed review of the income statement. Let me first focus on foreign exchange and Group structure. First regarding foreign exchange, as I was saying, as far as sales are concerned there's a negative impact on average over the half year. The dollar had the same rate as in the previous year against the euro, so virtually no dollar-related impact. But there are few currencies that weakened against the euro; sterling, but also currencies of emerging countries.</p>
          <p>Regarding profit from recurring operations, PRO, there's a beneficial effect due to ForEx here. Most currencies in our production countries; sterling, Australian dollar, also the Swedish crown, have weakened against the euro, and therefore our &#x2013; the cost of our key brands has dropped. So there was a positive impact. And there were positive transaction effects over the period. And that gives you the &#x20AC;20 million positive effect that we have, as described, to foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Regarding Group structure, its scope effects, you have the contribution of Vin &amp; Sprit, &#x20AC;164 million over five months and seven days to be precise. And of course you have to consider the Stolichnaya impact and the Spanish brandies that we sold off last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the overall ForEx impact on '08, '09, plenty of currency volatility, so it's difficult to estimate. But it's fair to say, based on the rates as at the 6th of February, with $1.29 to the euro, it's still the same today, roughly. The ForEx impact is anywhere between plus 80 and plus &#x20AC;110 million for the full period 2008-2009.</p>
          <p>So gross margin after logistic costs, a little over &#x20AC;2.5 billion. And as you can see, our gross margin against sales ratio has skyrocketed from 57.3 to 59.4%. This is due to the fact our historical business has enjoyed further growth in gross margin. As you see, 6% organic growth for that. And there's contribution of Absolut, which is a highly profitable brand. So if you combine both those elements on the top of the positive ForEx impact, you have the very sharp rise in our gross margin therefore.</p>
          <p>It would have been easy to generate sharp growth in profit from recurring operations by cutting advertising and promotion expenditure, if you take a look at what most of our competitors have done. You can see that, indeed, in most cases, there has been a drop in A&amp;P over sales. And in some cases, their investments have been cut in absolute terms. Well, Pernod Ricard's business models' strength shows up here. In a storm our gross margin is such that we have significantly pushed A&amp;P expenses. You can see an 8% organic growth there, improved 3% faster than sales. So this is an investment. It cost us 50 basis points from 16.8 to 17.3%. But it also afforded additional market share and we achieved market share in quite a few countries. Spain, we saw the example with Ballantine's. There are other examples. There's France with champagne and Mumm. We also gained market share in the Whiskey segment. We gained market share in Germany, India, China, Mexico. Quite a few countries, whether it' sagging or buoyant, we have invested in A&amp;P and this shows the strength of Pernod Ricard's business model, which enables us to invest in A&amp;P investment.</p>
          <p>Contribution after A&amp;P expenses has risen to &#x20AC;1.772 billion, up 6% organically. And as you can see, there's a 160 basis point improvement in the CAAP over sales ratio from 40.5 to 42.1%. Therefore, we significantly enhanced the profitability of our portfolio over the six-month period.</p>
          <p>Structure costs now. Structure costs are also moving in the right direction, &#x20AC;576 million in costs, up 2%. So there, of course, growth is lesser than for sales, which means that we're in &#x2013; well we took our margin papers and started really paying attention to structure costs as of the first part of the year.</p>
          <p>There are synergies that we are already enjoying with V&amp;S. And our structure costs over sales ratio has dropped from 14.5 to 13.7%. Just a few years ago we were around 20%. So as you can see, we are making a constant effort and we still have some way to go to further improve that ratio.</p>
          <p>Now all this good news translates into a 24% increase in profit from recurring operations. On a like-for-like basis there is an 8% organic growth. And this improvement shows up in our PRO over sales ratio, a 2.5% increase nearly, the very good performance of our historical business and the fine contribution that Absolut has already made.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the geographic breakdown of all this. All regions contributed to growth, especially true for Asia/rest of the world. These figures do not include Vin &amp; Sprit. This is on a like-for-like same-scope basis. So you see Asia/rest of the world 42 million, America &#x20AC;17 million and additional PRO. Good performance from Latin America and Canada contributing to the performance as well. France provides seven million. Good performance from France and Europe, which is somewhat behind. Enjoyed very good performance in Central and Eastern Europe, was hit by difficulty in Spain, the U.K. and Italy.</p>
          <p>So, let's look at the details of the breakdown. Asia/rest of the world very solid growth there, 18% growth in PRO, as you see, Asia is constantly improving its profitability. If you restate the numbers for customs duties, which are actually sales that don't lead to margin, we're looking at 29.3% in PRO over sales as against 25.8% in the previous years, so a fine improvement there, further greater and greater profitability. The strong organic growth in Asia/rest of the world is driven by China with Martell and Ballantine's and India. So we have two, very two &#x2013; two very strong driving forces right there. We experienced significant difficulties in South Korea due to slackening consumption in South Korea and in Thailand with political events, which have had a negative impact. And there's a very favorable mix/price effect in the region.</p>
          <p>Regarding Americas, well the first figure that strikes you here is &#x20AC;387 million, up 46%. This is the contribution of Absolut. You see the impact on the regions profitability from 27.3 to 32.7% in PRO over sales. But organic growth of PRO is 7%, no less. If you take a look at the U.S., well, sales dipped 2% because the market has slackened and retailers have depleted stocks over the period. As you may know, the period saw the integration of Absolut distributor changes announced in January 2009. And those changes are being rolled out, so we're not really in our final posture in the U.S. but we're getting there. And during the period, we experienced a very good performance from Jameson, The Glenlivet and Wild Turkey</p>
          <p>The half year was very good in Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, in the Southern portion of Latin America; Argentina, Chile, Peru. And the Canadian market performed quite handsomely.</p>
          <p>Europe, Europe is the only region whose operating margin dropped, from 29.5 to 27.5%. It's not really counter performance. What you need to consider is there was the integration of the V&amp;S business in Scandinavia. Part of that involves low-margin local brands, and a low-margin wine business. And so it's kind of a scope effect that took its toll on the performance in terms of operating margin. But if you take a look at organic growth, you can see that PRO organic growth is slightly underneath sales growth. Why? Well because we invested significantly in A&amp;P, an 8% growth in A&amp;P. So you see we're significantly growing faster than sales.</p>
          <p>So Russia, Poland, Romania have performed very well, true for other markets as well. Good growth in Germany and Sweden. But a more delicate situation in Spain, the U.K. and Italy, as already mentioned.</p>
          <p>France finally, sales slightly up, 1%, profit from recurring operations up 7%. On the Whiskey segment, the performance was very good, namely true for Ballantine's and Clan Campbell. We already we spoke about Mumm. Favorable ForEx impact, and, finally, we are really curbing our structure costs in France and that helps us accelerate the growth in profit from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>Let's now take a look at the breakdown by geographic region. You see the quantum leap for the Americas, from 27 to 32% of our profit. This is due to the contribution of Absolut, obviously. Asia is pretty flat. Europe, however, has dipped from 39 to 35%. So now we're really very strong in three, well balanced regions, Europe, Americas and Asia/rest of the world. And against the current backdrop, we think our &#x2013; having our risks balanced that way is a pretty good thing.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to the other items of our Group. Share of net profit from recurring operations, &#x20AC;339 in financial income. First of all you, have the financial interest, &#x20AC;320 million, paid for our debt. The average rate was 5.2%, which is in line with our initial goal for the full year. As you will see later on, we're going to change that objective in the right way. But the performance has been achieved against a market wherefore there was very strong pressure exerted on short-term rates for at least two months, and we were fortunate to set up hedges to weather the storm. So we were not hit too hard by the short-term rate pressure.</p>
          <p>Among other financial income/expense from recurring operations, well you have an eight million amortization expense of bank charges paid in relation to the implementation of the syndicated loan, and you have &#x20AC;11 million in other items including our pension fund commitments.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to the free cash flow for the period. Free cash flow grew significantly, &#x20AC;530 million as against &#x20AC;109 million in the previous period. If you exclude non-recurring items, which are virtually ascribable to the integration restructuring of Vin &amp; Sprit for the period, free cash flow from recurring operations reached &#x20AC;658 million as against 152. This growth was boosted by the implementation of a long-term factoring program, &#x20AC;350 million. But even if you restate the figures taking that into account, you can see that we multiplied the free cash flow from recurring operations by a factor of two. So we multiply by two. For the year we're targeting free cash flow from recurring operations close to &#x20AC;1 billion, and free cash flow in excess of &#x20AC;1 billion over the 2009- 2010 period and same thing for the year after that.</p>
          <p>So where will that come from? Well growth in profit from recurring operations shall continue. Financial interest is curtailed. Actually, it's going to be further curtailed. And regarding other items that make up the free cash flow, since business will not grow 10% like last year, we won't have to have to build up stocks to follow the growth. Therefore, there won't be a negative impact on working capital requirement because we have the stocks to face up to future demand, short-term future demand. So working capital requirement will be under control, same thing for CapEx. CapEx is more moderate. Given that the business is not growing double-digit, the CapEx we need is in line and even somewhat below our amortization. Finally regarding income tax, we're right on the money, right exactly in line with our expectations. So we will have a cash income tax rate below 20% for the coming periods. So all told, we feel very comfortable about our ability to generate free cash flow before paying out over &#x20AC;1 billion in dividend.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at our net debt over the period now. Well there's the opening debt, &#x20AC;6.143 billion, you have all the items that have to do with the V&amp;S acquisition, the price paid out to the Swedish state and the debt we picked from the company, roughly 5.7 billion, in line with everything we've announced thus far. And we have the acquisition costs and the fees, well penalties, for terminating the Maxxium and Fortune Brands &#x2013; Future Brands contracts. So that gives you our pro forma initial debt. And you have the free cash flow, I spoke about that. 24 million in disposals and acquisitions, pension funds 24 million in there, the dividend &#x20AC;295 and the conversion translation adjustment. In the coming periods the stronger dollar will be very good for our net debt. However, there was a negative impact from 139 to 158 over the period.</p>
          <p>So regarding net debt over EBTDA we don't have 12 months behind us, difficult to calculate ratio. But our goal is to continue to push it down further. Had we calculated the ratio, we would have seen that the ratio would have been under six for the half year. And finally, the ratio is moving in the right direction. And according to the syndicated loan requirements, the margins that we'll have to pay in the second half will be lower.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at the scheduling of our debt. What are the deadlines we have to meet in the coming years? Well as at the 31st of December, we had &#x20AC;500 million in cash and we have &#x20AC;1.5 billion in available undrawn credit lines. Regarding our deadlines, well we have nothing to pay this year, nothing next year. In 2010-2011 we have &#x20AC;1.5 billion to refinance, but this will be fully financed with the cash flow generated and by disposals. And then we have 3.3 billion in 2011- 2012 and the maturity will be financed, for the most part, by cash flow and disposals. And we are confirming our objective, which is net debt over EBITDA, close to four on the 30th of June, 2011.</p>
          <p>A few words about how we've hedged our debt. At the 31st of December our debt was all variable, well 29% was a variable rate. This was capped and floored for 21% and we had a fix rate on 51% &#x2013; sorry, 50%. Now certain of our hedging operations will expire, and we will have some 50% of our debt that will be fully variable over the next financial period. Of course this has an impact. As I said in the first half year, an average cost of borrowing of over 5%. In the second half year, the spreads on our borrowing will decrease. There will be a significant decline in the spreads on short-term debt in euro and dollars. Of course there's no longer the same liquidity crisis we had last October, so we will reap the benefits of this drop.</p>
          <p>The variable proportion of our debt will increase as well. And all of that now enables us to aim at an average cost of borrowing below 5% for the full year '08-'09, and we expect this decrease to continue. This is based on current rates and our current hedging, which should leave us with an average cost of borrowing close to 4% for '09-'10. So a significant decrease in the cost of our borrowing next year provided interest rates remain as they are at the moment. And we have good reason to believe that there will be not any sharp increase in interest rates, certainly not in the short term, that will probably be suggesting that the economy has picked otherwise. So we are expecting a very positive impact on the cost of our debt in next year's accounts.</p>
          <p>Corporate income tax is in line with our expectations. Income tax is 59 million for the first half year, for the recurring items &#x20AC;169 million at a rate of 19.7%, again in line with the 20%. We expect to do a little bit better over the full year. But for non-recurring items, our income tax was &#x20AC;109 million. This is because we have non-recurring expenses that are deductible, which save us on taxes. And of course we have foreign exchange losses which will increase that gain.</p>
          <p>Minority interests and others, 13 million last year, three million this year. As you know the others are our partners in Havana Club in particular, and the minority shareholders in Corby in Canada. On the other hand, we have the proceeds from a certain number of assets we disposed of; Cruzan, Gr&#xF6;nstedts, Dry Anis, giving us a net figure of three million in minority interests and others. When you take all these into account, this gives a Group share of net profit from recurring operations of &#x20AC;685 million, up 15% on this corresponding period last year. Once again, this reflects the performance of the Pernod Ricard historical scope of consolidation, and, of course, the immediate positive contribution of Vin &amp; Sprit, which contributed well to our net profit from recurring operations.</p>
          <p>This brings me to non-recurring items, very briefly. Other operating income and expenses minus 133 million, mainly the Vin &amp; Sprit expenses, the cost of integrating and acquisitions. Sprit was 70 million, 47 million in costs associated with early exit from a distribution contract, 16 million other non-recurring income expenses. This is mostly net capital gains and losses on disposal costs, restructuring and other expenses and a number of restructuring costs as well.</p>
          <p>In non-recurring financial items 46 million, due to two things, first of all the impact of the volatility on our interest rate hedging instruments and of course the unfavorable currency effect, particularly between the euro and sterling. Overall, all our Group share of net profit was &#x20AC;615 million. That is a 5% increase. This is despite the fact that we integrated Absolut with the costs that I've already referred to.</p>
          <p>Pierre, let me give the floor back to you for the conclusion and a few words about the outlook for the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Emmanuel. Now for the first half year I'm not going to dwell on any of the components of this very strong growth. I'm just going to focus on the outlook for the future. As you know, forecasting is particularly difficult when it refers to the future. This maybe even more true now than it has ever been before. Now we know that we have only very limited visibility regarding the economic prospects, but, to the best of our knowledge, there are markets that are faring well; China, India, Latin America, France and of course the Middle East. Other markets, which were really growth drivers for us, are on more difficult times. This is the undoubtedly the case of the Ukraine. There are question marks about Russia too, though I don't believe that the Russian economy is going to collapse; far from it, it's quite a strong economy. So that's I think what we can say for the moment. That said, one thing we can be certain of that &#x2013; is that our sector, Wines &amp; Spirits, is a very resilient sector.</p>
          <p>Ours is a brand-based industry. Our products are consumed on a regular basis. And when the bottle is empty, well there two options, either you replace it or you stop consuming.  It's not quite the same as renewing your fridge or your car. Our sector has an innate ability to resist economic situation and of course is driven by the strength of its brands. This is one of our main convictions. It's not just a conviction. It's been born out by the facts.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we have a leading position. We're a global player in our industry by way of our portfolio distribution networks. This enables us to harness potential throughout the world. This is why we are so resilient and this is something that's been proven. Having said that, in the third quarter, at January, February and March, in the third quarter of our financial year &#x2013; well, may I remind you that this is the weakest of our four quarters, traditionally. Remember that the festive season sees a very good second quarter in a lot of countries, everything stops until the 15th or the 20th of January in Russia, Spain and elsewhere. So the third quarter is the weakest of our four quarters.</p>
          <p>A number of technical effects as well that played in our favor in December, but that will play against us in January, such as the Chinese New Year. We delivered for the Chinese New Year in December. We will not be delivering in January. However, retail sales were good, as I said. There were also markets where taxes were increased. As you know, taxation on beverages increased on the 1st of January in France. There are technical effects. And in addition to that, we do not expect the market to improve in France. This could result in negative organic growth over the third quarter, which is our weakest quarter as you know. I'm talking about organic growth. If we then factor in Absolut and Vin &amp; Sprit, we expect our sales to grow. That goes without saying. So that's what I can say about the economic outlook and the markets.</p>
          <p>We also have very powerful levers at our disposal. There are a number of synergies through the integration of V&amp;S, &#x20AC;150 million that have already partly have come through. But remember we only began operating Vin &amp; Sprit the 1st of October. We expect more synergies to emerge in the third and fourth quarter and more next year again. We also expect to be able to optimize our &#x2013; optimize the efficiency of our A&amp;P expenditure. As Emmanuel told you, we have the highest ratio in terms of A&amp;P expenditure as a proportion of sales, or a percentage of sales if you prefer. But ours in an environment in which media costs are actually declining. So we can actually do more with less money. Not overlooking the fact that, as there will be less money invested in the media, we should be able to gain in terms of sheer voice. So we expect to be able to optimize the efficiency of our A&amp;P expenditure. And of course, we at Pernod Ricard manage A&amp;P expenditure market-by-market on the basis of how the markets are performing.</p>
          <p>Concerning structure costs, you will have seen &#x2013; I'm sure you would have seen that we've already started &#x2013; we've already moderated our structure costs, which only rose by 2% over the first half year. Again, this is organic growth. It does not factor in the structure costs relating to Absolut. But if you look at the trend last year, where we're in the region of five to 6% growth, we still have commercial networks being developed in emerging countries. So very clearly we are successfully containing and moderating our structure costs. We expect this to continue, even to gather pace in the second half year.</p>
          <p>The upshot of all this is that, for the current financial year, this is our financial '08, '09, we are aiming at strong organic growth in profit from recurring operations of between five and 8%. Now our previous goal was around 8%. Now around 8% doesn't mean over 8%, it could equally mean fractionally below 8%. But given the lack of visibility, we have taken a conservatively cautious approach and have broadened that back into somewhere between five and 8%.</p>
          <p>Now as Emmanuel told you, our debt will be reduced and we will improve our debt ratios. This we will do with the free cash flow we are generating. We will also do this through lower interest rates and spreads. I'd like to thank our bankers in passing. And of course, very strict control of our working capital requirements and CapEx. Now all these factors will enable us to manage our debt in a very disciplined way. We'll also continue to dispose of a certain number of assets for some &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now to conclude, for the full financial year we are aiming at organic growth of profit from recurring operations of between five and 8%. We are aiming at an average cost of borrowing below 5%.</p>
          <p>We should reap the full benefits of a successful integration of Absolut and Vin &amp; Sprit with the attendant synergies and the commercial advantages, thus enabling us to confirm this double-digit growth objective of Group share of net profits from recurring operations, which &#x2013; the double-digit growth as I said.</p>
          <p>And that shows us with simple math that for the very first time in our history we expect the Group share of net profit from recurring operations to exceed the &#x20AC;1 billion mark.</p>
          <p>That's the outlook. They are the conclusions. Let me now give you the floor for any questions you would care to raise.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Antoine Belge, from HSBC. I have three questions, please. First of all, a question on your Asian sales in the second quarter. Sales &#x2013; organic sales growth was between seven and 11%. Was that partly due to a catch-up after the Olympic Games and then maybe an anticipation of the Chinese New Year? Or have you received any more structural changes in Asian sales? Second question, as you've said, visibility is poor but the trend is slowing down, tailing off towards almost to a flat sales. And you said that overheads, though they rose up 2% in the first half year, could actually increase at a slower pace. Could you give us examples of how you believe you could reduce costs further? Maybe tell us what the financial impact on the top line would be? One final question, if you could say a few words about your program of disposals? What makes you confident about the fact that these disposals would go well? There may be less, let's say, appetite for your brands in the market. Could it be that your one billion in proceeds from sales is a little optimistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to answer the first two questions; Emmanuel will take your third question. As regards Asia, I think you have given the answer, it's contained in your question. It's those two technical considerations that really drove sales. Plus the fact that sales have continued to grow well in India, and India we're actually gaining market share. I don't think there are any other structural changes to be observed in Asia. I think the market that's in trouble is Korea, it was in trouble in the first quarter, it still is in the second quarter, and we can't see it picking up in the short term.</p>
          <p>As for overheads, we are &#x2013; may I stress the fact that we are a profit-driven organization. All our subsidiary managers, whether they're distribution subsidiaries or subsidiaries that are own brands they are all judged on the bottom line. These are people whose automatic reflex is to manage costs and of course cost containment that we saw in the first half year wasn't something that we advocated in Paris at our executive committee. We talk about these things but this is quite simply the result of cost cutting and particularly operating costs. I think all our subsidiaries have been managed in a very disciplined way. To that I would add that even last year we were still expanding our distribution networks in very dynamic markets, but given the uncertainties in the global economy, as you can imagine this type of expansion has been put on standby. I'm not ruling out a reduction in structure costs, possibly even a reduction in head count, but this is something that will be decided on a case-by-case basis, market-by-market basis, because that's the way we operate the Group. So structure costs will be managed in a very disciplined way, as I said. But this could of course have an impact on the top line because the costs are managed by every subsidiary on the basis of market potential. On disposals, Emmanuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on disposals, we told you that we talk about disposals when things start happening. What we can tell you as of now is that everything is going to plan. As for the appetite as you called it, I can assure you that I get calls from our banker friends everyday who often act as go-betweens, as intermediaries between ourselves and certain rival companies, just to determine whether we would consider disposing of certain assets. But I can assure you that there is quite an amount of interest for a number of secondary brands in our portfolio. I'm being very lucid and realistic about the fact that prices are not currently what they were a year or year and a half ago. However, I am very confident about the fact that we will receive acceptable prices for assets for sale. Otherwise we simply would not dispose of the assets. We would look at other secondary assets. We have quite a large portfolio. And if we do not get the price we're looking for, we do not get a reasonable price for a given asset, we will not sell it. So the plan will go ahead. We've given ourselves 18 months to successfully complete it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean that the figure of one billion shouldn't be taken very literally? Or does that mean that you're going to achieve that end maybe by other means?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you can take it as such. Okay, we're selling assets, we're not going to say, thanks for bidding that price, but that will bring us over the billion mark so we can't accept it. No, we're not ruling out the fact that the fee could be higher than a billion. But that's a very clear-cut objective that we have set ourselves and we will achieve that goal.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fran&#xE7;ois Digard from Natixis Securities. I have three questions if I may. First on synergies and the timing of synergies, you said it wouldn't be 75 million this year. You know we expected the synergies to kick in from the 1st of October. We weren't expecting them all to kick in straightaway but are we looking at 25 in the first quarter, 50 in the second half-year? Or how does it breakdown? Will we have more than 50 million in the second half year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're still talking about at least 50%. And I think we were slightly below 40, which is slightly below 40% in the first half year. That's our full six-month period that is, so it's on a pro rata basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your average cost of borrowing, 4% next year. Can you hedge that debt? Can you guarantee that figure? Or would it be too costly to hedge your exposure? Would it be better to carry variable debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll be very transparent with you here, as we always are. There are two schools of thought. First of all there's the Japanese scenario; this is very low interest rates for a very long period because the economy is going to take quite some time to recover. And then there's another school of thought, it's the hyperinflation school of thought, which could happen at a given point in time because the economy could pick up very sharply and very rapidly. So I think the financial department's role is to make allowances for both scenarios. We will continue to hedge our exposure. We will not be completely hedged but we will take out instruments that will enable us to benefit from low interest rates for quite some time, maybe collars or swaps more specifically. That's the type of instrument we'll be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One final question if I may, concerning Absolut's growth by region. Could we reach any conclusions there as regards its margin growth? High profitability in the U.S. but low growth, high growth in regions where the margins aren't as high. Do you have any critical size and target for small markets? For instance on the historical basis, could that have any impact on the profitability of Absolut?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuel, I'll let you take that on margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly the U.S. is one of the most profitable markets for Absolut. There's no denying that. But what we at Pernod Ricard are contributing, what we're endeavoring to do, is to build up Absolut to the same level of profitability everywhere. That won't happen overnight; it's something that will happen gradually. We've increased prices in a certain number of markets and this could have an impact on volumes, especially in markets where we weren't profitable enough. But we believe that with the impact of Pernod Ricard, the full integration of downstream margins, we believe that profitability will gradually converge, maybe not to the same level as the U.S. profitability. That won't happen overnight, as I said, but we will continually improve profitability elsewhere in the world, certainly outside of the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Pierre. Good morning, Emmanuel. Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Three questions. The first one, concerning the effets techniques and to try and put a scale on that. I mean, if I said that it was, of the three percentage points of growth, 1.5 were due to the technical effects, put that Absolut sum into the third quarter, it gives me probably about a 2% drag on growth. And if underlying growth is 1.5 that would tip me into negative, as you've described. Is that the sort of order of magnitude that we're thinking of?</p>
          <p>The second question, concerning the potential flexibility you have from the reduction in advertising rates, are you thinking in terms of, that would enable you to have a flat A&amp;P percentage? Or that would actually enable you to reduce the percentage of A&amp;P spent on sales in the next six months?</p>
          <p>And the third question, you saw net profit increase of 15% in the first half. That includes the FX and Vin &amp; Sprit. Do you have an estimate, and I appreciate it's difficult, of what would have been the underlying improvement in net profit without FX and without Vin &amp; Sprit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[foreign language]  I'll answer on the second question, and Emmanuel will answer the first and third. Well it all depends. Basically based on the environment, we will adjust and we will spend in A&amp;P accordingly. So maybe the ratio could be stable or the ratio could drop. And today we stand at 18%; we stand at 18%. And we are by far the most significant marketing investor, so to speak. So if we just cut that by one or two points that would certainly not jeopardize our brands. So as I say, it all depends on the environment. But once again that's the beauty of our industry. 60% gross margin, 18% invested in A&amp;P, and that is extremely auspicious to drive our profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the technical effects, well, they're impossible to quantify because we would need to ascertain the difference between sales on a given market due to technical effects. Take the Chinese New Year, the essential was delivered in January but part of the supply was delivered in December. This year, we did supply mostly in December but also a little bit in January. And among these technical effects, you have stock depletions and that is very difficult to evaluate as well. So I'm really unable to give you a figure. I don't think that technical effects would have significantly changed the grasp you have of our first half, of our H1 performance, but I can't give you any numbers, I'm sorry.</p>
          <p>Regarding ForEx, you see the &#x20AC;29 million positive impact on our operating profit. There's a slight negative impact on our financial performance. And the net number, well, it's a flat impact on our &#x2013; if you include tax. On the Pernod Ricard historical scopes of consolidation, we would have had something pretty much in line with the performance of our profit from recurring operations. So the difference can be ascribed to Absolut.</p>

          <p>Hello. Good morning, I have two questions, please. Firstly regarding U.S. de-stocking, you've already been feeling the effects of this for quite a large of chunk of 2008, and I just wondered if you could comment whether you think the bulk of that de-stocking is through your system? And the second question regarding the Group tax rate, it was 19.7% in the first half. Do you expect that level to be sustainable for the full year and into 2010? Thanks.</p>

          <p>[foreign language] Well, retail stock depletions are extremely fragmented in the U.S. It's very difficult for me to have a sense of what is going to happen with stock depletions moving forward. There will be further stock depletions in the first few months of the calendar year, of our second half. Quantifying that is a bit too challenging. I'm not in a position to do that.</p>
          <p>And it all depends on the market, as far as the U.S. is concerned at least. For other markets it's easier because it involves wholesalers. And well, you know what wholesalers' stocks are and we can talk with them about their stock levels. And Pernod Ricard is extremely cautious about all these matters. Now regarding our income tax rate. Emmanuel?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I can confirm that for the full year we should be under 20%. The performance may even improve in the second half. And today, based on current legislation and based on the visibility or lack of visibility we have, I think it's fair to say that we will have under 20% income tax for the full year. I have better visibility on the cash income tax rate in the longer term and so let me confirm what I said at the time of the V&amp;S acquisition, in a sustainable way our cash income tax rate should be below 20%.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Three questions, if I can. Can I just come back to Melissa's question on stock levels in industry? I hear your comments on the U.S. But Pierre, could you just flesh out a little bit more your comments on other markets in relation to stock levels? How they moved through the second quarter? Have they seen further reductions as you've gone into January and early February? What you actually expect, in a little bit more detail there.</p>
          <p>And secondly, in terms of credit you've been extending to your wholesalers, I'm just wondering how that your credit policies have changed through the first half? I assume they've tightened through Q2? And perhaps linked to that, could you talk a little bit about the factoring program you've introduced in the period?</p>
          <p>And then just finally, back on the A&amp;P side of things, am I right to assume that you're potentially thinking that in the second half, half two, on half two A&amp;P as a percentage of sales may be lower than it has been? Or shall I assume for the full year, full-year A&amp;P as a percentage of sales could be lower year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[foreign language] I'm going to take the third question first if I may, this is Pierre Pringuet. Regarding A&amp;P investment, the short answer is yes, our A&amp;P in the coming half year will be less dynamic than in the first half. But to quantify things a bit more specifically, it's difficult because once again, we're a very responsive and agile organization and we will see what is appropriate on a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis, but there will be a somewhat more moderate investment in our A&amp;P. And we also have to wait for the best possible purchasing terms from the media.</p>
          <p>And once again, you have to realize that if you invest the same thing at a lower cost, you'll have a stronger share voice. So what I'm saying is that for A&amp;P, to please bear in mind that A&amp;P is constantly adjusted by our subsidiary based on market potential out there, and we always have our eye on the bottom line.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move on to the first question that had to do with the stock levels. Emmanuel made a few comments. Let me make one about France, if I may. Duties increased in France. Some spirits that are subjected to higher duties, I'm talking about liquor above 15 degrees, so they've been stocked, but conversely, some distributors tend to stockpile less -- I'm talking about 25 degrees spirits, excuse me, it's difficult for France. There's an excise duty and there is a stamp tax on top of that and that is what increased most.</p>
          <p>Well, anyway, spirits under 25 degrees, not to mention of course wine-based aperitifs, were not stocked as much. So when you're going to try to calculate things, it's extremely difficult. I spoke about this with the two chairmen of our subsidiaries, Pernod and Ricard I mean, and it's very difficult to manage that and to balance things precisely.</p>
          <p>But by and large, it's fair to say that there's a kind of credit problem in the distribution chain, and consequently, we believe that there hasn't been much of a stockpiling effect in the distribution system in a number of countries. But it's difficult to ascertain and quantify things. Customer credit, Emmanuel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me give you a one good indicator. If you take a look at our receivables, restated for factoring that is, we're in line with last year. So there has been no increase in receivables, which means that has not drifted in any imaginable way. We've always been disciplined and also, we partner with a number of distributors and wholesalers worldwide, companies we've worked with for a long time. And in a storm, we look at things one-by-one and we make sure that our products are shipped to the consumer as efficiently as possible. So as already mentioned, our receivables are in line with the past. But we do work with our partners and together, we try to operate as efficiently as possible in situations that are sometimes extremely tricky.</p>
          <p>A word about factoring &#x2013; there was a question about factoring, wasn't there? Regarding factoring, we've entered a long-term factoring contract with BNP Paribas, I might as well give you the name of our factoring partner. And this gives us long-term visibility. It's a long-term contract and it gives us visibility and that we will improve our balance sheet and our debt in a sustainable way, which is a good thing, and the cost is extremely reasonable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>The following question <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> One is the distribution arrangement that you've put into the United States. I was wondering perhaps if you could tell us any costs associated with that or whether or not there's any sense of a second-mover disadvantage because of other &#x2013; a competitor having that sort of exclusivity first?</p>
          <p>And then secondly going back on to this issue about de-stocking, I mean, do you have a certain number in mind in terms of days, perhaps, I don't know, more -- less perhaps at the wholesaler-distributor level, but more at the pantry level that has been discussed before. I appreciate it's difficult in certain markets, because you've got three-tier systems.</p>
          <p>And I was wondering third point, whether you could talk also about the amount of flexibility that your managers have on A&amp;P spend? I mean, obviously, the rates are coming down. You want to give people a little bit of that flexibility, but is there the danger that there's too much autonomy within your company about how much A&amp;P flexibility there is at manager level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[foreign language] The selection of U.S. distributors that we saw in Wine &amp; Spirits was made following lengthy discussions. I could even say that there was a beauty contest that was organized by our U.S. subsidiary and in fact, the best proposals were selected. When I mean best, I mean the best financial proposals and regarding sales efforts to be made. And in particular, we will have dedicated resources, I'm talking about sales resources that'll  be dedicated in these distribution organizations to serve our brands, and that was part and parcel of discussions that we held with these distributors.</p>
          <p>So in that regard, we consider that we're in a vantage position and let me give you a reminder, we are number two in the U.S. and we are a key player. And amongst our brands, Absolut is part of the distributors' must-haves, a very critical brand, which is why we're very optimistic about the future of Absolut in the U.S. because Absolut is part of the distributors' spirits fabric, so to speak.</p>
          <p>Regarding the distributor stocks now, well, we track them and there is no particular stockpiling. Things are changing as usual, there are variations, slight ups and downs. There's seasonality, but to tell you the truth, we have seen nothing abnormal in distributor stock levels. And let me add something quite simple, actually. We announced the distributor change in the U.S. in January and obviously, that's not the time to stockpile for distributors that we would let go.</p>
          <p>Regarding A&amp;P now, well, it has to do with organization. You say so on the one hand, it's a good thing to have a de-centralized organization, but you are saying, wait a minute, now your subsidiaries are autonomous, therefore you can't control them. No, no, no, no, wait. Let me make things nice and clear. Ours is not a fuzzy, disorganized way of working. We have -- our budget organization is clockwork. On a market-by-market, brand-by-brand basis, on a monthly basis, we have the income statement for each and every element.</p>
          <p>And let me tell you that for Vin &amp; Sprit, Absolut, they discovered that Pernod Ricard held what they had been dreaming of for years. They did not have the performance of Absolut on the various markets. But at Pernod Ricard, let me tell you, the brand owner, in this case, Absolut, has total control of what the brand does on a market basis and on a monthly basis. And as I say, it's clockwork. So rest assured, things are very much under control from the top-line to the bottom line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Pierre Lemenoff from Cheuvreux. I have two questions; the first has to do with price hikes. Could you give us the schedule of price hikes for the calendar year 2008, and could you give us some guidance for 2009 with regard to currency, too? And secondly what will your dividend policy be with respect to your debt alleviation requirements? So could you just tell us a word about your dividend policy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emmanuel, tell us about price hikes and dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, regarding price hikes, we've been very aggressive. We were very aggressive in '07, '08 with higher prices for Martell, aged whiskies, Chivas, Ballantine's, high single-digits, sometime double-digit price increases. Since last summer, the environment has changed and it's very difficult to raise prices. So in the coming months, we shall continue to increase prices, but in a more reasonable way, more in line with inflation. What is true is that price hike effects are still kicking in today. Martell, for instance, was boosted in March, April 2008 and now it's delivering the impact.</p>
          <p>So I'm not saying that there will be no more price hikes. I'm saying that environment has changed and exceptional, well, the exceptional price hikes of the past are no longer on our short-term agenda. Regarding the dividend policy, of course, it will be up to the Board of Directors and the AGM to make that decision. As we said, we're expecting strong growth in our net profit and I would tend to think that in this day and age, it's not absolutely necessary to have dividend growth match our net profit growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just give us a brief report on your local brands in India, their market share? And how your market share has progressed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, there are a number of local brands in the Indian market, because the Indian market is still protected by very high import duties. For instance a 12 Year Old Chivas retails at 45 to $50. As you know, disposable income in India isn't as high as in Europe, which means that our local brands usually retail for somewhere between 5 and $10. We have a number of local brands. Now these local brands are growing very, very well. I won't give you volume growth figures, but volume growth is in excess of 20%.</p>
          <p>More interestingly, we have an assortment of brands, a whole range of brands. We're not talking about standard brands by the way. Maybe I should point out that in the Indian market that standard products are below $5. Premium products start at $5, so the whole scale of prices is very, very different. So our brands, local brands retail at between 5 and $10 and the segment that is growing fastest is the 8 to $10 range.</p>
          <p>The other point I'd like to emphasize is that not only are our brands doing very well, growing well, but they are also perfectly profitable with grain spirits. Well, grain spirits hasn't &#x2013; grain spirits are not doing as well as molasses spirits, which if anything, have not fared well. So our sales in India have continued to grow, have continued to be very, very profitable. Referring to your question on market share, I haven't got the figures at the tip of my tongue, but I'll ask Denis Fievet, our Investor Relations Officer, to give you those figures. What we're looking at is the premium segment of local brands. We have virtually nothing in the standard range and below $5. So as for market share Denis will pass that information on to you. I just haven't got it at the tip of my tongue.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Michael Bleakley from Credit Suisse. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen, thanks for taking the questions. The first one really was on the performance of the Premium Vodka sector in the U.S. I know, Pierre, that you said that Absolut was holding share within that Premium Vodka sector. I was just wondering, could you give us an idea in terms of how the Premium Vodka sector is faring versus mainstream Vodka , if there is a share loss for the sector as a whole?</p>
          <p>And the second question was just on the factoring points that Simon was asking about earlier on. When you, Emmanuel, talked about days sales outstanding being the same this year as they were last year, I presume that that is including basically what is going on in terms of Absolut being included in that days sales outstanding number for this year? So just those two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[foreign language]  As for premium vodkas in the U.S., maybe I should remind you that our definition of a premium brand is a brand retailing at over $17. This is for a $0.75 cent liter bottle. So there is a cut-off level at $17. I think we've given you in the past a definition of what we refer to as a value brand. That's below $10. A standard brand is which is between 10 and $17 and a premium brand is over $70, super premium is over $24.</p>
          <p>So we have a very clear-cut definition of the various subsegments for the various types and qualities of spirit. According to the last panel figures I received from the U.S, if you want a more detailed answer, I could look into it for you. But off hand, I would say that premium brands that is between 17 and 24 &#x2013; upwards of $17, premium brands are on a trend of minus 3%, which is exactly the overall trend in the U.S. Maybe I should mention though that the Nielsen data in the U.S. cover somewhere between 22 or 24% of the market, but are nonetheless the most comprehensive view we have of the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>That said, I should add that the super premium brands, which is in excess of $24, are on the very same trend. Absolut is a premium brand, not a super premium brand. Now it used to be that the super premium were progressing very well. Premium vodkas were selling well and so on. That hierarchy has ceased to exist. But there are one or two brands, let's call them standard brands and value brands, that have fared very well, particularly in recent times.</p>
          <p>I think the turning point in the U.S. was November, November and December. Up until the end of October, I think it could be said that the market was still becoming increasingly premiumized, but the downturn was in November. The trend was reversed in November and we expect that this trend will continue in the foreseeable short-term future. Michael, if I could answer your question about customer receivables, obviously, I was talking on a like-for-like basis. We're still talking about the historical scope and consolidation of Pernod Ricard.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Just coming back to the factoring, I just wonder whether if you could give us a little bit more detail there. You've stated in the presentation that there is a factoring facility that's been set up for &#x20AC;350 million. Can you clarify whether that figure is already included in your working capital for the first half, i.e. the working capital of about &#x20AC;166 million?</p>
          <p>Also in terms of the cost of that facility, whether you could be more specific or at least let us know whether that is in line with the average cost of debt for the Group? And lastly, whether there is a recourse closure within that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[foreign language]  This was borrowing without recourse, so there would have been no disposal of that asset. These are receivables that we transferred to BNP. It is in line with the cost of syndicated loan. Javier, in answer to your last question, yes, of course, that is taken to account in working capital requirements, which of course has a positive effect, needless to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One more follow-up question. What's triggered the &#x2013; this is the first time I understand you've basically set up a facility like this. What's triggered you moving to establishing a factoring contract and also in terms of the length of it, for how long is this facility been set up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[foreign language] Well, it's a contract that spans several financial periods. It's more than one or two years. And the reason we opted for this factoring contract is that it simply enables us to optimize our balance sheet and reduce our debt at a very competitive cost. So it's a very healthy way of managing our balance sheet. That's the reason.</p>
        </plist>
