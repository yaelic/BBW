          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We're going to follow the usual procedure of the presentations. We'll have questions from the floor then by phone and then through the web, and the event will last about an hour and a half. And it's going to be a long presentation, so we're going to start right away. And the Chairman of Iberdrola has the floor, Mr. Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for your presence, both of you here and by phone and on the web. We'll follow the usual structure. First of all, I'll talk about the main highlights for the year, then the CFO will talk about the financial situation of the Group and subsequently, Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro will analyze the Spanish regulatory situation, which I think is of considerable interest, and I'll end with a brief summary and the questions.</p>
          <p>In the general context with this debt crisis in the Eurozone, a reduction in demand in Europe, the operating profits of the Group was &#x20AC;7,650 million with a growth of 1.7% compared to last year. And it has been possible thanks to or in spite of a significant increase in levies that are more than &#x20AC;1.1 billion. And if we take away this effect, the operating profit would have grown 3.6%. The operating cash flow grew 5.8% to &#x20AC;6,047 million for the first time surpassing the &#x20AC;6 billion in one year.</p>
          <p>From the operating point of view, we have continued to implement cost control measures and thereby improving efficiency. And in the financial area, intense activities have been carried out to optimize our balance sheet structure and to increase our financial solidity. As a result of this, financial expenses have been reduced 17.5% and the liquidity position is close to &#x20AC;9.3 billion with a leverage of 47.4% at the closing of 2011. In this way, in a general context, with the dropping credit ratings of all companies and countries, we have been able to maintain and ratify our A rating.</p>
          <p>Finally, the recurring net profits increased 1.2% and net profits have reached &#x20AC;2,805 million. including the write offs amounting to &#x20AC;402 million. These results will enable us to maintain the remuneration to the shareholder at the same level as the previous year, a proposal that is going to be put to the next General Shareholders Meeting.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the main aspects for the period, we can highlight that Iberdrola has increased the gross margin by 3.3% to &#x20AC;12,026 million, increasing by up to two-thirds the contribution of the regulated and renewable businesses that depend less on evolutions in demand.</p>
          <p>The positive performance of the regulated business has made a decisive contribution, which represents close to 50% of the gross margin for the Group. The 6% growth obtained in this item reflects the impact of the improvements in the remuneration of the network business both in the U.S. and United Kingdom and the incremental contribution of Elektro in Brazil, which more than offsets the divestment in Connecticut Gas Companies.</p>
          <p>Regarding renewables, in a very low market scenario in the U.S. and with the negative impact in the dollar and pound exchange rates, the gross margin grew 5% driven by the increase in wind power output thanks to which production has increased by 13%.</p>
          <p>Regarding liberalized business, the gross margin has remained stable compared to 2010 affected by less margins in the UK and a 5.5% output production for the Group. The company has reacted to that difficult operating environment by focusing even more on cost efficiency. This has enabled us to control the growth in net operating cost below the gross margin, including the impact of the incorporation of Elektro in 2011. In this way, the efficiency ratio in terms of net operating expenses over gross margin have improved by 1.7%. The increase in this gross margin together with cost efficiency has made it possible to obtain this increase of 1.6% in EBITDA amounting to &#x20AC;7.65 billion.</p>
          <p>By businesses, we can highlight first of all the good situation of the regulated activities driven by the increase in earnings and efficiency improvements. Secondly, the limited growth in the renewable business because of lower prices, especially as a result of the negative performance of exchange rates in the U.S. and UK. Excluding the effect of the sale of some assets made in 2010, the wind power EBITDA would have grown 4.3%.</p>
          <p>And finally, the negative performance in the liberalized business, as I mentioned earlier, which is affected by the complex operating environment in the United Kingdom and the increase of more than 50% of the levies, which considerably raised to &#x20AC;621 million. This increase is especially significant in Spain, where this item has doubled in the last two years. And at the end of 2011, it amounts to &#x20AC;518 million. This is practically one-third of the EBITDA generated by the business in Spain. The main item in this levy is the nuclear production levy, which since 2006 is being paid by utility companies in Spain and currently represents &#x20AC;13 per megawatt hour, which is practically 25% of the turnover for this technology in Spain. And finally, we have to highlight the impact of the divestments in the Guatemala businesses and the effect that this has on the results of the liberalized business in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Regarding the balance sheet management, the current environment has made us put our stakes on a prudent financial policy. This has enabled us to maintain a liquidity of almost &#x20AC;9.3 million, enough to cover the financial needs of the Group for the next two years, as well as improving the debt profile with an average maturity of 6.3 years. Also in February, this is important, we have refinanced 80% of the maturities expected for 2012.</p>
          <p>As a result of all this, the Iberdrola financial ratios are still comfortably within the A rating ranges. The credit rating agencies, Moody's, Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor's have reaffirmed the A rating level for Iberdrola and have improved their prospects to stable. And all of this in spite of having taken on organic investments amounting to &#x20AC;4 billion, 85% of which have been aimed at regulated and renewable businesses with the balance shared out in the various countries; to these investments we have to add the integration of Elektro and the merger with Iberdrola Renovables.</p>
          <p>The solid performance of the company has enabled us to generate an operating cash flow, which for the first time as I said, exceeds &#x20AC;6 billion with a growth of 5.8% in the period. Net profits have reached &#x20AC;2.805 billion. The results obtained in the year together with the financial situation of the Group have enabled the Board to adopt a proposal for a shareholder remuneration for the year 2011 of at least &#x20AC;0.326 per share in line with the previous year. This proposal will be submitted to the next shareholders' meeting.</p>
          <p>With this aim, the company will pay out a remuneration equivalent to the complementary dividend of at least &#x20AC;0.18 per share, &#x20AC;0.03 in cash according to the bylaws, a minimum of &#x20AC;0.15 through the new Flexible Dividend program. This remuneration is added to the &#x20AC;0.146 paid out in January. Regarding the regulatory aspects that the Managing Director Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro will discuss.</p>
          <p>During 2011, there have been breakthroughs in all geographic areas, although there are still major challenges ahead. Starting with the UK, the first steps are being taken in the definition of a regulatory framework with the necessary predictability and stability to carry out the enormous investments that must be carried out both in networks and in new generation.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Network business, I would like to highlight the efforts made by the regulator to guarantee a stability and an acceptable return for these activities. In this sense, last January 23, Ofgem officially announced that they have accepted the proposal from ScottishPower for the approval of tariffs for the energy transport business for the period 2013-2021. Investments are planned over &#xA3;2.6 billion in the next eight years with acceptable certainty and profitability. And according to the regulator, this will provide good value to customers. With this new regulation for transport, the earnings of our Network business is defined in the UK since the distribution activity will continue to be enforced till 2015, within the current DPCR5 framework. And this is enabling us to carry out the investments of &#xA3;2 billion in the period.</p>
          <p>The UK generation activity, however, requires greater definition to establish a clear framework that can be assessed to provide incentives for the necessary investments since for environmental or obsolescence reasons the country must replace close to 40% of its generating facilities in the coming years. We, therefore, expect that the Electricity Market Reform will design this framework by the end of the first semester, both for traditional generation and for new renewable capacity as of 2017.</p>
          <p>Finally, progress is being made to establish a cost allocation system for energy transport that will now penalize the generators further away from the consumer centers. This reform is key for the United Kingdom to be able to meet its objectives for the installation of new renewable power.</p>
          <p>And moving on to the main regulatory landmarks in Spain that Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro will comment on later, the sector is characterized by a drop in electricity demand. At the end of 2011, the demand in Spain was similar to those of 2006. However, installed power was much higher than that year especially renewable power which has more than doubled in that period.</p>
          <p>Also the firm stakes put on renewable technologies in Spain, that has gone much further than the objective laid down by the European Union of 20% for 2020, has made it possible for us to meet with that commitment for 2020. We have a very competitive traditional energy mix thanks to which, energy crisis on the Spanish market the so-called pool are 10% lower than the European average. Also the distribution networks in our country have a remuneration, which even after the recent increases is also around 10% lower than the average for the main European countries. However, the remuneration for renewables in Spain according to a study made by the European Council for Energy Regulators is higher than the European average, the repercussion per megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>Not only that but the Spanish system is the European system with the highest cost. And this will be even more significant in the future in view of the development of the expensive and immature technologies that are taking place, especially solar energy. Additionally, the electric bill in Spain includes a number of costs such as a social bonus or incentives for national coal, which are superior to those in other countries in the European Union. These lead to a final supply price in Spain, which is slightly higher than the average.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the so-called tariff deficit has been generated, which is the result of the difference between what companies are authorized to charge and what we are obliged to pay. This has been the direct consequence of the exponential growth experienced by premiums, especially the special regime in recent years, which has multiplied by three between 2007 and 2010 and is still growing significantly with an increase in the cost of the system and the premiums for solar and hybrid gas-solar systems or thermo solar systems. The growing volume in the deficit generated and the urgency in providing a sustainable solution have led the Spanish government to take measures to tackle the problem.</p>
          <p>And we can highlight the recently approved Royal Decree 1/2012 to temporarily suspend the pre-allocation of procedures for the remuneration of economic incentives for new renewable and cogeneration facilities. Without a doubt, this is a positive measure with the proper objective that lays down the proper path and this is being developed by the Ministry for Industry, Energy and Tourism. This is an important measure but has a small impact in the short term and doesn't solve the problem since it doesn't prevent the errors already made with photovoltaic plants being repeated in the hybrid gas solar plants. On the other hand, we continue to move forward in the securitization of the tariff deficit, thanks to private issues, close to &#x20AC;13 billion have been securitized and around 7 billion are currently pending.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand the floor over to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, so that he can explain the results for the year in greater detail.</p>

          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. President. First, I would like to underline the most important aspects of the accounts and operating trends and I will finish with an analysis of the financial situation, the gross margin has grown 3.3% and now stands at &#x20AC;12 billion, although the exchange rate has subtracted nearly &#x20AC;144 million with growth in the regulated business in Spain and the UK and in the liberalized business in Spain and renewables that was to compensate the weak behavior of the liberalized business in the UK. And without the impact of the rate of exchange, the gross margin would have grown 4.5%. The consolidation of Elektro that provides &#x20AC;436 million compensates the loss of the assets sold in the United States, Guatemala and other assets that have also been sold that subtract nearly &#x20AC;300 million. The basic margin has gone up 3.2% in line with the gross margin and now stands at &#x20AC;12,275 million and the value of the emission rights allocated in 2011 is only &#x20AC;1 million higher than those allocated in 2010. Net operating expenses have grown 1.7% below the growth of the gross margin. And the lower expenses arising from the sale of the difference businesses, &#x20AC;103 million, have made it possible to compensate the greater costs of those associated to Elektro, &#x20AC;123 million and there has been increase in expenses in renewables as a consequence of the increase in capacity. And this fiscal year includes &#x20AC;443 million of non-recurrent impacts because of the hurricanes.</p>
          <p>Net staff expenses have been reduced 3.6% and now stand at &#x20AC;1.6 billion. And even after the consolidation of Elektro due to certain non-recurrent effects that were included in the books in 2010, the total workforce has been increased by 1.7%. The net external services have grown 7% and now stands at &#x20AC;1.8 billion, fundamentally affected by the change of perimeter and because of the storm costs. The rate of exchange has improved operating expenses by &#x20AC;43 million. On the whole, the recurring net operating expenses have grown 4%. As regard to levies, there has been an increase of 29.9% and the figure is now &#x20AC;1.1 billion because of the increase of levies in the liberalized business in Spain, 31% more. And I will be talking about this later on and I will be talking about the increase in levies in the UK.</p>
          <p>The consolidated EBITDA has grown 1.6% thanks to a growth of 3.3% of the basic margin and because of an operating expense that goes up less. However, the strong increase in levies, nearly 22%, has penalized the evolution of EBITDA. The consolidation of Elektro makes it possible to compensate the sale of assets and the negative impact in the evolution of the rate of exchange and the homogenization of the EBITDA in the regulated business in Spain where in the last quarter, we updated the remuneration of that year and of 2009 totaling &#x20AC;75 million which is what we had for 2009.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the recurrent pro forma of the Group had grown 1.7%, which is very similar to the figure that was reported. The growth of EBITDA is based on our diversified business model where the most stable and less risky business like the regulated business and renewables provide 71% of the EBITDA and this compensates the greater probability of the liberalized business.</p>
          <p>And talking about the operating profits per businesses, and starting off with the regulated business, the EBITDA that includes Spain, UK, United States and Brazil with Elektro has grown 5.5% and now stands at &#x20AC;3,825 million, which means that there's a 4.5% improvement in terms of the gross margins. And in like-for-like terms, all of the business areas provide growth at a recurrent level and this has been boosted by the regulatory agreements and by the synergies that arise from implementing efficiency standards. The regulated business in Spain provides 41% of the EBITDA, in the UK 22%; in the United States, 14% and Brazil 23% after consolidating Elektro.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the regulated business in Spain has dropped 0.2% and now stands at a figure of &#x20AC;2,555 million although in like for like terms it rose 4.8%. We have to remember that new regulatory framework is homogenous since the fourth quarter of 2010 and the drop of 1.4% in the gross margin is due to the fact that the improvement of 6.1% in income for the regulated business is not sufficient to counteract the negative impact in the inter-annual comparative analysis totaling &#x20AC;75 million.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the positive evolution of net operating expenses that have dropped 6.4% thanks to improvements in efficiency have made it possible for EBITDA to only [drop] 4.2%. The regulated business in the UK has reached an EBITDA of &#x20AC;832 million with a growth of 4.2% because of the increase of 4.4% in the gross margin as a consequence of the increase in the income due to the investments and due to the remuneration of the DPCR5 business, which was applied as from April 1, 2010 and operating expenses have been reduced by 1.7%.</p>
          <p>The impact related to the rate of exchange change has been negative. So that means that the EBITDA would have improved 5.4%. The regulated business in the United States provides an EBITDA of &#x20AC;548 million under the IFRS regulations, which means that it's a 23% slump. As regards to the negative effect of the sale of the gas business in Connecticut, which means &#x20AC;94 million less in EBITDA, there's been a nonrecurring impact of &#x20AC;43 million because of hurricanes and storms, which has to do with one of adjustments which linked to the negative effect of the rate of exchange, &#x20AC;27 million represents most of the slump.</p>
          <p>However, the underlying evolution is positive and it means that it's &#x20AC;32 million more in EBITDA, which arises from an improvement in the operating aspects of the business in spite of the bad fourth quarter and the increase in tariffs because of the new rate case in the main line have made it possible to make the EBITDA grow nearly by 4% and the EBITDA in Brazil has grown 60% and now stands at &#x20AC;890 million after incorporating Elektro to the consolidation perimeter, which since May 1 has provided &#x20AC;312 million and then there is 2.6% growth in electrical demand and new hydraulic (sic) hydroelectric facilities that have been commissioned, which also have produced growth. And the gross margin of the business has grown 66.1% and &#x20AC;486 million has to do with incorporation of Elektro. The operating expenses have gone up 85.7% or &#x20AC;151 million, of which &#x20AC;123 million has to do with this incorporation and the rest has to do with inflation and greater activity. And EBITDA without Elektro would have grown 3.8%.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to move on to the operating profits of the liberalized business that includes Spain, the UK and Mexico. EBITDA has dropped 7.4% and now stands at &#x20AC;2.2 billion whereas the EBITDA in Spain has gone up 5.9% thanks to an improvement in margins and because of a limitation in net operating expenses in the UK, there has been a 40.8% slump because of lower margins and less sales and less production that was down in Mexico 11% because they have been affected by the sale of the Guatemala business and the devaluation of the dollar.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses reduced 2.7% whereas the levies have undergone a very strong increase 50.7% that really penalizes the EBITDA of the business. And starting off with the liberalized business in Spain it has to be mentioned that there has been a reduction in the production of the ordinary regime of 13% because of the slump of 22% in hydraulic (sic) hydroelectric production and 7% in nuclear power, this is one of the driest winters we've had in the last 50 years. Even so the hydraulic (sic) hydroelectric reserves were 51% till December the 31st which is slightly above the historic figure and the average sale price is &#x20AC;61 per megawatt hour which has given us a greater margin although the procurement cost environment has been growing and the basic margin has grown 6.4%, which linked to the limitation of operating expenses which have dropped 4.6% because of cost limitations and some other specific effects of 2010, this has allowed us to counteract the strong increase in the levies paid, 30.5% more, which now represents 33% of the business's EBITDA. And the growth of this item is 5.9% and now has reached &#x20AC;1.5 billion. There's also a positive effect of &#x20AC;102 million related to resettlements. And for 2012, there are 56 terawatts hour of production already sold at a price in excess of &#x20AC;60 megawatt hour.</p>
          <p>As we've pointed out in the previous transparency, the EBITDA of the Spanish liberalized business is affected by the increase in levies. In fact, in the last two years levies in this business have been multiplied by 2.4 since &#x20AC;216 million in 2009 up to &#x20AC;518 million in 2011, which represents an impact of &#x20AC;300 million in two years and this means that the profitability relative to the invested capital in the in the Generation business, especially nuclear power stations is below the cost of capital.</p>
          <p>Until 2006, practically no nuclear levies were paid and now they account for nearly &#x20AC;200 million. According to our calculations, the total of levies in terms of nuclear production represent an average of &#x20AC;13 per megawatt hour, which is in line with the rates applied in Germany and Belgium. And the levies paid to the states represent &#x20AC;339 million, apart from those that are specifically nuclear, there are &#x20AC;150 million more that are linked to energy efficiency programs and to the social bonus and the rest of the local and regional levies total &#x20AC;179 million. We have the eco levy of Extremadura although we have filed an appeal before the Court of Justice and the High Court of Justice in Spain.</p>
          <p>The basic margin of the liberalized business in the UK presents a slump of 11% in which there's been a decline in sales, 5% in electricity, 19% in gas, and very low spreads with higher procurement costs that have not been compensated by an equivalent increase in the price of sale of electricity and a 22% reduction because of the lower spreads in the market.</p>
          <p>Net operating expenses have grown 4.1% due to non-recurrent effects that affected the annual comparative. There's been a reclassification of the CERT and CESP levies that are imposed by the regulator for energy efficiency programs based on the net operating expenses and therefore there's been a very significant increase but this has been compensated because in the net operating expenses there was a positive item of &#x20AC;50 million in terms of insurance indemnities in 2010. So that means that the EBITDA presents a slump of 41% and now stands at &#x20AC;322 million.</p>
          <p>However and as we pointed out in Q3, as from August, there was an improvement in the evolution of the businesses especially in the area of gas, with increases in the unitary margin arising from an increase in tariffs. And this improvement has been consolidated in the fourth quarter with a recovery of margins in gas and electricity. So that means that the results of this area will improve in 2012 because of an increase in margins. And as regards the liberalized business in Mexico, there's been a slump of 11% in the EBITDA and it now stands at &#x20AC;362 million and the effect produced by the rate of exchange has subtracted &#x20AC;18.4 million and this has had a negative impact on the business in Guatemala that has reduced the EBITDA by &#x20AC;58 million and that being said the underlying evolution of EBITDA has improved 1.5%.</p>
          <p>And as regards the EBITDA of the Renewables business, we're talking about &#x20AC;1.5 billion because of greater costs because of an increase in capability and because of the contracts and the maintenance contracts that have come to an end and because of the merger costs and because of lower prices that is &#x20AC;66.3 million below the figure reported for 2010 because of the greater weight of the business in the United States versus Spain. Where in the case of Hydraulic business, the load factor in the fourth quarter was bad and the evolution of the rate of exchange has had a negative impact of &#x20AC;26 million.</p>
          <p>The pure wind power EBITDA has grown 4.3%. Operating capacity has grown 10% and now stands at &#x20AC;13.2 million (sic) [13.2 MW] and the installed capacity has increased 9.2%. The average load factor now stands at 25.7%, which is slightly below 25.8% reported one year ago. Although in Q4, it was 0.4 points lower and as I mentioned this was affected by the low level of wind power produced in Spain and EBITDA has dropped 6.7% because of the increase in provisions that have grown 187% and now stand at &#x20AC;528 million. And this increase has no impact on the cash flow especially because of the &#x20AC;332 million produced by impairment of assets that are as follows.</p>
          <p>Firstly, &#x20AC;286 million in thermal assets in the UK due to the cancellation of the CCS project and the carbon flow that was announced by the British Energy Authorities that reduces the expectations in terms of spreads and the life of these assets. And secondly, &#x20AC;46 million related to promotional costs of the wind parks in the United States where considered on the current situation, they're not going to be developed. And then we've also extended the life of wind farms from 20 to 25 years which reduces the payback by &#x20AC;66 million. Although, amortizations have grown 4.1% because of the increase in investments made in the Regulated business as well as in the Renewables business.</p>
          <p>And the financial results have improved 17.5% thanks, among other things, to the impact produced by the hedging for rates of exchange for these subsidiaries, which represent &#x20AC;87 million. And another important impact comes from changed provisions related to the deficit totaling &#x20AC;85 million. Financial expenses associated to the debt has grown 5% because of the increase of 40 points in the cost of the interest paid and now stands at 4.6% including the new debt in reals that Elektro has provided and the fact that it is partially compensated by a 3% reduction of the average figure of the debt. On the other hand the greater levels of remuneration of the deficit has a positive effect of &#x20AC;31 million because this is a remuneration system that's linked to the Euribor of three months of the previous year which in 2010 was 0.7 and in 2011 it was 1.05 and to finish with the analysis of the results I have to point that the net recurrent profits have grown 1.2% and now stand at &#x20AC;2.6 billion. However, the reported net profits have dropped 2.3% as the President pointed out.</p>
          <p>Firstly &#x2013; the difference between both items is due to the following, firstly because of the impairment of assets totaling &#x20AC;402 million gross because in the case of the &#x20AC;286 million related to thermal assets in the UK and &#x20AC;46 million for renewables, we have to add another &#x20AC;70 million as regards the participation of Gamesa, which can be seen here in the consolidation by the equity method where we postponed the dates of achievement of these objectives because of the weakness of the wind power market.</p>
          <p>And secondly because they were &#x20AC;133 million less in 2010 in the case of extraordinary results and both effects are partially compensated by lower tax levels and because of a levy that is two points lower in the UK that means that we're paying less deferred taxes than in 2010 totaling &#x20AC;83 million. And also because there's been a change in the taxation policy in the Unites States totaling &#x20AC;169 million after reaching an agreement with the tax authority on lawsuits prior to the acquisition of ScottishPower. And the effective tax rate in 2011 was 15.7%, vis-&#xE0;-vis 23.6% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving on to a quick analysis of the Group's financial situation, during 2011 there was a reduction in the tariff deficit pending collection of &#x20AC;2.257 billion going from &#x20AC;5.248 billion at the end of 2010 to &#x20AC;2.991 billion at the end of 2011. 11 further issues have been made between private and public issues amounting to close to &#x20AC;10 billion, of which &#x20AC;2,961 million correspond to Iberdrola.</p>
          <p>Also the new government has continued with the policy of securitizing the deficit and in the two first months of the year, 10 new further issues have been made through private placements amounting to &#x20AC;2.4 billion, of which &#x20AC;732 million correspond to Iberdrola, which improves even further our comfortable financial position.</p>
          <p>In recent days, it seems that there have been new operations and this would mean that we would receive around &#x20AC;1 billion in the first months of 2012. In 2011, Iberdrola had &#x20AC;1,141 million in new deficit, which represents approximately &#x20AC;4.50 billion overall for the system and it has collected &#x20AC;437 million in the usual settlements through the tariff.</p>
          <p>The company has continued with its policy to strengthen the balance sheet in 2011. Net debt grew slightly to &#x20AC;31,706 million because of the acquisition of Elektro and the purchasing of the minority shares of Iberdrola Renovables partially offset by Qatar and the Group's cash flow generation. Leverage reached 48.8% including deficit of 46.4% excluding it.</p>
          <p>The balance sheet strengthening policy and the growth achieved in operating cash flow generation make it possible for the company to increase the strength of its financial ratios including the tariff deficit in such a way that ratios have stayed at the levels that the agencies required for the rating A- to A3. It must be highlighted that Moody's after the recent drop in the Kingdom of Spain has maintained our rating and stable prospects.</p>
          <p>The ratio with respect to net debt is 21.4% if we include the tariff deficit pending collection. The ratio is 19.5% versus 19.1% last year. The ratio of retained cash flow over net debt is 18.9%. If we include the tariff deficit pending collection, the ratio improves to 17.2% from 16.7% in 2010. And we can also highlight our excellent liquidity position. We currently have &#x20AC;9.294 billion in liquidity and available credit lines. Of the total, less than &#x20AC;2 billion mature before 2014. Therefore, we have a strong liquidity position that enabled us to cover 24 months of financial needs. Especially if we compare it with the debts maturity profiles, where in 2012 we only have &#x20AC;1.880 billion and &#x20AC;2.778 billion in 2013, there's no excessive concentration of maturities in any year and the forecast is suitable for a company with the financial strength of Iberdrola. The average life of debt has gone to 6.3 years from 6.2 years, and now Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro will comment on the regulation issues.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. If anyone thinks that I'm going to give a solution to the sector now, I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you. My aim is to give some objective figures that will enable us to do two things. Use figures to assess many of the proposals that are being made to solve the situation in the sector but there's no real information base for them. And secondly, try to focus the problem because until we know and examine the problem, it's going to be difficult to find a solution.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I'm going to define the tariff deficit. As we know it, which is the difference between the earnings recognized in the sector through its activities and the payments that the regulator obliges the consumers to pay. And since it doesn't coincide, there's a negative difference or against this which is what we call the tariff deficit.</p>
          <p>This tariff deficit has been financed through a Royal Decree by five companies. In fact, three companies financed 90% of the deficit with a financial cost, which is the Euribor minus spreads, and which we accept because we were told that this was a temporary one-year financing, and therefore, with a really low cost. The fact is that these have been multi-annual financing. We haven't collected 2006 yet and we still have financial costs without a spread. So we are evaluating what the financial costs are that haven't been recognized and they amount to more than &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>This problem, which initially had a dimension that could be taken on, has grown exponentially as of 2008, with the coming into operation of what we call the photovoltaic bubble. At this point, the deficit pending securitization, I think Pepe Sainz mentioned it, for the sector is around &#x20AC;7 billion. Including in the &#x20AC;7 billion, the ex-anti and ex-post deficit for 2011 and the ex-anti deficit for 2012.</p>
          <p>The history of the deficit has changed over the years. When it started in the year 2000 I think it was because of volatility in electricity output in Spain, which was very much affected by the price of fuels and the hydroelectric resources led to volatility in generation costs. And the generator wanted to flattened those costs by saying I'll drop them when the actual cost is low and I'll increase them in the opposite situation so I won't pass on this volatility to the consumer. This initially was a good idea but as of 2005, as we can see on the chart, it became a structural issue. And instead of flattening the volatility in generation costs, it hid the actual environmental cost that the sector was incurring and it has become a structural deficit that amounts to around &#x20AC;5 billion.</p>
          <p>So we can now start to define the problem. We have the problem that we need to reduce the annual cost of supply by around &#x20AC;5 billion and we have to find a solution to an accumulated debt of around &#x20AC;24 billion.</p>
          <p>And let's see what we can analyze to solve the problem. This chart shows what all electric energy consumers have paid in 2010, &#x20AC;37 billion and where this money has gone. Well, 20% of that money has gone to the inland revenue, VAT, and the electricity levy. 30% has gone to pay the regulatory decisions that have been made, that have nothing to do with supply and that have been made by the regulator over the years. That's 30% of the cost for the sector and in 2010 amounts to &#x20AC;11 billion. And on the left, we have the conventional costs. In other words, the production costs at market price and it includes all the output of renewable energy at market price. And the second blue square, the costs of the transport and distribution in Spain, which amount to &#x20AC;6.9 billion.</p>
          <p>And two very clear messages here, if I take away the left side of the chart, the sector continues to provide energy with the same guarantee of supply and at a price that is half the price the consumer is currently paying. Secondly, the associated costs decided by the regulator amount to the same as the total production costs and they are almost double the transport and conventional distribution costs. And I think that this chart gives us various clues on where the solution to the problem may lie.</p>
          <p>Regarding the associated costs, which as you will remember represented &#x20AC;11 billion, part of it are the premiums for the special regime and another part, which are various costs and decisions made by the regulator. The first is not having transferred to the tariff the total supply costs. This has generated a deficit, a debt that has had to be paid. Therefore, the first part of this associated costs are the annuities that have to be paid for the tariff deficit from previous years.</p>
          <p>There's an added cost because of the extra peninsular compensation and by law, this ought to be included in the national budget. There's an energy savings and efficiency plan that I don't know why has to be funded by the Spanish generators. And there's an interruptibility service or a cut-off service that is paid at a price that is 10 times higher than the price paid by conventional generators. And there's an added cost for domestic coal to guarantee the purchasing of around 29 million tons per year. All these decisions that have nothing to do with the cost of supply represent &#x20AC;3.299 billion.</p>
          <p>And now we're going to slowly analyze whether the problem lies in generation earnings or somewhere else. This curve on the right shows the evolution since 2003 of the average monthly prices of the Spanish spot market and the average monthly prices of the European spot prices. And we can see that both lines practically run in parallel and this is logical because the power stations that establish the marginal cost are the same and they have the same price.</p>
          <p>But even though the curves are very close together, I would like to highlight that in these eight years the average price in Spain of the spot market has been &#x20AC;4 lower than the average European price and when I say &#x20AC;4, and I multiply it by the output which is close to 300 terawatts per year. This means that the Spanish consumer has paid for energy &#x20AC;1.2 billion less than the European consumer just on the energy side.</p>
          <p>And this trend has continued in 2011 where the average price in Spain was &#x20AC;49 and the average price in Europe was close to &#x20AC;54, &#x20AC;5 difference. And this is also being seen in 2012, where 2012 futures in Spain are around &#x20AC;52 and in Europe they're above &#x20AC;57. So therefore I don't believe that the remuneration for the generation activity in Spain causes the increase in the cost of supplier.</p>
          <p>Another important point and this is a defensive slide, it's often said that the hydroelectric power plants and the nuclear power plants are over amortized and that all the money we receive goes to our operating results. Well, hydroelectric plants have &#x20AC;6.828 billion to be amortized and they have an average amortization period of 25 years. The hydroelectric plants are amortized over 60 years. Of the 15,000 installed megawatts in Spain in hydroelectric plants, only 600 are over 60 years. Therefore, all the rest have part of their assets pending amortization and the same goes for nuclear power plants. There are &#x20AC;7 billion to be amortized over an accounting life of 40 years and there is still 13 years ago. And this leads to an amortization rate close to &#x20AC;500 million and this is approximately equal to the recurring investments we have to make in these power plants. And this means that the net fixed assets at the Spanish nuclear power plants is going to remain constant and has been constant for the last five years. So it's unlikely that we're going to be able to reduce the net fixed asset amortization for these facilities.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>So let's move on now to distribution to see if we have paid a lot or not.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>At the end of last year, they commissioned a study to analyze the distribution costs of most of the European countries. And this distribution cost &#x2013; well, in order to compare it, three ratios were used. And that is total revenues, not costs, but total revenues divided by peak megawatts and total revenues divided by megawatts hour in circulation and total revenues divided by the kilometers of lines.</p>
          <p>So in all three measures, the unitary revenue in Spain has been lower compared to the European figures. If we focus now on the middle column, which is where you have the comparative ratio that is used most frequently in Spain, per megawatt hour, we've received &#x20AC;2 less than the European average and if we were to multiply that by the 300 teras of power in circulation, it means that from the point of view of transport &#x2013; no, from the point of view of distribution rather it means that the average Spanish consumer has paid &#x20AC;600 million less than the average European consumer, &#x20AC;600 million that have to be added on to the overall &#x20AC;1,000 and something million that I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>So as regards transportation &#x2013; no, as regards production and transport and distribution, it means that the average Spanish consumer has paid lower rates compared to the European average and it's something like 10% lower than the figure reported for the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>And the outcome of what I was going to call low revenues, yes and I have to use that term is that the relationship between the operating profit before interest and after taxes divided by the net fixed assets related to generation, transportation and distribution in Spain. And these are all of the UNESA companies, we're talking about a figure ranging between 4% to 5%. When the work that has been allocated by the market to the sector totals 6.7% or in other words in the last six years, the Spanish Electricity business has destroyed value, destroyed worth. And these are objective data and they have been analyzed by the auditors. And once we've looked into, what I call, conventional activities that had to do with the transportation, generation and distribution, let's see if the problem is related to the non-conventional activities, which are the renewables.</p>
          <p>This is a chart that was made by the European Commission of Regulators. The first column shows the objective that has been allocated to each country by the EU as regards the presence of renewables. In other words, France has a commitment and what they have stated is that 23% of the primary power they consume have to come from renewables, and then Spain is 20% and so on and so forth. So this chart delivers two messages. If we materially focus more on France and Italy, the general power objective as regard to penetration in terms of primary power, primary energy, is very similar, well, perhaps somewhat greater, it's fairly similar to the allocation that the government has given to the electrical business in terms of the penetration of renewables, in other words relative to this figure of 23% in primary power.</p>
          <p>And as regards the Electricity business, this objective has been transformed into 27%. So in other words, renewables are going to be implemented in other areas and in particular they're talking about transportation and they're talking about heating and cooling. And in the case of Italy, exactly the same thing applies. It does not transfer all of its objectives to the Electricity business.</p>
          <p>And as you can see, in Italy, the Electricity business has achieved its goals. But in countries like Spain and Germany, what they have done is this objective, this penetration target for renewables relative to primary power has been transferred practically 100% to the Electricity business. So that means that the penetration of renewables in Spain is much greater than what they have in France and Italy. We're talking about something that ranges between 38% and 40%. And in the case of Germany, it's somewhat similar.</p>
          <p>And that is what the second column says. And this clearly establishes energy policies in European countries that are very different. And then the third column says what was achieved in 2010. And in 2010 in Spain in the Electricity business, the goals have been achieved. And the only thing we have to do to maintain this is introduce more renewables as demand grows but as demand is decreasing this goal without doing anything in particular is being fulfilled. It's being achieved. And we are the first in achieving this goal compared to another country where they've made an enormous effort as regards the implementation of renewables like Germany where they are only at a level of 17% of penetration and they have to climb up to 39% in places like the UK where they have 7% and they have to reach 31% penetration but we are definitely the leaders in this race without a doubt.</p>
          <p>So what is the consequence of all this? And this is a chart that I'm sure that you've already seen and it also comes from the Renewables Council. The size of these circles shows the cost of volume that is being taken onboard by the Electricity business as a consequence of the arrival of renewables. We are also in the lead in Spain, well this shows the year 2010, where you can see that the additional cost related to renewables total &#x20AC;5.7 billion. What does that mean? Well it means essentially that each consumer has to pay &#x20AC;22 to maintain this renewables policy, &#x20AC;22 vis-&#xE0;-vis a total sales price of something like &#x20AC;110.</p>
          <p>So we're talking about surcharge, tariff surcharge that reaches 20%. And the next country behind us is Germany. And they've made a very similar effort, very similar to Spain, and they are applying only &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour in the form of a surcharge. In other words, half compared to Spain. And if we compare ourselves with other places like France and Italy where they've implemented a completely different energy policy, France is applying a &#x20AC;0.01 surcharge and Italy is applying a &#x20AC;0.07 surcharge. So in other words, we are placing our industrial consumers in a completely anticompetitive position.</p>
          <p>But if we now focus on the vertical segment, in other words, those that are being underneath Spain, those that already have a degree of penetration in terms of renewables similar to Spain something like 30-odd percent. And here I'm referring to Portugal and Denmark where they have made a very significant effort. We can see that with the same level of penetration, they have a cost or they are applying a cost to the user and in the case of Denmark, it's one-third of the cost we are applying in Spain. So there have to be some problems somewhere along the line in terms of planning and execution in the case of our renewables plan.</p>
          <p>So looking at this from a more demagogic angle, these are the data we have from the year 2010. And in 2010 energy in Spain, the nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced 85 terawatts whereas the PV power stations and thermosolar hybrid stations, and I'll tell you why we call them that, produced one-ninth of that figure. But if we talk about revenues recognized and related to these activities, you can say that both activities had the same costs associated to them. And if we were to extrapolate this to the year 2013, I can guarantee that the yellow column you can see on the right would practically be multiplied by two and the blue column you can see on the left would remain constant. So in other words, what we are doing is, we're not being very rational about this by the way, but what we are doing is increasing our future supply costs.</p>
          <p>This is a slide where you can see many sources of information because I know that this is going to be very criticized by people. But now let's see at this point in time the thermosolar stations that are commissioned in 2012 and 2013 especially if they have storage facilities and I think that practically all of them have facilities of this kind. What's the current regulation system, in other words with the premiums that have been defined for the next 30 to 40 years they are guaranteed an internal rate of return after tax, 15.6% and this is a regulated activity because 90% of the revenues are defined by the regulator and the same applies to distribution and transportation.</p>
          <p>So the first question would be why is that that regulated activity, why is that that it has this figure 15% whereas other regulated activities have a figure of 7%? So what is the difference? But it's not only that, but also in terms of distribution, every four years the remuneration system is modified. And here they have modified the revenues for the next 40 years, which means to say that if the revenues have been defined it means that leverage could be very strong indeed. And we have worked out the capital profitability should there be an 80% level of leverage and you know that leverage is of that level. And the profitability of the capital invested stands at something like 40% per year.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to make a number of remarks that have to do with the energy policy although relative to the future, which I think that any planner has to do this kind of work, but firstly let's see, and the first question one would have to put to our citizens considering the current situation we have in terms of penetration of renewables is what would they prefer that renewables be produced although we increase conventional production and conventional production is &#x20AC;61 megawatts per hour whereas in the case of renewables, we're talking about something from &#x20AC;70 to &#x20AC;300 megawatts per hour. And that's the first question we should ask ourselves.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, if we want to produce renewables, what renewables should we produce? Those that cost &#x20AC;70 megawatt hour or those that cost &#x20AC;300 megawatt hour because at the end of the day, it is the citizens that are going to be footing the bill at the end of the process. And the third question that I think is the most important of them all is what should we spend &#x20AC;300 megawatt hour per year on? Should we use it to guarantee a demand of one megawatt hour per year which is costing us &#x20AC;300 or should we use this money to improve industrial processes or domestic processes so that we can upgrade efficiency and reduce the demand we have in terms of megawatts hour and the outcome is the same, from the point of view of CO2 emissions it would be much better to reduce demand.</p>
          <p>And in the case of these festivities I think that the annual cost in 2013 will be something like &#x20AC;2 billion. And if we were to spend &#x20AC;2 billion every year for every single year in order to improve the efficiency of our industrial processes, that's well without really working out the figures, I think that it would be far more profitable but whoever is going to draw out the plans or the energy plans will certainly have to do this.</p>
          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>And another question, of the three main sources of renewable energy, new ones, wind power, photovoltaic and thermosolar hybrid and I'll say more about this, they've all been regulated and therefore, as regulated resources, they all ought to have the same reasonable profitability rate because I think this is an obligation of the regulator. But wind power has a premium of &#x20AC;20 per megawatt hour guaranteed for 20 years and wind power is a renewable energy that emits no CO2 that consumes no water.</p>
          <p>If we go to photovoltaic energy, the premium I think is &#x20AC;70, the new one, &#x20AC;70 per megawatt hour. It doesn't emit any CO2 either and it needs small amounts of water for flushing and thermosolar hybrid energy has a premium of around &#x20AC;280 per megawatt hour I think guaranteed for 25 years growing at a rate of the Consumer Price Index minus 0.5.</p>
          <p>And as of 2026 until the end of the installation, it has a guarantee of 80% of the premium which according to my estimates will be around &#x20AC;700 per megawatt hour. And it's also a renewable energy that emits CO2. Bearing in mind that legally they can use up to 15% natural gas for salt, heating, et cetera, the CO2 they emit is approximately half that of a combined cycle. Therefore, it's not so renewable. And since it's a thermal power plant, it consumes around 10 cubic meters per megawatt hour like any other thermal power plant.</p>
          <p>And I'll end with some final comments. This is not objective data. What's some of the problem we've had in Spain? I have no doubt that the people responsible for defining the Energy Policy is the government and in the government, the Ministry of Industry probably and the Ministry for the Environment. And they have the responsibility of managing the implementation of that energy policy. Well, when that energy policy is fundamentally based on state aid, the second obligation that the planner has is to first see how am I going to pay for that state aid, and secondly, what is the total amount of that state aid and how am I going to calculate it?</p>
          <p>In other words, of that state aid that is a complement to the Energy Policy as I define it, I first have to decide who's going to pay for it. In the U.S., it was very clear, all citizens paid. And therefore, it was turned into tax incentives for the developers of that kind of facility. In other cases, I think it's the case in Germany but I'm not too sure, when we're putting all the responsibility into the hands of the electricity sector and therefore the electricity sector covers all the cost, it doesn't make sense for the electricity consumers to have to take on this burden because it goes against the provisions of the International Energy Agency. And their first objective is to electrify consumption and to electrify consumption, we have to make electricity consumption competitive compared to other forms of energy consumption. If all the environmental costs are passed on to electricity and is paid for by the electricity consumers, then we're doing exactly the opposite of what the International Energy Agency is saying. But the regulator can decide to have the electricity consumers pay for it.</p>
          <p>What has happened in Spain? Well, first of all, it hasn't been said who's going to pay for this indirect state aid. It seems that it has to be paid for by the electricity consumers. It seems that way because it's included in the tariff or they include it when they calculate the tariff but it disappears in the final price for the tariff.</p>
          <p>So far, this environmental cost hasn't been paid for by anyone, it's been funded by three companies and nobody has paid for it for the time being. Secondly, how much? The government has every right to establish the state aid it considers suitable but it has to say until when? What is the limit? Does it make any sense when we are first in class in the penetration of renewables? We continue to invest in renewable facilities and in the most expensive renewable facilities. I think that the first decision made by the Minister in Royal Decree passed in 2012 of giving a moratorium to the plans defined by the government, I think, is a measure of common sense.</p>
          <p>And the third and this also seems very important to me, is how a state aid is assessed. State aid is regulated aid and therefore it should be calculated and I think that this is what the Supreme Court says based on a reasonable profitability. I don't know what the reasonable profitability is. But all regulated activities should have the same reasonable profitability or return. And regulated activities in Spain do not have the same reasonable profitability.</p>
          <p>I'll finish with this. I've tried to give some clues on what we shouldn't do and which parts we should follow to try to solve the problems in the sector. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that Jos&#xE9; Luis has given us a magnificent presentation on what's been happening in this country and what we have to do to use common sense, rationality and equality. And I'm going to say it in different words. So the first message is that there's a solution to the deficit problem. It has a solution and this solution means adopting measures, measures beyond those already approved by the government and as I said, they're going in the right direction but they're insufficient.</p>
          <p>First of all, I think that we have to stop right away the construction of the most costly renewable energy whether assigned or pre-assigned, the country cannot afford it.</p>
          <p>And secondly, the hybrid solar technologies, as Jos&#xE9; Luis said, those technologies that use gas and sun that had generated an unsustainable bubble has already occurred with photovoltaic energy some years ago. And secondly, that all the regulated activities, all of them and he said so too, should receive the same regulated remuneration. The WACC is the same WACC for all and therefore they should all follow non-discriminatory criteria, a reasonable criteria regarding profitability. Those are the existing ones and the future one. I say existing and future ones because when we talk about retroactivity, I think this is a mistake. Retroactive is getting back what has been taken away but not modifying what was done wrong in the past. We're paying for nuclear levies we weren't paying in 2006 and we're paying them now. That doesn't mean they are retroactive.</p>
          <p>They've been applied now for a number of circumstances; municipal taxes, autonomous region taxes, remuneration for the networks. In the U.S., we are building a line in the state of Maine. And there has been an agreement and they've said we'll have to review this. But anyway, every two, three, four, five years in the U.S. or the UK and in Spain, the remuneration conditions are reviewed. Nothing lasts forever. And thinking that today we can define systems where the remuneration 60 years from now will be defined today and say, oh well, we've done this on the retroactive basis. I don't think that's realistic. So they should all have the same levy.</p>
          <p>We can discuss what the WACC should be. We've been discussing the transport line in the UK where there should be five, six, seven, 6.5 but in the end everyone should be at the same level. On the other hand, we ought to reconsider all those costs included in the electric tariff eliminating those that have nothing to do with supply and that should not be borne by the consumers since they are items related to social, territorial or environmental policies. We already pay taxes for that. We're paying &#x20AC;2 billion in taxes every year. So those taxes should be used for those purposes and we shouldn't have to pay them twice.</p>
          <p>Issues such as energy efficiency, et cetera, I don't want to dwell on it. And also all the costs caused by the development of renewable technologies should be shared by all the energy sectors. Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro also mentioned it, the difference is in the case of Spain all the burden is put on a single sector, the electricity sector, to achieve the renewable objectives. While in other countries, they are shared by other sectors. I think that the environment is the responsibility of everyone and therefore all of it should contribute and not just a part of the consumers.</p>
          <p>And also the earnings generated through future auctions of CO2, which will be held as of 2013, should be signed to fund these technologies, and this is what the European directives say. And following with these European directives for the single market where the pseudo environmental regional levy should be harmonized. In other words, those that are the tax activities in the electricity sector but which have nothing to do with the environment related criteria but where you get nothing in exchange here. And as I said, we have to follow the European Union criteria, single environmental criteria and not different ideas on how to tax something.</p>
          <p>The electricity sector bears a lot of these state, regional, local levies and as we've seen, they are going up significantly. But there's already a tax in the bill, an electricity tax that is for this purpose to fund the autonomous regions. We don't need to invent new tax models. There's already a tax we'll pay on our bill that has this purpose and it should be adjusted in a uniform manner and also shared in an equitable way. And also access tariffs, especially in those quarters where there are lower energy prices. This government has done it also with common sense in the first quarter of the year. These tolls can be reviewed without seriously affecting the consumer and it would also be good to go back to some measures that existed in 2009 to provide incentives for energy efficiency and which were made to disappear. We don't know quite why because they did help energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we'll also move forward more in that market liberalization. Theoretically, we say that the market has liberalized but there are still 20 million consumers attached to the official tariff and this seems a contradiction.</p>
          <p>And while all these measures are implemented, this deficit funding, if it continues to exist it should be shared by all the agents that carry out electric activities in Spain and not just by these five companies or mainly three companies that have been doing it. And this funding should be actual funding. We're not banks and we're funding activities that aren't our obligation. If we're already generously helping at least the costs, the financial costs we're incurring should be paid for and finally it's also fundamental to speed up the securitization of this deficit. It's being done but it shouldn't slow down. We have to do everything we can to eliminate these burdens from our balance sheet, which affect our debt ratios.</p>
          <p>And going back again to this issue, I think that with these results we are presenting what I mean to say is that once again the diversification of our business portfolio and the management business focused on efficiency and the growing internationalization of the Group and the financial stability have allowed us to over some this very complicated environment in which we live. The operating accounts present increases in terms of the gross margin and in the net operating profits and in the net recurrent profits.</p>
          <p>So there's a growing contribution made by the regulated renewable business that counteract the evolution of the liberalized business that has been affected by the situation of the British market and has been strongly penalized by the increase in levies, especially in Spain where as we mentioned previously, these levies have been multiplied by two in the last two years and they now account for 33% of the EBITDA we generate in that business.</p>
          <p>Cash flow for the first time has surpassed &#x20AC;6 billion or that means a 5.8% increase and net profits now stand at about &#x20AC;2.8 billion in spite of the modifications made, totaling &#x20AC;402 million. So with these results, the Board is going to submit a remuneration to the shareholder of at least &#x20AC;0.326 per share as in the previous fiscal year.</p>
          <p>So if the year we have just closed is complicated, 2012 doesn't look much better. And I think that the growth programs have been presented today. And in the case of Spain compared to November when they spoke about 0.7% growth and now it seems that there are two or three points and something of the difference. And this is going to affect the economic activities of our country and of other European nations too.</p>
          <p>So we are facing economic conditions that are adverse and this means that recovery seems to be taking longer than we expected it to. In the last three years, the conditions in our environment have worsened significantly. In our sector, there's been a reduction both in demand and in the prices; in some of our main markets, the wind margins have been reduced. And in some countries, there's been a change in the regulatory environment and that means that we've had to adapt our investments plan and we've had to stop the expansion plan we already have up and running.</p>
          <p>And the levies supporting the liberalized business have been increased significantly in recent years. And the interest rates of the dollar and the pound vis-&#xE0;-vis the euro have evolved very badly or worse than we expected. So in view of this negative evolution and something that is affecting our results in this first quarter, Iberdrola has reacted by focusing more on efficiency and on improving its businesses whose growth is going to arise from a greater contribution made by the regulated business that represent more than 50%. And not only that, but the additional efforts we're making now to control costs and to improve financial management and to strictly fulfill our policy related to the adaptation of investments to the duration of cash flow are our main tools to do something about the current situation. So even if these negative circumstances prevail, we could fulfill our growth forecast in the lower range of the EBITDA and that is about 5%. So that means that we would grow slightly below this figure in terms of the net recurrent profits but if we maintain this figure it means that our remuneration per share could be maintained at similar levels as is mentioned by our dividends policy. But in any case you could all rest assure that all of us working for this company will carry on working as hard as possible so that this business model called Iberdrola will maximize results throughout the next few months. But in any case thank you very much for your attention and now we'll move on to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let's start up with the questions in the room, please. Victor, you have the floor and then Jorge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. My name is Victor Peiro and in relation to this policy that is all about adopting investments to cash flows. Could you please say something about the investments plan? What are your forecasts in relation to the business in the future years or at least for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we'll send you the exact figures but it's a bit of &#x20AC;5 billion &#x2013; just over &#x20AC;4 billion. I haven't got this by countries but we'll send you the information in any case. But considering the figures I think that we should consider the UK as the first destination. And second would come the Spanish Regulated business and the third destination should be in Latin America. That's what I think, divided by geographic areas. And by businesses, the Regulated business comes first followed by Renewables and a small proportion for the Liberalized business and correct me if I'm wrong, Paco.</p>
          <p>So priority for the Regulated business, secondly, it would be Renewables that's going to drop significantly. We're talking about something like &#x20AC;1 billion, correct me if I'm wrong, Xabier, and the Liberalized business. And here now they're giving it to me, 55% for the Regulated business, 32% for Renewables, 13% for the Liberalized business and the total figure is something like &#x20AC;4 billion. That would be the total amount of investments that have been established for this fiscal year. Jorge Alonso, please.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm Jorge Alonso from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I have a couple of questions for you. And in view of the current situation of the market, in which businesses do you think you're going to come across more difficulties next year and in which segments do you think there will be improvements?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in view of the fact that the rate of growth seems to be somewhat lower than what had been expected and you seem to be at the lower end of the range, I would like to know if this is going to produce CapEx adjustments, mid-term adjustments or would it be possible to carry out a divestiture plan or would it be possible to activate a plan to cut back costs in order to increase efficiency in view of these difficulties? And the last question has to do with Brazil. Could you give us some up-to-date information on how the negotiations stand in terms of energy and your operating expectations relative to 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that I already mentioned this before and what is very clear is we are talking about investment in regulated businesses. Most of our investments now have been allocated to that specific area, and what I said before is that in the case of the transportation grids in the UK, we're talking about &#xA3;2.6 billion in the next few years in the grid system, we're talking about another &#x20AC;2 billion in the Regulated business in the United States.</p>
          <p>We, on average, stand at $500 million to $600 million per year of investments, committed investments, and in the case of renewables, we have a number of offshore farms basically in the UK under construction that are also &#x2013; well some are onshore too and we're talking about &#x20AC;700 million to &#x20AC;800 million. And where we will have less, obviously, has to do with the New Generation business.</p>
          <p>With the exception of Latin America, where, yes we are investing in new generation, fundamentally, hydroelectrical, but let's say that most of the investments in the next three or four years will go into the Regulated business in the UK and the United States and Spain it goes without saying, and Brazil.</p>
          <p>As regards expenses, well once again our efficiency is improving. We are growing and our expenses are increasing much less than what our gross margin is growing. So in other words, we are increasing the top range and we're controlling expenses and we'll continue along the same lines. There are plans for this year and we will continue to stress this.</p>
          <p>And as regards Brazil, well, we are still carrying out negotiations. Well, this week it's the Carnival week so there are no negotiations underway but next week we will continue. But basically, as I say that we are subject to a confidentiality agreement, I can't give you any details just now but we are looking into it and we only hope that over the next few months, we'll be able to sign a definitive agreement on what we've mentioned some time ago as regards taking a position that would allow us to consolidate our businesses, especially in the area of new energy as soon as we have Elektro fully integrated and onboard.</p>
          <p>The next question from Pablo Cuadrado, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning. I'm from Merrill Lynch. I have three or four questions only for you. And the first question would be that after listening to Jos&#xE9; Luis San Pedro in relation to the lack of amortization in the case of hydraulic (sic) [hydroelectric] facilities and nuclear power plants, do you think that it makes any sense for us to talk about hydraulic (sic) [hydroelectric] levies and nuclear levies or the lack of amortization? I'm saying this because perhaps you could give us some figures in terms of the profitability of these plants and perhaps it's not just something silly that other people in the industrial sector say.</p>
          <p>But perhaps, you could also give us some indication, I'm not sure if you've read the newspaper this morning and it was said that the Ministry might propose a modification in the prices of electricity in Spain, setting maximum and minimum levels and could you &#x2013; or do you have any news on that particular development or do you know anything about it?</p>
          <p>And then I would also like to ask you about the prospects of the Renewable business in 2012, especially as regards the United States because there is no PTC or there will be no PTC as from 2013. Could you give us some figures of facilities per megawatt and EBITDA considering this year's EBITDA?</p>
          <p>And two very quick questions. One, for Pepe, is there any kind of negative movement in terms of working capital this year? We're talking about a figure of 31.7% and could you give us, Pepe, could you please say something about the effective tax rate for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can answer the first question. I'm going to answer the second question. I also read that in the newspaper although we have no information but what I understand is that what they mean to say is that it's the path towards liberalization. As you know, I come from the world of telecommunications and when the sector was completely liberated in the field of mobile telephony and this happened with the petrol stations before and with oil. But before fully opening up everything, we went through a period of what we call communicated prices. So before releasing the tariff, you had to report that tariff and you had to notify that tariff and if you didn't get an answer in 15 days, that tariff was made effective and you could apply it.</p>
          <p>So I think that this has to do with increasing liberalization and it doesn't have to do with increasing intervention. I think it has to do with the fact that there's 20 million people that are still connected to an official tariff can choose as occurred with telecommunications. So instead of having official tariffs, official telephony tariffs, we move on to what we have nowadays, which is something that is a totally open system. And there was this transition period so to speak, so these communicated prices if they told you, well, look this isn't correct, they stop you and if not they could be fully applied in 15 days. But I think that that's what this means. Although we don't have more information on what is mentioned in the newspaper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to say after what I said I'm fed up of this term. Well, perhaps we'd have to talk about solar for profits because those are true profits that come from the sun and not the other ones that don't come from the wind, the windfall profit. Well, some guru that knows this very well, said all this business about windfall profits is a slogan and to destroy a slogan you need to have a treaty, you need to do a Ph.D. I'm afraid that I have not done that but what I did do and all of those that have spoken about solutions, everybody spoke about windfall profit. Nobody gave any figures but everybody used the term itself, windfall profit.</p>
          <p>But I've chosen three nuclear power stations that we own and since the year we generated data and that dates back to 1988, which is when the stable framework commenced. And for each year I have the revenues received, we have the operating and maintenance expenses, and I also have figures on recurrent investments and repurchase of fuel and the net cash flow that the power station had.</p>
          <p>And I've covered all these nuclear power stations from 1988 until 2012, and as from 2012 what I thought is the cash that they generate is to remained constant until the end of their lifecycle and we've considered a figure of 40 years only. But the power station that has the lowest rate, well three of them, which operate perfectly well and the nuclear power station with the lowest rate of return is 4.3% after tax. And the one with the highest level of profitability has a figure of 7.1% after taxes.</p>
          <p>And not only that, but let's say that the maximum level of profitability was obtained during the years of the legal stable framework. And the less profitability &#x2013; they achieved less profitability after deregulation of the markets. I was looking around for the windfall profits and I can swear that I never found them. So, in other words, we're talking about profitability levels that are lower than those of the Distribution business and if I were to compare these profitabilties with other conventional technologies that I don't even want to name here, it would be like approximately double those we've obtained with the nuclear power stations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the issue of the PTCs in the U.S., we're going to see what happens after the elections and the new government. There are elections this year, so we're going to see if It's a plan that's going to be extended or not. It's going to be up to 2012 and in 2013, we'll see what the new government decides. Regarding the working capital, Pepe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, regarding the working capital. Since the working capital includes the tariff deficit, it's dropped. I think it's around &#x20AC;1.3 billion and if you exclude the tariff deficit, it's true that there's been an increase this year because of a number of payments that were made in January 2011. But basically, that will be normalized in the coming years. Regarding the tax rate, it will be around 25% as it was other years. That's more or less the recurring tax rate we have. And regarding the investments of Renewables and EBITDA, we've had a poor fourth quarter because of the wind power situation and we are expecting a growth of more than 10% in the Renewables business in 2012 and investments will be over &#x20AC;1 billion, around &#x20AC;1.2 billion, &#x20AC;1.3 billion. Next question from the room? Yes, Virginia? And then Philippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, I am Virginia Sanz from Deutsche Bank. I had some questions regarding 2012. I see that in the UK, retail sales have dropped considerably, and you've been the only company that hasn't lowered prices yet this year. I would like to know whether you could also lose more market share this year.</p>
          <p>And then could Pepe give us some indications on what the debt costs could be, since you've done practically all the refinancing? And this year your strategic plan comes to an end. Do you intend to present something new for the coming years or are you going to wait to see how the regulatory issue evolves here in Spain?</p>
          <p>And this is a question to try to understand where things are going. In your presentation and today, and at Natural Gas yesterday on regulatory issues, that's one thing, but what comes out in the press every day is fairly alarming as to what the government could do. Do you think they are listening to you? That all these presentations are going to bring something positive for the sector or could we find ourselves facing a negative surprise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll answer the first question is very easy. We have dropped prices in the UK. We have dropped gas prices, how much was it? 5% as of February 28, I think. And what I can say is that we are recovering customers regarding the ones we lost last year. Not only are we not losing, we are recovering customers right now and regarding the government, well, what I can say is that the first measure they've taken is a measure that we've been saying for some time to stop building or stop allocating further new technologies. So I think that they have listened to us in that area.</p>
          <p>And I want to say this and say it very loud, there are three words that this government keeps repeating, that they want to govern with common sense, they want to govern with justice and with a sense of equality. These are three words they repeat over and over again. And I think that common sense says why produce energy at &#x20AC;300 that isn't sustainable, that produces CO2 and consumes water when you have renewable technologies that cost &#x20AC;70 and solar photovoltaic energies that cost &#x20AC;100.</p>
          <p>Somebody has to explain that, otherwise it seems they say common sense or economic equality. And economic equality also says that it seems that power stations that Jos&#xE9; Luis mentioned that have returns of 4%, 5%, 6% or Regulated businesses with a similar return and there are others that have returns of 14%, 16%, 17% it seems that that isn't economic equality or a sense of justice. So I have a great deal of confidence in that the measures they take will follow those three directions, justice, common sense and economic equality, and unfortunately in this sector there hasn't been too much of that. We've been wildly building the most costly plants. We've seen the solar bubble in Spain, all the solar bubbles that are being generated in Spain. We've seen costs that haven't been reflected in the final prices and a number of companies have been providing the funding and that's put them in an unfavorable situation. So I have to say that I absolutely trust and these first measures we're taking go in this direction of equality, common sense and justice and that's something to be appreciated. Regarding the cost of debt, Pepe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we expect a cost the same as this year, 4.6%, with a debt that we expect to be of less than &#x20AC;30 billion, although financial expenses could go up somewhat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The exchange rates fortunately are in our favor. But the cost of debt is exactly the same as that of 2011 in our budget. And of course, like every year, we're going to have an Investor Day. We will hold that during the first semester, won't we Pepe? Have you set the date, more or less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, since the government will probably bring out the measures, well, probably during the first semester we'll hold the Investor Day and of course, we will review our forecast for 2013 and the coming years. Next question?</p>
          <p>Philippe Ourpatian and then Javier Garrido.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm from Natixis, I have two questions. The first one is dedicated to Iberdrola Renovables. Looking at the U.S. market, could we have the path of your installed capacity, which remain today market oriented means without any PPA because you have signed some big PPA starting beginning of this year and could we have just the share between the capacity under contract and which are market oriented?</p>
          <p>And the second is about the liberalized market in the UK, in your slide you are showing quite optimistic view for 2012, could we share the main points of this optimism regarding the liberalized market in the UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Xabier, will you answer the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This year 2011, we've had a production of between long-term PPAs and what was hedged on the short term, the total production in the U.S. was covered to an extent of about 88%, 90%. The facilities for 2012, they all have a close PPA except for a marginal part of 39 megawatts, the rest has PPAs so we're going to maintain this level of coverage.</p>
          <p>Paco, will you answer the question about the UK?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes three highlights. A decrease in supply costs of fuels, we're buying better and we expect to have better costs than in 2011. On the other hand, an increase in production, we're also seeing spreads that enable us to foresee an increase in production.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, an increase in sales as a result of the deployment of channels and commercial activities that are improving that deployment of channels and therefore sales, all three are going in a positive direction and that is what improves the expectations for the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Javier Garrido.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Javier Garrido from JPMorgan. I have three questions. The first regarding the guidance on the evolution in the EBITDA and net recurring profit. Just to clarify, the base year is still 2009 because the slide said 2010, 2012, but I believe it's the same as the strategic plan. The base year is still 2009?</p>
          <p>Okay. The second question regards the Liberalized business in the UK, you've just given the three drivers on why there's going to be an improvement in profitability. My question is, with that improvement in profitability in 2012 or that you expect for 2012, is that enough to prevent future impairments in the UK business and the question comes because the impairments in 2011 are related to future events, the carbon floor, the CCS project. But are the spreads expected in 2012 enough or will it be necessary to continue to improve those spreads later on to avoid future impairments?</p>
          <p>And the third question for Iberdrola Renovables, I believe that the year 2011, especially the fourth quarter, has been particularly bad regarding the load factor but looking at the record, the load factors are currently lower than those expected in 2007. I would like to know if that's offset by the increase in useful life from 20 to 25 years, or whether you still expect an increase in the Iberdrola Renovables load factors to justify the expectations you had? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first question, Javier, regarding the data we're giving, is average growth taking as a reference 2009, in other words growth in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The average growth through that period is 5% inter-annually, that's the average we're considering. And the same goes for recurring net profit where we're taking the results from 2009 and the average inter-annual growth for that period.</p>
          <p>Regarding impairments, correct me, Pepe. But the impairments in the UK have a name and they call the Longannet plant. The Longannet plant, which is a plant that initially, its activity it was thought could be extended as a result of investments that were going to be made in carbon sequestration in the project. This project finally has not been carried out. The necessary investment is much higher than what the government was willing to fund and therefore, it has been carried out. So this automatically leads to an expectation for the use of that specific plant that is shorter than what we had planned and this is what has been used and this is exactly what the competition had done as a consequence of the fact that they didn't have the CCS project, the carbon sequestration project. So it's something specific related to a specific plant as a result of a specific situation, the non-realization of the carbon sequestration project period, I don't know whether you want to add something on not, Pepe.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yes, I just want to say that we are taking on the liquid prices and stress from the market and then we would assume a recovery in the spreads because the reserve margin is going to drop and there are going to be some shutdowns and that's basically it. And regarding the wind power issues. Xabier, would you like to say something?</p>

          <p>Well last year, the wind didn't blow in Spain and this quarter it's blowing hard. Well it's true what the Chairman said, the seasonality issue in wind power. And also in some areas, the wind drops and in others it rises and what we're seeing in a repetitive way is that we have overall wind variables somewhat lower than expected.</p>
          <p>On the one hand, we're taking two kinds of measures. On the one hand, we're adjusting all our wind analysis models so that they can better respond to a more strict validation criteria. And secondly, we're also increasing equipment availability in order to obtain, let's say, higher operating rate with the same resources. And I would say that there are possibly some adjustments to be made regarding the expectations we had in some areas. And as I said, we're basing this on availability and improvement in operating efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Any more questions from the room?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for accepting my question. I only have one question to avoid any confusions with others. In the presentation, you were talking about proposals to solve the tariff deficit. You should say that this should be shared with the rest of the electricity stakeholders. Are you saying that what we should do is extend the tariff deficit over the years? And basically, my question is it's all well and good for you to identify what the problems are. But I think that at the end of the day, the government is always going to ask you to make sacrifice. So what kind of sacrifice are you willing to make is the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We call this the nuclear tariff but there's a tariff deficit that is going to be &#x20AC;4.8 billion according to the National Energy Commission. And I think that this is something that you're suggesting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've already said. I referred to a part of this because if &#x2013; we've been funding in the last eight years immense amounts, which is making a sacrifice, of course, which have nothing to do with our responsibility, we're playing the banker's role for the government. And I think that that is a big sacrifice but if to that, we were to add on a number of things that we've been paying over the years I think, that what is it? &#x20AC;8 billion or &#x20AC;9 billion? Yes, over the last six or seven years of different kinds of measures or different availability payments or levies of one kind over another or social bonuses, energy efficiency measures, well, you name it and it's an unending list of the things that we have been doing. So we have been the finance funding agents, we're not supposed to be bankers.</p>
          <p>And secondly, we have been permanently providing money for that issue. And thirdly, it seems that it's not reasonable to have levels of profitability below their WACCs and they shouldn't be helping others that have a profitability levels that have1,000 basis points above the WACC whack it seems but the problem is where you're supposed to do something, not what the problem is. If in our sector, we haven't made profitability as a consequence of the Spanish prices applied to traditional activities.</p>
          <p>If we're talking about 10% lower compared to the European average, if the Spanish prices or the Spanish rates are 10% lower than those of the European groups, we are already making a significant effort and that means that the profitability we have in the Spanish business be a profitability that is inadequate or insufficient to maintain such capital intensive activity as ours and in other activities it's different. And Pepe, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's a figure that's really going to amaze you and that is the current value of the premiums and allocated to the special regime is greater than the level of capitalization of the entire Spanish electricity sector, when they only provide 7% of energy. They don't even have one kilometer of the line. They don't have 25 million customers and ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is completely unfair and there's no equity involved and there's no common sense either. And this is where we have to do something, because this is where the problem lies.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Yes, I have two questions. And the first question has to do with the changes in the plan for renewables from 20 to 25 years. And you're talking about an impact of &#x20AC;66 million and I think that seems to be a somewhat low figure. Do you include all the assets of all the countries in this new policy of depreciation? That would be the question. Or is this impact, does it not cover the entire year 2011?</p>
          <p>And my second question would have to do with the slide number 51 where you can see the return of assets of the Electricity business in Spain versus capital costs. So what I would like you to do, I'd like to know rather what are you doing, you're drawing up an average of all these companies and if in this average of all of these companies do you include Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa after taking over Gas Natural and Endesa or is it just that these are the original figures that you're talking about. And could you say something about how Iberdrola compares in terms of returns relative to that average? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this has been taken from the study that is carried out every year by UNESA, which has to do with analyzing the sector's economic activity. And it obviously includes the five UNESA companies but I'm under the impression that it also includes other stakeholders in the sector such as independent producers, et cetera, et cetera. But reality shows that there are no significant differences in terms of profitability between the three major companies, Gas Natural, Endesa and Iberdrola, as regard the activity of the electricity business in Spain because we are all standing at something like 5.5%.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This obviously affects the whole system and what is being applied is what is equivalent to half a year since July 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. I have three questions. And the first question has to do with the UK. Your monitoring policy for the return on investments do you have any deadlines to take any positions in the future as regards maintaining or not these activities in the portfolio with levels below the WACC, which could be for instance the case of the liberalized activity in the UK? And what else can be done in the UK? Do you think that there can be a consolidation or what regulatory changes do you think could be made to change the activities environment?</p>
          <p>And the second question has to do with the United States, and that is operating expenses. I think that in the first quarter, there was a 20% increase. Could you please explain that? Does it have to do with the accounting system used? And finally, could you say something about this in terms of like-for-like about the whole Group? What is your objective as regards cutting back recurrent costs? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the case of UK, well in investments plan certainly. Because one of issues that has to looked into in the UK, there are things that they have done well which has to do with investments in the regulated segment. There's been a discussion and analysis and agreement in terms of the transmission and distribution activities with a five-year horizon in the case of distribution and eight years in the case of transmission, which seems to be reasonable. And then investments have defined with rates of return, which are WACC with 150 to 200 basis points.</p>
          <p>But in the case of electrical generation, the UK requires very sizable investments in the next few years because most of this segment is going to have to be dismantled. Many wind farms are going to have to be closed down in the next few years. So there is a discussion right now, which is the energy market reform and they're discussing how to do this. But we are asking for a figure because nuclear power stations will be built if the price expectations or the price we can obtain is a suitable price or if the framework is suitable too. And if not, they won't be built and that's not only my view but also the view of other stakeholders in this sector. This was mentioned the other day by our colleagues from Centrica and there is an interview today, which says exactly the same thing. So we're still pending and we'll take decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then what about these operating expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's true. In the fourth quarter, in the United States, an effort had to be made to improve quality. And this means that we have had some additional expenses, which we hope will not be repeated in the future years. But it is true that yes we have had some expenses in order to improve the quality indices and this has to do with the many storms and many hurricanes in the area.</p>
          <p>As regard to the objective set for costs. Well, the objective we've set is that the gross margin should grow more than the operating expenses that we'll have in the Group. In other words, we have to improve efficiency. Last year, we had an improvement of 1.7% in terms of efficiency. And this year, we want to continue along the same lines, and I can't give you the exact figure right now. But the goal is that our gross margin grows more than net operating expenses.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, after nearly two hours of presentation of results, we're going to finish. We know that there are some questions that are still pending on the web and the telephone. We are very sorry, but we cannot entertain those questions now, but we will do so from our own department. But in any case, we have to stop now because we have other commitments.</p>
          <p>Thank you all very much indeed for coming to this press conference or to this presentation of results. And we'll be seeing you at the next meeting during the Investors Day when we will present more results of the company. Thank you very much. Goodbye.</p>
