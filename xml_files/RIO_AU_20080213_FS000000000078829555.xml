          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to the Rio Tinto Conference Call to discuss the Full Year 2007 Earning Results.  Today's call is being recorded.  At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Skinner.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well good morning and welcome to all of you.  I'm Paul Skinner, Chairman of Rio Tinto.  Sitting alongside me here in London is Tom Albanese, our Chief Executive.  Our CFO, Guy Elliott, is on Australian duty today, so we are joined here in London by Dan Larsen, who is our Financial Controller.  There are results slides available to you on our website and we'll take questions from you in a moment, but before we do, Tom and I would like to make a few comments.</p>
          <p>The results we have announced today for 2007 set a fourth consecutive record for underlying earnings at $7.4 billion, ahead of market expectations and 1% above last year's corresponding figure.  Underlying EBITDA was a record $13.9 billion, which is a rise of 11%.  We also delivered record cash generation of $12.6 billion, $1 billion a month, if you'd like, up 15%.  Capital expenditure was $5 billion, 25% up on the previous year, and that's all about investing in value-adding growth projects.</p>
          <p>The ability of Rio Tinto to deliver substantial cash returns to shareholders was demonstrated in November when we announced that we were increasing the 2007 full-year dividend by 30%, and we are committed to increase this by at least 20% in both 2008 and 2009.  This underlines our confidence in the future of the business and the outlook for our markets.  Although we, and you know this better than we, have seen turbulence in financial markets recently related to credit concerns, we expect this to only have limited impact on demand for our products.  The principal driver of our business remains China and beyond that India.  In 2007, as you know, we successfully completed the acquisition of Alcan, which gives us a leadership position in the global aluminum industry, and we now have assets in that product group of the highest quality throughout the industry, and the integration of these businesses is well underway.</p>
          <p>Finally a few words about the pre-conditional offer we received recently from BHP Billiton to acquire all of the shares of Rio Tinto.  As you know, after carefully considering it, our Boards have unanimously rejected the offer on the basis that it's not in the best interest of shareholders.  While the offer represents an improvement on what we were indicated previously, it still fails to recognize the underlying value of our quality assets and prospects.  We have a very clear strategy to deliver value to our shareholders by developing assets of the highest quality, and we are executing this strategy very effectively, as I think the results today demonstrate.</p>
          <p>Our plans to continue to deliver shareholder value through our excellent standalone prospects are unchanged and will remain so unless a proposal is made to us that fully reflects, in the view of the Board, the value of Rio Tinto.  We believe that the recent unsolicited acquisition of a 12% stake in our plc by Chinalco and Alcoa reinforces the point we've made about Rio Tinto's value and strong prospects looking forward.  We've got an exceptional portfolio of assets and growth [Ed. Note: Audio Gap 4:27-4:31] opportunities particularly in iron ore, copper [Ed. Note: Audio Gap 4:33] and aluminum, and these assets, combined with our strong record for value delivery, project execution [Ed. Note: Audio Gap 4:37-4:40] and exploration position Rio Tinto very well to take advantage of the strong global markets we continue to see in the resources industry.</p>
          <p>And so with those few opening [Ed. Note: Audio Gap 4:49-4:53] remarks, I'll hand it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul.  For the [Ed. Note: Audio Gap] past several months I have [Ed. Note: Audio Gap 4:57-5:01] talked about our need to do everything faster, smarter and better, and I believe this is borne out by our results today.  We enjoyed a stellar year in 2007 ahead of market expectations and we are heading and aiming for new heights in [Ed. Note: Audio Gap 5:06-5:14] 2008.  The strong second half performance reinforces my view that we can indeed continue to drive our [Ed. Note: Audio Gap] business to achieving greater things.  Second half earnings of 3.9 billion were 11% higher than the first half and were a record in their own right, a positive indicator for performance in 2008.  In 2008 of course we'll see a significant contribution from the Alcan businesses for the first time.</p>
          <p>Our businesses are built on the three pillars of copper, iron ore and aluminum, with support from our energy, minerals and diamonds businesses.  The full details of the results of course are in the press release, so maybe I'll just make a few comments on each.  Copper first was once again our highest earner, with record EBITDA as we benefited from higher sales of refined copper and continuing strong copper, moly and gold markets.  Our cost position is excellent.  We actually recorded negative unit cash costs in 2007.  We recorded record spending on new development projects, and have an interest in many of the world's largest undeveloped copper resources including Resolution in Arizona, Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia and La Granja in Peru.  The 100-year old mine at the [Barney's] Canyon near Salt Lake City continues to deliver outside [Ed. Note: Audio Gap] 6:13), our largest earner throughout the group, and we believe will continue to be able to operate for at least three decades to come.</p>
          <p>For iron ore, 2007 was a year of records, with underlying earnings rising by 18%.  The market was strong in 2007, but the outlook for 2008 is even better.  China imported 383 million tons of iron ore in 2007, a rise of 17% from the previous year.  In December we announced plans to sell more in the spot market in 2008 in order to the current differential between spot and contract prices of about $100 per ton.  Our Pilbara operations are firing on all cylinders. We're ramping up to 220 million tons per year by 2009.  Beyond that our next target in the Pilbara is 320 million tons a year by 2013.  We are investing in automation and technology to develop the mine of the future, as well as focusing on growth opportunities based upon the excellent resource and mineralization position both in Australia and in Guinea.  Our intention is to triple production to over 600 million tons per year.</p>
          <p>Turning to aluminum, this has transformed in scale and potential in 2007 as a result of our acquisition of Alcan.  On a pro forma basis Rio Tinto Alcan produced 4.2 million tons of aluminum in 2007.  The demand outlook for aluminum is very positive.  Consumption is currently growing at the fastest rate of all the major metals.  We now have two major advantages in aluminum: the outstanding bauxite resource in Weipa in Queensland, Australia and the unique low cost hydropower position available to us in the Saguenay in Qu&#xE9;bec and in British Columbia.</p>
          <p>Integration of the Alcan assets is going well, and in November we increased our targeted annual [Ed. Note: Audio Gap] synergies to $940 million after tax from the end of 2009, and I believe there is still more yet to come.  We are producing more metals faster.  A key to our strong outlook and our plans for expansion is the role of China as a driver for demand.  By now we're all familiar with the story of rapid economic development in China and the transforming effect this has had on all of our markets.  China has replaced the US as the dominant consumer of almost everything we produce, and the trend will only grow stronger as industrialization and urbanization continues over several decades.</p>
          <p>It is important to recognize that Chinese growth is largely driven by domestic investment and consumption, not by exports.  Therefore, a recession in the US would have limited impact on the rate of Chinese growth.  If the US enters a, which we wouldn't see as our central estimate, we expect capital flow even to faster parts of world [Ed. Note: Audio Gap 9:45] such as China.  The net effect of a US recession might be a reduction of less than 1% in the rate of growth of Chinese GDP.  Overall, therefore we believe the price outlook for metals and minerals is positive based upon rapid Chinese demand growth and continued supply side constraints.</p>
          <p>However, we also believe the outlook for Rio Tinto's key products is particularly favorable, notably iron ore, copper and aluminum.  Of course BHP Billiton is more exposed to nickel and oil, where the forward price curve is less favorable.  And this means that Rio Tinto is better placed to benefit as we look ahead at what looks to be a strong price environment going forward.  With excellent resource [Ed. Note: Audio Gap] position and proven project execution capacity, and based upon our extensive portfolio of projects, we estimate the compound annual growth rate of our volumes from 2008 to 2015 is over 8% per year.  In our estimates this has [Ed. Note: Audio Gap] nearly doubled the rate of BHP's growth over the same period, and it is in commodities that we believe look great from a forward pricing perspective.  This reinforces our view that BHP Billiton needs Rio Tinto more than Rio Tinto needs BHP Billiton.  Put simply, and as our results show, we're accelerating away.</p>
          <p>To summarize, Rio Tinto is delivering value today, with record earnings of 7.4 billion and record cash flow of 12.6 billion in 2007.  We are setting production records in many of our key products, like iron ore and refined copper.  With the acquisition of Alcan we are now the leader in the aluminum industry, where we have an outstanding competitive position and a market outlook that keeps getting better and better.  We are investing at record levels in evaluating growth in the business, with planned capital expenditure of 9 billion in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Our large-scale reserves, resources and mineralization continue to generate options for growth, and we have a track record of delivering that growth on-time and on-budget.  The long-term demand outlook for our products remains excellent, based upon profound structural and demographic shifts taking place in the world economy.  Rio Tinto is perfectly positioned to take advantage of all of these opportunities.  We remain totally focused on value, and resolved to make the business work faster, better and smarter in pursuit of value for our Rio Tinto shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now thank you.  Let us take some of your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Thank you very much for making the unit volume forecast to 2015 by mines in your significant product lines.  I think that requires enormous bravery and courage.  We're all in the business of making forecasts and know how tough it is.  I feel almost remiss in asking you tough questions about those forecasts, because we all know how hard it is to gauge environmental permits and availability of engineering and other resources.  How did you go about forecasting BHP Billiton's volume, and for example what assumptions did you make about oil and gas decline curves, growth projects and Olympic Dam?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a hard time figuring that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John maybe I'll try commenting on some of your questions.  First of all reflecting on some of our discussions over the past year or so, I think you've actually raised this as an input, and I hope we've taken your input into guidance.  You are absolutely correct that this is something that is not a precise science, and clearly as compared to say the 1980s, where things were built as quickly as engineers to get around to building them, we're in a different environment now where you're dealing with all matters of issues ranging besides stakeholder issues, governments that are basically more or less affected by elements of resource nationalism, scarcity of power, scarcity of water, engagement with local communities, the full range of challenges that every new project anywhere in the world has to go through today.  And in many ways, John, as you know, that is having an effect on keeping the sector constrained on the supply side.</p>
          <p>I think for our purposes in doing this work, we had to basically put together the material that was generally available in the marketplace, both from our perspective and from BHP's perspective to do this.  We had to make certain assumptions when projects would come on line and they are consistent with what we've said in terms of the guidance we've given.  It is of course more difficult on the BHP side, as of course they haven't provided the guidance on the viability of Olympic Dam expansion.  They haven't provided guidance on timelines, so it is more difficult, but we've basically taken the material that they have presented.  And in any case I think most people would say that it's not as much &#x2013; Olympic Dam doesn't have much effect in the 2008 to 2015 timeline.  So again we take into account public available information of Rio Tinto projects, BHP projects, blended the apples and oranges of aluminum versus copper versus iron ore based upon public consensus numbers of price to come up with relative index factors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you could please put your BHP schedule assumptions up on the web, it would help us all in making our own comparisons and making whatever adjustments particular information users may want to make to what you've done, but I want to really compliment you for going beyond the bubble charts to saying how much volume and what year by project, that's a great help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, I think we'll probably refer you to the BHP websites for that information.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

          <p>Can I take it that the material that's publicly available over the web and the brief exchange we've had here is meeting the needs of all of you in the call?  If we don't hear another question in the next little while, I guess that's our conclusion.</p>
