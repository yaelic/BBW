          <p>Greetings and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call and R&amp;D Pipeline Update. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It's now my pleasure to introduce Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto Company. Thank you sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dan and good morning to everyone on the line. Thanks for joining Monsanto's first quarter earnings call, I'm joined this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO; Pierre Courduroux, our CFO; as well as Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me are Manny Cruz and Bryan Corkal, my colleagues in Investor Relations. This call is being webcast, and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at Monsanto.com. The replay will also be available at that address.</p>
          <p>We are providing you today with EPS measures both on a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to the GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are posted to our web site.</p>
          <p>This call will include statements concerning future events, and financial risk. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K, and in today's press release.</p>
          <p>Today's an extended conference call that features the annual review of our R&amp;D pipeline results with Rob. Before we cover that, Pierre will walk you through the quarterly financial results, and our guidance outlook. Then Hugh will cover the strategic check points including the US order outlook. So with that, let me hand the time over to Pierre to start us with the financial review.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bryan and good morning to everybody on the line. The first quarter results we reported today reflect better than expected performance from our Latin American business. They also reflect some timing benefits from our Australian cotton business, and some early positives from the US. These results were even better than our revised quarterly guidance of a month ago. With these strong results in hand, and an additional month of data on our business outlook, it gives me the confidence to point to the upper end of our original EPS range for the full year, even at this early point in the season.</p>
          <p>Before we go into the details of the financial results, let me place the first quarter in a more precise perspective. First, we are, of course, very pleased with our first quarter results as they confirm our emerging opportunity from Latin America, especially in corn. Compared with last year we grew ongoing EPS by $0.20 this quarter. This is strong growth at this early point, and it is consistent with our plan that considers delivering 60% of our full year gross profit growth from our international business.</p>
          <p>But with less than 10% of our expected total full year earnings, the first quarter is still a small quarter. I personally believe in a prudent approach to updating guidance, making sure the projections we communicate are backed by solid data points in the business. To date, with the strong results we have seen through December and the positive outlook coming out of our US order book, we have greater clarity that gives us the confidence to take our full-year EPS guidance to the upper half of the previous range.</p>
          <p>But with the US season still ahead of us and the reality that there's volatility in the broader economic environment, we will not get ahead of the business. Against that backdrop, I feel good about translating the early strength in our business to full year performance.</p>
          <p>Let me now move from that overview to the specifics of our financial results on slide four. Ongoing earnings per share was $0.23, which was ahead of our quarterly guidance but in line with our expectation for a more significant first quarter. That compares with ongoing EPS of $0.03 in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>As expected, the most important driver is the growth in the Seeds and Genomics. Sales and gross profit both increased more than 30%, and there's really two key factors driving that change. One is a core business driver, and the other has an element of timing.</p>
          <p>The first and biggest business driver is Latin America. The seed business delivered at the high end of our expectations and you can see this in our Corn Seeds and Traits numbers where our quarterly profit was up almost 60% relative to last year. This growth was driven by the mix benefit that came from significant rate expansion and by volume growth in both Brazil and Argentina. And that year-over-year gain flows very nicely through to the margins where the Corn Seeds and Traits gross profit as a percent of sales came in almost at 60%, compared with 55% in the prior year.</p>
          <p>The second factor of growth revolves around cotton where we saw a quarterly uptick in gross profit from our Australian business. As last year, the total planted acreage in the high-value cotton market in Australia stands at historical highs as the acres have rebounded following several years of drought. And in addition to the business performance, roughly $0.04 in cotton EPS reflected pure timing shifts in this business. In Australia, growers have the option of either buying the technology up front or following harvest based on yields. This year, more farmers chose to buy up front rather than after harvest, and this shifts those $0.04 from the fourth quarter of 2012 into this first quarter.</p>
          <p>For the other crops, Q1 is a small quarter. In soybeans we saw some gross profit contribution as the final royalties came through the point of delivery system in Brazil but we also saw the vegetable gross profit decline in the quarter due to some softness in the higher-value vegetable market in Europe as well as some timing shift in the Americas.</p>
          <p>On the Ag Productivity side of the business, and albeit in a small quarter, gross profit is up about 24% compared with last year. This reflects continued solid performance across that segment and it keeps us right on pace to achieve the approximately $800 million target in total gross profit from Ag Productivity for the full year.</p>
          <p>Below the line operating expenses for the quarter are also tracking with our full year guidance expectations. SG&amp;A in the quarter was $500 million. This is higher than last year and reflects in part the Latin American business growth in the quarter, as a portion of our SG&amp;A expense comes from related commissions. On the R&amp;D line, our expenses were $351 million, which is somewhat higher than last year as we increase some spending for more projects, but this keeps us within our projection for our full year R&amp;D spend.</p>
          <p>The strength of the first quarter also shows up through our free cash results. Quarterly free cash flow was $856 million, compared with $500 million last year. The increase reflects growth in net income, as well as an increase in the prepays in front of the US season, which are ahead of last year's pace. Importantly, these prepays are a good early indicator of US purchase patterns and are a positive indicator that supports the momentum in the order book that Hugh will cover. And you can actually see a reflection of those strong prepays in the year-over-year increase in deferred revenues on the cash flow statement.</p>
          <p>Now, on slide five, we roll up the complete guidance elements for the fiscal year. As we translate the strong Q1 performance into the full year, we move up the low end of our guidance and are on track to achieve the upper end of our original guidance, or $3.39 to $3.44 of ongoing EPS. And it also tracks with our overall free cash target of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>If you now go to slide six, here is how I see the earnings cycle for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned, roughly half of our expected EPS growth for the full year is reflected in this first quarter. Given the Latin American contribution, that's right in line with our expectation that roughly 60% of our GP growth in 2012 will come from our international business. We expect the remainder of the growth to be spread among the second and third quarters, as we expect growth in our US business as well. We expect growth over last year in both of these quarters but not on the same order of magnitude as we saw in the first quarter with the significant Latin American contributions.</p>
          <p>In terms of drivers, we expect the momentum in the Corn business will continue to drive our overall Seeds and Traits performance. Specifically we expect continued strong growth in our corn platform in the US for the second and third quarters. We anticipate less contribution to the overall growth from cotton and soybeans as we are not planning for the same level of acres and favorable conditions as we saw in 2011. Reflecting the trend we saw in Q1, we also expect relatively limited growth from our vegetable business for the full year.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect the fourth quarter to still be a loss, but with the emergence of the Latin America business, we should see a increasing contribution from Seeds and Genomics over time. But for 2012, the shift of the fourth quarter cotton revenue from Australia into the first quarter means that a portion of that Seeds and Genomics opportunity has already been reflected and with that shift, we don't see a significant change in the quarterly loss in 2012 related to last year.</p>
          <p>So as I wrap up, I will leave you with two key thoughts for how we carry the first quarter into our full year. It's still very early but the first quarter is a strong start. We have seen growth come from the areas we expected, and that positions us right where we need to be at this point in the year to realize the upper half of our full year EPS expectations. And within that, we are seeing the contributions from a more balanced international business and that is important as it speaks to the flexibility in managing our business and the clarity we have in delivering on our mid-teens earnings growth objectives this year.</p>
          <p>With that background of the quarter, let me hand the time over to Hugh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Pierre, and let me also wish everybody on the line the very best in the coming new year.</p>
          <p>The first quarter was a strong quarter, as the first check point the early strength validates both the business momentum behind our constants and our 2012 growth and the drivers that create our opportunity beyond this year. At this point, three things strike me. First, our pipeline progress continues to move ahead and be a competitive differentiator. And that's even more important as we've put an even greater focus on delivering yields to our growers.</p>
          <p>Second, to add emphasis to a point that Pierre has already made, the growth in Latin America isn't just an important financial contributor; it's an increasingly important strategic growth driver. With the proof points in hand, we can confidentially see the game-changing effect that the Latin American opportunity can have in driving growth over the midterm horizon.</p>
          <p>And third, our early orders in the US underscore that the momentum that we started to rebuild in 2011 is carrying into 2012. At this time a year ago, the order book check was the early validation that we could successfully reset our US product and pricing strategy. Today, I see the early orders as the indicator that our momentum is strong and our platform opportunities are real.</p>
          <p>These all underscore the constants that shows as we point to the upper half of our EPS guidance range today. They also reinforce a point that we made in our Investor Day in November, that the key to our strategy is delivering yields to our farmer customers. We believe that we're the best positioned in that ability. And when we are able to deliver yield, there's real value that shows up in our growth.</p>
          <p>One of the biggest proof points of that is the emergence of the corn opportunity in Latin America. You see this most acutely in Brazil which is highlighted in slide seven. In just the fourth year since initial approval, the trait penetration this season stands at more than 75%. You see this rapid adoption occurring simultaneously with upgrades to higher value traits. We are seeing a significant step up in acres from first to second generation singles this year, with even further upgrade opportunity as we move our offerings to our Double PRO over time. With each of these upgrades, there's significant new value for the farmer, and the value of the acre increases for us, driving our mix benefit.</p>
          <p>The same effect is true for Argentina on slide eight. In Argentina we are in upgrade mode as farmers are beginning to choose to upgrade from the established doubles to the new Genuity VT Triple PRO which is in its first year of widespread availability.</p>
          <p>If you shift to the US, 2012 is a bit different than the past couple of years, as we're coming out of a harvest where our products really distinguished themselves across the board. From a strategy perspective, our ability to deliver that total package of yield is a critical factor in defining how our customers see us and that, in turn, sets up the first look at how our performance translates into the order book.</p>
          <p>Let me give you that data. As of December 31st, the order pace for our US portfolio is ahead of the same point in time last year, and tracking well against our 2012 targets. Last year was a strong year for our US business, and we're tracking ahead of that pace this year. We are in a growth mode so our targets revolve around three key variables: unit volume growth, the germplasm upgrade and our trait mix. Against that, our total volume is ahead of last year's pace, and our portfolio mix is tracking squarely with our planning assumptions.</p>
          <p>As a metric, prepays are also strong and coming in earlier this year. As Pierre indicated, a good portion of the cash flow that we have seen in the quarter reflects these strong prepays, which is a good indicator that there is solid commitments behind the order book.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in a year where the perception of tighter corn supply likely drove some early orders in the industry, the key cancellation deadlines for corn are now behind us. So we've got good clarity that the order uptick that we have seen reflects real growth. That current order mix validates our confidence that we'll expand the penetration of our key product platforms in both corn and soybeans and that's reflected on slide nine. We have the strong response to the rollout and the ramp up of our RIB Complete products for Genuity SmartStax and VT Double PRO this year. That's translated to orders and it's tracking very well to achieve the 22 million to 24 million acres that we have targeted for our Reduced-Refuge corn family this season.</p>
          <p>Likewise, the order book also reflects strong demand for our products with root worm traits. For a number of years now, farmers have seen the value of root warm control firsthand. That proven performance shows up in the orders, as we are squarely on track with our expectations for our flagship triples and the key products in our Reduced-Refuge family. Likewise, with widely recognized performance of Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans in the marketplace, we are tracking very well towards our targeted range of 27 million to 30 million acres. That speaks to the third year momentum as farmers experience the performance of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in a much broader lineup varieties.</p>
          <p>So the bottom line of all of this is the order book is strong. That speaks to the opportunity that we see in the US for the growth of our key platforms, for volume growth, and for sales that flow through our financial statements. It's still too early to declare victory but we are clearly where we need to be at this point in the year.</p>
          <p>So from that operational look, I want to wrap up with a word on one of the most strategic check points at this time of the year and that's our R&amp;D pipeline. We're bringing to bear more tools than ever and we are making the conscious effort to make sure that we highlight the complete tool kit, ranging from the leverage created by breeding, to our unmatched biotech pipeline. We are the only company to have that total pipeline today and that positions us best to deliver yield to our grower customers.</p>
          <p>With that, let me give the floor to Dr. Fraley for the tour of our pipeline this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everybody on the line. When I outlined our R&amp;D strategy at our November Investor Day, I focused on two points: first, that the competitive advantage created by our R&amp;D engine is expanding and second, that our R&amp;D differentiation comes because we are uniquely positioned today to drive total yield with the convergence of the industry's most advanced technology platforms. And, remember, farmers buy yield, and that's where we are focused and that's what matters to the bottom line as we deliver yield to customers.</p>
          <p>The proof of that converging yield opportunity is in this year's pipeline update. In 2011, we saw significant progress and formal advancement in every one of our platforms. So, if I begin on slide three of our R&amp;D slide, the progress is clear. Number one, this is a record year for progress within our pipeline, with 14 total advancements or additions across our R&amp;D platforms and eight advancements specifically in the biotech pipeline. You will see significant annual progress balanced among all of our research areas and an R&amp;D pipeline that's expanding.</p>
          <p>Number two, you see that the same concept of balance within the platforms. On slide four, you see only the biotech advancements. And if you do the two-year look, including our recent product launches, almost two-thirds of our biotech projects have advanced. The symmetry tells the story. There are advances in every major crop, at every development phase and from both the agronomic and yield and stress projects.</p>
          <p>Number three, if you expand the view to look at the platforms by crop, you see the power of the integrated approach to delivering yield on slides five and six. This is the convergence we have talked about, and it reflects an expanded pipeline built around yield that we'll focus on going forward. We are known for our early investment in biotech but we never rested on that and today we are driving even greater progress across more platforms</p>
          <p>And finally, there's no better proof point of the value in R&amp;D convergence than in the results from our breeding platform in 2011. From the US data I first showed in November, to the breakthroughs we're making in next generation tools, our breeding advantage increasingly contributes to our commercial advantage.</p>
          <p>So with that I want to dive into the updates and I will begin with Yield and Stress pipeline on slide seven. Yield and Stress is the next frontier that flips biotech from a tool to preserve yield, to a tool that creates yield. And like any new Frontier, it's complex. It will be a significant learning curve for everyone and it won't be as straightforward as with the agronomic traits. Because of that, the value of our collaboration with BASF is more important than ever. The complexity of the work demands scale, scale in the discovery to generate leads and massive scale in testing. So the combined capabilities of two of the world's preeminent R&amp;D engines at BASF and at Monsanto give us the capability no one else can bring to bear on Yield and Stress.</p>
          <p>As the projects advance, we're building the line of sight on how to deploy them commercially. Yield and Stress traits fit our convergence point beautifully. We see every product coming out as a part of a system of traits, germplasm and key agronomic practices. Understanding how specific traits and germplasm work in combination is critical. So you are seeing us do an increased amount of testing in the field in phases two and three to develop reliable yield data for these systems.</p>
          <p>Let me start with drought-tolerant corn &#x2013; this is on slide eight &#x2013; and it's a project that illustrates these points clearly. This is our most advanced Yield and Stress project, in phase four. As you know, this product initially targets the portion of the western Corn Belt where dry conditions are expected in most years and where drought can limit yield during the stress period. It's a relatively small market to begin with, but it will be the first drought system in the industry to have the combined tools of breeding, biotech and agronomic practices packaged for farmers. And importantly, we have just crossed a key milestone. At the end of last month, we received deregulation of the drought trait from the USDA. That's the final regulatory clearance we needed within the US. It allows us to move to on-farm testing this planting season and to complete the stacking strategy with Double PRO and Triple PRO traits.</p>
          <p>From here, the next regulatory milestone before commercial consideration is the import country approvals for the complete trait stacks. Those submissions have all been made and we expect to have them in hand during the 2013/2014 timeframe. In the meantime, we are able to move forward with significant on-farm testing in our new Ground Breakers program. We have several hundred farmers who will test this integrated drought system that includes some of our best drought genetics, the biotech trait package and related agronomic practices. This program is designed to give farmers early exposure on a field scale while generating data that will help us prepare for commercial launch of the drought system. So this is a good step for our system, as well as for building an even better approach to bringing these new technologies to farmers.</p>
          <p>If I stay within corn, our first generation higher-yielding corn advances to phase three on slide nine. Over the past several years, we have been in early phase testing and with the second year of field testing in elite germplasm, we have seen consistent yield benefits as shown in the photo on the slide. And as we move into expanded testing, we're evaluating different germplasm backgrounds in more environments to develop a comprehensive set of yield data. That data helps us identify the right combinations of trait and germplasm and that will help to build out the ultimate package that we would take to farmers.</p>
          <p>If we shift over to cotton, we have also advanced our drought tolerant cotton project on slide ten. This is particularly relevant because it shows the leverage we get on our technology across crop platforms. As we are developing stress tolerance traits, we have been able to apply our experience to other crops. So there's a multiplier effect. In our early stage testing, we have seen good results under drought conditions and as we expand into broader varieties, we expect to hone in on the potential commercial leads that we'll take into development. This is still a relatively early stage project, but it's encouraging to see the proliferation of these yield and stress traits across more than one crop platform.</p>
          <p>If we shift into our agronomic pipeline, I want to focus on one of our most advanced projects, dicamba-tolerant soybeans in phase four and shown on slides 11 and 12. The biotech trait advanced of the last year, but here's another prime example of converging technology as the complimentary chemistry that drives the ultimate dicamba weed control system just advanced on an overall path to phase three. This will represent the industry's first biotech herbicide tolerant stack in soybeans.</p>
          <p>On the trait front, we have this lined up for our Ground Breakers program in 2013, making it the second of our key new US product systems that we'll take through that program. This is another project where we have worked in conjunction with BASF, as we're collaborating on new formulations of dicamba.</p>
          <p>On slide 12, we highlight the advancement of that over-the-top new chemistry. We have seen a reduction of volatility in our improved dicamba formulations with Roundup. In addition, these dicamba formulations make a nice addition to our system relative to other herbicide tolerant trait systems as our testing clearly shows dicamba has activity against a broader spectrum of weeds, and our field trials are showing some residual activity compared with other chemistries, providing extended weed control.</p>
          <p>Dicamba also has the fewest total resistant weeds globally. So it's a system we believe will provide unmatched weed control for farmers. And it's truly a platform system. Across the Americas, the dicamba system has fit on more than 100 million soybean acres, with an opportunity to step up weed control and create incremental value.</p>
          <p>Within soybeans, we also advanced our second-generation insect-protected soybeans on slide 13. Because of our experience with agronomic traits, and with some accelerated multi-season tests, we have been able to accelerate this project, advancing into phase three this year, after it was moved into phase two last year. This comes on the heels of the first generation Intacta product that has been rolled out for on-farm Ground Breaker testing this year, ahead of the initial commercial launch in fiscal year 2013. This second generation approach speaks to the upgrade opportunity. In tropical places like Brazil, the insect infestation in soybeans is particularly heavy. So the additional BT genes we add to Intacta with this second generation product are valuable because they will provide multiple modes of action, increasing product durability, and providing the potential for refuge reduction. In addition, with an expanded spectrum of control, this second generation product would also add protection from armyworm, another important insect pest in Brazil.</p>
          <p>If I shift over to corn, our Corn Rootworm III project on slide 14 reflects that similar concerted strategy around multimode products. This is a project that's important for a couple of very key reasons. Number one, it's the first agricultural application of cutting edge RNA interference technologies or RNAi for short. With RNAi we are able to target and rootworms with a novel mode of action that's outside of the class of BT proteins that have been used in all other insect control products. In fact, RNAi offers a mode of action different from the BT protein mechanisms in our Yieldgard products, as well as Herculex Rootworm, Agrisure Rootworm or the recently-announced Agrisure Duracade traits.</p>
          <p>RNAi technology leverages our genomics investments because we identify key DNA in sequences in insects and this technology allows us to tap into the naturally occurring machinery in the bugs to design new ways to target and control specific insects.</p>
          <p>We're the first to move the application of this technology for insect control into advanced development and in addition to this first trait, we also have the next round of RNAi actives in the pipeline demonstrating insect control. Just as importantly, we are continuing to look at broader product applications for RNAi and we're building a broader intellectual property portfolio and further R&amp;D capability to explore it.</p>
          <p>Rootworm III is also accelerating with the advancement into phase three. Our extensive regulatory experience and advanced product development capabilities will allow us to move this product aggressively through the remaining development cycle. As you compare this with our current portfolio, the performance is unprecedented. On the chart on the slide, you can see the three light green bars which have even better control than our dual mode of action SmartStax products. Given the headlines that there's been on rootworm control over the last few months, we see this pipeline product as a gold standard in rootworm control and durability that will be a real game changer.</p>
          <p>If we shift over to cotton, we advanced two agronomic traits but the one to focus on is our lygus control project on slide 15. The genes we are using for this project are one of the first to come out of our advanced protein engineering capability. We invested early and built up superior capability in protein structure, protein design, and directed evolution. And that's paying off because it lets us design proteins that have as much as a 90-fold increased efficacy compared to the naturally occurring BT proteins targeting these pests.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, this allows us to do things that simply weren't possible five years ago. We have used this technology to target the category of insects we refer to as piercing and sucking bugs like lygus. Currently-used BT proteins do not effectively control these hemipteran insects, effectively missing a significant class of pests. Where these bugs are present, cotton growers can spend up to $30 an acre on chemical treatment. So it's clearly a valuable economic target if we can integrate it in the seed along with the current bollworm control.</p>
          <p>So in the interest of time, I won't cover all the projects we have advanced this year. But I will tell you that we are making impressive progress in our canola project, in some of the other chemistry areas, and in the application of markers in our vegetable platform. Now, we have highlighted these in the appendix that accompanies the deck I'm using today.</p>
          <p>I'm going to complete our walk through with an update on a cornerstone platform, and that's breeding. I think as most of you know, we spend about half of our annual R&amp;D budget on breeding. So we have made a conscious effort to highlight our capability here. Not just because it's a significant part of the yield convergence we have discussed, but because it's a critical advantage in the commercial market.</p>
          <p>Nowhere is that more evident than our yield data from the 2011 harvest, highlighted on slide 16. I covered this extensively at our Investor Day, but I want to emphasize the historic performance gains we saw this year across corn, soybeans and cotton with a couple of updates. Now I also understand that there's a lot of yield data that floats around after harvest and everybody claims different things. But let me make three points. First, we do take yield seriously as evidenced by the thousands of comparisons in our database. And second, since our initial data review, our core yield advantages have been further supported by independent first and university trial data. And finally, if your yields are better, they should be reflected in your pricing. We just completed a study of corn pricing for the 2012 season. You see DEKALB is consistently the premium-priced seed in every major area and that premium tracks very well against the yield advantage we see relative to our competitors. And to me, that's the clearest validation that our yield advantage creates real commercial value.</p>
          <p>One of our important updates revolving around soybeans on slide 17. We have completed a direct comparison of Roundup Ready 2 Yield compared to the Pioneer Y series soybeans. A Roundup Ready 2 Yield advantage of more than 4-bushels an acre was observed in greater than 5,000 comparisons across 14 states. And that tracks squarely with the yield advantage we saw against all competitors and underlines the buzz we are hearing in the countryside around Roundup Ready 2 Yield performance.</p>
          <p>The other big update is from our cotton results on slide 18. Like corn and soybeans, the new cotton varieties we have launched are consistently out-yielding the competitors. You can see this by geography on the chart on the slide, and when you take a weighted average total, the Deltapine Land advantage is more than 6%. That's about 70 pounds of cotton per acre, or more than a $60-acre advantage for Deltapine Land over competitors and that really speaks to the rapid progress we have been able to make since acquiring Delta Pine Land and underscores the significant gains we made as we grew volume in 2011.</p>
          <p>If I broaden the view in breeding, the leverage we are getting from our technology leadership is greater, and there's two areas I want to focus on. The first is our integrated farming systems on slide 19. And this reflects the massive upgrade in the amount of data we are generating on our products. Now, the idea of precision agriculture isn't new, but what we have that's absolutely unique is the knowledge of seed genetic performance under different soil conditions, different planting densities and other environmental parameters. We're able to track and correlate that data to predict how a seed will perform on different farmers' fields. It's possible to deliver prescriptions to farmers beyond the typical seed recommendations to significantly step up yield.</p>
          <p>Today, we're piloting prescription programs with key farmers. From there, we have our first generation of commercial products in pre-commercial prep for the phase four equivalent. This would be a commercial prescription that would tie the hybrid recommendations into variable rate planning to maximize yield. From there, we plan to roll out successive waves that increasingly leverage our massive genetic databases to tailor what a farmer plants and drive the convergence of the advances in seed, soil testing and equipment to increase yield.</p>
          <p>The second area where this breeding leverage is a case study is on how our marker and genome sequence capability is changing breeding on slide 20. So historically, to target diseases, breeders had to screen through germplasm in the field or use laborious greenhouse tests to identify key disease resistance genes. We've completely revolutionized that. Today we use high throughput screening and markers to identify, select and deploy disease resistance genes. On slide 24 (sic) [slide 21] (39:01), you see how this comes together commercially. We have active disease screens that boost our annual performance and we have targeted molecular breeding projects in ways that give our portfolio an unprecedented double shot of technology to create the industry's most advanced disease tolerance program.</p>
          <p>The elegance of this approach can be best seen in our Goss's Wilt breeding program for corn on slide 22. Through our traditional screening process, we have hybrids in our commercial portfolio with very good Goss's Wilt tolerance targeting the key commercial needs today. But we also complement that using our molecular breeding technology to identify specific markers for Goss's Wilt that we can scale up significantly across all of our germplasm as a targeted trait and that expands the reach of Goss's Wilt tolerance in our corn portfolio and we expect it to step up the level of tolerance above anything available commercially today.</p>
          <p>And you see a similar opportunity for phytophthora in soybeans on slide 23. We are literally stacking resistance traits that couldn't have been done just a few years ago and that's translating into almost a bushel and a half yield advantage in soybean.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, it underscores that we have only scratched the surface of the capability and opportunity with breeding. In fact, I would make the strong case that our technology lead is as important and maybe more pronounced in breeding as it is in biotechnology.</p>
          <p>So if you move to slide 24, I can summarize how I think about our overall pipeline, and opportunity. First, our competitive differentiator is our ability to discover, develop, and deliver products that matter to farmers. We established our lead with the early investment in Seeds and Traits R&amp;D, and with the first generation of biotech traits. And we have leveraged this across multiple platforms and no one has the scale, the capability, and experience that we do.</p>
          <p>Second, we don't take our leadership for granted. While others are playing catch-up, we're driving the next innovation in the next platforms like molecular disease breeding, RNAi and precision agriculture that take yield to the next level.</p>
          <p>And finally, this all comes down to yield and we're in the best position to deliver yield to our farmer customers. Just a few short years ago the concept of truly integrated yield would have been inconceivable. Today, with our ability to generate data and form prescriptions for the grower, we see real opportunities in integrating the seed, chemicals and equipment management on one platform that drives yield more effectively.</p>
          <p>So I appreciate your time and with that, I will turn it over to Bryan for the Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>David, thank you very much for the question. We feel good about our supply this year. You are right, there's been a lot of noise in the marketplace and I think some of the smaller companies suffered with the very warm weather and production challenges given the lack of geographic diversity. We feel good about our own position and we are ready, willing and able to supply our farmer customers.

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. My question is just how should we be thinking about the big bulge in your deferred revenue line which at the end of the quarter was close to $2 billion. It was $1.3 billion last year and if I have the number right, it was $368 million year ago. So maybe you could just talk to how much of this is just early ordering year-over-year, although I kind of remember last year, I think we felt like orders were in a little early as well because of the attractive economics. But $650 million build year-over-year seems like it is quite substantial relative to the move you made with your guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent, thanks for the question. I will ask Pierre to give you a little bit of color but the way I think about it, if you think &#x2013; you are right, as you portray the history of this. I think it's really an indicator of strong farm income and it really speaks to the health of the business in general, the sector in general and how growers are feeling and I just &#x2013; I'm pleased we have managed to compete for a slice of that. But Pierre, maybe you can say a few words on Vincent's question on the bulge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And Vincent, you are right. I mean, it makes us feel good that the early prepays support our order book. By the same token as Hugh was saying, I mean, the big part of that is a reflection of farmer economics and as you know right now, I mean, there's a lot of cash at farmer level this year. So that's great and we can take advantage of that. And at the same time, from one year to the other, things are changing in the marketplace, and some of those programs may be adjusted from one year to the other. So my read on that is if anything, it's definitely favorable, supports a strong order book in the US. I wouldn't over read it, though. I would stay fairly conservative on the read but definitely we are very happy to have collected that money and as Hugh was mentioning, it definite makes us feel very comfortable with our order book today.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great quarter, guys. My first question is on Brazil. You mentioned the three quarters trait penetration. Could you perhaps comment more specifically on doubles penetration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're kind of &#x2013; it's kind of interesting, Michael, because we are &#x2013; doubles was the first technology advance and now &#x2013; and it went very, very quickly. Those lines went faster than our historical trend lines in the US and now we are seeing the &#x2013; before we reach peak acres, we are seeing the cannibalization of those acres with new traits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Bryan. I might add to that, the &#x2013; from a Brazil perspective you have basically three packages of traits in the market today. One is the first generation single. The second is the second generation single which is actually a stack and then the third is what we refer to as the double stack. As a percentage, that thing that is the double stack is very low today. Most of the upgrade has really been the first generation single to the second generation single. So the runway there to continue the upgrade is still present as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then one on SmartStax. Any supply constraints you are facing for the 2012 season, and in particular, any hybrid availability issues for some of your RIB complete offerings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we feel good, Michael, at the availability and a different story from a year ago. As you get into central Illinois, we are still a bit tight in hybrids but we knew that going into the season. But a different game from our first year of launch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will just add a quick comment, that we just recognized that the &#x2013; one of the agri marketing magazines made our SmartStax RIB Complete Product of the Year. So it is quite a difference from a year or so ago and the product has performed very well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question for Rob. You talked about Ground Breakers, I think three different times. This is kind of a new approach to launching products. Is the primary benefit here that it reduces the volatility around performance and pricing as you commercialize a new product? And I know you just went through the Ground Breakers with Intacta this past fall. Can you talk about how that process went?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, Don and Happy New Year to you. Yes, so, we have learned a lot. The origin of the Ground Breaker program actually started after we acquired Delta Pine Land and we were faced with the challenge of introducing new cotton technology in the marketplace to replace the fabulously famous triple nickel product and so we required a lot of grower experience and interactions to select those new cotton varieties and that turned out to be spectacularly successful as you kind of see in the cotton breeding results we show today.</p>
          <p>And then I think with the experiences we had with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and SmartStax, we really learned that getting that exposure to growers, getting them familiar with the technology, giving us that extra bit of time to match the traits to the germplasm is critical. So we're really making that, for our large major trait offerings a routine part of the introduction cycle.</p>
          <p>So as you highlighted the Intacta product in Brazil is already in the hands of nearly 500 growers and that's going to give us a lot of information on performance and opportunity for pricing and positioning and really understanding how a more complex product with multiple genes performs in the Brazilian environment. We're going to be doing that with drought. We have several hundred growers signed up to test the integrated package of the drought gene with different corn genetics, with the agronomic traits in Double PRO and Triple PRO. That's going to be really important because that product is going to fit across a broad geography. As you know the last couple of years we haven't seen a lot of drought. So it's also going to be a great opportunity for us to test how the trait performs in different germplasms. So we are excited about that. And I hinted in my comments that we will take exactly that approach when we bring the double stack of Roundup Ready 2 Yield and dicamba tolerance into the marketplace in 2013.</p>
          <p>So yes, it's an important part of how we've dealt with both the interaction of the traits and genetics and how we expect to manage the complexity of these new traits in the marketplace.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, thank you. Your corn sales were up 46%. Can you sort of break that down for us between price, volume and mix, and what kind of pricing do you expect in the upcoming US season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we've seen &#x2013; I mean it's still early days, P.J., but I would say as we look at the season development, we have seen limited amounts of price discount in comparison to what we have seen in previous years. But I maybe ask &#x2013; I maybe ask Pierre a quick dissection between price volume mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So P.J., if you look at the first quarter numbers, as we mentioned, most of the first quarter numbers definitely are coming from South America. And at the very high level, the way I look at it personally, I mean, I would break down the growth in between what's volume related, which would account for a little less than 50% and what is the trait extension and the mix benefits we are seeing, plus the price benefits we are seeing with new germplasm in South America.</p>
          <p>So I would look at it as a 50/50 and obviously when you look at the level of margins, as I mentioned during the call, this is one of the reasons because of the trait expansion that we have seen our margin in percent increase from 55% to 60% in corn. So, I mean, the great news is we've got headwinds both on the mix side and on the volume side in South America, and the first quarter definitely is a South America quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So just one question. If RNAi is successful with rootworm, would that mean that SmartStax ends up changing, meaning you would take the Herculex rootworm out of SmartStax. And related, should we expect you to start applying RNAi to above-ground pests relatively soon or is that going to take a while longer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the question. We are very excited about the RNAi technology. As you know, this was a recently discovered mechanism in biology. In fact, the original university scientist who discovered this technology received the Nobel Prize for it. We've worked on it very aggressively. You may not know in addition to the Corn Rootworm III product, our new Vistive Gold product also utilizes the RNAi technology and will be one of the first agricultural products commercialized with it. So it's an exciting opportunity and as I mentioned in my comments today, Rootworm III represents a really unique and novel mode of action.</p>
          <p>I think the way &#x2013; as you think through the commercial development, you have seen us stack multiple modes of action together so it gives us the opportunity to build on the SmartStax platform but also the opportunity to create new combinations of products for the future, and one of the things I see really exciting about the RNAi technology is that we are advancing the first product but in our pipeline, we are testing other RNAis with different modes of action and mechanisms that are completely different. So that's very exciting and really a centerpiece of technology for us.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning and Happy New Year. My questions relate to the vegetable platform. I think you have a goal there to grow profit to the point where it becomes the third largest contributor behind corn and soybeans. Some of the commentary this morning sounded incrementally a little bit more cautious. I think you referenced limited growth opportunity for the year. Sales and earnings were down in the quarter. Maybe can you elaborate a little bit on what is going on there and whether or not you still feel there's an opportunity to achieve that third place status, if you will, in the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Kevin, thank you, and Happy New Year to you as well. We still see &#x2013; we mentioned this in November &#x2013; we still see this having the capacity to become our third biggest platform. I think that's going to take time. I don't know if Rob is going to say a few words on markers. We are very enthusiastic with the progress that we are making in new product development. I think what we are seeing this year, and we'll &#x2013; I think Pierre's comments were cautious as we look at the projections for the remainder of the year. A big piece of that business is European. We have seen softness in that European market. Our assumption is that it's tied to the general turmoil in Europe. I think we will be a bit smarter come another quarter or two. But as we look out over the year, we are a bit more conservative on our veg projections in Europe. The rest of the business is actually tracking pretty well.</p>
          <p>So I think long term, we still see the opportunity as that becoming a third platform. We see really good advances in the technology and in product development, but as we look out over the next two or three quarters, we're going to be a little bit more conservative until we see how Europe shakes out. I don't know if my colleagues have anything to add to it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only thing I would highlight, and you see it in my deck, that we are just now starting to see the wave of really unique technology differentiation coming through the application of markers in the vegetable platform. I think our team there, Marlin Edwards and his team have just done a spectacular job of really bringing the new marker and the sequencing technology into vegetables and so I'm really excited about the &#x2013; starting to see the wave of pipeline advances. I think that's really what drives the ultimate differentiation of the business for us and continues to keep it as an exciting growth platform.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a follow-up, if I may on the subject of timing issues. I heard you mention the $0.04 related to cotton in Australia. Were there any timing issues in North American Seeds and Genomics, as it relates to sales and earnings impact as distinct from the prepay or cash flow impact that you referenced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually in the first quarter, the US plays a very small role and we didn't see any significant change from a year-to-year in the first quarter. So really, speaking about the US, we are mostly speaking about the order book, because in the actual results, the US doesn't weigh a big, big weight in the first quarter. So really, the way to look at it is really the first quarter is South America from a corn perspective with some support from South Africa, but that's pretty much it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You had a very good preorder book and I am just curious to what extent do you worry that might be farmers themselves worried about availability and double ordering. I know that some of our contacts suggest there's the risk of sell and substitute from some of these smaller firms that will have some challenges. Are you providing guarantees on availability? And then for Rob, it seems like the first time in a while with your dicamba trait in soybean, you've actually got a competitor that is on a relatively similar timeline. So I am just curious if you could size up how important first mover advantage is versus the Dow and list product and also the fact that they have got multiple modes of herbicide instead of only two. Does that really matter? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Bob, thanks for your questions. So on the order book, we feel very good. You know, Pierre's point &#x2013; you know, it's a small quarter for the US but as we look at the order book and how it's firming up, we feel very good as we go into the season.</p>
          <p>I &#x2013; there's a lot of noise out there on seed availability. We feel confident on our ability to supply across brands and across zones. And I think the piece that's given us reassurance as we travel the year into 2012 is, we passed our early December cancellation date and as you pass that date, the order book fattens significantly. So I don't see this as panic buying as much as a recognition on the yield increment that we are delivering and farmers rewarding us for that with their early commitments. But the fact that we've passed that first week in December is another level of commitment as you pass those early cancellation points.</p>
          <p>And then, Rob, maybe a few words.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure on your question relative to some of the competitive traits, Bob; so first of all I'd tell you up front that 2,4-D and dicamba are both very good, established broadleaf products. They are similar auxin class of chemistry and I think they will both be two really almost brand new tools in the context of biotech traits for growers to have access to.</p>
          <p>I think I have tried to highlight what I think the benefits of dicamba are. Basically we are working closely with BASF on new, reduced volatility formulations that look very, very good in development. Some of the things that we particularly like about the dicamba chemistry are the fact that it has a very broad spectrum of all broadleaf weeds. It has very few resistant weeds that are known and the nice thing about dicamba, is that we are seeing a surprising level of residual activity, which means the farmer can put the dicamba application and then be able to control emerging weeds for several weeks afterwards and that's a real advantage. So I think it's well positioned. I mean, we are looking at other herbicide tolerance traits. We are combining LibertyLink and others.</p>
          <p>I think our key advantage is we are working on a program with a great chemistry. We are going to stack it with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and we are going to be doing Ground Breaker trials in 2013. So I think we have a timing advantage and I think that's terrific. And again, I can't overstate how important it is to have the ability to combine those traits with a genetic platform that has the strong performance that we're seeing out of our soybean breeding effort and out of the Asgrow brand.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, congratulations on a good quarter. I just wanted to circle back here with South America and it seems like we've had some dry weather and some real hot weather as we have entered into the pollination season, probably more so in Argentina than Brazil. But do you think that is going to have any impact on the safrinha volumes potentially in Brazil and then secondarily, how reliant are you guys on the South American seed production? Is there any issues to some of that crop coming into the US? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for the questions. Two or three points; I guess the first one is, every year we do winter production in Latin America. So we have experience in that. You are right, Argentina is warm, is warmer than it is in Brazil. If you look at our seed production down there, 100% of what we produce is irrigated. So it doesn't guarantee success but it certainly mitigates the risk of dry conditions. So as we think about bringing seeds back, we feel good about our processes and our logistics, and we feel good about our production fields down there.</p>
          <p>So I think that kind of covers that end of it. And then if you look at production in general, Argentina has had a lot of coverage in the last few weeks. The piece that probably isn't covered as much, is you look at Mato Grosso in Brazil and they are forecasting significantly higher yields. So I think Argentina, there's areas in Argentina are going to be stretched. As we look at our own seed production, we feel okay. As we look at the region in general, you have to imagine, late June/July in the US and that's kind of the timing of that right now. So you are right, it's a squeeze right around the time of pollination but from our own physical production, we feel good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Happy New Year, everybody. Just a question on soybeans. Pioneer has been out there the dotting the Midwest with these bulk bins about every 15 or 20 miles and their customers are claiming that it's convenient for them to make seed pickups and it lowers their cost of seed treatment. I'm just curious, what is Monsanto's answer to Pioneer's program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we &#x2013; our focus in this really has been &#x2013; our focus in this really, Andy has been delivering better beans that provide better yield, and logistics is one component but I think genetics at the end of the day makes the really big difference. I don't know, Rob if you have any answer -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's the key. In the end, the yield advantage we are seeing with our Roundup Ready 2 Yield technology and the ability to stack with dicamba is great. But I think the other point that I just ought to emphasize is as you look at our strategy and both our licensed genetic platforms and our brands, we have &#x2013; our retailers and dealers are also doing bulk availability of beans. So I don't really see that as a differentiator at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-on, Pioneer has been pretty successful with their value pricing strategy in beans and so far they haven't signed up for the Roundup Ready 2 Yield license. So I'm just curious, if that continues to be the case, are you going to have to rethink your pricing strategy around Roundup Ready 2 Yield beans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all speculative, Andy, because as we sit here today, DuPont hasn't made that step and licensed Roundup Ready 2 Yield. I have been very clear in the last year that our stall is open and we would be very happy to have them as a licensee. We've made that offer, but they have never closed that deal.</p>
          <p>I tell you, the way that we think about this isn't from the perspective of what kind of bag or what kind of box do you deliver it in? We feel good about where we are in our bulk delivery systems. What the grower is looking for at the end of the day is who delivers more bushels. And when you look particularly in the environment at the moment, with where commodity prices are, and you look at the switch that's occurred in the last 24 &#x2013; well, actually, 36 months now on the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform, I think the results speak for themselves. So the grower is going to look for performance. He's going to look at optimizing every acre that he has and it's our job to get the best possible genetics and the best possible performance out there. That's how we are thinking about the run up to this spring.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Sort of a two-part question; first question is to Rob, in that your nitrogen uptake, your &#x2013; for corn, your nitrogen utilization trait didn't advance this time. And I was wondering whether you were running into some obstacles in that program and if you were, what were they? And then the second part is to go back to a previous questioner, your deferred revenues are up about 50% year-over-year or about $660 million. And so I was wondering why that rate of growth didn't really translate into an appreciable change in your earnings outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, so Rob, maybe a couple of words on nitrogen. I think nitrogen advanced a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jeff, if you look at the slide, you'll see that it advanced phase last year. So we are pleased with the progress. In fact, we have this year studied a number of second, third, fourth generation nitrogen leads. This is an area where the research is quite active and we're excited about the early results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the deferred piece, I will maybe defer the deferral to Pierre, but Jeff, just a couple of words on philosophy. We've &#x2013; you know, the first quarter is 10% of the year. We've got 90% to play for, but I will tell you, if I look at the order book, if I look at what's happened in Latin America, I feel very good at how the year is panning out. And I also feel good about the move that we have made to the upper end of our guidance. So maybe you are looking for more, but I think where we are sitting, I think is exactly the right stance to take, but Pierre on the deferral again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So speaking back to the deferred revenues on the balance sheet, I mean, really as we said, a big factor in those deferred revenue is the amount of available cash at farm gate. I mean, that's really where the key driver of those prepays is. What is great is that it definitely supports our order book and that's really the way we look at it. That's why we feel extremely good at it, collecting the cash, having the votes from farmers. At the same time, we don't consider that yet as a significant upside. I mean, this is really &#x2013; we look at it more in terms of a cash flow management from the farmer's side and a vote of confidence at the same time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. Rob, you were talking about the drought tolerant corn, that you got the USDA approvals last month. And then as you are looking to commercialize this in the 2013, 2014 timeframe, you need to get the international regulatory stack approvals as well. Can you talk a little bit more about the process involved, the countries and the expected timing where you need to get those international approvals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So with the US approval, that gives us the ability this year to put the seed out into the US market, and to do our testing with the growers, which is a great advantage and let's us follow up on larger scale testing of the trait and the genetic packages. So &#x2013; and then to the heart of your question, for many of the import countries, the data packages for the ultimate product have to be based on all the integrated traits. So once you get the approval for the D1 gene and it's now stacked, as you would commercially with a Double PRO or Triple PRO product, we need import country approvals for all of the traits as a stack package.</p>
          <p>So we've submitted those, but those take additional time and in some cases, the clock doesn't start until you get the deregulation of the drought gene in the US in certain countries and regulations. So that's what's going on, and then, over the course of the rest of 2012, 2013, as we go into 2014, we'll achieve the full set of international approvals and be able to go into launch of the integrated product package.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it might be a situation where it takes through 2013 in order to get the full approvals? I'm just trying to gauge the likeliness of a commercial launch in '13 versus '14.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. With some farmers experiencing issues when they plant continuous corn and with some of the bug resistant headlines that popped up over the past few months, have you seen any changes in farmer behavior as to what crop they intend to plant this year, what hybrids to use, what chemicals they will apply? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Elaine. I will maybe let Rob say a few words. But I'll tell you, as I've traveled and I have done some of the sessions in the countryside with growers this year, they are focused on optimizing profitability. And it's maybe changed the way that they are looking at incorporating insecticide into some of those programs, but in general, they are selecting hybrids and they are selecting the best possible technology practices to drive yields. So we haven't seen the shift there. The acreage involved in this is half a percent or less. It's a very, very small area, but I would say that the closer you get to the farm, the more aware they are and the more practical the approach to driving solutions around us.</p>
          <p>It's more a mitigation and insurance approach than anything else. But, Rob, I don't know if you have anything to add to that?&gt;</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I really can't add much, other than, when you are actually sitting down with corn growers, this is not an item that comes up. I mean, corn growers like to talk about what's going on with ethanol subsidies or with corn prices but I get very little feedback on rootworm and that's because such a small percentage of the corn production has dealt with any rootworm issues. There's a tremendous amount of excitement with the SmartStax RIB complete and the Double PRO RIB product. So we certainly haven't seen any changes reflected either in the order book or in grower purchases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I guess that would be the final validation point to Rob's last point. If we look at the composition of our order book and we look at our projections on the RIB family, and our triple stacks it really &#x2013; it tracks exactly in line with where we were projecting, which is kind of validation in terms of how our customers are purchasing, Elaine.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much for the questions, and I think Bryan, I'll just have a few very brief words to respect your time. I think in closing on behalf of all of us here at Monsanto, we wish you a happy and a healthy new year and thank you for your support and for joining us this morning.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned in my opening comments, this was a &#x2013; this first quarter was a strong quarter, and that gives us the data points that reinforce our 2012 opportunity and the drivers we see in continued growth. And the near term, we are seeing momentum from the growing Latin American opportunity and we featured that in our November Investor Day and it's playing out in this quarter. But we also see the opportunity in our core business in the US and that's reflected in our constants and our delivering at the high end of our original EPS guidance expectations.</p>
          <p>Beyond this year, we have increased our focus in becoming the yield company, delivering valuable yields to our grower customers. That shows in our strategy. It shows in our products and it shows in the pipeline that Rob shared with you today. What matters most to growers is yield and I tell you that I believe we're in the best position today to deliver that yield. We're expanding our competitive lead and that's what drives our opportunity to serve our farmer customers.</p>
          <p>So again, all the best to you and yours as we start this new year and thank you very much again for joining us this morning.</p>
