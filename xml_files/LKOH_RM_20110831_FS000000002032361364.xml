          <p>[Foreign Language]</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Days per share also in quarter 2011 (00:25) basic earnings per share grew 80%, net income per barrel of production $16.70 per barrel, which is the best performance in the industry, considering some allowances that exist for Western Siberian field. Free cash flow went up and EBITDA is better than market expected. The macroeconomic and the tax environment, on the whole, basically all factors were positive.</p>
          <p>The prices were growing, while at the same time, the ruble was appreciating, as you can see by 15% and exports duties and the mineral extraction tax were growing at an accelerated rate. As you can see, this mineral extraction tax rate was growing faster than the barrel price. The tax grew by 55.3%. At the same time, there was a moratorium on raising gasoline prices. So the input of the retail sector, especially here in Russia into this financial performance, is almost negligible, is almost negative even.</p>
          <p>Next slide, main operating results. Our crude oil sales in Russia grew, refined product sales in Russia also grew. We have observed unprecedented demand this year and the forecast that we had for demand on gasoline, most likely this forecast will turn out to be very modest. In the next couple of years, we expect significant growth. Exports decline is due to the fact that we've been putting sales in Russia, the NASDAQ in Russia that time was higher in Russia, and we also have a negative factor, which is a decline in production of hydrocarbons by 4.4%.</p>
          <p>The main financial results are shown on this slide, and we have already published them on our website. You can see that sales went up, OpEx also went up somewhat, while operating expenses are growing at the same rate as the ruble is appreciating, and net income increased significantly in the first six months, it was $6.7 billion and the EBITDA was $10.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Sales breakdown, traditionally the main contribution in sales comes from sales of oil and petrochemical products and chemical products in the western market. This sector remains to be very appealing to us, at the same time, we have grown our sales of power and gas in the domestic market, <mark type="ph" /> following (3:41) gas in Russia started generating additional profits.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, you will see the effect of the whole market situation with gasoline in Russia in the first six months of this year. We gave out warnings repeatedly that the whole gasoline issue is very sensitive, due to the dynamic growth of the car fleet. There is a scrappage program now in Russia, and because of this scrappage program in particular, we started seeing people queuing up to buy cars.</p>
          <p>Again, the fleet is expanding and unfortunately, some of the economic departments in Russia, I mean, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (4:31) statistics, they speak about gasoline, and they say that there are 32 million tons of production of gasoline in Russia. In fact, only high-octane gasoline should be included into the analysis. Everything that surrounds gasoline of octane number 95, so if you look only at high-octane gasoline, you will see that only in that segment where there is a shortage, real shortage.</p>
          <p>So what we should talk here about is that, not that there is not enough gasoline as such. There is a shortage of high-octane gasoline, something that you use for your own cars. So there is demand for high-octane gasolines and the decisions you &#x2013; <mark type="ph" /> to earn euro II (5:24) regulation is not a solution &#x2013; it's not a perfect solution, that's why our company invested significantly into our own refining capacities here locally, you can see that we increased our other &#x2013; yes, production refining, gasoline production in Russia increased by 13%.</p>
          <p>And we have also taken decisions to build a second line of catalytic cracking capacity. We want to double production of high-octane gasolines in North Sea by 2015. And we want to pull it into the second group according to the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:14) Index.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses. Leasing costs went up 12%, while the ruble was appreciating at the rate of 15%. Our own refining expenses rose because of stoppage at the Odessa refinery. We talked to our Ukrainian partners. Current operation of the plant is not economically efficient and that's why we stopped it. We have to suspend production there, and then there is this whole story of upgrading our refining capacities to produce more high-octane gasoline.</p>
          <p>Other expenses, operating expenses, were growing in line with our plans, as to petrochemical expenses and other operating expenses, we started a plant in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (7:06) and of course, we have seen a growth in those items of expenses.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses analysis. As you will see, almost all operating expenses are under control. There is very strong discipline. Every increase in expenses is either substantiated by production needs or by the ruble appreciation. In the next six months of the year, we expect the ruble to continue appreciating &#x2013; or rather the dollar depreciating. Because of that, our reporting will be, to a certain degree, under the impact of this factor.</p>
          <p>Next slide, transportation and administrative expenses. Not many news here, nothing unexpected. The tariffs were growing, but they were growing in a controlled fashion, I'd like to thank the government for this. It's not happening the way it used to grow in the past, but there is still the lower inflation rate, administrative and transportation expenses where growth is even below the rates of the ruble appreciation.</p>
          <p>Net income reconciliation. You can see the dynamics on the slide. Mainly, we see the contribution of revenues here. Revenue increase have the biggest effect on those dynamics, and also there is this situation where the mineral extraction tax, and we now can include into the calculation of the tax, how to get reserves.</p>
          <p>Then we must also remember about other taxes on export duties, they were rising, but more or less, we can talk about record profits in this first six months of the year. Right now, the company is enjoying unprecedented free cash flow. We've never had more than $4 billion in free cash flow, and this gives us an excellent possibility to tackle many of the production challenges.</p>
          <p>CapEx breakdown, the biggest item in capital expenditure is exploration and production. We will continue investing into exploration and production. We need to overcome the decline in production that we observe today. And as we have promised, investments into refining and marketing will decrease year-after-year, and they will continue to decrease because of the major investments that we needed to make, especially into our foreign projects, they have been already made, so you can see the numbers here, a very small $124 million for international projects in refining and marketing for the first six months of the year, this is very little.</p>
          <p>Although we do invest almost $0.5 billion into international &#x2013; we have already invested $0.5 billion into international projects. International projects is a niche that, well &#x2013; or rather not a niche, but rather a space where the company will be able to grow in the future. Now the most painful issue is obviously the decrease in production of hydrocarbons, it's the first year in the company's history when we have negative production.</p>
          <p>Uplift, the main contribution here is Naryanmarneftegaz. The American geologists made a mistake in assessing dynamics of reserves and reserves themselves, dynamics of reservoirs. So, because of that mistake, this decline has been very rapid. But, on a more positive side, we have seen the biggest drop from today and onwards, we do not expect any major declines like this.</p>
          <p>Now we have taken certain steps towards maintaining production using various methods, tertiary methods of supporting reservoir pressure, for instance, and other measures to intensify production. And we believe that, starting from 2012, in Western Siberia, we will be able to stabilize situation. And starting from 2013, our production there will start growing.</p>
          <p>And please also notice that, at a number of our producing facilities that are very old, were put into production even before western Siberia, like LUKOIL-Perm, year-after-year we see growth, steady growth. It means that our geologists, our explorers, have plenty of experience in dealing with old fields.</p>
          <p>We want to bring recovery index to 40 and this is a very realistic figure. In Perm, for instance, there we have one of our headquarters for the European part of Russia. And we've talked to the Perm management today, and they've told us that there, our recovery rates have gone from 32% to 40% in the Perm region, overall Perm is one of our oldest provinces. Current recovery rates in Western Siberia are below 20%, it means that we can at least double them.</p>
          <p>So the company has resources, reserves enough. The company has the financial resources. The company possesses intellectual and technological capabilities, and we are sure that we will overcome the decline in production. We expect that in 2012, again, we will be able to stabilize production and starting from 2013, we will see, although moderate, but long-term growth. We expect growth to continue over a decade, given our reserves.</p>
          <p>International projects also have a big impact on our production. They contribute a lot. On the one hand, there is a slight decline in production in Kazakhstan, but almost all other foreign projects are in the positive. For three years, the government has almost put a stop to any possibilities of growth in Russia. So of course, we pay more attention to our international projects, and we hope that the company will meet with a success overseas.</p>
          <p>In international projects, we not only have reserves, but the taxation, legislation is much more favorable there. So the company continues acquiring new reserves. Recently, we acquired a block in the Republic of Sierra Leone. This is the area where, in Africa, several major discoveries have already been made there; we see two blocks, one block is huge with good promising reserves, the other one is smaller, but there the reserves have been already discovered.</p>
          <p>We've been fighting for this acreage for a long time, and we are very happy that this SL-5 offshore block area came into our hands, and we have &#x2013; we are positive about Sierra Leone. We continue drilling in Ghana, very soon we'll start drilling in the Ivory Coast and hopefully by the end of the year, we will already have new information, new data that we will be able to share with you.</p>
          <p>A new region for us is the shelf of Vietnam; before us only Nizhnevolzhskneft, together with other companies operated there, but now with our partners, we have access to HT-02. This is a field that's very close to Tien Hai field, it's a gas field and it supplies Hanoi. We hope that the potential for gas and oil fields will be really here, but the geology there is extremely challenging, and that's why we were invited to join that field. We expect to drill three oil exploration wells in 2011, they're not very deep. So from a technology point of view, this is all very realistic.</p>
          <p>Record profits and the record cash flow enabled us to cut the net debt of the company in the first six months of the year, and we saved $2.2 billion. And all the financial covenants today are very stable and healthy for us today. And of course, we could not mention that today, LUKOIL is the leader of Russian oil industry in terms of financial performance, we can't disclose the names of Peer 1, Peer 2 and Peer 3, but the analysts are most likely to understand which companies stand behind us.</p>
          <p>And on <mark type="ph" /> procurement (17:25), you can see, in terms of EBITDA, in terms of net income per barrel, LUKOIL is an undisputed leader, despite the fact that the benefits and allowances of our company, in short, is uncomparable to the benefits that other companies have in Western Siberia.</p>
          <p>All of this tells you that the management of the company puts all its efforts into improving the performance of the company. This year, we paid out a record dividend. If this year continues the same way, then next year you can expect also an increase in the dividends and the company thinks that it is quite possible that our growth will happen not only through intensification of our own production, but also through acquisitions. But of course, it takes time and it takes effort. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We all know that recently, LUKOIL entered into an agreement with Bashneft and Rosneft. How is the joint-venture shaping for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:07) field and also, if you could inform us about your cooperation with Rosneft?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (19:15) field is totally on track, and there are no problems there. We are extremely grateful to our partners for the constructive approach that they take, we believe that the schedule that we are on will &#x2013; again, if everything is on track, I'm sure that we will start the work on time, and we will reach production, forecasted production, on time.</p>
          <p>As to Rosneft, there the whole process is much more complicated, because there, the company is not yet targeting a foreign partner. You know that yesterday, and we congratulate them on this, Rosneft signed an important contract with an American company, now an American company has access to the Russian Arctic Shelf. And so, obviously all their resources went into that project and this is a priority for them. But the working group between our company and Rosneft continues to operate and as soon as we have news, you are going to hear about them.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the tax agency, you've mentioned today that there will be a program to stabilize production of hydrocarbons. What is the timeframe that you're looking at? What is the production that you target and how much are you going to invest into this? And in the press release, we also read that it's necessary to strengthen control over compliance of this program, how are you going to do this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in the past several days, we've been having some very tough talks with the heads of our production, and the CEO of the company said that he is not satisfied with their work and he demanded that this program is drafted until the end of the year. Again, there is potential. We understand how the company can move forward, how we can progress. The program is in the making. As soon as the program is ready, I'm sure that Mr. Alekperov will voice all the parameters of this program. As to our targets, by 2012, we need to stabilize production and starting from 2013, we need to see growth in production.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I have another question. LUKOIL is going to use its option to buy back <mark type="ph" /> as you have (21:36) communicate, as far as I remember, the option deadline is the 29 of September. And if yes, then how?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, they are sitting there on the shelf nicely, then I'm getting in the way. And given the turbulences in the market, I think that was the right choice. This is a very strong financial reserve for the company with our coefficients, with our ratios. For LUKOIL, this buyback of shares was the best investment that we could have done. And about dividends, another question I missed a little bit &#x2013; this year, we paid out record dividends. If nothing tragic happens on the market next year, the dividends will be even stronger.

          <p>We will have additional reserves, $300 million and $500 million for oil, for exports. And since we have already upgraded significantly our main refineries in Perm <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:03) we will have an additional advantage from the perspective of additional income from high-octane gasoline. So we can speak only about the positive effect for the company at $95 a barrel, well we came at $465 million. Now we hope that the government's decision will be executed and lower excise taxes on high-octane gasoline will be put into place and higher excise taxes will be put on bad gasoline and the effect will be even higher.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We never bid for that. What happened is, there was a selection round. It was like a competency exam, if you will, for the companies.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norway is the same story. We can fill slots from Norway. We are mostly attracted by hydrocarbons, and we were prequalified, among other companies. We were first of the Russian companies to obtain the permission to operate in the Arctic shelf. The logic is very simple, if Russia is not open to us, then we will work in Norway. Of course, there the fields are not as huge as in Russia, but the taxation regime is much more beneficial, favorable to the investors. So if we can't find projects that meet our profitability and return targets, then we will gladly go into Norway. Yes, please.</p>

          <p>Good evening. Thank you very much for the presentation. I have a question about downstream and your plans for investment into upgrade in Russian refineries. I understand about <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:39) catalytic cracking, but on the whole, what do you think about the upgrade program in LUKOIL? Your refining is already pretty state-of-the-art, especially in comparison with competition locally. So how much do you want to invest into downstream in Russia and what is the EBITDA effect that you expect with this new taxation regime and the 60/66 story?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. You know that investment into refining in the current economic climate and also the 60/66 <mark type="ph" /> might be, and that's (31:23) the full name of the program, are very lucrative, although a one-time investment is very big, in the long run, they will pay off nicely. We are about to complete upgrade of refinery. We are fully underway <mark type="ph" /> in Abadabad (31:43) and right now we are looking to the possibility of constructing the second line of catalytic cracking, let us say, to duplicate the recently launched catalytic cracking in Nizhniy Novgorod. So few of our refineries already have the index of higher than 83%, but Perm is behind this index, because they are producing a lot of fuel oil. And one of the second line for commission in fact, exceeds, and they will &#x2013; I'm sure they will exceed 90. We will produce an additional 2 million tons of gasoline and we think that there is market for this high-octane gasoline in Russia. I will not give you EBITDA projections, but in summary, the recent research project is in excess of 20%. The investment in catalytic cracking is about $800 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One point of clarification about Ghana, I understand about the technical delay, but how many wells do you plan to drill this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>According to the schedule, we must drill three wells. Only after we have drilled three wells and three structures, we will be able to tell you what is the prospect. We have three wells in Ghana pending, if I'm not mistaken, and another three wells in the Ivory Coast. And another three wells, as you have seen, in Vietnam till the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From the point of view of return, the rate of return in those regions, the prices on liquid, Ghana and Sierra Leone and to the Ivory Coast, what are the prices there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The well is not dried and all the projects will be very, very lucrative. It's a production sharing arrangement and the rate of return is higher than for Russian fields, for the time, when the cost feedback, it goes down, but all of the projects are pretty, pretty good. While you are risking with exploration, national governments of course are interested in engaging investors, because there the risk, at this stage, the risks are very high. But when the plant opens up, as happened in Angola, in Nigeria, or what is happening now in Brazil, the government starts offering completely different terms and conditions. And since we already bought our tickets, we are pioneers there and our risks are the biggest. If we succeed, then the rate of return will be very good. We have a question in English. Yes, please.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, I have two questions. The first question is about &#x2013; I know you can't quote the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand the question. I think I've already answered this question, no? And so what's the second question? What is your second question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My second question is about CapEx. Do you want to update your program on CapEx, and when can we find out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the second question? Sorry, I'm not sure I understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you speak about the investment programs for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (35:44) which CapEx, which capital expenditure is &#x2013; the line was not very clear, I'm sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We couldn't hear you very well. I think we answered your first question. We are under legal restrictions. We can't disclose any information about this deal. And if the second question is referring to capital expenditure on upstream then, this program will be finalized by the end of the year. And at that time, we will be able to understand how much investments we will have to make into this sector. But right now, I don't have any figures. I know that this investment will be huge, it will be significant, but everything will be within financial resources and capabilities of the company.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>We also have questions from online. Two more questions and then &#x2013; yes, we've got the question from Mark Henderson.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The sales of oil went up. Do we need to &#x2013; your sales have all domestically went up, do you want to continue with this strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, yes. For us, the most important factor is the net-net back. If net-net back in one area is higher than in another area, then of course we will sell in that region instead of the other.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will invest some into production and we plan to pay out dividends next year. It is also quite possible that we will make new acquisitions. Another question from the audience, please? Yes, please. The question is off the microphone.</p>

          <p>Well, if Vanco invites us, then it's possible. It may be efficient but, of course, it's pretty small. Conoco and LUKOIL have an agreement, but they must give each other the right to participate in each other's projects. So LUKOIL has this right and if we deem it necessary or possible or feasible, we will enter Vanco's projects.</p>
