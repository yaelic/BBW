          <p>Thank you for joining us today.</p>
          <p>This quarter we continued the trend of improving business performance, increasing constant currency revenue growth, expanding margin, and once again delivering double-digit earnings per share growth. We've now grown EPS in each of the last 30 quarters. And since the beginning of our 2010 roadmap, we've grown EPS at a double-digit rate in 12 of the last 14 quarters.</p>
          <p>Our revenue growth of 2% was 2 points better than our constant currency performance in the first quarter and 7 points better than our fourth quarter growth rate. Our revenue growth would have been about a point higher, adjusting for the divested PLM business. So on this basis, the improvement was broad-based across all segments and all geographies, including Europe.</p>
          <p>Our performance is driven by the investments we've been making to capture growth opportunities and to deliver value to our clients. We've been investing heavily to build out the infrastructures in the emerging countries. This quarter, our growth markets were up 14%, or 9% at constant currency, led by the BRIC countries, which were up 16% at constant currency. Our performance in the growth markets has consistently outpaced the major markets. And as a result, for the first half of this year, our business in the growth markets is now as large as our Eurozone business for the first time.</p>
          <p>We've been investing to extend our technology leadership. Earlier this year we introduced POWER7 technology to our midrange unit servers. And this quarter the midrange grew 11%, which resulted in 4 points of share gain in Power Systems. In the third quarter, we'll have POWER7 across our entire unit's product line, and we'll introduce and ship our next-generation mainframe solution.</p>
          <p>We've been investing in key growth areas such as business analytics. Our business analytics revenue was up 14%, which contributed to strong performance of both Software and Global Business Services. Global Business Services revenue growth improved to 3%, and Software key branded middleware was up 10% at constant currency. And we took share again this quarter in Software.</p>
          <p>We've been investing in acquisitions to build our skills and technology in support of our growth initiatives. In the first half, we have closed six acquisitions and announced another three, for a total of about $3 billion. These acquisitions add to our capabilities in areas such as industry solutions for Smarter Planet initiatives, and business analytics, and cloud computing. And this quarter we also continued to improve our profit profile, expanding pre-tax margin by a point and growing earnings per share by 13% to $2.61. And remember, we've delivered this profit performance compared to a strong second quarter of 2009, where we expanded pre-tax margin by over 4 points and grew EPS by 18%.</p>
          <p>So now based on our first half performance and our view of the second half, we're increasing our expectations for the full year 2010 to at least $11.25 of earnings per share. That's up from our view in April and up $0.25 from January.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the financial results for the quarter with a quick walk down the P&amp;L. We delivered $23.7 billion of revenue; that's up 2% as reported and at constant currency. We completed the sale of the software PLM operations at the end of the first quarter. This divestiture impacted IBM's revenue growth by about a point and our software growth by about 4 points.</p>
          <p>This quarter we dealt with the sharp strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. Currency provided 40 basis points of revenue growth as compared to the 200 to 300 basis points projected based on mid-April spot rates. So that's a 2- to 3-point impact to our revenue growth. So the currency movements since April impacted second quarter revenue by about $500 million. And if you consider the currency movements since mid-January, second quarter revenue was impacted by $1 billion.</p>
          <p>We expanded gross margin, driven by better margins in Global Business Services and Software. Our expense was down 1% year to year. Our operational expense performance was 5 points better, mitigated by impacts from currency and acquisitions. We increased pre-tax income by 7%, and pre-tax margin was up a point to 19.3%. Our tax rate was down just over a point year to year to 26%, in line with first quarter and our expected range for the full year. Net income improved 9%, and margin expanded nearly a point to 14.3%. And finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a 3% reduction in our share count.</p>
          <p>So bottom line, we delivered $2.61 of earnings per share, up 13% from a year ago. And while it's certainly more difficult to measure the currency contribution to the bottom line due to the impact of pricing and sourcing actions, we estimate that currency, including hedging activity, impacted earnings growth by 0.10 or $0.11 per share.</p>
          <p>So it's important to note that we're achieving this 13% growth off of strong profit performance in second quarter 2009, and in the face of a significant currency headwind. I'll address that in more detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to the revenue details, starting with a geographic view. In discussing the geo results, as always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. After substantial improvement in the year-to-year growth rates from fourth quarter to first, we again had an improving trend in year-to-year revenue growth from the first to the second quarter across our geographies, with the Americas and Asia Pacific each better by 2 points and Europe better by a point. The major markets also improved a point, with the best growth again coming from the UK, which was up a very strong 11%. And the U.S. returned to growth for the first time in seven quarters.</p>
          <p>Our growth markets grew 9%, outpacing the majors by 9 points. In the BRIC countries, which represent over a third of the growth markets, revenue grew 16%, with double-digit growth in each of the four countries. Our strong performance extended beyond the BRICs. In fact we had double-digit growth in over 35 countries this quarter, up from 30 in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our ongoing investments have positioned us to capture the fast-growing opportunity in these markets, and we've been rapidly expanding our base of business. As I mentioned earlier, our growth markets business is now as large as our Eurozone business, and at this pace we expect our growth markets to be larger by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to revenue by segment, our services business returned to revenue growth at constant currency, led by an 8-point improvement in Global Business Services' growth rate compared to the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our Software performance was excellent, with key branded middleware up 10% at constant currency, and total Software up 6%, excluding the divested PLM business.</p>
          <p>We're capturing growth in key areas like business analytics, storage management, and business integration. This quarter our Systems &amp; Technology business delivered mid-single-digit growth as expected, and we gained or held share in every brand. So on this basis, similar to the geo performance, we had improvement versus the first quarter growth rate in all segments at constant currency.</p>
          <p>Turning to expense, our total expense and other income was down 1%. With a 2% increase in revenue, our expense-to-revenue ratio improved 0.9 of a point year to year. The expense decline was driven by operational expense improvements of 5 points year to year. But this improvement was mitigated by currency, which impacted expense growth by 2 points, and acquisitions for another 2 points.</p>
          <p>We've had an ongoing focus on increasing efficiency and driving productivity across the enterprise. This is our eighth consecutive quarter of operational expense improvement. Some of the savings from our productivity initiatives goes to the bottom line, and some is reinvested back in the business. As an example, this quarter, while overall SG&amp;A was down 4% excluding currency and acquisitions, SG&amp;A in the growth markets was up 10%. This is consistent with our investment profile over the last two years, where our operational SG&amp;A spend for the growth markets was 10 or more points higher than the majors.</p>
          <p>I want to mention just a couple of items that had significant year-to-year impact to our profit this quarter. This quarter, our workforce rebalancing charges were less than $20 million, down about 50 million from the second quarter of last year. When you look at the year-to-year benefit in other income and expense, remember that last year we had a charge of almost $120 million related to an investment in a joint venture.</p>
          <p>Other income contains a significant portion of the impact from our hedge of cash flow programs. As you know, we hedge our major cross-border cash flows to mitigate the currency volatility in global cash planning. While our hedging programs generated a gain this quarter, it wasn't as large as the gain last year. The result is a year-to-year impact to profit of over $130 million, which is roughly 70% in expense and 30% in cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>This $130 million hedging impact is about $0.07 per share year to year. We also estimate that we had a translation impact to our earnings growth of about $0.03, so the total impact to the bottom line from currency is estimated at 0.10 or $0.11 overall.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to our segment pre-tax margins. Our improving business mix and productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our margin over time. This quarter, Software and Global Business Services had great margin performance, each up over a point. Our Systems &amp; Technology margins declined, due to mix of business and a higher level of investment to support our new product introductions this year.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the segments, starting with services. The two services segments returned to growth at constant currency this quarter, delivering 13.7 billion in revenue, up 2% year to year as reported, and up 1% at constant currency. This revenue performance was largely driven by Global Business Services, which improved its year-to-year growth rate by 8 points sequentially.</p>
          <p>Total signings were flat sequentially at 12.3 billion, down 12% year to year, with Global Business Services signings up 2% at constant currency. Backlog remains steady at 129 billion, up $1 billion adjusted for currency. The biggest driver of the signings decline was outsourcing, down 19%. Based on an assessment of our large outsourcing contracts, we had a significant decline in contract extensions, as a number of large deals rolled out of the quarter. Contract extensions have little to no benefit to near-term revenue.</p>
          <p>In contrast, we had good growth in new business signings, which have a more immediate contribution to revenue. When you look at the revenue that will be generated from these outsourcing signings, we will actually get more revenue over the next 12 months from this quarter's outsourcing signings of $6.5 billion than we did from last year's second quarter signings of $8 billion. So the strength of new business signings in outsourcing contributes to an improving revenue trend for the rest of the year, and shows why it's important not to put too much emphasis on just the absolute signings number.</p>
          <p>Moving to transactional signings, which include integrated technology services, consulting, and AMS systems integration, signings were down 3%, again an improvement from first quarter at constant currency. You can see improving performance in transactional signings over the past several quarters in our supplemental charts. It shows a positive trend and good momentum as we move into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>This quarter, ITS growth improved from first quarter rates at constant currency, and AMS grew. In consulting, signings were up 17% in North America, and up in total for the first half, although total consulting was down in the quarter as a number of deals rolled out of the quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall, we signed 15 deals greater than $100 million. And as I said, total services backlog at the end of the quarter was 129 billion, up $1 billion adjusting for currency, though down 2 billion at actual rates, and we had another quarter with very low backlog erosion.</p>
          <p>Now I'll go to the key drivers of performance in the two services segments. In Global Technology Services, revenue was $9.2 billion, up 1% year to year as reported and flat at constant currency. GTS outsourcing revenue was up 2% in the quarter, and Integrated Technology Services revenue was down 2%. We had good performance in the growth markets, with revenue up over 8% at constant currency in each of these businesses.</p>
          <p>Global Technology Services' pre-tax income was up slightly in the quarter with margin at 14.9%. With the benefit of the first quarter rebalancing activity coming in the second half of the year and an improved revenue growth trend, we expect to expand margin in the second half.</p>
          <p>Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was up 3%, both as reported and at constant currency. We saw an improved performance in many areas of the business, as we grew revenue in both the major markets and the growth markets, in all sectors with the exception of communications sector, and in both consulting and AMS, where we had particular strength in North America, with combined revenue up 8% at constant currency. From an offering perspective, we had double-digit growth in both business analytics and Smarter Planet.</p>
          <p>Global Business Services pre-tax profit was up 12% year to year, with margin expanding 1.3 points to 14.6%. This expansion was driven by higher utilization and benefits from the continued implementation of our globally integrated capabilities. At the same time, we're continuing to add to our skill base and invest for future growth.</p>
          <p>To wrap up services, we saw a number of positive signs and improving trends in the quarter. We had improvement in the revenue growth rate sequentially, with a return to growth at constant currency for total services. GBS revenue was up 3%, with 8 points of improvement in the growth rate. We had good recovery in AMS. We had very good new customer signings in outsourcing. Backlog was up $1 billion year to year with a low level of erosion. And we have a good pipeline of deals going into third quarter.</p>
          <p>With this level of performance, the total services revenue growth rate should improve in the second half. This improvement will be led by GBS with its higher transactional content. And with the benefits of the first quarter resource rebalancing, we expect to see margin expansion in the second half as well.</p>
          <p>Software had another strong quarter of revenue performance with revenue of $5.3 billion. That's up 2% year to year or 6% adjusting for the divestiture of PLM, which is a more appropriate view of our ongoing business.</p>
          <p>Key branded middleware grew 9% at actual rates and 10% at constant currency and gained share for the 11th straight quarter as we continue to solidify our lead in the middleware market. The share gain was broad-based, across WebSphere, Information Management, Tivoli, and Rational. Key branded middleware accounted for 62% of our total Software revenue, up 4 points from this time last year. Both the WebSphere and Tivoli brands grew at double digits year to year, and we had strong performance in the business analytics product set. Segment pre-tax income was $2 billion, up 7% year to year, and pre-tax margin improved 1.3 points to 33%. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of margin expansion in the Software segment.</p>
          <p>Now, let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another excellent quarter, growing 17%, and gained share in all segments with strong performance across the portfolio. Application servers, which provide customers with secure and resilient infrastructure for mission-critical business applications, grew 32%. Business integration software, which includes our ILOG and Lombardi acquisitions, grew 12%.</p>
          <p>Information management also had a strong quarter, growing 7%. Information management software offerings provide the foundation for IBM's business analytics and optimization offerings. Tivoli had another terrific quarter in all three market segments, and grew 18% in total. Enterprise Asset Management within the systems management portfolio grew double digits. This continues to be a critical component of IBM's Smarter Planet solutions.</p>
          <p>In security software, we had strength across the portfolio and in all geographies. Our Tivoli storage products also continue to perform very well, growing double digits and gaining share. As an example, XIV software, which provides ease of use and lower total cost of ownership, more than doubled. And Tivoli Storage Manager grew 10% this quarter, driven by its market-leading data reduction capabilities and related cost benefits.</p>
          <p>The breadth and diversity of our software portfolio, combined with strategic investments in high-growth areas, have enabled us to achieve consistently strong results in the Software segment. We expect to deliver similar levels of revenue performance in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Systems &amp; Technology revenue was $4 billion, up 3% year to year or 4% at constant currency. Revenue was driven by continued growth in Systems x, storage, retail stores, and microelectronics. We had strong performance in the growth markets. BRIC countries grew 20% year to year, with growth in all brands, and we expect the strength in growth markets to continue in the second half. Gross profit margin was down 1 point, driven by mix.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter, we will announce new high-end servers. Both the System z and high-end Power servers will be refreshed with availability in the middle of September.</p>
          <p>Now, let me take you through more details on the brands. Power Systems revenue declined 10% year to year. Our new POWER7 products drove midrange growth of 11%, and Power blades growth of over 65%. This performance drives our ninth-consecutive quarter of share gain.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we had 225 competitive Unix displacements, of which almost two-thirds were from Sun. This resulted in $225 million of business and nearly 4 points of share gain. This is a sequential increase of over $75 million from the first quarter, where we gained over 7 points of share. We have now won 620 deals from Sun totaling nearly $650 million over the last six quarters. The win rate has been increasing, and we expect these take-outs to continue throughout the second half.</p>
          <p>This quarter we will announce our POWER7 entry and high-end systems with availability in September. Our high-end systems will scale up to 256 cores and are capable of running 1,000 virtual images, which is four times more than our current high-end POWER6 processors. Additionally, the energy efficiency of these new high-end systems will be five to seven times more efficient than the latest Unix systems from both Sun and Hewlett-Packard.</p>
          <p>Storage revenue grew 5% year to year. Disk revenue grew 12%, or 14% at constant currency, driven by continued strength in high-end offerings, XIV, and DS8000. XIV added more than 130 new customers to the platform in the second quarter, and revenue more than doubled year to year. System x revenue grew 30% year to year, led by our high-volume offerings and our System x blades. X blades grew 16% year to year. The high end of System x was up 17% and gained share. This high-end performance, combined with the growth in blades and improvements in end-to-end operational efficiencies, contributed to improved gross profit margin performance in System x.</p>
          <p>System z revenue declined 24% year to year. This week IBM will announce the next generation of System z, the fastest and most scalable enterprise server in the industry. This server provides 40% more performance on a mix of workloads than the equivalent z10. Some workloads can achieve greater performance improvements, such as Linux, which has 60% better performance and 35% lower cost. This announcement is the foundation for IBM's first system of systems, which provides the capability to manage 10 times the virtual machines of VMware by extending mainframe governance to our other industry-leading technologies.</p>
          <p>Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 23% year to year. Both our 300 millimeter and 200 millimeter fabs are fully utilized.</p>
          <p>Systems &amp; Technology continued its revenue growth this quarter, with strong performance in disk storage, System x, microelectronics, and Retail Store Solutions. And with the introduction of new high-end systems in third quarter, I expect this growth rate to improve in the third and fourth quarters, and to deliver double-digit PTI growth for the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Turning to cash flow, we generated 3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, which was down $400 million year to year, driven by higher capital investments of $100 million in support of hardware product announcements, as well as a prior-year foreign tax refund of $360 million.</p>
          <p>In the first half, our free cash flow of $4.4 billion was flat year to year. We had strong operating performance, driven by higher net income of 600 million, and sales cycle working capital improvements of 350 million year to year. This was offset by higher capital investments for new hardware products and semiconductor technology, and a year-to-year impact of over $700 million for unique one-time tax refunds, as previously disclosed. Excluding these unique tax refunds, free cash flow would have been up 700 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at the uses of cash in the first half, we spent $1 billion for six acquisitions in support of our growth strategy. The largest of these were National Interest Security, Initiate Systems, Lombardi, and Cast Iron Systems.</p>
          <p>In addition, we returned almost $10 billion to the shareholders in the first half. $8.1 billion was in the form of share repurchases, and we have about $6 billion remaining from our last board authorization. We took our dividend up 18% in April and paid out 1.6 billion in dividends. This is the 15th consecutive year that we raised our dividend, and we've more than tripled our dividend over the last five years.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to the balance sheet, where we see the impact of our cash performance. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $12.2 billion, more than two-thirds of which was in the U.S. Our collections remain strong.</p>
          <p>Total debt was $26.7 billion. $21 billion of debt was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7.1 to 1. $5.5 billion was non-financing debt that was down from $6.6 billion a year ago. Non-financing debt-to-cap was 23%, up from 16% in December and down from 35% a year ago. With this level of leverage, we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.</p>
          <p>I'll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter, all categories positively contributed to our earnings growth. Our revenue growth, at constant mix and margin, contributed a nickel. The largest contributor was operating leverage, driven by gross margin expansion, improving expense productivity, and a year-to-year improvement in the tax rate. And a 3% reduction in share count contributed $0.08.</p>
          <p>So once again, our growth was delivered through a combination of revenue growth, margin expansion, and an effective use of cash. And while it's not uniquely identified in the bridge, we overcame a currency headwind of 0.10 to $0.11 on our way to 13% earnings per share growth.</p>
          <p>Now, for the last several years, we have consistently delivered strong earnings growth. Since early 2007, when we first introduced our 2010 roadmap, we've delivered double-digit EPS growth each year and in 12 of the last 14 quarters. Compared to the Dow, IBM is the only company to have positive year-to-year growth in each of the last 14 quarters.</p>
          <p>In each of these periods, which spanned a variety of economic environments, we faced unique opportunities and challenges. There are many dimensions of IBM's business model, from business mix to global scale and structure to financial strength and flexibility, that have allowed us to overcome challenges and capitalize on opportunities while we consistently deliver.</p>
          <p>This quarter, we dealt with a significant currency headwind caused by the sharp strengthening of the dollar and still delivered 13% earnings per share growth against a very strong second quarter of last year, which had 18% EPS growth. So while some companies will show growth this quarter as they recover from their losses in the recession, IBM is building on our strong performance over the last eight years.</p>
          <p>We continued our steady improvement in the business in both revenue growth and margin expansion. And we used our strong profit and cash position to invest and expand our base of opportunity while returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback.</p>
          <p>Looking forward to the second half, we'll have exciting new product introductions with our new mainframe system of systems, and POWER7 technology across our Power Systems product line. We'll continue to leverage investments in our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, business analytics, and growth markets. We'll integrate the acquisitions announced this quarter. We'll yield the benefits from our first quarter workforce rebalancing actions. And we'll continue to drive efficiencies and increase productivity, all while continuing to invest in innovation throughout the business. All of this supports our expectation of at least $11.25 of earnings per share for the year.</p>

          <p>Yes, thank you. Mark, you went through each of the businesses in terms of your outlook for the remainder of the year. On Software you said to expect a similar kind of growth rate to continue. For hardware, you stated that it should improve. And for services you stated it should improve as well. Can you clarify that those are constant currency statements? And given the currency outlook at current spot rates, is it realistic to believe that either Q3 or Q4, IBM could grow its revenues above the 2% rate year-over-year that it did this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The statements that I made, Toni, were in fact constant currency statements. I mean, we look at the impact of currency and give some analysis on that in the supporting charts. But it's very difficult to look at how that's going to affect it, given the volatility in current periods. I mean, as an example, just look at how much currency moved in the last week and a half. I mean frankly, we were revising this supplemental chart on a daily basis because the change was so significant.</p>
          <p>So at least from my perspective, Toni, the important part from the IBM team as the &#x2013; in a operational mode is to be able to build a fundamental business model and capability to deal with that fluctuation in currency. And so if you look at it at today's spot rates, we would look forward on an EPS basis and project about the same level of currency impact in the second half that we had in the first half. And we were certainly able to deal with that in the first half, and I would expect we'd be able to deal with that in the second half.</p>
          <p>And I think you can kind of make that same statement if you look over longer periods of time. We've certainly been in periods where currency's gone against us and with us, and in each of those quarters over the last four or five years, we have grown EPS.</p>
          <p>So from my perspective, the statements we made looking at the individual businesses were on a constant currency basis. I look at our capability to deal with fluctuation in currencies in the first half, and we should be able to do the same in the second half. And on an earnings per share basis, at current spot rates we would look at that earnings per share impact in the second half being about the same magnitude as first half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mark, just to clarify, so you've done the exercise for what you think earnings will look like given a prevailing spot rate. And my question is, have you done the exercise for what revenue looks like? And trying to balance your commentary about improving fundamentals in two of your three businesses, do you think the reported revenue growth rate at the spot rates can actually improve in the second half? Or is that unrealistic?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's look at the third quarter. I mean, in the third quarter on a current basis, we look at revenue going against us by about a point. And if we get the acceleration of revenue that we're looking for from services business now with better momentum and on a better trajectory, Software repeating the kind of quarter that they had, and now the new announcement content &#x2013; I mean, I would look at that third quarter and I would say yes, we should be generating positive revenue growth, even in the face of that currency fluctuation.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. I wanted to ask you about services if I could. You indicated that the backlog &#x2013; or signings, excuse me &#x2013; was down because extensions didn't come in, renewals. Is that an anomaly or a trend? And how should investors be thinking about signings as we look out certainly this quarter, but indeed for the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let's step back. On the signings basis, as we analyzed it, we had &#x2013; in the GBS business, we had good revenue growth. We had positive signings performance. So then when you look at Global Technology Services, the issue that we wrestled with was really in our outsourcing business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the point I was making on the outsourcing business is that if you look at the complexion of those signings by analyzing the larger deals, we actually did very well on a year-to-year basis on the new business signings content. And it was not only a year-to-year basis, but it was also quarter to quarter.</p>
          <p>So if you look at deals greater than $50 million in outsourcing, the new business content was up 33% year to year. It was up 36% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That, frankly, generates better near-term characteristics than we see in extensions, obviously. And it gives us confidence as you look at 6.5 billion of signings in outsourcing this quarter, we'll frankly get much better characteristics on our revenue line from those signings than we did last year's 8 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, to your point about the trend line on this and the characteristics, as we looked at the analysis, frankly, we believe that last year we had a high level of extensions because our customer base was wrestling with the economic difficulty of the recession.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there were a lot of contract renegotiations, and in part of those contract renegotiations, we saw a number of extensions.</p>
          <p>But I think frankly, as we've worked with the operational team, we believe the bulk of that trend is in the rear-view mirror. And I do think it's quite reasonable to be encouraged by the strong growth rate that we did have in the new business content. And that's what really led us to project on a forward-looking basis that we ought to have improving revenue characteristics, even as we move into the third quarter, in GTS as well as GBS.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. Mark, can you comment on how trends are going in the public sector vertical for you? There's obviously concerns out there on the state and local level, on the federal level, and then on the European public level. And then comment on Europe as well. So what you saw there, and if any of those verticals impacted the signings as well.</p>
          <p>So revenues and signings in those &#x2013; the European market as well as the public vertical, if you have any comment on how things are going in those. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me start with public sector. I mean on public sector basis, if you look at the U.S. federal performance, we did pretty well. Revenue was up about 5%.</p>
          <p>So if you look, as you kind of mentioned in your remarks, Ben, it was really state and local was more challenging. And as you look at it, I think it's more indicative of the state and local governments wrestling with tough local budgets.</p>
          <p>When you then say well, how did we perform on a growth markets basis? Like the U.S. state and local, Australia was down, but we had a number of very strong performances in public sector in our growth markets. As an example, Ozzian was up 11%. India was up 14. China was up 16. Korea was up 10. Latin America was up a whopping 77%.</p>
          <p>So I did see public sector challenges in state and local in North America. I think U.S. federal did pretty well, up 5%. And we had a number of very strong performances in public sector in our growth markets unit.</p>
          <p>Now turning to your second question. On Europe, in general, really Europe had pretty good performance if you look at that growth rate compared to first quarter. That was, in fact, an acceleration. And they were more affected than North America by the PLM divestiture to Dassault. So, frankly, were it not for that, they would have been flat.</p>
          <p>I do think, however, it's interesting when you look at the characteristics and the overview of our business, that this is the first quarter where our growth markets unit has equaled in size the content that we have in the Eurozone. So that will obviously be an ongoing trend. We've had our growth markets' growth rate exceeding that in major markets now for I think it's 10 quarters in a row, and generally it's in that magnitude of about 8 points. And you're seeing this quarter, it's in fact 10 points.</p>
          <p>But we saw improvement in year-to-year growth rates across the board. Even in Europe, we did well. Some countries in Europe, you look at the UK, we're up 11%. Last quarter UK was up 8. And the fourth they were up 4%. So it does vary quite a bit by individual country.</p>

          <p>And maybe if you even tried to attempt to get an idea of what those markets look like, had you not had a big refresh that's coming? I mean, how do those markets feel relative to what obvious strength we're seeing on x86? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I think what you saw in the quarter is a function of the anticipation of the new announcement content that we have coming out in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And by the way, these are very strong announcement. I mean the z Series, this is a major new announcement. It's not just a new z. It's now z and a system of systems implementation. And we'll be able to tell you much more about that during the announcement later this week.</p>
          <p>On the Power side, we're now announcing the high-end Power as well as the entry Power content. If you want to look at how Power's performing, let's look at the content in the midrange, where we did have the Power announcement, the new POWER7 technology. And that midrange system grew 11%. And if you look at the blades content that POWER7 technology was on, it was up 67%. So if you snap out those elements with the new announcement, we did very well.</p>
          <p>We're still taking strong market share in this platform. You saw, I would imagine, the first quarter, took 7.5 points a share. In the second quarter, 4 points a share.</p>
          <p>Now moving into a third quarter, where by the end of the quarter we're going to have POWER7 technology across the board, coupled with the fact that we'll have the new z Series announcement, I think is a very &#x2013; we should have a very strong quarter as we move into the third.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Mark, I just wanted to clarify your comments around the mix of outsourcing renewals versus new business. Is the takeaway there that some renewal business was actually pooled into 2009 as customers sought to renegotiate contracts and get better pricing? And therefore the renewal business is a little weaker than most investors and industry sources thought for this year?</p>
          <p>And then if you could also perhaps give us your view of the pipeline for the rest of the year. And maybe some sense of what you think the growth rate will be for signings this year. And how that's different from the revenue growth rate you expect given this mix of renewals versus new business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let's look at outsourcing specifically, where I made those comments.</p>
          <p>First of all, if you look at the progression through the quarter, Richard, we had double-digit signings growth for our services right through week 10 of the quarter. And what we saw is we had a number of contracts roll into the third quarter. So as I look at the outsourcing business on a forward-looking basis in the third quarter, we should have pretty strong double-digit growth in our outsourcing business going into the third.</p>
          <p>Again, I think the impressive part on the new business was the growth rate not just year to year, but also quarter to quarter, where it was up 36%. Now generating more impressive revenue implications as we go into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>But overall, on a forward-looking basis we did have a number of contracts roll from second quarter into third quarter. We're generally on a trend line for double-digit signings growth through week 10. And now given that as we look forward to the third quarter, that outsourcing business should have a good double-digit growth rate in signings for the third.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Mark, I just want to go back to Europe. Clearly the year-on-year revenue growth trend improved. But as you look at linearity through the quarter and the pipeline going into the back half, is it fair to expect that the growth rate in Europe continues to improve in the next couple of quarters? Or should we expect that to flatten out conservatively?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I'm looking at the implications of what I see in the business as we've gone through the first half of the year. And in the first half of the year, certainly Europe was wrestling with those individual economic challenges. It's not like they just occurred at the end of the quarter. And we had overall kind of steadily improving performance in our European business.</p>
          <p>And as I said, we had some very strong performances, like the UK. I mean, Katy, you look at a country like the UK growing 11% in the quarter, that's pretty powerful. And you could pick even Greece and Spain, they were relatively flat even amongst the turmoil that they had.</p>
          <p>So from my perspective, as I look at the data, I do think we should expect that Europe should have an improving trend as we go into the third quarter. And overall for the IBM Corporation, it should see the same.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on those last two questions around linearity in the quarter, particularly as it relates to bookings trends.</p>
          <p>It sounds like outsourcing bookings slowed, and I believe previously you said you saw some deal slippage in the consulting business outside of the U.S. So maybe &#x2013; hoping to get some more color on kind of the global IT demand as you see it and whether or not customers are delaying or deferring signing large contracts to wait to see how this European situation shakes out. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would not jump to that conclusion off my comments. And the reason I say that, remember we're talking about contract extensions. Those can be driven by a number of different things.</p>
          <p>First of all, I've already said that we think it was a high level extensions last year given the economic environment. Secondly, they can be influenced just by contract dates &#x2013; when those contract dates  end. So we had a number of those extensions roll to the third quarter. But as I said, as you look at that outsourcing performance moving into the third quarter, we expect that to have double-digit growth rate. And that's pretty strong.</p>
          <p>And additionally, I would say, within the quarter, we saw that new business content with very strong growth on a year-to-year basis and a quarter-to-quarter basis. Additionally, we had a very strong close with our Software business. Software had a very, very powerful third month of the quarter.</p>
          <p>So overall revenue trends in the quarter were very measured and steady throughout the quarter. So I do not think I would take this and interpret a reflection that there's a pullback in spending. And I think my remarks are in a way indicating the reverse, in that we think that rollover of deals should accelerate performance in the outsourcing signings content in the third quarter. And we should see measured improvement once again in revenue performance for services and the IBM Corporation as we go from second to third.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, can we shift gears to gross margins? How should we think about the some of these puts and takes here in terms of some of these services extensions maybe not being renewed? I know they can be higher value. And also we have the refreshes here with Power and the mainframe. Will there be any sort of margin impact, either good, or maybe some headwinds, temporary, from a hardware perspective in 3Q versus 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, let's take those in separate parts. First of all, let's look at margin.</p>
          <p>For the IBM Corporation as a whole, when we have taken you through our business model and the &#x2013; either the roadmap to 2010 or to 2015, we're looking for productivity on PTI margin, and the model is about 0.4 to 0.5 of a point. As we look at that PTI margin improvement, it was a point. So I would look at it and say pretty good performance.</p>
          <p>If you look at the gross margin, it was up a 0.1 of a point. And remember, within that 0.1 of a point, it was absorbing some of the impact of currency in the hedge that is within the cost element.</p>
          <p>So I think margin did a pretty good job. I think our productivity actions did a good job. And frankly, if you just took a real steely-eyed view of that year-to-year improvement in our productivity versus the model, you'd have to say that it was about two times the model.</p>
          <p>Now, the other point that you had asked about is on a services base. So if you look at services, again, at the PTI margin base, overall services had an improvement about 0.4 of a point. Again, I would say that's very close to model. I mean 0.4 of a point within a quarter in the services business, that in and of itself is absorbing some of the impact of currency in the hedge. Outside of currency in the hedge, that margin would have been up about 0.8 of a point. So once again, I look at that content, I think the performance was pretty positive.</p>
          <p>And then your last question, as we go into the third quarter, the product announcements that we have in high-end P and our z Series content are high-margin, end of the product line. So they are absolutely going to drive stronger hardware margins in the third quarter. And frankly, you're going to see that on a forward-looking basis because we should have very strong double-digit PTI growth rates on our hardware business in the third quarter as we announce these newer high-margin platforms in both the Power series as well as our z Series mainframe.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. I just want to dive a little deeper into the public business. The weakness in the state and local, I think, makes sense, but from a federal level, I think that was more backward looking. If you look at the U.S. government and the OMB recently put a halt on government contracts that are kind of behind plan in the U.S., it doesn't sound like you're expecting any impact in your outlook from that, but just curious how we should look at that, and whether that's embedded into your outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think on that public sector statement &#x2013; the U.S. government statements that you're referring &#x2013; we got to see how this plays out. Let me tell you what I have heard. I think what they have said is that they're reassessing kind of the mix of their spend &#x2013; not necessarily a reduction of the spend, but a mix of their spend &#x2013; towards projects that are yielding the best productivity and yields against their business cases in their platform. And I think that sounds like a very logical thing for them to do.</p>
          <p>As we look at it and we look at our contracts, we think we have very strong contracts. We think they're performing well. So on that kind of a base, I would not project a big impact. But I got to wait and we got to see how this rolls out. But that's how I have heard it described.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Maynard. Operator, let's take one last question, please.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The last question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Mark, I know there's been a lot of questions on the bookings, and I think I understand the outsourcing phenomenon, but on the transactional side of the business, bookings have remained negative against I think which were negative comps last year on a constant currency basis, although they're improving. Yet the GBS revenue growth has turned positive. So again, it seems there's a little bit of a disconnect between what's happening on the bookings and what's happening in terms of revenue growth. Can you help us understand and reconcile what's going on now in the short-term side of the business that may be leading to that decoupling?</p>

          <p>Well, first of all, we had shorter duration on some of the contracts. Second of all, we had a very positive consulting performance in the first quarter. Third, you look at this quarter, our North America consulting business did a very good job. Signings were up 17%. And I think lastly on that point, that's why we included that supplemental chart. You could see &#x2013; just draw that trend line yourself into the third quarter. Measured performance increasing &#x2013; improving every quarter as we go into the second half and now against an easier set of compares. So I feel quite confident that we're going to have good transactional performance on that base as we move into the third quarter and the back half of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So with that, let me take a minute, and let's wrap up.</p>
          <p>Now for revenue, let's look back at our April earnings call. Now, we said we'd have modest revenue growth in services, and we did that. We said we'd have mid-single-digit growth in Systems &amp; Technology, and we did that. We said Software performance would be consistent with first quarter. We did that. In fact, we grew a point faster. And overall, we said we'd return revenue growth at constant currency for the corporation, and we did that.</p>
          <p>So for revenue, we did exactly what we said we were going to do. If you really look at that difference to analysts' expectations, the difference is all currency. Due to the strengthening of the dollar since our first quarter earnings announcement, that impact as we included in the supplements, is about $500 million. So our operations performance is really right on target.</p>
          <p>Now, we delivered 13% earnings per share growth despite a 0.10 to $0.11 currency headwind. And that's compared to a very strong second quarter 2009 base. And we have a strong hand going into the second half, an improving profile in services, ongoing momentum in Software, and great high-end hardware product announces. So with all that and with at least $11.25 of earnings per share for the year, we're now well above our 2010 roadmap objective, building on 30 straight quarters of EPS growth.</p>
          <p>So, again, thanks for joining us. And now, as always, back to work.</p>
