      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Welcome, thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings report. I'm joined by David Mathers, our CFO, who will do the bulk of the presentation today, but our Divisional COOs are also with us for the Q&amp;A session, so Rob Shafir of Asset Management, Eric Varvel of investment banking and Walter Berchtold from the private bank.</p>
          <p>Second quarter was a difficult one, given the challenging market environment arising from persistent concerns around global economic conditions, including the European debt crisis and deteriorating economic indicators, particularly in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Against that backdrop, our asset management and private banking divisions did well. But our investment banking results were not what we would have expected them to be, and therefore our overall result was not satisfactory. In addition, the continued strengthening of the Swiss Franc had a negative impact on our reported performance.</p>
          <p>Let me put these results into context by making four major points. First, our business model and strategy have performed very well and put us into a position to excel over time. Despite a weak second quarter financial performance in investment banking, we earned an underlying return on equity of 10% in the second quarter, 15% for the first half of 2011 and an average return on equity of over &#x2013; over the past 2.5 years, of around 17%. All of these are among best in class in the industry.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue to increase our client market share in every one of our businesses. For instance, in our private banking and asset management franchises, we had strong net new asset inflows of CHF14.5 billion in the second quarter. And in the investment bank, we improved our global IPO and announced M&amp;A market shares to number two in the industry.</p>
          <p>We have properly anticipated many of the regulatory developments, capital liquidity and compensation, and we've already adapted our business model to thrive in the face of changes to come. We believe this puts us ahead of the curve versus our peers who have many of these challenges still ahead of them.</p>
          <p>We've already been operating under Basel 2.5 standard since the beginning of the year and have a Basel 2.5 Core tier 1 ratio of 10.2%. We are also already operating our liquidity with an NSFR of close to 100%. While this early transition makes it somewhat more challenging for us right now, the earnings and returns that we are producing will likely be stable in the future, while our peers begin to make adjustments for the new capital framework that we've already completed.</p>
          <p>In addition, the global capital framework is evolving, as we had predicted, with a more level playing field. And finally, we have one of the cleanest and most conservatively funded balance sheets of any bank; all of this has been achieved despite fairly heavy headwinds in our business, particularly over the past year or so.</p>
          <p>The second major point is really around those headwinds, I mean clearly, our results in the quarter demonstrate the impact of those headwinds, continued industry-wide low levels of that client activity, resulting from extreme levels of uncertainty from market and political issues around the world, had a material impact.</p>
          <p>Low interest rates continue to prevail and the Swiss Franc continued to strengthen. We are going to do our best to clarify the impact of these factors for you, but they clearly had a negative impact on our performance in the second quarter. And perhaps most importantly, while we hope that these headwinds might dissipate, it's now clear that there's a significant risk that these conditions may persist for longer than we'd hoped. We need to ensure that we can continue to produce the highest returns in the industry, even if they do persist.</p>
          <p>So my third point is, towards that end, we are implementing measures to reduce our cost base by CHF1 billion on a run rate basis going into 2012, over our run rate in the first half of 2011. This cost reduction alone would have increased our return on equity by two percentage points in the first half of 2011, so even if difficult conditions persist, we believe we can continue to produce best-in-class returns. These cost reductions are being made in ways that have a limited impact on the revenue line and should allow us to grow share in our businesses. The upfront cost of these reductions have been partially included in the second quarter financials, and the remainder will be included in subsequent periods.</p>
          <p>And our fourth point is that we believe the strength of our business model and strategy, along with increased discipline on the cost side, leaves us exceptionally well-positioned to excel when these headwinds subside. More client activity, higher interest rates and the weakening of the Swiss Franc would all create substantial momentum for us and improve an already strong story.</p>
          <p>We remain convinced of the strength of our business model; the ability to earn industry-leading returns of 15% on an operating basis in the first half of this year and 10% in the second quarter, despite tremendous headwinds against us, is a testament to the strength of the model.</p>
          <p>The Swiss Franc movements alone depressed our pre-tax income by CHF637 million in the first half versus the same period in 2010. The ability to take decisive action to adjust the size of our business while at the same time continuing to grow our assets under management and win market share is also conformation of the strength of the franchise. Having adapted earlier to new regulatory regimes, we're better positioned to capitalize on an improvement in the market environment when it comes.</p>
          <p>Separately, we've announced today that Walter Berchtold will move up into a role as Chairman of the Private Banking division, and Hans-Ulrich Meister will take over as the CEO of the Private Banking division effective August 1. In the Chairman's role, Walter will continue to provide support and guidance for the division, especially in the transition, and will focus an even greater amount of his time on developing our client franchise in Private Banking and more broadly, for the bank.</p>
          <p>Walter has done an exceptional job in his period as CEO of the division. We've outgained in market share and net new assets by a factor of three to the closest competitor over the last few years. And Walter has been most closely associated with moving our private bank into what I think is the premier position among private banks.</p>
          <p>Hans-Ulrich was brought in by Walter and I three years ago, and has done an exceptional job as CEO of Switzerland, and Walter and I believe this is the right time to make this transition, and that Hans-Ulrich is definitely the right person for it.</p>
          <p>Hans-Ulrich will need to adapt the strategy of the private bank to his leadership style and vision, but he has been an integral part of the private banking management group over the past three years and he will continue to pursue our strategy of disciplined growth in the private bank, making sure we're tightly managed for the more challenging environment that we see today, but also poised to take strong advantage of the upside as the headwinds turn.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn it over to David.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good morning. I'd like to start the presentation on slide five, with an overview of the financial results.</p>
          <p>We achieved underlying revenues of CHF6.3 billion, pre-tax income of CHF1.2 billion, and net income of CHF0.8 billion. Diluted underlying earnings per share were CHF0.53. The pre-tax income margin was 19%, and the post-tax return on equity, 10%. Total net new asset inflows were CHF14.3 billion, with a continued strong contribution from Wealth management.</p>
          <p>Looking at the numbers for the half-year, excluding fair value and debt moves and restructuring costs, we achieved return on equity of 15% compared to 17% in the first half of 2010. Reported second quarter pre-tax income was CHF1.1 billion, and that includes CHF142 million of severance costs that were booked in the corporate center and relate to the expense reduction initiative that Brady mentioned before.</p>
          <p>The next few slides assess the impact on our profitability from some of the market headwinds and outline how we're actually adapting to the challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Slide six. Slide six shows how the strength of the Swiss Franc continues to adversely affect our financial performance. We estimate the Swiss Franc's strength has reduced the Group's second quarter pre-tax income by CHF348 million compared to the second quarter last year. And that means that in the first half, the strength of the Swiss Franc, because this is obviously now pre-tax income, being CHF637 million less than it would have been at the prevailing exchange rates in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Clearly compared to an average dollar, Swiss Franc exchange rate of $0.90 in the first half of '11 and $0.87 in the second quarter of '11, if the current U.S. dollar rate of $0.80 to the Swiss Franc persists the balance of the year, then we will continue to see further adverse FX impact on the Group's profitability.</p>
          <p>We thought it would be useful to give an overall guide to this FX sensitivity. And as you can see from this, we are most sensitive to moves in the dollar, where a 10% move costs us CHF375 million up and down. Against the euro, the sensitivity for that same 10% move is CHF85 million.</p>
          <p>Slide seven. As you are aware, low interest rates also continue to dampen our earnings. And this slide shows you our annual net interest income sensitivity by looking at changes in both short-term rates and long-term rates on our interest rate positions within the private bank and in treasury.</p>
          <p>You can see that a higher interest rate environment benefits net interest income. For example, 100 basis point absolute move in one month LIBOR, combined with the equivalent move in the five year swap rate, would increase annualized net interest income by around CHF540 million.</p>
          <p>I'd also point out, though, that given that current interest rates are already so low, there is only a small further impact that could come from flatter yield curves, with limited downside to net interest income from the current level.</p>
          <p>Slide eight. In light of the pressure from the Swiss Franc's strength, the volatile macroeconomic environment and the prospect of interest rates remaining low for an extended period, we are taking decisive action to improve the profitability of the business by implementing a number of cost saving measures. We have developed plans and begun to implement the delivery of CHF1 billion of cost savings compared to the current one half '11 annualized cost run rate.</p>
          <p>We would expect there to be limited net savings from this in 2011, but we do expect to recognize the full benefit of these savings from the beginning of 2012. These measures will result in a 4% overall reduction in head count in front office and support functions across the bank. And we will achieve the majority of the savings in investment banking. We expect these measures to have limited short-term revenue impact, as the majority of the cuts are in low return areas.</p>
          <p>The total cost of implementation of these plans is expected to be CHF400 million to CHF450 million during 2011, and we have already recognized CHF142 million of this in our second quarter numbers. We remained committed to our growth plans and the continued focus on investments and the reallocation of resources to targeted growth businesses. For example, the ultra high net worth client segment and emerging market businesses across the private bank, investment bank and asset management, and the flow businesses within fixed income.</p>
          <p>Slide nine. I want to be clear what we will achieve from these cost savings, and this slide is intended to put them in context. The savings will result in our 2012 cost run rate dropping by CHF1 billion from the run rate we have averaged so far in 2011. And if revenues were the same as in the first half of this year, this would have increased our post-tax ROE by approximately 2% from the 15% level that we reported already for 1H '11.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to slide 10 for a divisional overview of the results. Given the scale of FX moves this year, we thought it would be useful to separate out the quarter-on-quarter change in revenues and expenses relating to FX moves from the underlying operational performance. So if you look at the private bank, comparing the second quarter a year ago, you can see that on FX-neutral basis, pre-tax income would have been CHF174 million higher; CHF100 million improvement in revenues, and a CHF74 million reduction in costs. But this was offset by a CHF205 million reduction from the FX impact, resulting in a lower reported income, pre-tax income, by CHF31 million.</p>
          <p>And the bottom table shows you the same trends against the first quarter. Operating trends were positive, with improvement in recurring fees and commissions. But as a result of very low client activity, transactional revenues were significantly lower, mainly in respect to reduced brokerage and product issuing fees. Net new asset inflows remain strong.</p>
          <p>So let's look at the Wealth management results in some more detail on slide 11. Pre-tax income for Wealth management stood at CHF595 million, and the pre-tax income margin was stable at 26% compared to the first quarter. The gross margin declined in the quarter to 115 basis points, with net new asset inflows remaining strong, CHF11.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now we turn to the revenue trends on slide 12. Looking at each revenue component, the underlying trends are somewhat masked by the FX movements. But in summary, after a strong first quarter of transaction-based revenues, market uncertainties and the consequent impact on client confidence resulted in subdued brokerage and product issuing volumes in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>This was the main driver behind the fall in gross margin, which, if you exclude the CHF72 million gain on the sale of real estate, was 111 basis points in the second quarter. Client activity levels are being influenced by macroeconomic concerns, and this volatility in activity may endure for some time.</p>
          <p>In underlying terms, pre-FX, recurring commissions and fees increased compared to the first quarter. However, due to the strong Swiss Franc, they were lower on a reported basis.</p>
          <p>Slide 13. In our Wealth management business, we had solid net new asset inflows of CHF11.5 billion in the quarter. The annualized growth rate for the first half was 6.7%, ahead of our 6% target rate. There was a major contribution from ultra high net worth and emerging market clients, broadly distributed across our onshore and offshore booking centers.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to corporate and institutional clients on slide 14. Pre-tax income remains strong at CHF248 million in the second quarter, with a pre-tax margin of 53%. Continued low credit provisions reflect the high quality institutional loan book and the resilient fundamentals of the Swiss economy.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to investment banking now, slide 15. We are following here the same layout as we did on &#x2013; for the private bank a few slides earlier. Revenues and profits fell substantially in investment banking due to a combination of significantly lower fixed income revenues and the appreciation of the Swiss Franc against the dollar on what are predominantly dollar-based revenues.</p>
          <p>FX-neutral revenues were down 38% on a strong first quarter and 13% on the second quarter last year. Our performance in equities, underwriting and advisory was resilient, with revenues broadly sustained, in dollar terms, against both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 16. Slide 16 provides a U.S. dollar denominated P&amp;L for investment banking, to help provide a more meaningful comparison to our U.S. peers. Although our performance was still disappointing in U.S. dollar terms, with net revenues down 38% compared to the first quarter, I would note this partly reflects a strong first quarter for Credit Suisse compared to the industry. And you will see that our half yearly revenues in dollar terms were down just 1% compared to last year, with improved dollar revenues in debt and equity underwriting advisory, broadly stable equity revenues, and fixed income sales and trading revenues down 12%.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, we suffered from illiquid markets driven by weak macroeconomics, which adversely affected the performance of our mortgage, credit, and rates businesses.</p>
          <p>So if you look at fixed income on slide 17, our results were affected by the following factors: first, client risk appetite declined sharply in the quarter as a result of the weak macro environment. Second, we continue to be conservative in our overall approach to risk within the fixed income business, maintaining a low VAR stance, largely due to our concerns over direct and indirect <mark type="ph" /> tower (17:48) risk as a consequence of the broader market and macroeconomic issues.</p>
          <p>And as a result, when executing client demand, we often found that executing from client positions, in certain illiquid markets, resulted in losses in our market making books in the mortgage, credit and rates businesses. Notwithstanding this, I would point out that all of our fixed income businesses did report positive revenues in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 18, we had a resilient result from our equities business, notwithstanding muted client volumes. Although this &#x2013; although these lower client volumes did result in a reduced contribution from cash equities, our prime service business delivered a record result, with higher revenues in dollar terms as client balances increased and market share improved.</p>
          <p>And I'd also note the resilience of our equity derivatives business in the second quarter, consolidating what was a strong first quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 19. We delivered solid underwriting and advisory results. Equity underwriting revenues increased, reflecting market share momentum. We were ranked number two for global IPOs in the second quarter. Increased advisory revenues reflected both industry volumes and our improved number two market position in M&amp;A. And I note that the pipeline of new activity remains healthy.</p>
          <p>Slide 20. Pre-tax income and asset management was strong at CHF202 million, increasing both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. On an FX-neutral basis, the quarter-on-quarter pre-tax income improvement was 22%, with fee-based revenues increasing by 10%. Solid semi-annual performance fees and carried interest on realizations. Placement fees grew as a result of continued progress in our fundraising activities, and investment gains were strong.</p>
          <p>Slide 21. We saw solid net new asset inflows of CHF4 billion in the second quarter, representing the eighth consecutive quarter of positive inflows into our asset management division. These were well distributed across product types, led by good contributions from our asset allocation business MACS, real estate, and commodities.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to capital and liquidity on slide 23, please. We continue to maintain a strong capital position, with our Basel 2 Tier 1 ratio maintained at 18.2%. Our Core tier 1 ratio, which excludes hybrid capital, increased slightly to 13.1%. We've revised our projection for Basel 3 risk-weighted assets in 2013 to around CHF300 billion, compared to the original estimate that we gave last autumn of CHF340 billion. But I'd point out that's primarily driven by the strength in the Swiss Franc over the past nine months.</p>
          <p>We have made tangible progress in mitigating the impact of Basel 3 over that period, with CHF15 billion in risk-weighted asset reductions already achieved, primarily in our exit portfolio. I'd also note that our deferred tax asset has been further reduced in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>The extrapolated B3 CET1 ratio at the end of 2010, assuming consensus earnings, now stands at 12.7%. However, if you fully deduct, at the beginning of 2013, all of the phase-in features between 2013 and 2019, then the ratio would be at 8.8% at the beginning of 2013.</p>
          <p>Our funding and liquidity positions remain strong, and we're well prepared for the Basel 3 liquidity and funding requirements. Our estimate of the Basel 3 NSFR ratio, net stable funding ratio, is around 95% at the end of the first half, with the LCR also well in excess of the requirement.</p>
          <p>Just in terms of our funding plan, we completed close to 70% of our 2011 long-term funding. And we continue to maintain a clean balance sheet, with only CHF400 million of net exposure to the Italian &#x2013; to Italian sovereign risks, and immaterial exposure to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.</p>
          <p>So let's just go through this a little more detail and start on slide 24. As you can see, the Basel 2 Tier 1 ratio was 18.2%. The Core tier 1 ratio increased slightly to 13.1%, and the B 2.5 Core tier 1 ratio, 10.2%. And I'd note that the regulatory capital base in all these calculations reflects a pro-rata dividend accrual of CHF1.30 per share, in line with what we paid in &#x2013; respect to 2010.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, we show the detailed calculations updating the progression risk-weighted assets under the proposed Basel 3 rule changes. If you start with the CHF204 billion risk-weighted assets under Basel 2 in 2011 on the left of the chart, we had CHF151 billion for the expected B 2.5 and B 3 changes.</p>
          <p>The estimated mitigation benefit achievable by the end of 2012 was in the range of CHF45 billion to CHF65 billion, and this will result in B 3 post-mitigation RWA of around CHF290 billion to CHF310 billion. And the right-hand chart shows the roll-forward from our original pre-mitigation guidance. But as you can see, the major benefit is from the movement in currency rates, which reduced RWAs in Swiss Franc terms by CHF40 billion.</p>
          <p>Just one point; in terms of RWA growth, our business plan assumes that, during the next 18 months, business growth will be achieved through the reallocation of capital between existing business lines.</p>
          <p>Slide 26. Deferred tax asset utilization is very much on schedule. We have deferred tax assets down CHF1.6 billion, or 18% so far this year, of which approximately half is due to FX moves.</p>
          <p>In terms of the key element of this for Basel 3, deferred tax asset on net operating losses, the reduction is CHF1 billion so far this year. And we continue to expect have minimal balances by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>Slide 27 is an illustrative model of how the CET1 ratio could develop, based on our capital projection from now until the end of 2013, under the Basel 3 rules and using the revised post-mitigation guidance for RWAs of approximately CHF300 billion.</p>
          <p>The left column shows our current shareholders' equity. We have adjusted for regulatory deductions and the next 18 months of current market expectations for retained earnings, which I would remind you, do not represent forward looking statements being made by Credit Suisse management.</p>
          <p>Just one point to note in this analysis; you can see that over the next 18 months, we are <mark type="ph" /> still benefited (25:30) of CHF2 billion. This reflects our policy to issue &#x2013; I apologize. Shares, this reflects our policy to issue shares from conditional capital for share-based compensation awards. Once we reach the Basel 3 entry point, we may revisit this approach, which is why we've not assumed any benefit in 2013.</p>
          <p>In terms of dilution from share awards, we expect to issue around 50 million shares between now and the end of 2012. So by the beginning of 2013, our CET1 capital gross of CHF38.2 billion to give a Basel 3 CET1 ratio of 12.7%. Market estimates for earnings in 2013 then imply a pro-forma CET1 ratio of 14.3% by the end of 2013.</p>
          <p>Slide 28. The market has been focusing on the look-through CET1 ratio simulation when Basel 3 is implemented at the beginning of 2013. On slide 28, we assume a CET1 ratio which allows for the full deduction of phase-in allowances at the beginning of 2013, rather than allowing for the phasing in of these deductions as required under the Basel 3 and the Swiss rules.</p>
          <p>On this much more conservative basis, our CET1 ratio would be 8.8% at the beginning of 2013. If we continue to assume CHF300 billion of risk-weighted assets, then looking out a further year would result in this ratio being 11%, well in excess of the 10% minimum that, I would remind you, is only required under the Swiss legislation currently being discussed in parliament, by 2019.</p>
          <p>And in addition, although we've not shown it here, the cumulative CHF7.1 billion of high trigger contingent capital that will be an issue by the end of 2013, represents a further buffer of 2.4% of risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>And I think, just to be clear, this look-through calculation does not represent the regulatory transition requirements by the BIS or the FINMA. It is the transitional CET1 ratio and not the look-through ratio that's the relevant trigger mechanism for the buffer capital note.</p>
          <p>Slide 29. Finally, with the continued focus on certain Eurozone countries, we show here that we have limited exposure to both sovereign and non-sovereign counterparties in these areas. On this note, I'd like to conclude my presentation and hand back to Brady.</p>

          <p>Philipp Zieschang from UBS. Three questions, please. The first one is, could you provide a bit of an outlook in terms of the gross margin development in Wealth management, which ranges you expect over the next couple of quarters?</p>
          <p>The second one would be on your risk-weighted asset guidance, where you basically say you expect, in your business plan, flat risk-weighted assets until the end of 2012. And if we leave aside the current quarter, or second quarter performance in fixed income, but could you nevertheless share your thoughts in terms of the revenue growth outlook for your fixed income business, given that risk-weighted assets are flat after mitigation? And I believe your residential mortgage-backed trading business is part of your mitigation plan.</p>
          <p>And a third one; thanks for the helpful currency impact disclosure. But if we just take the CHF205 million for the second quarter which you add to private banking, if we assume this is basically Wealth management clients, and add it to your reported profits, it means a 26% profit increase like-for-like over the second quarter 2010, where rates were low, markets have been even tough in terms of transactions. So, could you just describe a bit where this underlying improvement would have come from, because it looks like a very strong performance underlying, with 26% up? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think on the first question, maybe I'll quickly answer the first one and we can have maybe Walter address the third question, in terms of, as you say, the positive impacts that we've seen on the business to get us to that answer. And then I'll try to &#x2013; I'll answer a little bit of the second question, but maybe Eric Varvel could add to that as well.</p>
          <p>I think, in terms of the development on the gross margin, as you say, obviously the impact of lower interest rates, the lower transactional volume, et cetera are &#x2013; is clear in that. I think our view is that, if these conditions continue to prevail, then we think probably gross margins around these kinds of levels will also continue to prevail.</p>
          <p>Obviously we do try to &#x2013; we are continuing to try to effort &#x2013; driving higher gross margins through active measures that we take, in terms of more cross-selling, et cetera, higher margin product. But I think that if these kinds of headwinds continue, I think these are probably &#x2013; these are the probably the kind of levels that we would continue to see.</p>
          <p>With regard to the RWA, it's actually &#x2013; it is a good question. Obviously, and again as you say, apart from the second quarter performance and looking at it on more of a longer term basis, we continue to think the fixed income business is actually a &#x2013; has been a relatively strong performer. I think, as David mentioned, the kind of first quarter to second quarter compare obviously makes it, it's &#x2013; we are obviously disappointed with that compare on a quarter-to-quarter basis. On the other hand, if you look at first half of this year versus first half of last year, it's down I think about 6% in revenue terms, so it's actually held up reasonably well. And from a return point of view as well, for the first half of this year, our fixed income businesses had a pre-tax return of 17%.</p>
          <p>And so that's &#x2013; obviously we'd like to see that better, we hope we'll see better market conditions and we hope we can do a better job within managing the business but overall, that's actually &#x2013; that's actually, I think, given what we've seen in market conditions in the first half, pretty reasonable return.</p>
          <p>The question of how we get, as you say, to a flat RWA over that period and what the revenue outlook is? I think our general view is that in fact we can reallocate, we can adjust our business model, reallocate RWA within that, and continue to make good returns in that business. And we've talked about some of our investments for &#x2013; we have &#x2013; obviously, the main engines at this point are our credit business, particularly leverages finance and our structured products business, those have been the main engines. By the way, they &#x2013; those were some of the businesses most affected in the second quarter, but those will continue to be, we believe, good businesses where we have very strong market shares and show good returns.</p>
          <p>Our emerging markets business, as well, is a very strong business and that's one that performed well in the second quarter. Clearly, as you know, we are continuing to built out on our rates in our commodities businesses and we think that those will be businesses which are generally a little bit more risk-weighted asset efficient and actually can therefore produce, probably, more returns based on probably a lower level of RWA, but &#x2013; Eric, I don't know if you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think what I would add to that is, if you look at our stronger businesses and you look at the first half returns at a 17% return on pre-tax income over equity, it's an attractive business. We think the first quarter doesn't necessarily represent the type of business and the type of returns that we can put out to investors and to our shareholders. If you look at the two quarters &#x2013; let me see if I can give you a deeper analysis of it and what actually happened.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we generated CHF2.7 billion in top line revenues in FICC. In the second quarter, we generated CHF900 million of top line revenues, excluding OIS charges. Of that, client revenues were CHF2.2 billion in the first quarter and they were CHF1.6 billion in the second quarter, so the client revenues were actually quite strong across the two quarters, in fact, we actually took share.</p>
          <p>When you look at the inventory, the inventory securities held for client trading in the trading, in the first quarter we gained $600 million. In the second quarter, we lost $900 million. We didn't do a terrific job with our inventory management on the securities in the second quarter, and we got caught in very difficult markets in illiquid situations, and we wanted to bring the risk down. So that caused the losses.</p>
          <p>But the trading activity and the fundamental build in the sales effort in rates, FX, commodities, credit, has gone very well, and we're seeing real evidence of that. What's &#x2013; we're also seeing is empirical evidence of that from third party agencies like Greenwich Research, that is coming back and saying, your penetration rates with key accounts is much better than it's ever been, but your cross-sale is much better than it's ever been. So the outlook for fixed income, if you look at the first half of the year and the 17% pre-tax return on equity, is quite good. The power of structured products, the credit business, the emerging market biz, we think will continue and we think there's real upside for us in some of these sales flows, as we can monetize better, through the trading effort, that P&amp;L, so we're actually pretty optimistic.</p>
          <p>In terms of mitigation, we have moved into Basel 2 and prepared through the Basel 2.5. So we are one those banks that has been a leader in mitigating capital and repositioning our business, and we feel like we can continue to do that into a B3 world, so we do have some experience with that, and have done that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So the underlying strength, roughly about CHF200 million year-over-year, is about &#x2013; a third is coming from net new assets, obviously, which we generated over the years now, they come to fruition. Then about a third is repricing of services across various aspects of our business, and obviously another third is real estate.</p>

          <p>Two brief questions for you, if I may. You've given some detail on sensitivity on FX and on interest rates; that's helpful, thanks very much.

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The second one... hello? Yeah. the second one would be, post the restructuring exercise, where do you think your cost-income ratio in the IB is going to end up? If I had a look at it correctly when I was standing in &#x2013; 91% and over the longer term ,where would you like it to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Thank you. Actually on the first point, it's interesting. We debated. I was actually in favor of including some estimates of, as you say, looking at previous periods with higher client activity and what the impact of that would be. I don't know that we have a particularly specific answer for that because, as you say, if you &#x2013; it depends on what environment you want to assume, if you go back to more active periods or even if you looked at the first quarter and all the client activity and kind of put it onto the business model, I think we still believe that, overall, you could take in the private bank, obviously if you take the transaction margin that's obviously been quite depressed, particularly in the second quarter, if you looked at that on a more normalized basis, our hope would be that eventually we could get back to some of the more historically high levels there, how quickly that will happen or whether we'll get completely back to that level, it's a question. I don't know, Walter, if you want to address that quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at it normalized, before the crisis, it was probably 250 higher, after the crisis 150, so that's sort of like some guiding points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I think also, if you look on the investment banking side as well, obviously additional flow, additional activity could be helpful there. Although we do see &#x2013; we still have strong backlogs and obviously, even in the second quarter, if you look at our advisory business and our equity business, and the primary business in general, there was a fair amount of flow, obviously in the current market conditions, that's slowed down in terms of execution, but if markets get back to normal ,you could see some significant improvement there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the cost-income point, I think I will answer that at the group level; you can see that the cost-income ratio was 82.6% in the second quarter, 79.3% in the first quarter. And I think the point about the cost reduction program is that we're talking about CHF1 billion net cost reductions. So one can simply take it off. And the answer is, one would expect the cost-income ratio to drop by about 4%, everything else being equal, from CHF250 million of those cost savings on a like-on-like basis.</p>
          <p>We've not given, as yet, the breakdown cost ratio &#x2013; the cost benefits across the three divisions, I would say the majority of the benefits are expect to be the investment bank, but I don't think I'd want to be as precise as yet as saying what that would mean for the cost-income ratio, but everything else being equal, it is not &#x2013; is a net cost reduction program, so you would reduce the group one by 4%, as from these numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And over the longer term, for the IB cost-income ratio, where do you think it should be?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we've &#x2013; I think that's &#x2013; we've laid out actually as one of our KPIs, I think. Where what was it set at? I think it's -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Teresa Nielsen from Bank Vontobel. I've seen that the bottom line of your P&amp;L, you have some items like minority interest, that's the net income attributable to non-controlling interest which is increased here in the second quarter to around CHF600 million. Can you give &#x2013; is there any level going forward you can give for this item?</p>
          <p>There is another line which is available for unpaid share-based payment award, which has also increased. It's an item totally at the bottom of the P&amp;L, and I believe it could be very important, as it is at the bottom of the P&amp;L?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, do you have any potential buffer of tax benefits which you could put into the year-end 2011, which could reduce the overall tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the first point; two points is, under U.S. GAAP, we actually have to consolidate certain private equity interest, and you see that in the non-controlling interest number which is separate from the core results.</p>
          <p>So I think what you're referring to under the core results, there was CHF47 million of net income attributable to non-controlling assets. The other all essentially represents the private equity interests which are held within the asset management business and therefore are not relevant to the operating performance; they're actually consolidated and then de-consolidated under the U.S. financial standards.</p>
          <p>The CHF47 million then relates to the small number of joint ventures where we have minority interest, it's not that material for the bank overall. And I'm not sure we'd expect to see it change too much going forward. So that's a little point I'd make about the first.</p>
          <p>The second point, what was this, I &#x2013; could you repeat the second point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I, well, I think the &#x2013; I think, generally speaking, we are -continue to be in our &#x2013; focused on the pay down of our differed taxes, particularly our differed taxes on NOLs, and you can see that's come down by CHF1 billion so far this year. The effective tax rate for the group was about 25% in the second quarter, but nonetheless, I think we would still stick to our guidance of something in the mid to upper 20s for the full year, particularly as we have the U.K. bank levy, which comes in the second half, which is not allowable against tax.</p>
          <p>And so I'd expect that tax rate guidance, I think, still very much to be the case. And clearly, we're probably getting more focused on reducing the differed tax position in our balance sheet than anything else at that point, if that's helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two quick questions, please, on Basel 3. The first one is on slide 25, about the mitigation of risk-weighted assets. I think one of the concerns investors had is, what would the revenue cost of that mitigation be? So having done perhaps a quarter of your plan mitigation, that CHF15 billion reduction, what was your revenue experience as you sold those assets? And does it inform you as to what the revenue loss potential could be as you continue with your mitigation plan for the additional CHF45 billion to CHF65 billion? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is just on the capital roll-forward on slide 27, just to understand that over the next 18 months, you're basically planning on issuing CHF2 billion worth of shares. That just is a one-off for the next 18 months, it's not something that you would plan to do beyond 2012, in order to sustain the dividend? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I thought you had three. Okay. Do you want to answer second one first, or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So the &#x2013; what we show on slide 27, which we actually did in the first quarter, is that we have met, in part but not in whole, the obligations under our deferred compensation through the issue of conditional capital rather than bought in shares.</p>
          <p>As you know and you've seen from the fact that our share count has actually, I think, not increased much over the last preceding five years, our policy up until that point was to fully offset by buying in treasury shares. I think, in view of the Basel 3 glide path, we thought it was more conservative to, in part, but not in whole, meet those obligations through the issue of fresh share capital.</p>
          <p>In a pretty technical point, it's not really CHF2 billion of fresh new capital, because that's essentially the add-back of the deduction under capital of the obligation we're creating now. The impact on capital is the amount of stock we have to buy back in respect to prior-year plans. So that's why we thought we'd helpful to give some guidance over the 50 million of new shares. The impact of the &#x2013; what we are actually deferring now will be only evident in future years, but I think your point, though, actually stands; we are looking at doing this in, as I said, over the next 18 months, once we actually get into 2013, through the Basel 3 transition, that's clearly a decision we'd revisit.</p>
          <p>I think our policy before was to buy back, I wouldn't want to bind us on that, but I think that's why, if you look at the chart on slide 27, you see we have not factored that in after 2013. I would say clearly, this is an estimate not a forecast, and &#x2013; but it does, it does have an impact in the calculations, so we thought we'd be clear and show it this way for you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Basel 3 mitigation, we have &#x2013; we still have significant wind-down portfolio that will release capital that will help us mitigate on the way through. We are also going to look at our rates business. We are also going to look at our credit business, so it will be mitigation across several different products, mainly those structured products rates and wind-down. We think that the revenue impact will be marginal, because we think we are going to be able to grow shares in other businesses to effectively take the place of some of the lost revenue through the mitigation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And a lot of mitigation to-date has been in the legacy area, where we really weren't making revenues before, and so there is no real revenue impact to that.</p>
          <p>So I guess the answer is on that, we assumed we would be able to mitigate there, it wouldn't be a cost, either to revenue or cost in terms of getting out of those businesses, and that's what's happened. I am not sure that informs us that well on the other areas, or we don't &#x2013; we can't tell you that that's instructive of the other areas, but we continue to be optimistic that we will be able to mitigate with relatively little revenue impact.</p>

          <p>John, one which may help, I don't know if you noticed in slide 42, in the appendices, we actually included an update of the business by business mitigation numbers, so you can see that &#x2013; if you compare that to the one we gave in the autumn, you will see that the exit business reduction is CHF6 billion to CHF10 billion compared to CHF20 billion, CHF25 billion at that point, which reflects the progress we made already.</p>
          <p>You can see the securitized products reductions are slightly higher, but that also partly reflects moves in those positions over the last nine months. The emerging market number hasn't changed very much, and you'll see that the derivative numbers, we actually said CHF5 billion to CHF10 billion in each of those two areas before. It's like CHF7 billion to CHF12 billion now. So, if that's helpful in terms of giving some context to this.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I had two questions, if I might. The first is, coming back to the gross margin, and if you strip out the exceptional gain, you're at 111 basis points as you highlighted.</p>
          <p>You guys have restated this division a number of times, so I guess I'm lacking a historical context for that number, and I was hoping you could give me some historical context; is that the worst quarter in the last decade, or have you had worse quarters in that, so some historical context would be helpful?</p>
          <p>And then also obviously, you guys report in U.S. GAAP and a number of your peers report in IFRS. Years ago, someone made an offhand comment about a 15 basis point difference, but I was just wondering if you could give us sort of rule of thumb for going from a U.S. GAAP to an IFRS, if you sort of net the revenue cost impact, what that would be, so we can have a context of how that would compare to peers. That was the first question.</p>
          <p>And second question is probably more of a big picture question, but I think many listeners, callers, are struggling to understand the impacts of a rating agency downgrade on the U.S. and what that could &#x2013; impact that could have on funding markets and risk assets. And it's a question, as banks analysts, we're getting asked a lot. And frankly, speaking for myself, I am not sure I have much insight. So I was wondering if you could share your views there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe I can try to answer the third question as best I can, and then we will come back and Walter can address the issues on gross margin. I assume that &#x2013; so the second part of your question on GAAP versus IFRS is specifically with regard to impact on gross margin, I assume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, I think with regard to the third question, obviously it's &#x2013; it is very much uncharted waters, as you say, so I'm sure &#x2013; I'm not sure we have a lot better point of view on it, or informed point of view, than you all do.</p>
          <p>I think our general view is that the technical issues around the downgrades or other issues around sort of the debt ceiling issue, is that there &#x2013; they seem to be relatively limited. So for instance, they aren't a lot of contractual triggers and contracts, let's say, if Treasuries get downgraded from AAA to AA something happens. There has to be more collateral or it impacts different relationships there.</p>
          <p>So there seem to be relatively limited impacts from a technical point of view, which obviously, if that's the case, that would be something that would be helpful and make it more manageable.</p>
          <p>I think the bigger issues are really around what are the market impacts of something like that? What would be the impact on client activity and on volatility in the markets? And that's probably where we've been more focused, because we think that's probably the area where we're likely to see more of an impact. And our basic response to it is to stay pretty close to home in terms of risk. And that's probably the best way to manage it, since it is a fairly &#x2013; I think it's a fairly, obviously, uncertain event that that actually happens.</p>
          <p>But I do think that one of the more positive aspects is we don't feel like there are a lot of technical triggers that get hit if that happens, so that's obviously helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously when you look at the fees, I think since we restated 2006, certainly the worst quarter at least I have seen. When it comes to IFRS, it's roughly about 7 basis points, would be 7 basis points lower due to the commission expense, which is I think under IFRS differently accounted for.</p>
          <p>But I think, again, as I said once before, it is just important to note that this is a pure commission business you see here in Credit Suisse. So all like trading closing we'd normally see in other wealth managers is not included, which obviously &#x2013; sometimes it's a little bit offsetting when it comes to margin compression on the commission side.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Huw van Steenis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. Two questions; first, in the appendix on page 44, you got your bubble chart. I was wondering if you just talk to it a little bit, in particular with securitized products going back to what you described here as a more normal environment. Would we suggest that actually something around only CHF1 billion a quarter in fixed income is actually what you think is more realistic in a normalized environment, unless you can get FX and rates to deliver more?</p>
          <p>And then number two, I think the pages you delivered on capital are incredibly helpful. I would &#x2013; may be useful to add an extra page, also highlighting to people how the conversion of the CoCos would work, because I think we continue to see huge numbers of questions.</p>
          <p>And so my question on that would be, if you continue to only deliver the CHF0.50 a quarter for the next two quarters, would that change your mind on the dividend accrual, which obviously at the moment, I think you're still accruing flat? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I guess, with regard to the question on the bubble chart and the prospect for the business overall, I think, the &#x2013; obviously our hope and our expectation is that both the securitized products business and the credit business will actually have better performance in future quarters than they did.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned, our emerging markets business actually performed quite well in the second quarter, so we obviously hope and expect that that will probably continue. And then, as you say, we have, obviously, aspirations to continue to develop our rates and our commodities products. And I think as Eric mentioned, we feel like those are on a good track.</p>
          <p>I guess in general, as Eric laid out, we sort of have &#x2013; call it a CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion run rate on the client flow side of that, of the fixed income business. If you look at the first quarter and the second quarter. Obviously somewhat impacted in the second quarter, but fairly consistent along those lines. I think obviously, our hope would be that we could actually grow that through some of these initiatives and maybe through some what better market conditions, but if you look at sort of CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion, and hopefully that grows to CHF2 billion to CHF2.5 billion or something over time, we'll see. That would sort of be our aspiration on that side.</p>
          <p>And then clearly, the question of, if you have CHF600 million of gains in the first quarter, CHF900 million of losses in the second quarter on sort of the inventory activity, obviously our hope would be that the first quarter was probably a pretty favorable environment, the second quarter was a pretty unfavorable environment; our hope would be that we'd probably have more moderate positive numbers on that over time in the business, and particularly as it developed and diversified.</p>
          <p>So I guess &#x2013; I'm not sure if I am exactly answering your question, but that's, I think, where we would hope to see the businesses. Sort of CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion of revenues going, increasing to some number higher than that in future quarters. And then obviously the sort of inventory profits or the trading profit side of it becoming a sort of more consistent but moderate positive number over time.</p>
          <p>So within that obviously, you have to make judgments about how quickly we'll be able to get there and how effective it will be, et cetera. But that's, I think a &#x2013; I think that's a broad &#x2013; I'd tell you that that's a broad framework for the way we think about the business.</p>
          <p>And again that would be, I think that, as we achieve that, that would be a business that would make good returns on capital, solid returns on capital and would contribute. Would clearly be accretive and be solid returns on capital in the context of the business.</p>
          <p>I think &#x2013; by the way, thank you for your point on the CoCo conversion issue, we're actually surprised that there is this much confusion around that as there is, because we thought it was fairly straightforward. But I think we do have to continue to, I think, do a better job maybe of explaining exact how it works, because it's actually fairly simple. I don't know if you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I should just summarize. The buffer capital note is triggered until the beginning of the Basel 3 period, on the Core tier 1 ratio as stated.</p>
          <p>So the Core tier 1 ratio for this year, up until the fourth quarter when BIS reporting goes to B2.5, was 13.1% against the trigger level of 7%. Next year, assuming the B2.5 conversion for BIS, well then the relevant ratio then becomes the Core tier 1 ratio under B 2.5, which was 10.2%, which was broadly the same as in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Once you get to the Basel 3 era, assuming that is implemented on schedule at the beginning of 2013, it then becomes a CET 1 ratio as defined by the Basel rules and by the FINMA, which I think we've given a sort of pro-forma number, but 12.7% is the simulated ratio, assuming consensus earnings then rising to 14.3%, which is the numbers actually on slide 27. And the 7% would then compare to those things, and that would be what would actually trigger any conversion with the buffer capital notes.</p>
          <p>So the stock price isn't actually relevant. It's triggered by those ratios. And I think it's probably unsurprising; I did look at the pricing of the buffer capital recently and it's still trading above par, which is exactly what you'd expect, given those kind of capital ratios at the present time. So hopefully that's helpful on the BCN.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the &#x2013; Huw, on the dividend question that you asked me, and obviously, as we've said, we've continued to accrue at that CHF1.30 level &#x2013; per rate on that CHF1.30 level in the second quarter. I think that continues to be our intention but obviously, as we see how the business develops, how the market develops, we'll have to continue to reassess that. But that's, as you know, that's a level that we've continued to accrue at.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. The first part of the question is for Eric. I'm just trying to understand a little bit more the FICC line. And the CHF1.6 billion was very helpful, the CHF900 million was very helpful.</p>
          <p>Just to understand, looking at <mark type="ph" /> your word (59:42) it seems to me that you're taking the CHF900 million as an unrealized loss rather than &#x2013; sorry, a realized rather than unrealized loss. Is that a fair assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kian, thanks for the question. Yeah, I don't know, it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be realized loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Realized loss, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, realized. And if I could better understand the thinking around the FICC expansion, in particular in respect to the sales expansion, where are we geographically &#x2013; where do you have to go? Can you give us some indications? And really bottom up, what needs to happen for you to gain more market share in rates and FX? And before maybe you answer that, could you also tell me a little bit about the loss. Is it fair to say that you were long cash assets, short CDS and those &#x2013; you had basis risk in the CHF900 million loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's correct. The losses were on &#x2013; is my mic on? Yeah, now it's on. Yeah the losses were on the cash positions as well as the basis risk against the hedges. So it was a combination of the two. And if you look at the CHF900 million, the bigger portion of that was in securitized products. Speaking to your question &#x2013; yeah, sorry.</p>
          <p>Speaking to the question on sales, we've really spent the last couple of years increasing our sales staff across the key areas, mainly rates, FX and credit, a little bit in securitized products, but mainly rates, FX and a little credit.</p>
          <p>We've increased that by about 20% over the last couple of years, geographically more in Europe, probably next U.S., a little bit less in Asia. The returns on that have been coming in fairly strong. Sales credit's client revenues is up 10% year-over-year, which is fairly significant. Like I also said, I think formerly, we are also getting very good feedback from third party agencies on the content that we're bringing to key accounts. What you're also seeing is, across fixed income, we've moved over the last couple years, from an eight position to a number six position overall in sales. So we feel pretty good about the progress we've made in sales overall.</p>
          <p>In terms of future investments, I think it's a little less now about head count increase, it's going to be more about consistent IT spend and building a platform to drive more sales activity. If there is any increase in head count, it'll be to our &#x2013; some of our higher growth markets in the emerging markets, to build sales there in the EM. Does that give you enough insight?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's quite helpful. And then IT spend, can you explain a little bit where you need to invest a little bit more, because I understand the FX platform has been done already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There will be some continuing spend in FX in rates, considerable spend in the emerging markets, sales and trading platforms, more country-specific; those are sort of the main &#x2013; the main areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I don't know, I actually don't know that it's fair to say that the FX platform has been done. Though, I think actually, we have more work to do there and one other things that we are continuing to do is to adapt our AES model, which we have in equities, our automated execution services model, which is &#x2013; we think really one &#x2013; certainly one of the best in market, continue to adapt that into our fixed income businesses, and so that's obviously also part of that technology spend and really trying to get more, obviously, more involved in the electronic flow on the fixed income side as well. So I think there is more investment to do in FX and other areas as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And last question, then, is related to coming back to the 50 million shares, should you decide, or the board decides to reduce the dividend, is there likelihood that the 50 million shares would not come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that there may be some confusion about two things. I think in the projection, which we show on slide 27 and there afterwards, we show our consensus earnings and the consensus dividend expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So therefore it includes the deduction, I guess, of the CHF1.30 shares, as I believe that is the consensus. So if the dividend were to be reduced, then clearly then the capital numbers would change by whatever that one feels the dividend would be at that point. The share-based compensation is a different issue entirely, it actually relates to the &#x2013; essentially the deduction that we make every year for share-based...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, I understand that. But if you're saying you're going to do this in order to get your capital level up, you could buy back the shares, right? So, if the dividend goes down, if the board decides to cut the dividends, will you dilute by 50 million or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Kian, the best way &#x2013; it's a good question, but I think all we're trying to do is to effectively to let people know that that is sort of part of how we're approaching it, but we are going to obviously take a flexible approach to that. So as you say obviously, I guess if dividends were reduced and therefore improved the capital situation, then maybe we would issue less shares under the conditional capital issuance. So it's &#x2013; well, it's obviously going to be a dynamic approach, but we thought that that was a fairly illustrative way to just look at how the capital might develop and what actions we might take with regard to existing share awards and the delivery of shares against that, so &#x2013; but you're right; obviously that could be adjusted if other parts of the equation changed, then that could be adjusted.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had three questions. The first question I had was on the asset management division, bit of a question of detail. If I take out the equity participation revenues, which have been going up, I guess, because of York capital and the private equity gains, and try and get a feel for what your $250 billion traditional asset management business is generating, I struggle to get it generating anything at all. So I was wondering if that was broadly correct, and if you have any plans to improve the contribution of the traditional business?</p>
          <p>The second question I had; again a bit technical. On your hedging of your tier 1 capital ratios, which I think you hedge for currency risk on the ratios at the tier 1 level. As you transition to Basel 3, where it would really be more about common equity, will you transition to hedging your common equity to risk-weighted asset ratio?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is, sorry to come back to this fixed income issue, but if my trader told me that he'd done $1.6 billion of client revenues but lost $900 million on inventory, but he'd won client market share, I'd have a fairly cynical view on that. So I'm struggling to get a feel for whether the $600 million to $900 million inventory swings are normal, or are you now putting more inventory at work to your client benefit &#x2013; to your client's benefit than previously? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with the asset management. I'll just start with it, then hand it over to Rob. But I mean, one of the very important strategic elements on the asset management side, and one of the things I think we've been very successful with, is continuing to convert that to a model which is based on management fee carry, non-capital based uses of our &#x2013; non-capital based sources of revenues within that. I think we've actually made some very nice progress in that and obviously, though, that continues to be the case. So in general, that's clearly one of our clear strategies there and I think, both strategically and operationally day-to-day, we've actually done a really good job of making progress along that. But Rob, do you want to address?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of how we look at the business, we really don't define it in terms of traditional, I guess, versus non-traditional. We really define it in sort of three major areas; obviously our Swiss platform, our alternatives business and our emerging market business. So that's sort of how we define &#x2013; how we look at the business.</p>
          <p>In terms of equity participations, you mentioned something like your capital, we've recognized very little thus far year-to-date, because most of the fees that are associated with York are recognized at the end of the year, on a one-time basis. So that's not been a material part of our results. If you look at our investment related gains that are balance-sheet related, strip them out, as well as financing cost, still roughly, you got about $100 million of underlying profitability in the second quarter. So we feel pretty good about what's happening in terms of the different pieces of the business coming together from the fee-based side, our placement fee business, the performance fees in the business, as well as our management fees, which are contributing to a much healthier sort of underlying economic performance of the business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the hedging point, I think you're absolutely correct. We normally look to match our risk-weighted assets, or the currency of risk-weighted assets, approximately to our equity base. And at the present moment, the matrix we actually use for that is the B2.5 definition of RWA, not the B2 definition of RWA.</p>
          <p>To give you an idea, on that basis, approximately 70% of our risk-weighted assets are actually in U.S. dollars. However, in terms of our current hedging position for that shareholders' equity, it's typically between 50% and 55%, so therefore we're underweight in shareholders' equity compared to the dollar. And I think you can probably deduce that from the comparative moves in the balance sheet, because it's not as great as it would have been the case if it was fully matched.</p>
          <p>And I think that that hedging view reflects more dynamic view of the position, because if one simply looks at a static view to maintain a constant ratio, then you'd match 100%. In reality, as we've seen today, we clearly have significant P&amp;L sensitivity to dollar-Swiss Franc as well. So it's really a balance between that forward-looking view in terms of our profitability and the static position, in terms of our percentage of RWAs against equity.</p>
          <p>That said, I think you probably could deduce &#x2013; we probably were slightly short the dollar in the quarter, compared to a strictly neutral position.</p>

          <p>I think, Matt, with regard to your third question, I think we were trying to just give you a feel for how the different parts of the business work right? So the fact that, even in a less active quarter actually, our client flows held up reasonably well, I think, in the context to that quarter. And I think that is actually part of the payback from some of the investment that we've made.</p>
          <p>But just to make it very clear, we're not in any way happy, or trying to justify the trading losses that we made. We should have done a better job in that, and I think, in future quarters we will do a better job. It was clearly a very difficult quarter. It was illiquid, the markets were quite volatile &#x2013; but also, we clearly should have done a better job. So we're not saying that that's a good result.</p>
          <p>And as I said, I think our expectation would be that, between good quarters and more difficult quarters, our client flows would be, again, the CHF1.5 billion to CHF2 billion, et cetera, or higher, hopefully, as that range moves up. And then hopefully, our inventory trading will be something from small positives to bigger positives, but we certainly wouldn't expect, in normal conditions, to be losing money on the inventory, so we -</p>

          <p>Sure. Just to come back, though, on that last point. I guess what my question was really interested in was this point about whether you're putting more or less inventory to work for your clients than previously...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Whether this kind of $600 million to $900 million is unusual compared to history, because there has been more inventory available for your clients, and you've been more willing to put your balance sheet to work than say, one year or 18 months ago, to give me some context versus previous quarters?

        <plist>
          <p>No, I think in fact, we're probably &#x2013; I think our VAR levels are down about 25% from the second quarter last year. I would say our &#x2013; obviously, our &#x2013; as the RWA changes have kicked in, that's probably also reduced our risk somewhat. But I wouldn't say we were materially higher or lower in terms of inventory positions in the second quarter, but obviously, the volatility of the market gave rise to more issues there.</p>

          <p>The only thing I'd add is, some of the price volatility in the non-agency paper and CMBS indexes was pretty extraordinary. I mean, we saw 20% to 30% swings over the course of four to five weeks, which is on par with some asset classes we saw actually fourth quarter '08. So it was a pretty extraordinary environment on the downside, and then trying to hedge that and having that basis risk made it interesting.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's Jernej here from Goldman. I have a few questions. And I think these are hopefully going to be very brief.</p>
          <p>The first question is on the FX and I think you very helpfully give us the sensitivities on slide six, and on slide seven to some extent as well. You show us two years of FX history, which shows that essentially the Swiss Franc appreciation really picked up pace in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>I guess the question here is as follows, if one takes a slightly longer time series, over the past decade or so, it seems to have been pretty much a one way trade. So the Swiss Franc basically gained, or the dollar rather halved versus the Swiss Franc over this period pretty much in a straight line. I was just wondering, what gives you confidence that we are going to have a reversion here at some point, particularly given that the rebate which is, I guess, negative towards the U.S. dollar seems to be intensifying?</p>
          <p>So that's question number one. How should we read the sensitivities you're giving us? Are you are trying to tell us that you expect some sort of a mean reversion of U.S. dollar, or are you just trying to tell us that you think things are going to get worse here, or how should we interpret this? I guess it's a debate we keep coming back every quarter now, for a good two years at least.</p>
          <p>The second question that I have is on your capital position, and I hear you that you say that you feel that Credit Swiss has already complied with the new regulatory set up. And I just have a couple of questions on this.</p>
          <p>So firstly, how does Credit Suisse feel about the Basel Committee essentially giving a cold shoulder to contingent capital as a concept. At least that's the impression I think I got and I think many other people got as well? So to what extent does that change your view on CoCos? And do you think you might be actually the only bank, maybe outside of UBS, that ends up issuing contingent capital at all? How should we view this as a, essentially from a quality of capital perspective from here? How do you view it?</p>
          <p>The second question I have on capital is just a very simple question on your leverage ratio. It's now 42 times leverage, as I calculate it, simple leverage. It's &#x2013; compared to UBS's 25 and the U.S. investment banks basically in the low teens. So I was wondering how you think about that, if you see this as a relevant metric at all?</p>
          <p>And the final question is purely, I guess, more of a broader question, and I asked the same question to UBS, so this is not a loaded question at any stretch of imagination, but what do you think is the proportion of your investment bank, in terms of balance sheet usage and maybe in terms of total resource, that is used to directly support your private banking business?</p>
          <p>And I was just wondering that, given all of the regulatory changes relate to one part of your business, which is the investment bank, and the other part of your business seems to be making, at least according to your divisional disclosure, well in excess of 40% return on equity, whether you think the time will come in the near future for a more broader strategic rethink? Thanks a lot. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lot of good questions. Okay.</p>
          <p>I think on the FX side, I guess what I would say is, we aren't really &#x2013; we aren't trying to predict, we aren't making a prediction about what might happened to foreign exchange rates. We were simply trying to give some hopefully helpful disclosure about what the impact might be of movements in that over time.</p>
          <p>So I don't think, at this point, we're actually assuming it's going to get worse or it's going to get better. I think obviously, we have taken measures in terms of reducing the cost base, because clearly it could remain at these levels, or it could even get stronger from here, which would obviously negatively impact the business.</p>
          <p>I also think that clearly, we continue to more strategically address some of these issues as well, in terms of where business are located, where &#x2013; what we are doing with our cost base in terms of potentially diversifying away from some of the Swiss Franc cost, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So I don't &#x2013; I actually would have to look, I'm not that up to date on a longer time series in terms of the FX rate, but I think our view is yeah, that obviously, you could see some reversion, you could argue that this is overshot in markets more normalize; or obviously, it could stay at these levels or it could even get worse from here.</p>
          <p>I think what we're trying to do is, make sure that our business will actually deliver good returns even if it &#x2013; even if it stays at these levels or gets worse. So again, 15% ROE in the first half on an operating basis even with these currency headwinds, we think was &#x2013; it shows that the business works. Obviously with these cost cuts, we would go into 2012 with a sort of base that &#x2013; level of kind of two points higher in ROE. So our hope is that we can actually manage that, but we'll also be managing it more, I think, longer term and more strategically as well.</p>
          <p>Your second question was on the CoCo issue. It's, again, a good one. I think our general view is, that we think that the contingent convertible capital is good capital. We think it's actually good for the industry, it provides additional capital layers without requiring dilution from the shareholders.</p>
          <p>We think there is a &#x2013; certainly a very large, ready market to buy these instruments and we obviously saw that in our issue where it was, as you know, very heavily over-subscribed, so we think it's actually a good thing. So I would say &#x2013; I think it's, I think, as you say, clearly the most recent news on it has clearly kind of come back from a little bit of the &#x2013; in terms of acceptability in terms of the core capital.</p>
          <p>I still think there're going to be a number of countries, number of regulators, and a number of banks that decide that having contingent capital as part of their capital stack will be something that is good and useful. And so, I think our view continues to be that this will end up being a robust market with a number of different issuers in it. But we'll see how it develops.</p>
          <p>I think for us specifically, in terms of our capital requirement, I don't think it really matters; in fact, you could argue that the less issuers there are, the better off we're going to be, because I mean our first issue of high trigger CoCos was, whatever, 20 times over-subscribed. I don't think there is any issue with us raising the additional capital, contingent capital.</p>
          <p>So from our point of view, I think we are not concerned about our position on it. I think it's actually a good capital instrument for the industry, and so I hope it actually does have increased, increased acceptability.</p>
          <p>And I don't think that &#x2013; I think actually the Basel, the Basel announcement, some of the other announces that we've seen have, as you say, backed away from contingent capital as a way to satisfy the core capital requirement, but I don't think they've actually closed the door on those being capital instruments that can be used to supplement capital overall.</p>
          <p>I don't know, do you want to talk about the leverage -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The balance sheet point. And I think there's probably a detail question than a broader question, really, in the issue of balance sheet to risk-weight asset ratios.</p>
          <p>In terms of the leverage ratio for the group, I think you're aware that we're obviously regulated under the Swiss leverage ratio, which has a number of variances to it, most particularly the exclusion of Swiss mortgages. On that basis, the ratio is 4.7% at the end of second quarter, I think compared to a range of 3% minimum under the Swiss rules, to sort of 5% being a sort of good times definition.</p>
          <p>And so the question then, I guess, is in terms of the total balance sheet, how that actually compares to the U.S. peers. And I think therefore touches a little bit on the question of RWA to balance sheet ratios. So I mean, I think that's probably the point of the comparison.</p>
          <p>I think what we would say is that our balance sheet actually has a high proportion of very low risk assets, particularly relating to our prime service and our <mark type="ph" /> reservices (81:23) which actually increases the balance sheet number, but doesn't actually add much in terms of risk-weighted assets. And we don't have much off-balance sheet risk, whether credit cards or anything else. And we generally have a very low risk in terms of credit quality &#x2013; in terms of our credit positions.</p>
          <p>So I don't think the balance sheet's &#x2013; certainly for Credit Suisse compared to U.S. Peers, and not necessarily comparable, given the different regulatory requirements. But I'm &#x2013; we can discuss that further, but I think those are the two points I'd make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think to your last point on the invest bank, and I'm not sure there's a very precise answer to your specific question about percentage related to the private bank, et cetera. I think that we view it as both an important aspect of the integrated bank model, which we think is a successful model, it's one where we can derive more value for clients and derive better return for shareholders. And it's also &#x2013; we think that the investment banking business can be a, and is, a good returning business in and of itself. Our first half in our investment bank, notwithstanding the second quarter which were difficult conditions, we had a 16% after-tax ROE in our investment banking business.</p>
          <p>Now that's a good first quarter, much tougher second quarter, our hope would be, obviously, that we can drive even better returns on the business over time as we continue both strategically to evolve the business, but also hopefully, we'll see some better market conditions going forward. But even if we don't, 16% after-tax return on equity, assuming the Basel 2 12.5% derived equity base, is a pretty return on that. So we think it is important to the overall proposition, but we also think it can be a business that makes good money and makes good returns in and of itself.</p>

          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Christopher Wheeler from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. Three questions, if I may. First of all, just going back to the losses, obviously you suffered in June on inventory. I just wondered how that is impacted in terms of your view of the securitized debt, the RMBS and the CMBS, and whether &#x2013; perhaps you could share with us what you've done, or thought about doing, in terms of saying well, this is something we took on the chin and we move on as we did before, or have you reduced the amount of capital in that area or are you thinking of actually reducing your activity in that area, because you feel that maybe this is a more difficult market moving forward? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one, related to that &#x2013; and I am little confused, I am sorry, but on note eight of the report, you have the trading revenues and you have a 1.562 billion loss on foreign exchange products, and I'm just trying to work out how that relates to the losses you've actually booked on inventory, and how that relates back to what we &#x2013; my earlier question, perhaps you just explain what that is?</p>
          <p>And then final question, really, is back on the lovely old subject of capital. Obviously, FINMA's made it very clear that sooner rather than later, they want to get you up to the levels they require. And the 8.8% obviously, is towards the bottoms of &#x2013; both your peer group, but obviously &#x2013; and that's your broader peer group in the U.S. and in Europe. But also, in terms obviously, of your main competitor in Switzerland. I am just trying to get my head around, what the discussions are with FINMA, in terms of where they would like you to be in 2012-13, in terms of the look-through ratio and whether 8.8% they feel totally comfortable with. Is there much pressure on you, obviously you've talked about the share compensation now not being negated, but obviously this has a big relevance to your dividend? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, as to the first question, our securitized products business is a very good business and if you take it first and second quarter together, very positive result and very good returns on the business, so I think our view is clearly- and this kind of comes back to this issue we talked about, first quarter overall performance was very good, second quarter obviously, on a &#x2013; particularly on a compare, was not as good. And again, we are not happy with the losses that we took on the inventory making there, but overall, the business made money in the second quarter as well. And on a combined basis from first to second quarter, it's a good business and we've got a very strong market share there, so. Our view is that it will continue to be a business that we can run profitability and with good returns. So I think our view on that is unchanged. Do you want to take the next two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of note eight, this is the trading revenue disclosure which is the U.S. GAAP disclosure, which is not by business, but by the type of instrument. So what you're actually seeing is the disaggregation of trades. So in particular, we have a number of interest rate swaps which were actually hedged against cross currency swaps. So in the volatility we saw in the quarter, essentially, you see the gains being taken on the interest swaps, and losses coming through on the FX hedging against it. So there's nothing untoward. Clearly, the overall trading numbers, which you see here, obviously reflect the overall fixed income numbers in particular, but there's nothing untoward in the FX thing. It's simply a consequence of the accounting disclosure by product type, or by risk type, as opposed to by business line, essentially. We did not have a 1.562 billion loss in our FX business, for example.</p>
          <p>So that would be my answer on point eight. I think in terms of the capital ratio, I think just one point to be clear, both the buffer capital note and the requirements as laid down by FINMA are actually on the transitional CET1 ratio, which we actually give on slide 27, which actually shows a 12.7% pro-forma ratio on consensus estimates, rising to a 14.3%. I think we thought it was useful to give look-through numbers today, because we've had questions about it, so we thought we'd actually give that as if those transitional deductions where not there over &#x2013; between 2013 and 2019.</p>
          <p>So I think that's really the answer of the discussion in terms of the regulatory environment. And the rules, which, as I said, are being discussed by the Swiss parliament at the moment, require that ratio, which fully converge by 2019, so both definitions are the same, to be at 10% minimum by 2019.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very helpful, and your disclosures as you said earlier, is very, very helpful indeed. I guess it's just the fact that they have made it very clear, sooner rather than later, and so 2019 we know is the date. And that's fine, you look like you'd be in very good shape there. But there are going to be competitive issues if you're sitting at the 8.8% possibly in 2012, then I'm sure FINMA must be thinking about that as well; is that not something that has any concern to you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think there's two points there. I think, in terms of the other aspect, the Swiss legislation which is the requirement of the issuance of the high strike CoCos and then the low strike CoCos. Effectively, at this point, we're now very close to the 3% requirement for the high strike already, in terms of the CHF2 billion we actually issued, and the forward contract we entered into in 2013. So really by October 2013, with the conversion of the hybrids into the BCN, we will essentially be very close to being full in compliance for the high strike CoCos, six years ahead of schedule. I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adds another 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which adds another 3% to the ratio. I think, if you look at the, as I said, the &#x2013; both the headline transitional ratio of 12.7%, 14.3% at the end of 2013, if we then look at the look-through ratio, 8.8% and 11%, and I point out that 11% does not assume we will continue to issue new capital in part for our shareholders. Then, even on that basis, you'd be above the 10% required by 2019, and then you have the high strike CoCos on top of that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just two areas, both on wealth management. You talked about the cost cuts being largely in investment bank, but obviously there's a new lower base because of what's going on in transactions. So could you just talk through what you are doing on costs in wealth management over the next 18 months, and what we should expect there?</p>
          <p>And then on the inflows, which are quite good, I just wondered on slide 13, the very strong inflows in Switzerland, to what extent are you seeing a flight to quality, given what's going on with sovereigns, et cetera. Is that influencing your inflows this quarter and in the first part to a great extent? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Fiona. Yeah, I think on the first point actually, these efficiency measures that we're taking do impact all of our businesses, and they impact them really around the world and so there clearly is &#x2013; there will be a reduction in cost base in the wealth management business as well. I think, as David mentioned before, we haven't really wanted to get into the full detail of how much exactly in each business, but there will be material reductions in the cost base in the wealth management business as well.</p>
          <p>And then, Walter, do you want to take the inflow question, or &#x2013; sorry-</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. Obviously, as said by Brady, we are not disclosing numbers, but we will take serious action on the private banking side. On the &#x2013; on your question about the sovereign problem, whether that drove assets to us as well in Switzerland, I don't really see a pattern of that right now. I don't think this is based on the sovereign problems we have.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we had a tough 2008 and 2009, I think we recovered. And I think as well, when you look at some of the parameters about the brand of big banks, that certainly has improved, and the I think the wealth of &#x2013; the platform a big bank can provide in Switzerland is still much bigger than some of the smaller ones. So I think that is really attracting people back into Credit Suisse.</p>

          <p>It's been interesting, because people ask questions about both the competitive situation, where obviously in '09, et cetera, there were more &#x2013; there was more distress generally in the industry and also some of the issues, the more macro issues. The truth is, if you look at our business, we have been very consistent in terms of net new assets that have come in almost every quarter, every year; it's been very consistent over the past three or four years. So it's been strong and consistent, so I'm not sure that FX changes or sovereign distress or other issues have really impacted that very much; we're very happy with the level of net new asset generation, and obviously hope it continues.</p>

          <p>Good morning and thanks, hanging on for me. So just a question on the timing of the impact of the CHF2 billion of contingent share award issuance that you've flagged. Just so I understand this, the capital impact of awards that have already been granted, or that will be granted over the next couple of years; and then, in terms of the associated share dilution, the 50 million similarly, is that already captured in the diluted share count that we see currently, or is that to come, in addition to the diluted share count that you published as of the second quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first point is to &#x2013; actually, is that the deduction is really the P&amp;L chart. So that's the benefit to capital. So it's not directly a relation to the share issuance, so we will see that accruing <mark type="ph" /> liberally (93:10) over the course of the next 18 months, depending on our performance and our compensation accruals. In terms of the share issuance, we actually did do this in the first quarter; you may have seen that the share count actually went up during the first quarter, because that's when we actually delivered the shares for this year, so &#x2013; which is when the bulk of the shares are actually due. There will be some limited share issuance in the balance of this year, but we actually pulled that forward into the first quarter this year compared to second quarter last year, and then the majority of the shares would then be driven by the delivery of shares for prior-year awards, presumably in either the first quarter or the second quarter of next year, depending on how we actually time the share delivery to our employees. It's always very close to the quarter crossover. Okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, to be exact, is it in the share count today? No, because we've not issued the shares as yet. When we actually issue the shares, they'll become into the share count and you would expect the shares to go up by that order of number, the largest increase occurring, as I said, when we actually deliver the shares, probably at the end of the first quarter, it might slip into second quarter.</p>

          <p>That 50 million increase first or second quarter next year is an increase in both basic shares outstanding and fully diluted shares outstanding?</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot Matthew. So I think that's all our questions from the website; we're kind of running out of time. Any other questions here?</p>

          <p>Let me just quickly sum up then. As we said, we think we have a strong business model and have demonstrated that by being able to earn a 15% return on equity in the first half, 10% in the second quarter, and that's despite some very strong headwinds in the markets. Market shares in private banking, asset management, and investment banking have been steadily increasing, so we think clients buy into the model. In addition, we do feel we've been at the forefront of regulatory change and our model is highly evolved now against the future regulatory requirements, so we have less adjustments take on that in terms of capital, liquidity; some other elements in the business model.</p>
