          <p>Okay, I think we can &#x2013; we're going to start please. So welcome for this &#x2013; welcome to the second session of the day for the AXA 2011 Earnings Presentation from London. This afternoon will be speaking Henri de Castries, Chairman and CEO of AXA; Denis Duverne, our Deputy CEO; G&#xE9;rald Harlin, our Group CFO; and Mark Pearson, the CEO of our U.S. Life operations. So, Henri, I think you can start now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mattieu. Mattieu is asking me to be very brief, so I will be very brief. So let's &#x2013; at which time? Pretty got much time as possible. Here we are. I'm going to comment only two slides. I think the outcome for us for the 2011 earnings is very, very simple. It's an earnings release showing the robustness of this business model, of the operating business model and the robustness of the balance sheet. Therefore, we are able to maintain the dividend.</p>
          <p>Why do we think that we are robust? Very simple. Revenues and earnings are growing in the Property &amp; Casualty line of business, slightly ahead of our Ambition AXA expectations. And the second pillar of the activity, which is Health and Protection, revenues and earnings are growing solidly. Revenues are growing double digit. Earnings and margins are growing and are &#x2013; or are at very high levels. The Life &amp; &#x2013; sorry, the Savings and Asset Management portion of the business is, of course, given markets conditions more challenged, but nevertheless, still very significantly profitable in each area where we are addressing the issues we have. But the diversification of the business model and the generation of earnings are convincing us that the operating model is a strong one. I would add to that something you should not neglect, which is the geographical diversification of the business, which is reducing the risk profile.</p>
          <p>Denis will discuss the margins at some length. But you will see that what we were intending to do at start of Ambition AXA is in fact starting to operate. So we maintain the dividend because we think that the dividend is an important element for the shareholders in this period of time, and we do not think that this payout is any way reducing our ability to develop our business.</p>
          <p>Of course, the financial market has been impacted by market conditions. You will see that through &#x2013; I mean, when you look at the impairment we've taken on Greece or when you look at the revision of assumptions we've made on the U.S. business that we are very much delivering on operational initiatives. Remember that the three pillars of Ambition AXA are: more selectivity, acceleration of growth in the high growth markets or in the high growth segments like the direct business and more efficiency everywhere. Selectivity, you will see that we have redeployed more than &#x20AC;4 billion of capital this year, three quarters of it for the acquisition in particular of the Asian minorities and one quarter of it for the deleveraging of the group.</p>
          <p>We are also more selective in the business lines, as I said just before, decreasing the exposure to general account and increasing the exposure to have some protection in P&amp;C. So it's working, acceleration in the high growth market. Denis will come back to what we have done in Asia. But clearly, it's something we want to continue. And we think that looking backwards &#x2013; looking back, the buying of the minorities was justified. Asia is representing now one quarter. Asia ex-Japan is representing one quarter of the new business that we have in group in Life, and it's going nicely as it is in Property &amp; Casualty.</p>
          <p>Efficiency, the good news is that we are delivering on our efforts. You know that the plan was to save &#x20AC;1.5 billion between 2010 and 2015 to reduce the operating cost of the group. We have achieved &#x20AC;300 million in 2011, slightly ahead of the plan. And we are very comfortable that the rest of it is going to be delivered over time between now and 2015.</p>
          <p>A word on the balance sheet, we are comfortable with the balance sheet. The Solvency I ratio which is still the regulatory ratio we have to go operate with as long as Solvency II is not enforced is at its peak over the last five years. For us, it's not the most significant ratio, but it's worth mentioning it. If you look at Solvency II, the ratio has decreased to 148% at the end of last year, which we still think is a comfortable territory. It's up again now above 150%.</p>
          <p>What we want to see on Solvency II because we are all aware of the discussions regarding the implementation timetable is very, very simple. We look forward for the same thing as all the other large European players. We want clarity on the methodology as quickly as possible and a precise implementation date. We hope things are going to progress there, but whatever the outcome of the discussions, we are comfortable with our own situation. It's not a real concern for us even if we want clarity on some of the technical aspects like the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (6:15) payment.</p>
          <p>So overall, in a very difficult environment, we think a very solid set of operating earnings and a decent and a relatively good degree of confidence of the management and the fact that Ambition AXA is going to continue to deliver what we have said it would deliver. We don't think that the financial uncertainties will be alleviated quickly, but we are comfortable operating within the conditions we are seeing now.</p>
          <p>And I will now leave the floor to Denis for more detailed commentaries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. So I've also been instructed by Mattieu not to comment more than six slides. So I will do that relatively quickly if I can find the first one. First one is at slide 16. Just to go through with you the key elements of our underlying earnings, as you have seen, we have sold Canada in September, which means that we have considered Canada as a discontinued business for the full year, so Life &#x2013; so you see the Canadian earnings in the net income. So for comparable, this is on underlying. We take that out of the &#x2013; we take the 2010 earnings of Canada out of the comparison.</p>
          <p>The second element with regard to scope relates to the Life business where we sold the bulk of our U.K. Life business in 2010, and we've sold Australia, New Zealand on the 1st of April 2011. So that's on a like-for-like basis, we take out &#x20AC;141 million. So the comparison &#x2013; I mean, between 2010 and 2011 is negative on the Life side by &#x20AC;72 million and more than that &#x20AC;250 million of the &#x20AC;72 million is explained by the decline in the U.S. earnings, which has been a big part of the story this year. On the U.S. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:27). As you know, we strengthened our reserves for lapses, and so Life earnings, which should have been up otherwise have declined by &#x20AC;72 million.</p>
          <p>P&amp;C went up 16%, a good story. We are in line with what we said we would do, and Asset Management is up 20% because of the nonrepeat of the Rosenberg reserve that we took last year. Adjusted earnings were down 15%. That's entirely a function of the realized capital losses, which followed <mark type="ph" /> where assets and gains (9:08) in 2011 &#x2013; in 2010, sorry. And it's &#x2013; we did a decent amount of capital gains, &#x20AC;682 million. But we had bigger impairments, equity impairments, the biggest one being <mark type="indiscernible" /> (9:22) for &#x20AC;115 million. And more importantly fixed income impairments, the biggest one being Greece &#x20AC;387 million. We took Greece down to 22% of part. On the net income, we are at 49%. In some time, you will recall that we lost &#x20AC;1.5 billion out of the disposal of the U.K. Life business to resolution. This year, we had very significant gains from disposals: Australia, Hong Kong and Canada that we also took &#x20AC;1.1 billion, &#x20AC;1.2 billion from goodwill, of which &#x20AC;943 million on the U.S. goodwill, we've had 37% of our U.S. goodwill. This is a story that I have commented at length this morning where basically &#x2013; with very low long-term interest rates, we considered that the accumulated business line was a business which was really in trouble, and we try to evaluate what part of the goodwill was related to that business, and we wrote it down and we removed that part of the goodwill, &#x20AC;943 million.</p>
          <p>The other negative here is the Hungarian Bank, basically after having nationalized the pension systems in 2010, the government allowed the mortgage owners to repay their mortgage at the conversion rate of the Swiss Franc because all mortgages in Hungary are in Swiss Franc or 90% of the mortgages are in Swiss Franc. They could repay their mortgages on the 2008 exchange rate. So we decided to take a big write-down on Hungary. We are essentially stepping lending activity there. We are continuing to take deposits, but it's a big risk that is almost in run-off. So that's the story for our net income.</p>
          <p>Now if I go into the new business activity, you saw that our new business APE was down 1%. This is slide 21, protection, plus 13%. We have grown protection across the board with a good success in the U.S., France, Switzerland and Germany.</p>
          <p>On the opposite, on GA savings where we have a negative margin, we have pared down our growth, and new business volumes have gone down 20%, especially the decline in France, Italy and Belgium. Unit-linked where we have stable margin of 22%, new business went down 3%, contrasting, it showed good growth of unit-linked in Italy, France, the U.S. and Asia, offset by the U.K. where we are mostly now selling mutual funds and Germany where we have repriced and reduced our exposure to VAs.</p>
          <p>Mutual funds, nice growth in the UK, but offset by a decline of pensions in Central Eastern Europe, again because of government actions. And so our margins in the life increased in spite of a decline in interest rates, which, I would say, is not a small achievement.</p>
          <p>Moving to &#x2013; sorry, maybe to &#x2013; looking at the earnings on the Life side, Page 24, you'll see that in U.S., we made this loss in the U.S. Vas for the regions we have outlined, hedging loss and strengthening of lapse reserves. But we had solid growth in all the other segments of Life: protection plus 8%, savings plus 8% -- plus 18%, sorry; and unit-linked excluding VAs, plus 4%.</p>
          <p>P&amp;C, I would only comment one slide which is Slide 29. We are better than where we said we would be. On the current year &#x2013; current year combined ratio, we had 99.6%. We said we would be below 100%. Thanks to a combination of price increases, lower net cuts. We are at 0.7% of net cuts where we believe the average over a decade is about 1%.</p>
          <p>Cost savings are in line with our plans. Low frequency, some increase in severity. We have low prior -- positive developments, but all in all, we improved our combined ratio by 1.6 points to 97.9%. And our investment income is almost stable, which is not bad in a declining interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, Asset Management, Slide 32, Asset Management earnings increased by 20% in spite of the slight decline of average AUM. This is because of the nonrepeat of the Rosenberg reserve on AXA IM, which straight earnings grew by 69%. AllianceBernstein earnings declined by 23%, lower revenues, lower assets under management, and expenses, which have not declined exactly in line with revenues.</p>
          <p>That's all I wanted to say. Gerald &#x2013; is Gerald taking the floor? Yes, so Gerald &#x2013; Mattieu continues the command.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as the shareholders' equity, it's moved down from &#x20AC;49.7 billion to &#x20AC;48.6 billion. You have all the key drivers. I just would like to highlight one point, which I mentioned already at the end of June, which is minus 2.5% goodwill deduction concerning to the buyback of the minorities in Asia, which are deducted for accounting reasons from the shareholders' equity.</p>
          <p>Solvency I ratio is pretty high at one of the highest level at 188 points. Solvency to economic solvency is at 148%. We consider that it's comfortable level. We will be above 150% in January. Most of the movements, as you can see on the right, are coming from credit and government bonds, spreads, net of the liquidity premium but also due to the very low interest rate environment. And you can see that under sensitivity, there are two main drivers remaining, interest rates and corporate spreads.</p>
          <p>And as far as the debt gearing is concerned, we are at 26%, which is a level which is &#x2013; it has declined from 28% to 26%. Two reasons, first, the net proceed coming from disposals and acquisitions, &#x20AC;0.9 billion and the rest coming from the increased upstreams from dividends to the holding company. Interest coverage improved from 8.5 times to 9.1 times.</p>
          <p>General Account invested assets not &#x2013; no big change, I would say, that our structure which is mainly a fixed income structure remains, yet some, it's on the market value. So that's why corporate bonds look like going slightly down, but that's due to the widening spreads but nothing specific to mention.</p>
          <p>On the annualized capital gains, it went down but still substantial from &#x20AC;6.6 billion to &#x20AC;5.1 billion. This is &#x2013; this corresponds to the annualized capital gains in our balance sheet. It's -- so that's top of the shareholder equity. Equities went down from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;0.9 billion. This should be compared with a net exposure of &#x20AC;6 billion, so we are still positive. One word about the government bonds, annualized gains moving up from &#x20AC;2.3 billion to &#x20AC;3.1 billion and you have detail at the bottom here. We are negative on the peripheral countries at minus &#x20AC;0.7 billion, but all the other account fees are positive.</p>
          <p>U.S. well the annualized gains and which are not on the balance sheet which is off balance sheet on real estate and loans which are going up from &#x20AC;2.9 billion to &#x20AC;3.2 billion. The exposure to the peripheral countries &#x2013; no significant change, just wanted to highlight that we made the calculation at the end of Jan and at the end of Jan, we are &#x2013; for Spain and Portugal levels which are not different from the levels at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Greece, we impaired Greece and all the exposure to Greece has been impaired, and we have a global haircut of 78%. Of domestic versus non-domestic, the exposure on eurozone peripheral countries is 55% &#x2013; so 55% of this exposure is held by non-domestic countries, mostly Spain, Germany and Belgium.</p>
          <p>And on this slide, what we did is just in a theoretical case where the &#x2013; as the value of the exposure to eurozone peripheral countries would be reduced to zero, then we have unrealized capital gains, which are above the exposure to the peripheral. The consequence on the right side would be a decline in the investment because we need to take out capital gain, so the new &#x2013; the reinstatement would be 3.9% compared with a guaranteed rate at 2%, which means that we have flexibility to absorb potential losses.</p>
          <p>Here, you have the traditional slide on the investment policy. The investment margins went down from 76 basis points to 73 basis points, so quite resilient. The spread versus guaranteed rates, the investment income went down from 4 to 3.9 minus 10 basis points, but at the same time, we got a decline of 10 basis points from the guaranteed interest rates, which confirm that we have a steady gross margin of 180 basis points.</p>
          <p>You can see on the top right, the reinvestment rate in 2011, this explains that the interest on average has been at 3.5%, of which 3.9% for the Eurozone and at bottom right, you have the current investment policy, which is we don't invest any more on Eurozone peripheral countries. Government bonds 25%, so significantly reduced, and we have a lot of values in corporate bonds and secured financial bonds. That's and also &#x2013; under this condition, with this profile of investment and fixed income, we get a return on eurozone, which is roughly at 3.7%.</p>
          <p>On the embedded value, embedded value went down from &#x20AC;34.2 billion to &#x20AC;31.5 billion. TNAV slightly increased from &#x20AC;14.1 billion to &#x20AC;14.5 billion. This is the embedded value per share is &#x20AC;13.5, and you can see on the right here different elements. Operating return is strong, its 19% corresponding to the return plus the earnings from the non-life business, investment experience correspond to effect of declining interest rates and widening of the spreads on both sovereign and corporate bonds.</p>
          <p>The group operating free cash flow increased by 14% due to Life and non-Life. On P&amp;C, it increased from &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC; 2.1 billion corresponding to the improvements in the underlying earnings that linked to the improvement on the combined ratio, but also on realized gains net of required capital. The &#x2013; what is interesting is to look at the proceeds from the &#x2013; from our subsidiaries, which will start from 2.7% to 3.2%. This corresponds to real cash, and the remittance ratio which is at 76% where it was at 75% one year ago.</p>
          <p>Last, the free cash flows. You can see that between 2010 and 2011, we had an improvement in the expected inforce surplus generation. And also, this &#x20AC;2.2 billion remain stable which means that our strength &#x2013; new business strength plus the capital dedicated to the new business remains the same, whereas the profitability of our new business increased, which is &#x2013; which highlights what we explained to you on the IR Day. IRR on new business moves up on &#x20AC;10.9 billion to &#x20AC;11.5 billion. And as you can see on Life, our free cash flows went up nearly at &#x20AC;1.7 billion and in the end, we are at &#x20AC;1.8 billion.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. Unlike the other presenters, Mattieu has asked me to take most slides out and to go into some detail. So that's either because I'm a wonderful presenter, or we have some issues to discuss in the U.S., so I'll let you decide.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's have a look at the U.S. On the operating side, we had &#x2013; we did have a good year, if you look at sales volume, up 7% in the year. This volume coupled with some good changes in the mix and what we've done on expenses has helped to offset the lower interest rates, and you see the new business value figure there up 15% on the year.</p>
          <p>Obviously, as has been mentioned a number of times earlier, our underlying earnings have been held back in the year by GMxB losses and the strengthening of reserves to reflect lower lapses on the GMxB book and the net income, we have taken a write-down of our goodwill of $1.3 billion, which is affecting that negative $475 million. So good operating performance but have been hit by the legacy book on our underlying earnings and on the net income.</p>
          <p>Just diving a bit down into the sales number, on the left-hand side, there is the Life new business APE, you'll see &#x2013; so numbers we're pleased with. Firstly, our Life business is up 40% on the year. This was coming principally through us being back in the market with third-party distributors and a product we have called IULs, Indexed Universal Life product, doing very well in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>I'm also very pleased with the success on the Retirement Cornerstone that's up 24% year-on-year. This is an available newly product that has a variable roll-up rate rather than the traditional fixed roll-up rates that you see in the marketplace, obviously, a lot less risky than a fixed roll-up rate. So this was pretty new to the market, and we're pleased that that is gaining some traction there.</p>
          <p>You can see as well on the accumulative side, as we have de-risked this product and dialed down some of the features, you can see that that's come true in lower volumes there, and we're simply trading volumes for margin on that particular line. Expenses, 11% down on the year principally through reductions in head counts. We've had some good early action there and some success there.</p>
          <p>In terms of placing us for the future, a couple of things I get comfort from. Firstly, the aligned distribution channel, through the grid our business is going back to its roots and back to the basics. If you look at us having the aligned distribution for us of 5,200 people, it is really an asset we have inside the company. And that now is giving us two-thirds of our business as opposed to 40% when we were more active in the accumulated third-party market.</p>
          <p>The innovation of products in this market is really important. It's obviously, there is risk in this investment times, and it's a very competitive market. So our ability to innovate to be competitive was not taking excessive risk is important. So one of the things we like to track is how are the new products doing and the launches so far, over time in Cornerstone, SCS, and our IUL product have all gone well and account for more than 30%of sales today. And just one other statistic there, the workforce now inside the company is 27% lower than it was in 2007. So we've moved very, very fast to reflect that.</p>
          <p>This slide shows our pre-tax underlying earnings. One thing for those of you following other U.S. companies, you will know that the attribution results on U.S. company, its GMxB book is normally showing in the net income line. At AXA, we do show it in the underlying earnings. So what we've done on this slide is to strip out the impact of the hedging losses and the strengthening of reserves to lower lapses to show what's happening in the core of the business. And you can see there in the center of the graph that excluding those margin and lapse impacts, we are seeing a 10% growth in our pre-tax underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>Just a few words on the deduction of goodwill, as Denis mentioned, we had a good look at the business and once we have confidence over the long term, we have reflected the reality today of lower margins, particularly on the accumulated business and we have felt it appropriate to take a write-down of goodwill and that comes to 37% write-down of $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Two things that goodwill will expect to the year 2000 purchase of the minorities in AXA Financial, and it's obviously a non-cash item and as such is not affecting RBC but the local solvency. Our RBC ratio is just below 500%, so no local statutory issues there at all.</p>
          <p>I'll also try to show on this graph here, the much lower risk profile of the new business we're writing today in terms of the initial capital needed to backing investments we received, but also the capital needed to sustained in shocks on interest rates or equity markets and you can see the numbers there, a much less risky business we are writing today.</p>
          <p>You can also see on the bottom left there, the accumulated sales over the period peaking in the year 2007, we do remain with a top 10 player in the market on the BA side, I think number eight in the marketplace, and we think we got the mix about right now.</p>
          <p>Just a quick word on the lapse assumptions, I think the most important takeaway here is that our reserve assumptions are now in line with the actual experience for 2011. Our practice in previous years in common with most other insurers has to be use a three-year average of the lapses in view of the low interest rate in the market and name keys are staying at that. We'd likely to keep them low for the next few years before it prudent to move to actual experience. So the 2011 net impact you see there is reflecting this year's lapses, but also a catch-up if you like or one-off to take us from the full year average to actual in the &#x2013; get some guidance there if lapses were to decline by 0.5% beyond what is already projected in our reserves then the impact would be about $160 million net.</p>
          <p>The other issue to watch on policyholder that have is, of course, the amortization, a risk. There is no evidence at all of increased amortization in the book, and you can see there from a little dot we have in the bottom that actual experience is significantly below average assumption.</p>
          <p>If we were to double the reserve assumptions and there's no reason why we were, but if were then our underlying earnings would be impacted by $150 million. In focusing on this inforce business we have, we have taken some actions in the last quarter. We are the first insurance carrier that still open to new business in VA that has suspended additional contributions into legacy products, basically we were able to put in investments to dial and get the same sort of features when you bought the products well back in 2006 and 2007, so understandably, we have stopped that. It would affect from tomorrow actually.</p>
          <p>We've also introduce technical tools to help us manage volatility both within the fund and at a policy level, which helps our customers, but also helps, protect the balance sheet on full access as well.</p>
          <p>On the hedge reporting side, I did want to make people aware of a couple of things. We do not use non-performance risk adjustment in capitalizing our reserves. This is used pretty widely in the U.S., this NPR, and has the effect of reducing the amount of reserves by applying the company's own credit spread to discount rate, and has the element of smoothing out these traditional reserves over many, many years.</p>
          <p>The industry also use the historic scenarios, the stochastic scenarios under U.S. GAAP. over time, and as I mentioned earlier, will reflect impact on mark-to-mark basis in underlying earnings.</p>
          <p>Looking to the new business side, we have worked very hard to try and reshape our business, particularly on the savings side. Pleased with some of the numbers there. You can see SCS, which is structured capital product, and Retirement Cornerstone are really gaining traction. And on the Life side, you can see the success of the Indexed Universal Life and now accounting for about 40% of our business. There's also this mix in what we've done on expenses has increased our new business margin by 1% to 13%.</p>
          <p>So I think in the U.S., it's very clear. We have a good operating performance in the year. We really are getting some traction on our strategy to diversify. At the same time, we have to be mindful, of course, of the inforce book we have, and we're applying very strong disciplined risk management through that. And the objective remains delivering sustainable earnings and free cash flows over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I've covered all the slides very, very fast. So I hope that was okay for everybody.</p>

          <p>Nick Holmes with Nomura. I had irritatingly some slightly more detailed questions on Slide 53 on the variable annuities. And first one is amortization expense. Mark, you said this is way below assumptions. And I wondered, a), why you think this is?  And b), what might make it worst for you? And then also ask about lapse assumption, you've given us the 0.5% sensitivity. I wonder if you could actually tell us what the lapse assumption was in 2011. And also, under sort of what circumstances would you expect lapsation to improve? I mean it gets worse for you that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Nick. So on the 2011, actual assumptions &#x2013; and we are hesitant to give out one number, Nick, because it's actually, many, many numbers. We dynamically calculate the reserves based on when we got the business, the in-the-moneyness and where interest rates are. So if we give you a number of X and you check out X is moving, it's very difficult to see what the impact on reserves would be because you have to know what the reserve assumptions are and what the in-the-moneyness is for those particular cohorts. So just giving one number can be &#x2013; not helpful, so that's why we don't give out a particular number.</p>
          <p>And the real issue on lapse rates is obviously a combination of where interest rates are and in-the-moneyness that affects the lapse rates. Also, the extent to which there are alternative vehicles for consumers. And that's probably what's keeping the lapse rates down below for all players in the U.S. because in the days prior to 2007, let's say, every three months there was a better product come out that people could surrender their old and go into the new, so that's probably the issue that's most effecting lapses at that particular level.</p>
          <p>On the annuitization rates, to be honest Nick, it's probably early to claim victory on this one because we have to wait for the annuitization period to start, which can be &#x2013; which is at least 10 years on most of those products. So nothing we're seeing has caused us any alarm, but it's something we have to track from now onwards because it's still too early to have a really huge number in the sample to look at.</p>

          <p>One comment on that. I believe that from the customer standpoint, when the customer takes the annuity, he losses the benefit of assets. And I mean &#x2013; that's an obvious point that we've made a number &#x2013; on a number of occasions. So if the customer <mark type="audio gap" /> (38:14)</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, because a) we are applying the ITF from a general lump sum which means that we are &#x2013; we have less backable expenses, and we have slowed down the pace of DAC amortization since 2008 substantially, so we have less protection. So we should have less growth in hedging, but we also have to recognize that we have less DAC protection.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oliver Steel with Deutsche Bank. I'm sorry I've got more questions on the same sort of subject. The first, if you came back to the lapse assumption, and if you're not, can you give us an actual figure for 2011? I wonder if you could give us some of the exceptional capture element of the lapse charge. That's question one.</p>
          <p>And the second question is, Denis, you were touching on actually on the issue, which is how long can you depend on the DAC reactivity, that you can put a few more figures around that or if you like some sort of guidance as to what sort of percentage DAC offsets against the gross charge you might expect going forwards?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is I noted that the base earnings &#x2013; the guaranteed business in the States had actually halved in 2011. So I'm just wondering what the cause of that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat the last one?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think what you &#x2013; you call it the base earnings i.e. pre the exceptionals for the GMxB business in the States &#x2013; it's in one of the slides. It went from $406 million to $216 million.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question on the catch-up versus the one year, I don't actually have the numbers, so we will have to get back to you on that one. I don't actually have the number at hand, and I wouldn't want to take a guess.</p>
          <p>On the last question you had which is the VA base fees the $406 million to the $216 million, there is a &#x2013; if I remember it right, the pre-2011 VA is unhedged, and that moves around a bit in that particular line. It was positive in 2010 and negative in 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On your second question <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:12) which was about the percentage of DAC optimization, we could say that roughly today, we have a net impact, net of tax of roughly 30%. And as mentioned before, it was mentioned by Denis because you know that since the DAC capitalization will be lower, we can expect more or less to be at 50%, something around this.</p>

          <p>Linked between those two. And the second question was I wonder if you were planning on keeping &#x2013; in any sense, I couldn't it find here an equivalent of the slide from last year which had free cash flows from &#x2013; undiscounted cash flows from new business. There was a slide, which have that in last year, I mean, actually it was Slide 42, and I think it was the main part of the presentation last year. I actually found that very useful, and I'd like to make a plea that it be reinstated if it really has been dropped and I also think &#x2013; I thought that will distinguish itself by being one of a handful of companies reproduced this last year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>More work, on the French Life business side, I think there are various elements. First, the &#x2013; I would say the will of banks to try to attract life insurance deposits, it's probably not as strong as it was in the second half of last year because of what the ECB has done to fund them with, I would say, cheap resources for significant amount and a significant amount of time. The second observation I would make there is that the first thing they do is to cannibalize themselves. I mean their own life insurance subsidiaries. I mean, their appetite for transfer, will have to come back. I think that given the evolution of the Basel III rules, which is going to play more favorably because they are not going to be able to double count the capital between banking and insurance. The first thing they should do is to try to reduce the balance sheet of their life insurance subsidiaries before attracting others.</p>
          <p>Second, I would say for us, it's not a core concern because as Denis has highlighted in his slide, our level of appetite for euro denominated general account products is low because of the margins as we have generated. I mean, we prefer to have unit linked or I mean, P&amp;C or Health and Protection.</p>
          <p>Second type of risk is could be a benefit from special tax incentives to attract money on the balance sheet. Since the way to be very improbable given two things, the necessity for the French state to reduce its deficits, which is going to play for both candidates. Second thing, if one of these two candidates is elected, it would be difficult for him to reconciliate the finger pointing at on banks, seeing that Finance is the enemy, the fact that one of the decisions would be to grant them tax exemptions for some products they would put in the market. So I see the degree of risks as being fairly limited there.</p>
          <p>As far as AXA Bank is concern, we have the question this morning in Paris because they are offering a 6% rate to attact money on their books. As Nicolas Moreau answered, this is an extremely limited period of time and impacted the commercial operation to attract money and then try to convert it into insurance products, so it started the marketing strategy of the French business. We will see if it works. It has worked in other countries. It's not, I would say, a structural policy. We use AXA Bank as a way to capture flows, which we then try to convert into, I would say, more long-term money.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And on the undiscounted cash flows from the new business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As far as the undiscounted cash flow, we made an extensive work as you know for IRR base, so I can say that it will be &#x2013; it's not very different. I can tell you that what we told you &#x2013; we told you remember as far as Life is concerned, to have a 20 -roughly &#x20AC;24 billion of expected cash flows from the inforce book. It's still true, so no big difference as far as factor of the new cash &#x2013; of the cash flows coming from the new business. Not to be changed, so &#x2013; but I noticed your point and I'll try as much as possible next time to provide you with the slide. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (52:04) A couple of questions. You say you've got limited appetite for euro denominated general account business. And does that translate to your agents as well, though they still got appetite to sell it? So how are you managing to align your interest with theirs? First question.</p>
          <p>Second question is what steps are you taking to expand distribution in India? That's not a loaded question hopefully for you. And the third question is, just given the changes you've made to the VA offering in the U.S., what strategic benefits are there for owning AllianceBernstein?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first part of your question, as you have seen, the Health and Protection business is developing quite fast in France. And the unit-linked proportion of the sales is resisting quite well. So the French team, they have been doing an exercise, let's say, revising the historical strengths of the networks, which historically have been very good in selling protection, especially the specialized agents.</p>
          <p>They have also worked on the commission structure. And we think that overall it's working pretty well. Our market share in terms of unit-linked is increasing, even if the market is difficult. And in the mixed unit-linked for the first month of the year is at 25%. So they are selling unit-linked rather than selling euros. They are selling more Health and Protection. And remember, I don't think it's a major issue for us because as you know, we have two sorts of agents. We have the generalist agents who are selling mostly P&amp;C and accessorily from Life and Protection business. And we have specialized life agents and for them, the rules were selling Protection rather than selling Savings, so it's not as difficult as what you would imagine, and we have not stopped to sell euro dominated policies but it seems, put clearly, the proportion is shrinking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the two tricks we are using to sell bundled products with a minimum 25% <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:25), and the second trick is that if agents in system selling euro contracts, they have no commissions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's simple. On the &#x2013; trick in French means?</p>
          <p>Expanding distribution in Asia, as you've seen, we &#x2013; I think there are two different efforts. One of them is to be popularity sales force. Another one is to build bancassurance distribution.</p>
          <p>Last year, we've been expanding quite significantly there. Take the Indonesian example, where we have now an agreement with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:15), which is the first bank in the country, not only in Life, but also in P&amp;C. And we are also trying to extend the network of bancassurance agreements in the region because we think it's a good way to expand both in P&amp;C and in Life.</p>
          <p>And if you look at the, I would say, the revenue numbers in Asia, you would see that most of the Life under P&amp;C business are growing at the double-digit rates, 116%, in fact, for those. And it's the combination of the two things. One other thing I would mention as far as Asia is concerned is I want the teams to increase the exposure to commercial business and large risks because I think it's an area where we have all the capability, all the expertise and where we are under-represented. And where there's also a very significant margin. I'm not sure I got the thrust of your question but basically...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll give you the thrust again if you want. The first is that historically, you put a lot of the VA funds into Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in reality, that's what I thought. I understood. So we move to open architecture on the VA side back in 1996. And by 2006 and 2007, only one third of the funds were ready. So by moving 65% or 70% of the funds to passive, we've obviously further reduce the rate of &#x2013; on the VA funds. So that's clearly a part of the negative flows that Bernstein experienced on the equity funds. But if there was just that &#x2013; that would have been slowed down &#x2013; I mean, the bulk of the negative flows on the equity side were coming from the institutional side of the business of the retail. And this is the combination of relatively poor performance in 2011 because they had an operative on the way what happens. And also the &#x2013; I would say, the defined benefit category is a shrinking category, therefore all &#x2013; most of the active mergers has outflows on the equity side. AllianceBernstein, having said that, has very good performance on the fixed income side is developing rapidly in alternatives and widely to human strategies and that's where the future of the firm lies. And hopefully, the value franchise will recover. The growth franchise there is seriously damaged, but I would say that if we have the continuation of outflows on the equity side at the current space, with which given the fact  that the growth rates have been relatively constant around $60 billion, we would be in Q4 of 2012 roughly breakeven.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could we go to Slide 31 because Slide 31 is giving a portion of the answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. You see minus &#x20AC;54 billion on the equity front in 2011 plus foreign fixed income plus 22% in alternatives and other, so the issue is &#x2013; remains equities and again, as the equity franchise is gradually shrinking, I believe that we are &#x2013; I would are close to the bottom.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you be able to comment quickly on what portion of the VA book is mature as in it's in the amortization period and how this evolves in 2012 and 2013? And also, what you think is the risk of the current amortization rates that you are observing not being representative of how situation might evolve in the coming years. And the reason I'm asking this is because especially in the IB product at industry level, volumes stepped out quite significantly in 2003 and onwards, so the sample really for the vintages before 2002 is relatively small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, do you want to take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So just very quickly, as I said in the presentation, we see no deterioration year-on-year, but in answer to the earlier question, it maybe a little bit too early to claim victory because there's a 10-year rate on this amortization as you know, and most of our business was sold 2005, 2006 and 2007. So the countries, if you like, for us will be a couple of years out. I don't have the percentage but that means the percentage of those policies that are in amortization is by far the minority of the money. That's why we're not claiming victory yet. But if you remember on that slide, we were looking at less than 1% rates so far and those who are eligible and will be reserving at the five level, so we're pretty conservative on reserving, but we'll have to wait until the 10 years period is up to be certain on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

          <p>So kind of peak year is tied from 2015 onward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In terms of the volumes, if you look around. I don't think it's the right way to look at it. First, we've started to sell VAs with secondary benefits in &#x2013; we are the first one which started in 1996. So we have probably the biggest mature book of the industry. And even the oldest generation, we don't see changing patterns in terms of amortization. And as I indicated before, the customer has an interest, an objective interest in continuing to hold his or her policy because he continues &#x2013; he or she continues to benefit from both IB and DB where as they lose their benefit. So I mean frankly, I know it's a theme that is recurring with the investors, but I stood very quietly over this same integration risks. Actually that's not what keeps us awake at night.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we did get some guidance if the rates, what do you think is the rate? The <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:30) would be much <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:32).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To Denis' point, there is a natural hedge between those policyholders who take income benefit and the death benefit side. Policyholders cannot elect for both. And we gave some guidance on the &#x2013; even if those, the reserving rates were to double, it would be &#x20AC;150 million. So it's not a major issue for us. <mark type="ph" /> Andrew (1:03:00)?</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:03:05) Citi. I just had a couple of questions. The first one on economic capital, I saw in the sensitivity that all the change in economic capital said that it incorporates corporates bonds spreads net of liquidity premium. But clearly, <mark type="ph" /> in the EV (1:03:22) there's been a jump in the liquidity premium from &#x20AC;1.7 billion to &#x20AC;8.5 billion odd, so I was wondering does that hone the economic capital and what kinds of impact does it have on economic capital in terms of points?</p>
          <p>The second question is just a clarification on economic capital. The sensitivity is clearly higher than that at first half 2011. So clearly, I guess, this is because you're getting sensitivity in the market levels, which are much lower interest  rates and equities, I guess, that's the reason. Or if there's something else going on that would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And the last one is unfortunately, U.S. VA, looking a bit simple. I was wondering when the reserving is moved to the actual experience, what is the data lag in the experience analysis when you get actual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the lag in the data? So, for example, if you look at last year, you had U.S. interest rates &#x2013; U.S. 10-year yields falls 15 bps in the first half, about 120 bps in the second half, so if you have data just for first half probably it's not representative of lapse behavior in the second half, just checking. So I was just wondering what is the cut-off date? And whether you expect that to be a factor at all?</p>
          <p>And second one was on Page 52, very helpful information in terms of the sensitivity to markets and capital consumption on the different products, I was wondering that's for new business, could you give us a rough split of how the back book would look in those three &#x2013; across those three buckets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Good. On the economic capital <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:10) we want to take the liquidity premium? Okay. To be sure, in terms of liquidity premium that we have been using for the economic capital is in line with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:24) relative that it should be 108 basis points. That's the level and &#x2013; so I think that's as you know that the formula if we start, which means that it's a 50% of the spread of an index of corporate bonds minus 40 basis points. That's the formula. And we have been consistently applying this formula, again who knows exactly what will be the end rule, as mentioned by Denis before, but that's what we are doing, so it's consistent.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just to be sure, in terms of impact, therefore, it will be exactly the &#x20AC;6.6 billion difference that you saw in liquidity premiumin EV?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in terms of available capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And just on the VA point by the time lag, our reserving is right up to the end of December, so there's no time lag on that particular point. And then the split of the back book &#x2013; we'll come back to you on that point. I don't have it at hand. We'll come back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Three questions in different areas, one, just a follow-up on that. Given the range those which are currently occurring on the countercyclical premium, there must be a potential on the 72 to lose quite a large chunk of that liquidity premium, which you currently account for your economic capital. I wonder if you could give us some sense of that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, moving to U.S. but the different side of it, it appears that the new big thing in terms of third-party sale is Indexed Universal Life product, could you give us a sense of the margins, the IRRs payback some of that versus and what the major risks are there, so that we then get all primed up for that?</p>
          <p>And then finally &#x2013; understand what's going on, and finally, in terms of M&amp;A, I assume that you must being offered quite a few things to be rescued in the old world. And I've got cheap prices I would hope, but you say &#x2013;  you've expressed the desire to do M&amp;A in the new world in the growth markets. How are you thinking about that balance in the current market conditions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the vehicle &#x2013; your question on vehicle when we get to the economic capital because it goes back to the previous question. It means that &#x2013; you said that it will be a negative. It could be a negative or positive because in fact we should take it, and we should think about the mismatch which is this today. I explained the liquidity premium and mostly, the liquidity premium is a direct function of the evolution of the corporate spread.</p>
          <p>But you imagine a company, but there, let's say, 50% sovereign bonds and 50% are price spreads. There is a mismatch there. Imagine that a German company real benefit from the existing liquidity premium, whereas the Italian company would be penalized by such a situation because the loss of value on the asset side really in terms balance or actually stuck in terms of balance by this liquidity premium. And that solves the issue and all the, I would say, those discussions on liquidity premium are around this, meaning that the rate is being built, the liquidity premium it will -focusing at the beginning exclusively on the corporate bond side and not on the global evolution, and to be clear, the regulator didn't think about the present sovereign debt crisis, so that's the issue. I think that countercyclical premium and you will see how these discussions will go. But the countercyclical premium should be, I would say, a mix between the evolution of the sovereign debt spread and of the corporate bonds. That's not to be done yet, so we should remain extremely cautious, and that's why presently we are using the traditional liquidity premium.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, this is a pretty good time in spreads, so it offers accumulation benefit. It's a simple design that gives investors the opportunity to link to major industries worth of cap and that provides downside protection to 0%. It's &#x2013; the volume coming in is because to be frank we're back in the third party market. We've been quite for a  number of years, we're back in there. We do have an IUL that is simply to sell them any of our competitors as I've just explained to you. Because it's sold to the third party, it's obviously price competitive, so the IRR they are slightly lower than other book average they coming at around 9%, and the new business revenue margins is 22% on that particular product. But obviously, with those caps and downs are protection, we can match the exposure buying the corporate instruments there as well. So I hope there's no need to be ready as you say</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why is that product is at 9% IRR?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:11:18) margin is 22%, IRRs at 9%, our total book is about 11% in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe an additional point, yes, it's relatively low IRR but you need to look at it in the context of an overall book of business. And there is more benefit overall in the diversification that we get here than &#x2013; so if you want to sell higher IRR products, you would probably elect to sell mainly VAs as we are tending to diversify away from VA. We have to accept in the short term slightly lower IRRs. Our IRR is slightly depressed because we still have a customer issue in the U.S. because we have expanded fast and then contracted relatively fast. So we believe that this IRR will improve over time as we have a better handle in our unit cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the decline there, at the same time, since the indexed unit-linked which means that it's indirectly indexed on the equity market. So we are taking the management case of measuring the profitability in terms of internal rate of return, which is quite modest. I think that we are assuming the growth of the equity markets like-for-like something like 6% in there. So it highly depends on the final growth of the equity market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the last part of your question, we are maybe the Red Cross in the developed world. Now the latest new rich in the emerging one, meaning that when we say we are selective, we have never said that we would not buy anything in the major countries. What we have said is that we would buy only things, which are giving us growth and good margins. But we are fairly not going to be the Red Cross in the developed markets, meaning, buying these first businesses because the police is asking us to do so. Okay? If we buy, it's because we are bottom fishers.</p>
          <p>The other side of the point is in the developed world, we are not ready to pay outrageous multiples just because we want to expand. We are extremely conscious of the fact given the multiple at which we operated, we cannot afford to waste our cash overpaying for acquisitions in the emerging. We want to expand in the emerging. We want to buy things at reasonable conditions. Is this clear?</p>

          <p>Hi, there. Colin Simpson from Goldman. Just two questions please, you mentioned this ECB liquidity facility. I wonder whether &#x2013; the consequence of an &#x2013; it's really on into the banking system if there's a smaller pool of corporate bank corporate debt. And because you earned so much of it, I wonder whether you see some of that retiring and the need to reinvest somewhere. I mean, where do you think you would invest and do you agree with that thesis?</p>
          <p>And the second point really I'm afraid is on the USA. Year-to-date, do you have a positive, negative of the hedged margin? And how your lapse assumption is running?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You should have taken a bet on the first part of your question because we were convinced this would come. G&#xE9;rald, you want to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Going back to the slide presented to you, we, first of all, we don't invest. It's extremely marginal but presently, we don't invest in senior sanctioned bonds. Why? Because there are much value in corporate bonds that brings much more classification. We have some investment in secured bonds but &#x2013; and there is still some need for banks to issue secured bonds. So that means that we don't have plan for investment into 2011 doesn't rely as a significant level of new issues in terms of financial bonds. But we are not so much &#x2013; we are not at all &#x2013; at least on that side.</p>

          <p>Just in the start of the year, obviously, the investment market speaking of volatility been a lot quite within last year. So we are ahead of our budget for the first month of the year and on the second part of your question on lapses, no significant change.</p>

          <p>Hi, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:16:22) again on your charted net financial debt, obviously, that's gone down a lot &#x20AC;30.4 billion and now you have &#x20AC;4.5 billion of cash, how much of that cash is free for acquisitions or reinvestment?</p>
