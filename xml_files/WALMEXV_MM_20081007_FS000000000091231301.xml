          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Here with me are Eduardo Solorzano, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Scot Rank, our Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>I would like to start this conference by saying that in the current economic environment, we continue, as always, to invest and work with our long-term vision. Our cash generation and a strong balance sheet allow us to continue strongly investing in prices, opening new stores of our different formats, remodeling existing stores and expanding distribution capabilities.</p>
          <p>Now, regarding the quarter, I will briefly mention how the environment is affecting sales growth. And then Eduardo and Scot will go into the details of what we're doing in this environment.</p>
          <p>First, the slowdown of the economy. The implication of our business is that we are seeing more discretionary spending and the formats that are being more affected are Suburbia and Vips. Consumer credit provided by all the banks have come down and is showing declines compared to double-digit growth last year. This has a direct effect on our business, being Suburbia the most affected.</p>
          <p>Talking about consumer confidence, customers are not only constrained financially, but consumer confidence has been affected. And it is at the lowest level since it started being recorded. This is something that certainly affects high-ticket items' purchases at our stores.</p>
          <p>Customers are pulling back their spending in non-food areas such as clothing and general merchandise. And we have to remember that 50% of our mix is non-food and that we have higher exposure to the slowdown than the rest of the market.</p>
          <p>Finally, regarding sales, it is important to mention the calendar effect that we had in September. Two weekend days less than during 2007. When you look at the underlying trend in weeks, though, September was better than August with 3.8% versus a 3.3% comp stores growth.</p>
          <p>Now, about the results for the quarter, I would highlight the following. In the case of gross margin, we reported improvement in gross margin despite the mixed format as more discretionary formats, Suburbia and Vips that have higher margins continued to be underperformed and despite the investment in prices.</p>
          <p>In the case of inventories, they are at a very healthy level. Total inventory was 1% below last year and average inventory per store was down 9.2%. Return on equity for the last 12 months to September was 25% while return on capital employed was 27.4%.</p>
          <p>Now, I am pleased to have Scot Rank here with us. And I will request him so that he comment us on the results for the quarter.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Rafael. It's a pleasure to be here and thanks to all of you for listening to this call. I will talk about what we're doing in this environment basically regarding sales, gross margin and general expenses.</p>
          <p>First, sales. Throughout the year, we have focused on increasing customer loyalty and driving traffic with three basic strategies: increasing our price advantage, winning in perishables and leveraging our superior holiday merchandise.</p>
          <p>Let's start with prices. For the first seven and a half months of 2008, we made significant improvements to our competitive position by increasing the price gap versus the rest of the market. For four weeks, we let our advantage slip and we paid the price in lost sales. With the support of our suppliers and through operating efficiencies, we corrected the situation. And going into the fourth quarter, we had the largest price advantage that we have had in nearly five years. I think that in these economic times, our customers will appreciate everyday low prices more than ever.</p>
          <p>Perishables. This year we improved the quality and lowered the price of our perishables and our volume is growing in double digits. The combination of EDLP across the store and more value in perishables continues to drive traffic across most of our formats. By increasing direct purchases from the field, we are being able to improve value to our customers while maintaining our margins.</p>
          <p>Seasonal merchandise, back to school was somewhat below our expectations, but we learned a lot and you will see major changes to our fourth quarter holiday program that will allow us to leverage more than ever the global sourcing of holiday merchandise.</p>
          <p>Aligned with our three core strategies, we've launched a number of new tactics to better communicate the value that we offer to our customers and to drive sales. Let me give you a couple of examples. Bodega Aurrera, for example recently reinforced a program called the one peso, two peso, three peso program. These offer top selling perishables at between one to three pesos for seven days. Consumer response has been fantastic.</p>
          <p>At Supercenter and Superama, we just implemented a new point of sale system that allows us to offer savings when a customer buys more units of the same item. We are using it to reward loyalty and encourage pantry loading. We just launched this program which is called Superauros in Wal-Mart or Supersavings in Superama and this now gives us a unique promotional vehicle that complements EDLT for the middle and upper income customer that shop at Supercenter and Superama.</p>
          <p>Sam's Club has always had the best prices in Mexico. But now we are communicating the value of the membership by comparing prices with the competition. We call it membership value pricing and sales and club memberships have responded positively.</p>
          <p>Credit is key to sales at Suburbia, and we just re-launched the Suburbia credit card with a 5% bonus for all purchases made through the end of the year. In addition to this, we've added new features to the card including a deferred annual fee and the ability to obtain additional cards or replacements at no extra cost.</p>
          <p>At Vips, we just launched the new Vips 45 peso menu for breakfast and dinners from Monday through Friday. Customers get a complete meal with full service at fast food prices. Vips can maintain its margins, drive sales and leverage its fixed costs. These new programs and others will be supported by significant advertising investment.</p>
          <p>The results so far of our three core strategies are reflected in customer traffic. This year customer count in comparable stores has grown 4.8%. And if we consider only self-service formats, the growth has been 6.4%.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk a little bit about gross margin. I am very happy with what we have achieved in terms of gross margins. It increased 20 basis points during the quarter despite the drop in sales of our higher margin formats, Suburbia and Vips, and despite the investment we made in price competitiveness. The improvement in margin was driven by efficiencies, strong improvements in inventory management and also efficiencies we have been able to negotiate with suppliers. We have reduced markdowns, reduced inventory levels and reduced shrink.</p>
          <p>Now talking about expenses, given the slowdown in sales, our greatest challenge during the quarter was expenses. I think we did a good job of expenses except for two important line items, remodels and utilities.</p>
          <p>The remodeling expense grew 47% in September. What happened is we have obtained licenses to perform parking lot expansions and major retrofits. And we decided to move forward with these investments despite the short-term economic conditions and the effect it had in third quarter results because we believe this is the best decision for the medium term.</p>
          <p>In the case of utilities, our utility expenses grew 51% in September, and specifically this is related to electricity costs. This came both from higher prices of energy as well as the incremental cost of having to rent diesel plants to supply energy to our new stores. These plants are rented for an average of four to five months before we can connect to a public network.</p>
          <p>In the case of energy we are working in the following areas. One, we are reducing the period of time that we need to rent energy plants by working closely with the Secretary of Energy and the energy suppliers. We are improving our prototypes to have more energy efficient stores. We have a cogeneration energy project in Oaxaca that will come on line next year. And we are also working with suppliers to drive energy efficiencies in equipment that they have in our stores.</p>
          <p>If we take out the increases in utilities and remodels, expenses for the retail business in the third quarter would have grown 9.4% compared with a 10.2% increase in sales. I think you would agree with me, Eduardo, that we continue with our discipline with regard to expenses and it should allow us to continue to improve our position in the long term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Scot, and I completely agree with you. Welcome, everybody and good afternoon to everybody. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. And I will share my views of what we are doing at Wal-Mart de Mexico.</p>
          <p>And I think this is a big opportunity for us because I believe that we have very strong financials in our company and these give us the opportunity in order to move ahead into the market.</p>
          <p>As Rafael say, we have a strong balance sheet that will give us a lot of flexibility. And I believe this flexibility will act in our advantage because I believe that this will allow us to have a much better performance compared with the market.</p>
          <p>We would be focusing in the following. First, we will try to regain a bit of the top line growth. So we want to keep our eyes in that in order to improve it. And the objective that we have in this environment is that our shares will grow above the market.</p>
          <p>In order to achieve that, first, we are going to continue strongly investment in prices. I believe prices are key from now on because clearly our customer will have less money in their pockets and we believe that they have to feel that we are on their side and we will continue investing in prices.</p>
          <p>Our most important season is about to start. We believe holiday season we are getting ready and we are ready for that season. In order to have a very good season, we are prepared for that. I believe that now that we are very lean in term of inventory this will allow us to have a very good season that is just about to start.</p>
          <p>We have decided that each of our formats, we have a very detailed program or plan in order to achieve the sales goal and we have by week goals that we have set for each of our formats. So these I believe will help us in order to align and to have a clear direction for the organization in the sense that everybody will know what to do in the following weeks.</p>
          <p>Of course, no details about these plans will be shared a bit later with you because, as you imagine, this is something that we cannot share just because I mean this is part of our plan. And we don't want that our competition will be aware of what we are going to do.</p>
          <p>Inventories is also very critical. We believe that inventory is something that we need to continue to improve our position in inventories and to improve our inventory management. These I believe will give us more flexibility in the market, will allow us to take some advantages about the market because we believe that there will be some bargains into the market and some of merchandise and we can acquire that merchandise in order to have a much value added product to our customers. And as well, it will help us in order to improve our shrinkage, which is very important to reduce our liability because of markdowns, because of excess of inventories that we may have.</p>
          <p>Expenses, as you know, also will be very important. We are a very well disciplined company in term of expenses. We used to mange very well our expenses and we will be continuing investment and search for efficiencies into the company that will allow us to continue to have the lowest structured cost in the market. And we believe that having the lowest cost to operate the business will give us some advantages that we have to take full advantage of them.</p>
          <p>Then also, people is critical for us. We will continue to reinforcing our management. I believe that we have the talent that we need to run our business under the existing circumstances and to execute our strategies and to achieve all the efficiencies that we have set as a goal. The result-oriented management team that have experience in dealing with difficult economic environment is clear in our case.</p>
          <p>Finally, suppliers will be our next goal. And we will focus to develop a very good business or a very strong business with our talented suppliers. And we'll be continuing to work with them in order to try to drive more efficiencies.</p>
          <p>We believe that this is time to take care of our customers and that in the first and most important step for taking care of all of our shareholders. And we also continue our social responsibility activities.</p>
          <p>Now Rafael, I think you have some additional comments before ending the conference call.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to comment that we continue with our multi-format expansion program. As of today, we have opened 85 units including 12 Bodega Aurrera, 18 Mi Bodega Aurrera, 24 Bodega Aurrera Express, 11 Wal-Mart Supercenters, three Sam's, two Superamas, four Suburbia and 11 restaurants.</p>
          <p>Our cash position as of the end of the third quarter amounted to 7.4 billion pesos. This is equivalent to $677 million. And this is after our investment so far this year of 7.7 billion pesos in fixed assets, a dividend payment of 3.2 billion pesos, 2.1 billion pesos for repurchasing of 53.7 million shares. As always, we invest our excess cash in a conservative way. And we will keep our policy of investing this cash on a very conservative way, always taking into account the security of the funds.</p>
          <p>Regarding Banco Wal-Mart, we'll continue running the business with prudence, as we have done so far.</p>
          <p>With this, we are now ending our conference call. And I remind you that we will be available to receive any calls with questions that you may have. Thank you very much.</p>
