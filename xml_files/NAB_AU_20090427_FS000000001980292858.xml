        <plist>
          <p>[Abrupt start]...New Zealand was a solid performance. It's up 7.5% sequentially reflecting about 6% volume growth and a 3% reduction in costs in the half and that is a market that is experiencing significant NIM pressure from heightened competition on the deposit side, but nevertheless managed to deliver a 7.5% up. I would say that current volumes and volume projections are substantially lower than the 6% we experienced between the average balance sheets in this period.</p>
          <p>And then finally nabCapital, which was very strong obviously the numbers are a little lumpy based on market conditions and we also took some costs in the September '08 associated with the risk mitigation trades. But nabCapital was very strong, markets areas saw volumes, margins and the benefit of holding positions all substantially positive and it also is now about 30% of the way repricing its institutional book at substantially higher margins and all of that has been achieved. This is the one business where we have constraint on balance sheet growth. So nabCapital delivering a large increase sequentially within clearly of where it was a year ago.</p>
          <p>Then just turning down to the cash earnings level, obviously the only thing we really encounter going down to that level of substance is what's going on, on the bad and doubtful debts side. Cameron has already given you some thoughts on that. And it's enough to turn all of these franchises negative. So if you look down sequential BPA minus six, retail minus five, MLC is not affected. U.K., big increase in bad and doubtful debts. There, as many people anticipated are taking the profitability down to &#xA3;50 million. And also in the case of nabCapital which is the business that has seen the bad debts come through earliest in this cycle as you read about in the newspapers all the time.</p>
          <p>So let me go on, review a couple of other things at the Group level and then touch on the businesses. You are familiar many of you with this slide on the Jaws and cost to income momentum. At the top there you see the Group cost to income over the last two years falling from 51.8 through 47 to 43.4%. You see the maintenance of the Jaws in this particular period 6.7% positive Jaws. And then, down the bottom a little reconciliation which takes out the FX effects and the consolidation of GWB showing a 2.7 cost growth in the period. And we're still comfortable with our guidance on cost. Albeit, that we softened it a little bit in the strategy update with respect to one-off cost.</p>
          <p>Turning over the page to investment spend, you'll see we're continuing to invest in the business. We had $331 million of projects expenditure in the first half. We always have this first half, second half issue where projects get approved and started up in the first half, so the spend is typically higher in the second. But you'll see there that the spend 331 is roughly in line with a year ago. And you'll see a pleasing downward trend in compliance projects, leaving room for more efficiency and revenue generating projects. And this expenditure does include our spend thus far on New Bank, which is the initial pilot around our next generation banking platform.</p>
          <p>Okay. Let me just take you through each of the franchises. And for the banking ones I've really just got these two slides showing the main drivers and then a little bit of an exposition on NIM. So for the Australian Bank, you can see business lending growing 8.1% between the average balance sheets over this period. Obviously, sector growth in business is trending towards zero and the outlook is for minus 5% growth next year but this business is growing substantially above system. Continuing to take share and continuing to benefit from good margins.</p>
          <p>On the retail deposit side, it's difficult to know whether it's above or below system but in any case it's a substantial increase in the deposit base, up nearly 12% in the half and the customer funding index of the Australian Bank is now 54% and traditionally had been in the high 40s.</p>
          <p>And then on the retail lending side, much less substantial growth partly because of some &#x2013; partly because our mortgage business has being growing about 0.5 times system, which reflects partly where activity is the market and partly work we've doing on our broker business and so we do expect that to pick up in the second half.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the cost-to-income ratio for the Australian Bank is &#x2013; continues its strong downward trend, and it now 39% despite a $25 million increase in costs and the NIM as I said before is pretty much being sustained around the 250 basis point mark.</p>
          <p>And then just on the next page, just to give you a sense of the ins and outs on the NIM. You can see there, the improved contribution on the lending front, which reflects pricing over and above higher input costs almost exclusively in the business bank, reflecting pricing for risk in the current environment and you can see the emergence of lower contribution from deposits, which is partly competition but actually more just a function of the lower interest rate environment reducing the value of things such as free funds. And essentially, they are the items, which explain the movement in the Australian NIM.</p>
          <p>The issues going forward will be that we'll still have cheap wholesale funding, which is yet to mature and roll off and so we will need to stay on our toes about passing through those higher costs as they come, and sometimes, there is a lag in doing that. And secondly, we don't expect that we are at the bottom of the interest rate cycle, so the contribution from deposits is likely to come under further pressure and I'm sure every bank is committing itself to grow its deposits base as aggressively as it can.</p>
          <p>Turning then to MLC and just to give you a sense of this business, you can see and it won't surprise you in the top left hand corner, the significant drop in funds under management. To some extent there are negative net flows associated with people taking money out, which is not surprising in this environment but substantially it's a function of investment earnings. And so that translates directly through to revenue. We have seen a slight up-tick in margin in this business but pretty much that is the shape of the contribution to the revenue side.</p>
          <p>Lower down you will see that the insurance business continues to move forward with the premiums inforce continuing to grow fairly consistent with the long run trend of about 11%. And you will see in the top right that the business has also continued its progressive work on the cost front with MLC taking $14 million out of its cost base in the current half.</p>
          <p>All of that washes up in terms of the cash earnings that have much reduced contribution on the investment side and we'll have to see equity markets in particular turnaround before that will begin to move in the other direction. There is a little bit of volatility in the insurance side to do with some mark-to-market gains, and then the reversal of those gains in some of the assets that reflect the investment of reserves. But otherwise, there is a slight up-tick in the claims experience in the business, which is what we normally see in an economic downturn, but it's not a marked up turn at this stage.</p>
          <p>I think this is a very difficult environment for the wealth business, but it is an environment where the strengths of MLC do come to the fore. It has no exposure to the very low margin platform type businesses, which are clearly under some pressure. We've already seen a couple of players try and exit that market. It's had none of its funds frozen through this period reflecting conservatism in the construct of its products. It still &#x2013; it has the leading position on transparency and customer efficacy, which is rapidly, looks like becoming government and regulatory &#x2013; part of government and regulatory focus. And its flagship funds continue to outperform peers the majority of the time.</p>
          <p>Okay, turning then to the U.K. Similar chart to the Australian. You can see this franchise still being open for business. On the business side 6.7% growth in the average balance sheet between these periods. It is eminently sensible to be open for business, I mean, the U.K. has clearly put quite stringent criteria around the new loans that it will write but our priority is to create a bigger back book against the iFS centers in the South in particular, because that is the path to raising there ROE. So we are open for business there. We are getting very attractive front book margins in doing that, but we are very careful about the business that we write.</p>
          <p>This business has also experienced pretty strong retail deposit flows, particularly in Scotland, and is now operating I think at a 76% customer funding index and has a stable funding index of over 97%. And by the way it's only 6% funded out of net. So it substantially stands on its own two feet.</p>
          <p>Retail lending growth is much lower than that just reflecting the weakness in consumer sentiment and housing activity in the U.K.</p>
          <p>On the cost front faced, as I had said before, with substantial headwind from basis risk and unrecovered funding cost of &#xA3;80 million, the management team went to work on the costs particularly hard taking out &#xA3;34 million in the half and managing to sustaining the cost to income ratio at just over 57% in that business.</p>
          <p>And then on the net interest margin, you can see there a significant reduction in net interest margin. This is not indicative of product margins. As you see on the next slide, as we go there, again, you see a similar picture, an improved contribution on the lending side from front book and repricing activities, a drain on the deposit side, partly from competition but also U.K. interest rates are extraordinarily low, and then you see a 41 basis point drain from these unrecovered funding cost reflecting basis risk and the like and which the business is now working hard to address, indeed has already addressed to some degree.</p>
          <p>And also we clearly went through a very significant peak, particularly November-December, around the relationship between LIBOR and base rate when there was considerable concern for the banking system and we've since seen those spreads settle down. So as I said before, we hope that we are past the peak of that.</p>
          <p>The average LIBOR, three months LIBOR rolling to base rate spread was 207 basis points over the period, and I think the long-run average was more like 18 basis points. So you can see if that comes upon you very quickly, it's difficult to deal with on a timely basis. Lynne will have more to say about that this afternoon.</p>
          <p>Moving on to New Zealand, similar story, you see a strong growth in business lending. As I say, don't expect that to continue, it will definitely soften from hereon. This business tried to stand aside from the really aggressive competition on deposits and protect its book rather than grow it aggressively. You may see others growing stronger there but it was really trying to stay out of the hot money end of activity. And then you can see also like the U.K. very modest lending growth on the retail side, reflecting the state of the economy, which is clearly and has been for some time in recession.</p>
          <p>Management, similar theme, turned our attention even harder to cost. This business has a long track record now, eight halves of flat or declining costs, took a further 10 million out of the cost base, so it brought the cost to income ratio of the New Zealand business down to 44.7%. And then you &#x2013; and on the bottom right you can see the continuing deterioration in NIM.</p>
          <p>And then just turning to the NIM picture and there are a couple of other dynamics here. One, similar degree of contribution from working at the repricing in the business bank, an increase of 14 basis points. In New Zealand much more aggressive competition around deposits, leading to a 28-basis point decay. And then a couple of extra things, we have what we call an ERC benefit there, which is fees charged to customers for getting out of fixed-rate mortgages. Unfortunately under the accounting convention we have to bring that to profit today, but the economic costs associated with the run off of the associated hedges will actually accrue over the next couple of years. So that may turn from a 10 basis point positive in this half to something like an 8 basis point negative in the next half and then fairly neutral thereafter. But so don't be surprised if you see that next time.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, we have the cost of the government guarantee and some additional liquidity in that franchise taking another six basis points. But the trend is down in net interest margin in New Zealand.</p>
          <p>And then finally to nabCapital and then we'll go back to the Group level and look at asset quality and capital and the like. In nabCapital, you can see that the underlying profit trend with a bit of a hiccup in September '08 associated in part with some of the risk mitigation trades, but nevertheless strong upward trend in underlying profit.</p>
          <p>You can see in the top right, the importance to that of the contribution from the markets business, which was up nearly 100% in its revenue. If you look in the bottom left, the vast majority of that relates to foreign exchange trading and interest rate derivatives. And you all know there have been marked corrections in both of those markets over this period, with clearly discernible trends, high volatility and therefore a lot of interest amongst the customer base to manage their exposure in these markets. At the same time, we found a relaxing of spreads that were available to us in this activity and with clearly discernible trends the holding of positions which we tend to do only on an intraday basis. We don't take substantial positions for any length of time. But holding of positions even for a few hours also contributes substantially to the revenue. So very strong on the markets performance.</p>
          <p>You can see progress, particularly in the institutional lending book around repricing and the front book ROEs are at least double what the back book ROEs are in this sector. I said we're 30% of the way through repricing.</p>
          <p>In the structuring and investments area, that has turned negative on revenue and that's partly an inability to price some of the assets that are relevant to that part, but also that business picks up the mark-to-market accounting around the risk mitigation trades, which through a widening in spreads was a mark-to-market loss in the period. It is also where we are amortizing the premium on the risk mitigation trades and it's also where we've put through $160 million overlay as negative revenue to create a collective provision generally pointed at the conduit assets and the associated derivatives. So that explains about a $300 million swing in the revenue of that business. And all of that is being achieved without, as I said, growing the nabCapital balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So if you go over a couple of pages to the provisions and the coverage. There is no new news. Top left, you've seen already the increase in bad and doubtful debts, which excluding the CDOs is a substantial increase in the period. You can see how the charge on the top right is attributable to the various businesses and it's nabCapital the Australian Bank and the U.K. all experiencing a quite an uplift there.</p>
          <p>And then on the bottom left you can see what we've done to collective provision balances up nearly $1 billion and the specifics up about 700 million as well in the period and we've separated out the singles names where specific provisions are greater than 25 million to give you a sense of the contribution coming from that.</p>
          <p>Our specific provision to impaired ratio is I think 33.5% reflecting of course full provisioning against its each situation based on the expected scenario and security realization. So that's the coverage there.</p>
          <p>And then on the bottom right, you can see what &#x2013; you can see a couple of the coverage ratios. One is the collective &#x2013; and importantly the collective provisions as a percent of the credit risk-weighted assets ex housing, which is the one that has outstripped the growth in the credit RWAs to be at 1.38%. And then you have total provisions to GLA, which is also trending up substantially. So it's all part of anticipating what the cycle may bring that's not obviously apparent in the portfolio today.</p>
          <p>And then to give you just a sense of the state of the Group portfolio on the next page, a couple of things you already know. One is the diversity of the portfolio with the high proportion of housing, lending and in all our markets, housing lending continues to be a very high quality asset class and the geographic mix is there for you as well.</p>
          <p>On the top right, we have seen some decay in the amount of non-retail exposure, which is investment grade down from 77% to 74%. Importantly, I think in the top left, I did this for the first time last time to give you a sense of the watch loans. It's worth nothing that nab has a fairly &#x2013; has a bias towards bringing clients into watch early. So it's not necessarily comparable between institutions, if you look at what's going on in watch loans. But we have a bias towards early detection and working with customers. So while it may not be comparable across institutions it is nevertheless comparable through time. And you can see in all the franchises the proportion of the GL&amp;A which we are working closely with, is rising. In some cases quite steeply, in particular nabCapital. But also you'll see a marked up-tick there in the U.K.</p>
          <p>And then the bottom right gives you what's going on in impaired and 90 day past dues, and pretty much the real drivers of that are coming out of the business portfolio not yet out of the retail portfolio.</p>
          <p>Now just to give you some 90 day past due statistics, for the Australian Bank, sequentially, it has gone from 0.41 to 0.53. In the U.K., it's gone from 0.46 to 0.71, and in New Zealand it's gone from 0.2 to 0.31. So coming off a low base in New Zealand. And the average ECERS score, which is our credit scoring scale in the business bank in Australia as a measure of what's going on in the part of the portfolio that has not become impaired. The average has moved 20 basis points from 13.8 to 14 on a 25 point scale. So it's not that the whole portfolio is shifting markedly one way, but we are seeing more people fall off the end into impairment.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the nabCapital conduit portfolio and you'll find lots of disclosure in the MD&amp;A on conduit assets and further slides at the back as well, for those of you who want to go through it in detail.</p>
          <p>Generally, speaking with respect to the conduit portfolio, there is little change in the first half '09. There were no impairments. There is little or no change in subordination levels. There has been some ratings migration. The rating agencies constantly review their methodologies and downgrade various types of assets. We'd be managing the thing to our internal ratings rather than the external ratings <mark type="inaudible" /> requires you to access the capital in provisioning based on the lower of internal and external. And our internal have been consistently lower. Nevertheless on the internal ratings scale 97% of the conduit assets are investment grade.</p>
          <p>The rating agencies have announced further review of methodology, which we think are just going to likely to bring the external ratings into line with the internal ratings. So we don't think that will change anything.</p>
          <p>And as I said before we have taken $160 million overlay generally pointed at the conduits and associated derivatives to reflect the deteriorating economic conditions because while we can't see anything in their at the moment, the longer this goes on and the more severe the global economy becomes, the more likelihood that something at least will get effected.</p>
          <p>On the SCDOs in particular where we took out the risk mitigation trades, there was one credit event in the first half of '09. So if you remember these structures point a various aggregations of 400 names in a pool. So there was one credit event in that pool, which constitutes one step towards default or one step of loss of subordination. But that didn't have any impact on provisioning or any such thing.</p>
          <p>There was a large scale negative ratings migration in this portfolio in March, where things came down. But again, it's the same story where pretty much it was bringing things down towards the way we're already treating them internally. So only one of these instruments remains AAA, the rest are between AA+ and BBB+. And we are conscious that there are other names in the 400 name pool that are experiencing some stress, so we wouldn't be surprised to see some other names in the pool get into difficulty, which is all part of why we took out the risk mitigation trades in the first place to move ourselves substantially away from those attachment points.</p>
          <p>We're now trying to manage this pool not to hold it at AAA, which seems to be an extreme thing to do but to hold these to investment grade. And so we will consider from time-to-time whether we want to do small top ups around the risk mitigation in order to achieve that and make sure they don't became an issue on capital or provisioning.</p>
          <p>Let me finish up by taking you through the rest of the balance sheet in terms of capital and funding. First of all, on the slide heading credit RWA movement, we have a roll forward of what's been going on in the credit RWAs. And you'll see there three things of materiality: One is the growth in the portfolio which is partly the activity in the balance sheets of the franchisees we've been talking on the way through and partly more credit RWAs associated with higher activity in the markets business. You'll see there 16.8 billion or 40 basis points deterioration to do with the credit quality of the portfolio. So that is what you might call the pro-cyclicality that we've experienced in the period. And then on the right hand side, you see the net optimization in the period. We actually released about $16 billion of our RWAs, and then there were some methodology changes imposed that took up about four of that, which gave us 28 basis points of relief.</p>
          <p>So this brings the aggregate level, the RWAs that we've thus far released post-transition to Basel II to about 40 billion, and we have a substantial number of initiatives still on our plate that we're working through in the second half. So we hope to benefit from further net optimization in the second half. So all of that combined to keep the growth in Credit RWAs pretty much in check.</p>
          <p>And then if you move on to the Tier 1 capital position. There are a couple of things to draw out here. First of all, as we said before we have &#x2013; we finished up the period at a strong Tier 1 capital ratio, 8.31. Importantly, 6.59 of it being core Tier 1, and particularly foreign investors are quite interested in core less than Tier 1 &#x2013; pure Tier 1.</p>
          <p>Obviously, that movement from 7.35 six months ago is a function of the capital raisings that were undertaken. Although, there are a couple of headwinds we just reviewed the credit RWAs. And the U.K. pension has switched into deficit which cost about seven basis points. And I guess the other factor in there is the cut in the dividend, which allows us to retain more capital.</p>
          <p>We have decided to do a partial underwrite of the DRP to bring back an additional 500 million, which will top us up to 8.45%. This is not an aggressive capital raising it just shows our bias to continue to take a small opportunities to contribute to the capital base as they present, while the environment remains particularly uncertain. I think once this becomes a very predictable cycle we will review our capital and perhaps be comfortable taking it substantially lower. Although that will depend on where market precedent and regulatory debate is settled by that time.</p>
          <p>We will, of course, also turn our attention to our quite substantial hybrid capacity in the second half and see if we can get some hybrid issuance going, which we anticipate will be easier in a low interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>And then finally on funding and liquidity, we've maintained pretty much our strong position. The Bank's Stable Funding Index now 76% with the customer contribution to that being 57%. We've pretty much nailed our term funding requirement for the year in the first half. The vast majority of that under the government guarantee. We will of course go pass 19 billion as opportunities present to take any pressure out of next year. Although we do anticipate that the term funding task next year will be higher, but not materially higher than the term funding requirement this year.</p>
          <p>And in the bottom right, you can see that we are still trying as much as possible to err on the side of loan maturities and those things. And at the top, mainly through continued cooling of mortgages into internal securitization trusts continuing to build the short-term liquidity holdings and potential of the Group now sitting at $87 billion.</p>
          <p>So in summary, as I said, I think &#x2013; we think it's creditable given what the world has thrown at the banking system and the result that was delivered today was net of some conscious investment in the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Second half revenue will have some positives and negatives. Positives around continued momentum and repricing and also the potential to continue to write business, subject to how we want to commit our capital. The headwinds will probably be the sector growth rates won't be that great and the markets business is unlikely to perform absolutely as strongly as it has in this half. And of course BDD, by no means are we saying we are at the bottom of the cycle on that. So in all likelihood, we will have one-half, maybe two-halves of high BDDs, but who knows given all the uncertainty in the world.</p>
          <p>Our priority through all of this, as John Stewart said, was to keep the bank safe and that is really our number one priority. So we are staying strong on capital, strong on funding and liquidity and taking measured response to events as they present.</p>
          <p>Anyway, so with that and it sounds like we've got microphones, maybe we would take some of your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Craig Williams from Citi here. You noted at the moment Cameron in your opening address that business lending is contracting at present. Australian banks have the highest loan to deposit ratios of any non-nationalized banks around the world at the moment, which suggest a pre-subdued outlook for credit in the medium term as well. And already you have the largest business banking distribution base. So why the need for 155 new business bankers? Is this a necessary investment? Is their focus going to be increasingly on deposit gathering? And is this already hardwired into banking KPIs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The additional 155 business bankers will have a bias towards both deposit taking and other services transaction services as well. We have a very strong business banking franchise. This is where you've got to get the balance right. Where obviously we are going into a declining economic environment, we are also being presented with unprecedented opportunities. 35% of the market is not operating as it normally would, either through the regional bank participation, non-bank finances, foreign banks who are maybe not got an appetite for greater credit and we are interestingly seeing some migration of very high quality customers out of other banks. So we're trying to balance that up and we are going to capitalize on the franchise. But the 155 bankers we are hiring will definitely have a bias towards deposits and transactional services.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. It's Jon Mott from UBS. Just a question on the revenue outlook and if you look at the different components that came out today, I know the average balance was quite good, but if you look at the spot GLA, it was only up about 1.5%. And then the margin, yes, there are some moving parts there but the end of the day the Group margin was weak and I would presume that it was exiting at quite a weak point as well if you look from the first to second quarter or even on the monthly run rate. And then on top of it, you had a very strong trading revenue number that came through. And again the first quarter would have been very strong, but as spreads start to come back in it's unlikely that the trading number is going to be as strong into the second half. So I wanted to get your feel on the outlook for revenue growth going forward. Are we likely to start to see the revenue start to decline going forward over next half or two?</p>

          <p>I think as Mark just flagged, yeah, we do &#x2013; we'd expect the trading performance not to be as good because as interest rates are coming down less customers are clearly seeking to manage that. So that's obviously will be an impact. On the margin, there are many moving parts and whilst there has been the opportunity to reprice, there is also very strong competition on the deposit side. So I think we are seeing that play out on both sides.</p>
          <p>Yeah, there is definitely a subdued demand for credit. So I think it's fair to say that revenue will come off to a degree now. There is the &#x2013; I guess, this is definitely a story of two halves because we do have the opportunity, as I just mentioned in the last answer, to take some of the capacity that we might see is appropriate, but the reality is system growth next year is likely in the business side to be negative. And consumer appetite is low as well. So, yeah, it's a reasonable outcome that revenue will be off.</p>

          <p>It's Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. On slide 49 you show that impaired assets in Australian banking have increased from around 20 basis points to 40 basis points. I'd like to know which industries you are seeing the most pressure and also which segments of the market. And also whether you expect those impaired asset trends to accelerate as we move through the next 12 months and the economy heads into recession and unemployment heads towards 10%?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Richard. I might actually get Joseph Healy who is our Group Executive of Business Banking to provide a little more detail, but what we have seen is now the migration of impaired assets from the large corporates that were a feature particularly of the second half of last year and early quarter into the SME sector. We haven't seen the deterioration to consumers yet and that will be very dependent on unemployment. But I might just get Joseph just to comment a little bit on what he is seeing in terms of the mid market now.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the short answer is it's not sector specific. We are seeing and we have seen a deterioration in the what I'd describe as the non-food retail sector, the sector of the economy that is dependent on discretionary consumer expenditure. We've also seen some deterioration in those sectors that are very focused on the export market and a little bit in the commercial real estate, but it's broad based largely if I were trying to capture in one broad sector it's going to be in the non-food retail sector where we are seeing that slowdown, but it's broad based.</p>

          <p>Yes. We have an internal target that doesn't mean we are going to get it. But we've got about 40 billion so far and we've set ourselves a target of 60.

          <p>Jarrod Martin from RBS. Just a question on your final dot points on slide 24 regarding risk mitigation. Could you just give us a bit more of a feel for when you say you will consider additional risk mitigation and small top ups, are we talking about the &#x2013; what we saw previously, the $100 million per annum spread over five years? What are you looking at? What are the trigger points that we should be looking for, for you to actually go ahead and do that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are talking order of magnitude smaller than that if indeed we do it. So it wouldn't be anything like the commitment we made last time. And it will just depend on what comes out of the pool of names. So if we get some deterioration in the pool of names and it starts to effect one instrument more than the others for example then we may just move ourselves up a rung or two on the ladder but not sort of a wholesale investment like you saw last time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions, firstly, on trading income, you've flagged a $658 million increase on the September half. I just wanted to confirm does that have the full 368 million negative fair value move in collective provisions against it? And if so does that mean that the underlying move was up about $1 billion or so?</p>
          <p>And the second question was, just relating to a paragraph in the release regarding a change in APRA's view on provisioning for the conduit assets. It talks about going over and above the bank's internal credit process to look at market related pricing and so forth. Could you expand on that a bit more and whether the 160 million is sort of preemptive against that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with respect to the first one, yes, you're right there have been about 300 million of items put through the revenue line of the markets business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second one, I wouldn't say the 160 is preemptive. I mean, obviously we've been in ongoing discussions with APRA and they take an active interest in the conduit portfolio. And what we're just flagging is that with the rating methodology changes that are coming up that Mark flagged, we just discuss with them how that's going to &#x2013; how that might impact provisioning coverage going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben Koo, Goldman Sachs JBWere. Just a question on the capital side, with the Tier 1 ratio underwriting that you have done on DRP, it's looking well &#x2013; it's looking at the top end of your peers, now well above where some of your peers have flagged that they are comfortable to be. And it's well above where APRA is flagging they are comfortable for other banks to be as well. Can you just give us a bit more color around your thinking behind that? Is it just creating a bit of a war chest in case for acquisition opportunities as well? Or is it just more because of the concerns about the funding markets as well with the focus on credit &#x2013; or the capacity of &#x2013; on the capital side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, you are correct Ben it's certainly above where the rating agencies have flagged but &#x2013; and they still haven't moved from their view that 7% is the floor for AA rated bank. I did note that the list is getting shorter. They haven't communicated the change and it's well above the regulatory standard as well. We don't see it as a war chest. We just think that at this time we'd rather be a little stronger on capital to give us a greater flexibility as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Now, as Mark said as the economy normalize or as the cycle becomes predictable, we may very well be comfortable running capital ratios below that, but I think at the moment while there is volatility and uncertainly we'd rather have a strong capital position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question for &#x2013; in relation to your outlook for the margins and particularly in the second half. Mark's presentation gave a number of headwinds at the Group and divisional levels for the second half margin outlook. So just confirming are you budgeting on a negative margin for that second half?</p>
          <p>And then in terms of the asset side of the &#x2013; in terms of repricing of lending facilities, you've given how far you are through it, but where do you see the timeframe for getting through the hump of that rate pricing such as that lending spread benefit is largely washed though the timeframe for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second point James, I mean, there is &#x2013; we are probably anywhere around a third of the way through. As facilities represent, I mean, generally you are looking at a potentially three-year plus cycle to go through. So we'd hope there is probably another year to 18 months for us to work through the rest of the repricing. It's a bit difficult to suggest where the margin might land at the full year. I think that the positive headwind is going to continue. I think every bank is after deposits and I think that is a more &#x2013; quite a significant headwind.</p>
          <p>I know there is a lot of commentary on the fact that on the asset side that in fact the world has consolidated around the Big Four, and we've got unprecedented opportunity. The Big Four are still competitive, and we are still on occasions, particularly around high quality credits, I mean there are some once in a lifetime type customers presenting themselves and actually thinking about moving institutions. So there is actually still a bit of price tension and competition on the asset side. So it's a bit hard to see where it's going to land. But it's not a bad bellwether to show that in fact four point basis increase from September showed there was actually quite a lot of moving parts there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, CLSA. I just had a few question on, well two things, first of all on page 100 where you talk about Bell Group, I was wondering if we could just get a very short common sense, very simplistic version of what Bell Group is about. And perhaps more importantly what it might mean for all the other Bell Group type exposures that have happened over the last 20 years?</p>
          <p>And the second question all comes down to the capital adequacy on page 116, just a few questions on that, at that moment NAB enjoys $13.9 of billion subordinated debt that's sitting in the Tier 2 capital, could we get a feeling on the refinancing profile of that?</p>
          <p>The second one on the capital is that if you have a look at the expected loss deduction, I note that it's gone from 300 million to 400 million notwithstanding the fact that collective provisioning has increased. Could we get a feeling on what the regulator is trying to tell you there?</p>
          <p>And the final thing is could we get a feeling on the status of Clydesdale or the U.K. banks towards Basel II full accreditation, what that might mean to the capital adequacy? Is that included in the extra $20 billion of optimization that come out of the risk-weighted assets?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it, I got. Well, I wrote down three, I hope Cameron wrote down the other one, anyway. The sub-debt we have about 2.8 billion I think that matures in '09 and about the same that matures in 2010. We have no reason to engage in any issuance based on that maturity profile. And in fact I think &#x2013; I don't think I have met an investor in the last 12 months who is actually interested in lowered Tier 2 and I do wonder whether the industry will even think those sorts of things are important in the fullness of time. But anyway so we don't plan any issuance in sub-debt over the next two years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before you go off that one, Mark, does that mean it has to be replaced with Tier I?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it doesn't, because we are managing to a &#x2013; primarily actually to a core Tier I ratio. We are not really talking about total capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the regulator saying something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have plenty of room on total capital.</p>
          <p>The 300 to 400 ELEP, yeah, you are quite right. But that is &#x2013; that's a function of the expected loss in the portfolio assuming it all comes in one lump and then the difference between the two is 50% deduction Tier I, Tier 2. We don't expect all the bad debts to come as one lump. Nevertheless, the conservatism in APRA's calculations do require that as an adjustment to the ratios as you know. So that's not particularly surprising.</p>
          <p>And then on Basel II in the U.K., we are actually trying to understand where the FSA and their preferences are on this and we will make a decision about whether we go for accreditation or we slow it down. And none of that is in our RWA optimization estimates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Brian your first question was on Bell. Look, we don't comment on that, because there is lots of moving parts, as appeals process, it's settlement discussions, we are only one of the parties. But suffice it to say that certainly from internal point of view we are comfortable that we are dealing with that appropriately and have appropriate sort of provisions and our position on that matter. That &#x2013; I think it's got a fair way to run.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just wanted to follow up on the margin. You mentioned that it's a tough environment yet if I look at the basis risk it's come back 105 basis points in the U.K. and about 30 basis points here in Australia. Just if we can get an idea as to how that fits into your equation? And perhaps if you could give us an indication as to where the spot margin is at the moment, if it's up and down on what you actually reported for the half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean we do &#x2013; for the reasons I outlined we do expect the basis risk problem to reduce. But it is always a risk that it's going to be some shock through the system and it's going to spike again. And that's probably a good thing to take up with Lynne. I think the average spread over the period was like 207 basis points and I think towards the end of the period or into April, it was down around 130, I think. So already a substantial bite has come out of it.</p>
          <p>We probably have about &#xA3;12 billion in net assets that are base rate pointed, something of &#x2013; in that order of magnitude. We think there is only &#xA3;2 billion that we can ultimately not do something about. So it's a question of just chipping away at the stock of that to reduce the exposure at the same time.

          <p>Thanks. It's Chris Williams from UBS. I've just got a question. I am looking at slide 52 in your presentation pack on the U.K. and I know this might be dealt with later on, but I'd just like your perspective on it, thanks Cameron. I am looking particularly at the impaired loans in the commercial property book gone from 128 basis points to 308 in the half. But your specific provision coverage is almost half; it's just 12.9%. And I think Mark you pulled out specific provision coverage at 33% of impaired assets at a Group level. Just wondering what's different in the U.K. where you can carry such low specific provision coverage given the trajectory of impaired assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously when you come into specific provisioning, it's very situational. So what exactly are the characteristics of the customer situation, the workout, what's the realizable value of the security and you immediately move to provide 100% for what you think the downside is. And so if you are seeing a difference in the ratios, it's a difference to do with either the strategy to exit or the strategy &#x2013; or the expected value of security and that explains all the difference. So it will be a portfolio mix that gives rise to that.</p>

          <p>Scott Manning from JPMorgan. Just referring back to slide 23 where we are looking at the escalation of the watch loan exposures in nabCapital up to starting back in March 2008, and we are only seeing the provisioning in nabCapital on some single name exposures that we are all familiar with coming through now. Just trying to get a feel for the uplift in that watch loan between March '08 and March '09 whether that relates those same exposures or whether there is new ones coming through that aren't actually being provided for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a mixture of both. I mean, as Mark flagged in the presentation we take an active process on brining customers into watch. And in fact you'll see the tick up actually really started from September '07 when we started to get a &#x2013; obviously when we started to see the deterioration in the credit market. So we &#x2013; logically as we see the economy deteriorate, we are going to bring more and more people into watch earlier to try and manage them out throughout it. We haven't seen any other high profile corporate impairments that really inflect, mainly coming through in the back half of the '08 numbers in the first quarter of this half. But that's not to say that as we get into a declining economic environment away from what we're &#x2013; effectively failures of leveraged business models into a general deterioration, we wouldn't bring in more people into watch.</p>

          <p>Yes, one of the key concerns that the market has is the U.K. operations and if the U.K. does get worse than you expect and potentially as bad as a lot of the other banks in the U.K. have seen, there could potential be a capital drag on the Group to help recapitalize in a bad case scenario. I wanted to get your feel on that? Would the Group be prepared to help recapitalize the U.K. if the situation does deteriorate worse than your expectations?</p>

          <p>We don't see that as an outcome at the moment. But we don't want to sort of get into the hypothetical. I would say that U.K. at the moment remains profitable. We stand here today on April 2009, Northern Rock was September 2007. So our U.K. management have been dealing with headwinds for nearly two years and they are navigating their way through it. As a 2% player in the market also gives us capacity to navigate around a lot of the troubles and we have seen the benefit. So as we see hopefully the situation where the basis risk mitigates going forward and the bad and doubtful debts will play out, but we are not at this stage seeing a scenario where there'd be an extended period. When you start to get in the recapitalization scenarios it's &#x2013; I think it's got an 8% Tier 1 on a standalone basis. If when you get in recapitalization scenarios, yeah, you are looking at <mark type="inaudible" /> extended period of loss and we are not seeing that at this stage.</p>

          <p>Well, let me add also. We did do some recapitalization recently &#xA3;700 million, some was equity, some was prefs, some sub-debt. That was in response to a quite severe stress test imposed by the FSA and so the business is already capitalized in line with that severe stress test.</p>

          <p>Tim Buckley from Shore. Just further there on the U.K. U.K. mortgages, I know we are getting more today this afternoon. But your loan to value you have only stated the origination value, could we get a ballpark current figure in particular given your LMIs are 1% of the portfolio. And, I suppose, where I am going with that is the variance of your result to what we have seen from GE and from Lloyds last month is pretty dramatic. So either your lending practice are dramatically different or their provisioning is different.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Look I think &#x2013; I'd take that up with Lynne to get more detail but I'd say the nature of our mortgage book in the U.K. is quite different to many of the peers. We are obviously not a major participant in the market therefore have not saw aggressive growth there. But the other factor is of course that our housing stock skew is to the north of England and Scotland where there wasn't house price appreciation to the same degree. So therefore we haven't seen the same degree of deterioration.</p>

          <p>Just following from the term &#x2013; loan to value ratios, the commercial property for the U.K. that's seems to be the one &#x2013; slide that's seems to be missing loan to value ratio. Can you just elaborate on what the loan to value ratio was on the U.K. commercial property? And also when you are looking at the CMBs conduit portfolios, it seems to imply there has been about a 40% drop in U.K. commercial property prices, if you sort of reserve engineer from that CMBS slides. Is that indicative of what's happening in the commercial property book is all.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ben, there have obviously been deterioration in commercial property prices in the U.K. The nature of our commercial property portfolio &#x2013; I think as we flagged on previous occasion, it's got a bias towards more secure and high quality <mark type="inaudible" />. But I suggest on the whole, I mean, obviously that's why &#x2013; we know the scenario &#x2013; that's why I got the specific session this afternoon on the U.K. to give you an opportunity to get into more detail of that with Lynne and David Thorburg.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I was wondering if you could give us an expectation on where the tax rate will kind of run going forward. I mean if you have a look at the tax rate, which is on page 85, once again we've seen a very low tax rate. In past period we've seen very big, previously unrecognized tax losses coming through. Could you give us a feeling on where the effective tax rate will be going forward if you strip out for the loss in terms of accounting etcetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we have had a period of low effective tax rates, particularly the September '08 half, where there was recognition of U.S. losses. And we've had various issues with tax authorities get cleaned up. A number of which had led to releases. So those things will wash through and we will move more towards the statutory tax rate. But on the other hand we are starting to &#x2013; we are being careful, but actually leveraging our global reach a little bit to just manage the tax expense of the margin. So it will trend towards the statutory tax rate, but I don't think it will get there.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks everybody for participating today and persevering with the blackout. So we'll ask you to clear the room relatively quickly. Because you have something in here in about 10 minutes, I think. Thank you.</p>
