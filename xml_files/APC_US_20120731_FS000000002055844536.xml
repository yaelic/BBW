        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Steve, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Anadarko Petroleum Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, John Colglazier. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today for Anadarko's second quarter conference call. I'll remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements and certain non-GAAP financial measures. So, we encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements on our presentation slides located on our website and see the reconciliation for the non-GAAP measures in our earnings release as well as on the Web.</p>
          <p>Our executive leadership is here today and they are ready to answer questions later in the call following their prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Al Walker. Al?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good morning. It's a pleasure to discuss with you yet another strong operating quarter. The company produced several significant accomplishments, which speaks to the power of the portfolio we have accumulated. As a reminder, we provided a comprehensive summary of Anadarko's global E&amp;P activities in our Quarterly Operations Report, which is available on our website.</p>
          <p>There are four accomplishments we would like to bring to your attention this morning. First, record sales volumes of almost 750,000 barrel equivalents today, which included a 20,000 barrel per day increase in higher margin oil sales volumes over the first quarter of this year</p>
          <p>Second, significant free cash flow totaling $142 million. When including the collection of the first installment of the Algerian tax resolution, this amount increases to $255 million.</p>
          <p>Three, industry-leading deepwater exploration and appraisal success continues at Anadarko. We announced our second world-class natural gas accumulation offshore Mozambique with discoveries at Golfinho and Atum. This new complex is estimated to hold 10 Tcf to 30 Tcf of recoverable resources and is fully contained on our block. We also have new opportunities in deepwater C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire with our oil discovery. We also, in addition to that, have appraisal success in the Gulf of Mexico where the results at Vito led the partnership to increase the estimated recoverable resources of the field.</p>
          <p>And four, our continued commitment to value acceleration. We announced two joint venture carried interest agreements valued at about $1 billion in the aggregate for our Salt Creek Enhanced Oil Recovery Project in Wyoming and our deepwater Lucius development in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>These transactions significantly enhance project returns in a tax-efficient manner and enable us to reinvest the avoided capital into shorter-cycle, high-return opportunities. You can anticipate we'll continue to look for ways to employ this approach elsewhere in the portfolio. These four accomplishments and the consistent high level of operating performance support our confidence in our portfolio and the ability of Anadarko's people to continue delivering differentiating results today and in the years to come.</p>
          <p>As we've done for some time, we will continue to manage capital allocation to ensure investments are directed to the highest return projects possible, while maintaining our commitment to operate within cash flow. Even though we are operating in very volatile commodity price environments, we are committed to this approach.</p>
          <p>Consistent with our philosophy, we've reduced our operated rig count in the Marcellus and are reducing rigs in the Greater Natural Buttes while redirecting this activity to the core of our Wattenberg Field. The Wattenberg Horizontal Program is delivering the highest returns in our U.S. onshore portfolio with rates of return exceeding 100% at today's prices.</p>
          <p>We'll also to continue to leverage the competitive advantages of our midstream assets which support the pace of our drilling activities and maximize the value of our sales volumes. We locked up about 62,000 barrels per day of firm fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu back in 2002 and have acquired additional fractionation capacity.</p>
          <p>With these actions plus our existing firm transportation and ongoing facilities expansions, we've created a significant advantage enabling us to move our products to sale at very competitive prices. As included in last night's news release, we also took steps to further protect our 2013 cash flows by trading out of our existing three-way collars and into 900 million cubic feet per day of fixed rate swaps at a price of about $4 per MMBtu.</p>
          <p>Our cash position is strong with $2.8 billion of cash on hand and this is after reducing the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility by $800 million during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We also want to briefly touch on the Tronox Adversary Proceeding, which I know many of you have been following in the media. We remain confident and believe when the trial resumes next week, the testimony of our witnesses will continue to support the merits of our case. As was reported, we participated in various efforts to resolve the case but have not yet been able to reach anything mutually acceptable to both parties.</p>
          <p>Though we are limited in our ability to discuss the case, we'll continue to provide updated disclosure regarding the proceeding and any adjustments to the financial statements attached to last night's news release will be in our second quarter 10-Q.</p>
          <p>As you know, earlier this year, we were successful in reaching an amicable resolution to our tax dispute with Sonatrach and Algeria. And during the second quarter, we received $113 million, which is the first collection of what will be a total recoupment of about $1 billion this year plus an additional $700 million or so in the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>In reaching resolution on this matter, we've been able to turn our attention to new opportunities both with Sonatrach and the State. We constructed a deep, high quality portfolio with tremendous embedded value that's designed to deliver predictable, repeatable results giving us the confidence to increase the midpoint of our full year 2012 sales volume guidance by 3 million barrels, without this increasing any capital requirement to do so.</p>
          <p>In the months ahead, we anticipate a number of notable catalysts that we expect to do the following: increase production in the U.S. onshore liquid rich plays, continue a very active global deepwater exploration and appraisal program, submit a plan of development for the TEN complex offshore Ghana and achieve first production at the El Merk project towards the end of this year. There's a lot to be excited about and we're focused on driving value in the years and the months ahead.</p>
          <p>With that, we look forward to answering your questions this morning. Operator?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of David Tameron from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Nice quarter. Quick question for you, is if &#x2013; can we talk a little bit about &#x2013; you talked, Al, about accelerating value. Can you talk more about other potential transactions that &#x2013; I'll just leave it at that, let you add any color you want to on that. Can you just talk about potential transactions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, David, I think it's understandable that you and others are probably interested in what we may or may not do in Mozambique. The coke process has been one we've watched closely. And you might imagine we've been approached by a lot of people seeking interest in what might be a farm-down opportunity there. I can only tell you that I think our history kind of speaks for itself.</p>
          <p>We've been willing and I think a pretty good architect of design around how to do things in a tax efficient way. And I suspect Mozambique and other things in our portfolio will continue to be at the top of the list for things for us to consider. You wouldn't be surprised that we do get a lot of inbound interest on Mozambique and a lot of people that are not in the play today would like to be in the play.</p>
          <p>So, my guess is, is once we find the right deal that we think makes sense for us and our shareholders, we'll be inclined to pursue something if we in fact can find that. Other things in our portfolio, I think what we did at Lucius here recently is a great example of things we've done in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico that we may find ourselves doing again not just in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico but elsewhere. So, I'd like to think that we've had a pretty good track record around this issue and it's one that you'll &#x2013; you should expect as I said in the prepared comments that we'll continue to look for ways in our portfolio to put to use.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's helpful. And then one more question. Just a specific question as for the guidance going forward. Do you care to show us this year what your downtime assumption is as far as volume and third quarter guidance for hurricanes, et cetera, for any Gulf of Mexico disruptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Chuck hit that. As you know, we're pretty conservative around how we look at weather particularly this time of year and some years, we're spot on with it and some years, we're a little light and a little heavy. It just depends on weather activity but we do have that factored in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, David, I'd just add that we put the weather in the third and the fourth quarter. But &#x2013; that corresponds to our hurricane seasons as you know. And I think that thing you ought to see in our guidance is that we're experiencing what I'd consider explosive growth in virtually every one of our significant U.S. onshore plays and we're also seeing the benefit of the Algerian tax dispute resolution like Al mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>And that's just &#x2013; that's a great spot to be in. We're seeing records at Wattenberg, records in the Maverick production, Eagle Ford production that we have and our Permian Basin is also popping on records. And almost every one of those has essentially doubled from about this time last year.</p>
          <p>So, we're seeing that growth. We're seeing the growing pains associated with that growth. And you'll see us have to do the tie-ins and the infrastructure expansions that are associated with those and we bake those into our third and fourth quarter guidance.</p>
          <p>The reality is we're hopeful that we don't get any hurricanes and we'll realize that incremental volume or we're able to execute on the infrastructure expansions even faster than we planned. We'll see how all that goes as we move to the third and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Doesn't sound like you want to quantify that downtime assumption in there as far as volume. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (11:45)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we've haven't in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Fair enough. I'll let somebody else jump on. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's actually Drew Venker. You guys split from your usual practice of filing the Q at the same time as your report you alluded to this morning. Is there any read-through as to the potential for a settlement or an update on the settlement regarding your &#x2013; or your estimated liability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you're right. Your observation is correct. It is a little bit of a departure and I think what I might do if you don't mind, I'm going to let Bobby Reeves, our General Counsel, answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. Thanks, Al. Yeah, as Al stated earlier, we're really confident in the merits of the case in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. But we continue to seek a resolution there. Just like I talked about on the last quarterly conference call, there's lots of reasons we believe we're &#x2013; we have the right side of the equation on the merits of the case. There's no trial this week due to a previously scheduling order issued by the judge but we start again next week. We believe our witnesses will continue to show the merits of our case and demonstrate that Tronox was adequately capitalized at the time of IPO and that Kerr-McGee was not in any way responsible for their subsequent financial troubles or bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>All that being said, while we remain optimistic about the case, we are also continuing to seek a reasonable resolution. And we will be filing our 10-Q timely on or before August 9 but we do believe it was important to try to get the best clarity in the 10-Q about the case. So, we will be updating our disclosure as of that time. And also, any adjustments to the financial statements that were attached to the press release last night.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That makes sense. And I guess in the past, you guys had talked about selling down part of your Mozambique discoveries. I guess, so has anything changed there? Would you be open to selling your entire stake or would you expect to retain at least some interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the best way I can answer that is we always look at whatever we think maximizes the shareholder value and really believe that to be sort of the guiding light for how we look at either farm-downs or divestitures. I do think if you look at the track record, we've had more of history of monetizations through farm-downs as well as promotes, and that more likely than not would be our preference whether it's Mozambique or other places that we see ourselves wanting to continue to be a part of the operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk to the CapEx trajectory that you expect for the second half of this year, relative to the $3.6 billion or so that was spent in the first half and what's driving any changes from that trajectory? And then it may be too early but any early look on how you're thinking about 2013 in the context of your growth plans and the various farm-outs that you've executed or are contemplating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you can imagine, particularly given the comments I made in the prepared remarks, staying within cash flow is sort of the guiding principle for us, but with that, I'll let Bob Gwin, our CFO, answer the question specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, for 2012, the second half is roughly equivalent to the first half if you adjust the first half number for about $220 million of Western Gas Partners expenditures that were included in our consolidated results for the first half of the year. As for 2013, we fully expect to spend within cash flow again and beyond that, we're not really providing guidance in terms of how it might grow between here and next year. We expect to announce it very early next year along with a broader corporate update like we did this past year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then resource-wise, you talked in your Operational Update about strong well results at drilling the Geneseo formation in &#x2013; above the Marcellus. Can you add a little bit more color on what you saw there, relative to what you would see out of a Marcellus well, A. And then B, your plan for drilling additional wells and what areal extent do you think could apply there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian. Excuse me, Brian, this is Chuck. We actually only have a single well that was producing; it's early results on that are extremely good. We're making 6 million cubic feet or 7 million cubic feet a day from the well. It looks strong. We have a large area in what we call the Sproul Forest and it looks to contain most of our Geneseo prospectivity. It's early days; it's dry gas. We'll put it in our portfolio and work it in. I think the advantage it has is, is it's a little bit shallower, a little cheaper to develop. But we're not pushing that right now just because of the price realization on gas in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At what gas price would you get more excited within the context of your portfolio about drilling either a combination of more Marcellus or Geneseo well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say between $4 MMBtu and $5 MMBtu?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had a couple of questions on China &#x2013; the status of Liwan deepwater drilling there and what are your &#x2013; what's your game plan for Brazil going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I could, I'm going to let Bob Daniels handle the first part of that question as it relates to the drilling of 43/11 and then I'll have Bob Gwin, answer the question about where we are with Brazil in terms of the activities there that we've historically discussed in terms of being a divestiture. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Bob. This is Bob Daniels. Regarding 43/11, we did have a rig under contract. Originally, we had it scheduled to spud about now and happens to be typhoon season over there. They decided that given the depth of the water and distance from shore and everything else that they would like to drill that later in the year, so they farmed the rig out to another party for several wells and we'll come back probably about November and spud the 43/11 well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then this is Bob Gwin; on Brazil, BP as operator is working with Petrobras on the unitization potential for one of our blocks down there and so we're continuing to assess what unitization could mean for us and how it would affect value and so, therefore, we're currently in a holding pattern with regard to any divesture. Although, it still, of course, would remain on our list of expected divestures in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning, guys. A couple of things from me please. On the volume guidance, can I just explore this a little bit? Because it looks like Caesar/Tonga had a pretty stellar second quarter, at least start-up. My understanding was you'd originally talked about 40,000 barrels a day of capacity on Constitution and now it looks like that's moving higher. So, can you talk a little bit about what we can expect for the trend there on the plateau volume rate? And if you wouldn't mind layering that into why the liquids volume guidance was &#x2013; appears to be down so much in the second half? I'd appreciate some color, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Doug, this is Chuck. Caesar/Tonga is doing phenomenal. We have three wells out there. It hit its peak very quickly; we ran right on up to capacity. It varies a little bit day-to-day with regard to how Constitution, Ticonderoga are doing on the platform. We do &#x2013; there's a lot of asset work and just general maintenance type work that we do on Caesar/Tonga, so whenever we have some incremental capacity, we can shove some more Caesar/Tonga through the facility. So, that gives us a little variability.</p>
          <p>But the wells are doing phenomenal and we still expect them to stay on peak for quite some time and we're actually going to drill a fourth well here in the third &#x2013; late third quarter, early fourth quarter and then it will be complete and come on line early next year, thereabouts. And that will give us some even incremental capacity and we're looking at expansion of the capacity on the Constitution. We'll see some natural expansion just as Constitution and Ticonderoga decline with time and we'll do our best to fill that in.</p>
          <p>With regard to the guidance again, the future oil guidance is dictated by our assumptions associated with weather and you've seen all the reports. It's an active season and so we've taken into account that in our forward guidance. The other thing that plays into that, we're seeing our normal standard summertime maintenance in China and Alaska. And then we have &#x2013; as I mentioned earlier, we have a lot of work going on in the fields in &#x2013; at Wattenberg and Maverick. We're tying in a lot of oil infrastructure. And with that comes some downtime and we're baking that into account.</p>
          <p>That is &#x2013; that's no reflection on how the fields are doing because they're going up and they're growing tremendously as you can see in the Ops Report. So, it's just a &#x2013; it's where all these things come together and the bottom line is our fields are doing fantastic and we're seeing the growth. We're also seeing the growing pains and there comes a little downtime with it. But I would not be overly concerned about oil volumes. It's just a matter of timing and we just got to get it &#x2013; get through this growing pain and move on, and you'll see outstanding results from all of these fields.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. Thanks for the answer, Chuck. My follow-up is really I guess, this one's for Al. So, I'll apologize in advance, Al. The &#x2013; the balance between tax efficient, I guess, monetization, the way you've done it in the last six months with the two deals that you did &#x2013; for some reason, the market isn't &#x2013; doesn't really seem to be rewarding you for that.</p>
          <p>And I'm just curious as to how you see your priority between trying to actually getting value back into the stock for something like Mozambique because I guess what we are &#x2013; keep kind of hearing on the chatter is that this could be another kind of farm-down with no real material release of value. So, if you could just walk us through how you're thinking about prioritizing your &#x2013; what is clearly an embarrassment of riches but that doesn't seem to be getting through to the stock price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a very understandable question and you're not a bad person for asking it, Doug. So, I'm not put off by it. As it relates to Tronox, I think that has created an unfortunate cloud, a lot of misunderstandings about the case have unfortunately found their way into the share price. I think when you realize that we find ourselves in a situation where we're continuing to pursue what we think is the right answer for the shareholder in court.</p>
          <p>At the same time, balancing that with what we think could be a reasonable settlement, if one could be achieved. There's not much more we can do to be a fiduciary for shareholder value than to pursue those sort of independently of each other but be mindful that each have their own ways in which they create value for letting the operating story come out.</p>
          <p>I think from a management perspective, we're pretty proud of our operating results for a long time and 2012 is just another chapter in a pretty good book. As you look at Mozambique, I think we look at it as probably one of the biggest success stories of our company's history. From again using the book analogy, we're pretty early into the reading of the book.</p>
          <p>And how we might extract value in a farm-down there is sort of in the category of to be determined. We don't have, today, a deal for me to be able to describe to you, for you or others who in turn to determine whether or not you think we've created value in the way we structured it. So, I think as we looked at the things that we have done in recent memory, I do think they add a lot of value. They bring forward the value in a tax efficient manner. And over time, I believe that will work its way into the share price. It's unfortunate we've had events recently such as Tronox and previously before that, Macondo, that have really not allowed the industry-leading operating story to get the full light of the day.</p>
          <p>So, I think from our perspective, Doug, we'll continue to look for ways to create that value through using structures that we think are tax efficient, that we do think unlocks value and gives the market a good indicator of the value of an asset or a play that we might be in. And we'll continue to hopefully find that resolution one way or the other, so that the operating story is not clouded by things that don't have anything to do day-to-day with how we explore for and drill oil and gas wells.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Could I dip into Mozambique a little bit again? When you look at the area like Golfinho and Prosperidade, I mean, what do you see as the next step into us being &#x2013; which area could likely get some more momentum in terms of development for an LNG project? And what role does, I guess, the Mozambique government play into help making that final decision?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to let &#x2013; I'm going to ask Bob Daniels to address your question. I do think to answer it in part myself, you do have a country and you do have a government here that's working really hard to try to create for their people the right situation.</p>
          <p>The opportunities for a better way of life and an enrichment through better education for the population is going to be through things like the discovery of natural gas in the deepwater off Mozambique. So, I think we have a committed government to try to do the right things to help industry create greater wealth. As it relates to the block, there's still a lot the block has, we believe, to offer. And why don't I turn that part of the question to Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Scott, thank you. The question on Prosperidade versus Golfinho/Atum and which one has the most momentum; these &#x2013; both of these have tremendous momentum. These are amazing discoveries. We've talked about both of them being on block, 10 Tcf to 30 Tcf recoverable net to our partnership. So I mean these are just amazing natural gas complexes and both of them could be the first LNG developments we put in. Right now, Prosperidade is a little bit farther ahead technically because it was discovered first. We've done more work on it.</p>
          <p>But the Golfinho/Atum complex is catching up rapidly. We've got the first appraisal well down at Golfinho. We're on the second one. We've got two more planned after that. We're going to then start doing some DFTs up there. We're doing the exact same sort of thing that we did to the south of Prosperidade, which is define the resource better so that we can get certified reserves and make the decision. I guess the thing to recognize is that the Golfinho/Atum complex is all on our block whereas Prosperidade does spill off of our block onto the adjacent ENI operated block where they have appraised it.</p>
          <p>So, we'll continue to work with ENI. We'll continue to work with the government and see how we can move both of these complexes forward, but beyond that, when you look at Mozambique Area 1, we've got some very exciting prospects to the south where we plan to start drilling late this year. Black Pearl and test some of the ideas that potentially could have some liquids associated with it based on the Ironclad well that we drilled several years ago down there. So, we've got a lot more to do, but both of these have tremendous momentum and the LNG planning and development is moving ahead very rapidly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's kind of hard to imagine that I guess both areas would get into shallow LNG development, correct me if I'm wrong there, but it just seems a little bit much all at once. And I guess from your perspective, when you take a look at &#x2013; when do you think the next sort of meaningful event will happen in terms of giving us a better visibility on which area has that leg up? Is it &#x2013; ultimately, it seems like it's going to come from the government &#x2013; is that fair statement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not necessarily from the government. I think that the appraisal work at Golfhino/Atum, when we're done with that, will give us a lot of information as to which one is a better development and then also the status of the unitization, how that progresses and that's something we don't control. We've got several parties involved in it, so we're going to have &#x2013; but we do want to continue with those discussions. So, all of those are moving along in parallel and we'll see how they all play out, but we think we've got two world class accumulations here and we're aggressively pursuing both of them at this time. We will have to make a call as to what will be the first, ultimately.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You know, Bob, I might add just to that if I could and that is that we &#x2013; our plan is to get both complexes to the point of having to certify the reserves at the same time, so that we are prepared in order to move forward with either of these in the first two trains. And I think that's one of the mechanical things in front of us that we can control without being able to say we can, in fact, control the unitization negotiations and discussions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Bob, I think you said that the call has to be made at some point. When do you think that call has to be made? Which one goes first?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Real quickly, looking at the free cash flow comments that you made earlier and kind of the substantial war chest you're building up with free cash flow versus your CapEx spending, going forward. How do we think about the potential for acquisitions and, specifically, maybe looking at the area of mutual interest in the Permian and are you looking at any packages there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Dave, let me take a quick moment to address that and I'll then let Bob Gwin do it as well. I think today, we're not really an aggressive acquirer of assets simply because the portfolio we've got is really one we're pretty darn happy with. And our ability to add value through the drill bit, through the exploration activities of Bob Daniels is probably our best value-added for the dollar invested.</p>
          <p>It might be more likely that we might want to see yourselves taking a greater working interest in some wells or drilling a few more wells and spending capital that way than we would necessarily through acquisitions. It doesn't mean that acquisitions at some point might not be of interest to us, particularly at the right price. But that might be a better question for Bob Gwin to address than me. But I think today, the exploration model that we have is probably for us to best value added for the composition of the portfolio we've got.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only thing I'd add to it is that, of course, there is lots of properties out there and we look at lots of them. We look at numerous opportunities around the world, both in terms of in our exploration area as well as in places if &#x2013; to see if an acquisition could dislodge something in our existing portfolio and help our future results.</p>
          <p>But as Al pointed out, we are very pleased with the portfolio. We're very pleased with the forward model and so as you would expect, it becomes pretty difficult to find ourselves in a competitive bidding situation where the economics make sense for us to pursue it. But we keep looking at it obviously because the free cash flow gives us some flexibility, gives us some optionality.</p>
          <p>Bob Daniels' success and his team's success with the drill bit gives us a lot of optionality and so we're constantly trying to figure out how we use that optionality available to us to drive better results in a more capital efficient basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, the last time we probably made any sort of acquisition of size was in the Eagle Ford with the TXCO situation where they were in bankruptcy and they were a distressed seller. So, it's probably in a scenario more like that that you may see us be a little more aggressive than we would be otherwise. I think in that particular case, we bought TXCO for around $1,000 an acre and depending upon how you valued the promote associated with KNOC, we did it somewhere between $15,000 to $19,000 an acre. So, if we see those sort of economics work again in our favor, Dave, I think you might consider letting us load the guns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I appreciate that color and then switching over to the Marcellus just for a moment. You had the rig count down yet production was up. You'd kind of telegraphed that that might be something that would happen last quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about how we think about that going forward? And whether that was driven more by a series or drilled uncompleted wells being completed or by the efficiency gains you kind of outlined in your Ops Report last night?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Chuck. It's a bit of both particularly on the non-op production side, we've seen a lot of growth over there and it feels now making the 1.2 Bcf a day which is just a phenomenal start and you'll recall that up until just recently, we've had a carried position in the Marcellus, and we built that at a very low cost &#x2013; low cost to Anadarko and have a tremendous asset there that has a lot of life left into it. We've also got a lot of efficiency. You've seen our drill times come down. Our completion costs come down. We outlined that in the Ops Report. If you want to go through that, you can just refer to the Ops Report. I think it does a pretty good job of telling you how we're working that.</p>
          <p>So, going forward, we'll continue to keep a fairly low rig activity level on the operating side and I think our non-operating position will do the same thing. There are several hundred wells that are waiting on either completions or hookups, so you could continue to see a pretty strong production performance out of that that area and the economics, despite the gas price, are fairly strong given the low cost position and the efficiencies we've got out of drilling and completion group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I appreciate that color. One just last follow-up to that, looking at those efficiency gains and the reduction in costs on the completion side, how do we think about what inning you guys are in from the perspective of that continuing? Obviously, kind of 15% reduction quarter-over-quarter is a pretty impressive number on the spud to rig release time. Do we keep kind of pushing that trajectory for several more quarters? Just any kind of guidance you can give us on that would be helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think I'd want to pop out a percentage, but I will tell you that our drilling completion guys &#x2013; just they're top rate. They wake up every morning trying to push additional efficiencies into our program and deliver value to Anadarko. And I've been amazed at the just year-over-year, I guess for the last five or six years, we're seeing continuous improvement and I've been on those guys every day.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a follow-up question on the Marcellus. What's your current backlog and then what's the plans for actually taking down that backlog over the next few quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, this is Chuck. The backlog's around 200 wells and it's just getting clipped off on a steady pace. Both us and our non-operated partners have reduced the completion count or the completion crew count. And what we're seeing is just a general slowing of the process up there that's helping us manage our costs, get more efficiency out of the dollars we spend up there. And depending upon gas prices and how those crews are operating, you could see 20 or 30 of those wells a quarter being put on line and even more if prices were to rebound, I think you'd see us accelerate that. And you could see the growth coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I'm just thinking if you look where the current spot gas price is relative to the forward curve for next year, there's not a huge amount of contango at this point. And so I'm just wondering if you guys would start stepping into a higher completion of that backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's an option for us. Right now, we're down to a crew count that we're comfortable with and I think our non-operated or our operated by others are feeling the same way. So, you're just seeing &#x2013; you're sort of seeing a steady-state pace right now. And I don't really see that changing unless gas prices improve considerably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then shifting over to Jubilee, on the down production quarter-over-quarter, how much of that was related to rig remediation versus just underlifting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the production &#x2013; what you're seeing on the quarter-to-quarter numbers is just how the ships coming in and out and the way the liftings work. The production from Jubilee is actually starting to pick up. We were down to around 60,000 barrels a day. And now we're producing over 75,000 barrels a day. And so, you're starting to see the impact of the acid jobs and the sidetracks we did earlier this year. We're feeling fairly encouraged by how the field is performing.</p>
          <p>And the &#x2013; when you're out in a field like that and you're in a subsea environment, to work on a well, you oftentimes have to shut in all the wells around you. So, that's why you're seeing &#x2013; you didn't see the build quite as fast as maybe you would have hoped. But the acid jobs are working well and I feel like that you'll continue to see that performance and we've also started our Phase 1A wells. And those &#x2013; the early returns on those look really good as well and if we apply the lessons we've learned on the completions in Phase 1 into the Phase 1A group, which I'm sure we will, I think you'll see some really good performance out of that field coming forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then &#x2013; so the &#x2013; if it was just a timing, I guess on the second quarter, do you expect to have sort of an overlift in the third quarter out of Jubilee?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It goes up and down. I'm sorry I don't have the exact figures on the third quarter but the production is steady and it's &#x2013; the way the liftings work, there's a sequence of liftings and it's just timing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right now the field is doing so well and both the Niobrara and the Cordell are performing extremely well. You've seen us increase our resource potential out there to 1 billion barrels to 1.5 billion barrels. The mix is associated more with the way the existing vertical completions are put together. And so, that's probably a reasonable mix going forward but it'll change from time to time depending upon which section we're in. But I would say that's in the game of what the mix is going to be.</p>

We're completing three wells and we're drilling one right now. So, we'll have a total of seven wells. There is a lot of activity around us. So, we'll get a lot of information with regard to our land position and have a more fulsome discussion in 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning guys. A question on Phobos, I was just curious as to what color you could provide or what response you would provide to investors who may feel that per the Operations Report release, you could be giving up a good bit of potential upside in the prospect in exchange for what on the surface looks to be maybe $80 million or so. Could you provide any color going forward with Phobos and you guys' thoughts on the farm-out there?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Eliot, Bob Daniels. We manage our risk, and even though it's a very good prospect with its dual objectives and proximity to Lucius and everything, it's a good prospect. It still is not without risk. And it's also going to be a fairly expensive well because the lower tertiary tail that we have on it, test down there. So, we felt like the right thing to do at this point was to share that risk a little bit, and so we laid off a piece of it.</p>
          <p>We're essentially going to be fully carried on the well and that will spud later this year. It's very typical of how we do our business both in the Gulf of Mexico and around the world. So, it's just managing our risk and recognizing that while it's a very attractive prospect, we've got lots of very attractive prospects on our portfolio.</p>

          <p>Yes, absolutely. And just a quick follow-up to that then would be just so I get some clarification. The 20%, does that apply to whole potential development that was farmed-out or is it the block or the well? It is the old development, 20% was farmed out?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joe, it's Bob. In Kenya, we'll probably get to drilling over there first quarter of 2013. I originally had thought this year but because of the Golfhino/Atum activity, we've pretty much used up our rig time all in Mozambique, so it will happen early 2013. South Africa, we're in the process of waiting on the final papers signed by the government. Meanwhile, we're working with PetroSA, our partner on a 2D seismic acquisition program, that will get started later this year. New Zealand, do you want me to just kind of walk around the world?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Going back to the Wattenberg; if my recollection is right, you're on track to spend about $1 billion there this year. So, that's a big chunk of your CapEx, but the &#x2013; I wanted to get more kind of color on what you've seen on the Cordell rates? And also, maybe a little more color on that Barclay section where you had the 10 wells <mark type="ph" /> and the 640 (46:30).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Charles, this is Chuck again. The way the Wattenberg has gone, we have &#x2013; we're at eight rigs now. The field is growing very, very quickly. We've pushed rates from the horizontal program up to 28,000 barrels a day. And that's coming from about 75% of the wells in Niobrara and 25% is Codell. We &#x2013; the two have very similar characteristics with regard to production profile on a BOE basis. One is little more liquids rich. That's why we're drilling more Niobrara wells than Codell wells.</p>
          <p>But as we go in into these areas and we want to develop, say, a section, we're doing our best to complete the development in the section to sort of mow the grass, is what we call it. And just walk across a section and complete it. So, we don't have to come back in and disrupt production from either &#x2013; from any of the other wells. And so, that's our process and that's why we're doing it the way we're doing it.</p>
          <p>The Barclay section as you referred to is an area where we've gone in and almost completely developed the section on a test spacing in both zones and it's &#x2013; we've put those wells on line. It'll take us a number of months. It is too early in the process to know how well they've done and what the total estimated ultimate recovery are between the two zones. But that's one of our experiments and the early returns on that as you saw in the Operating Report looked very good.</p>
          <p>And I think this is the way we're going to approach the field going forward which is just rig up on a section with the number of rigs that we need to prosecute the program, grow both the Niobrara and the Codell at the same time, move in with a completion fleet, and complete those 10 wells &#x2013; however many wells, eight wells to ten wells to 12 wells per section, and then move out and go on to the next one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And are those &#x2013; is the pattern for those Codell with the Niobrara, is it kind of a sawtooth pattern or are you doing kind of seven Niobrara wells on one end and then three Codell wells on the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more of a sawtooth where you have a Codell under two or three Niobrara wells.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then back to Mozambique, I'd like to take one more run at that question. Bob, so, obviously, the Prosperidade complex is further ahead technically, but you've guided &#x2013; you're accelerating the appraisal on the Golfinho/Atum. The &#x2013; to me the one big thing, and this is what everyone has alluded to, the one piece of complexity that you have on the Prosperidade is the unitization discussion negotiations I think is what you guys said.</p>
          <p>What &#x2013; is there a timeline for that when it's going to start and do you have an expectation for how long that's going to take? Because I guess at least in my way of thinking, that's going to &#x2013; it's really that &#x2013; how difficult and how long that discussion, that utilization discussion is, is going to be a large determinant of what everyone's after which is which prospect or which complex is going to get discovered &#x2013; or developed first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Charles, this is Al. Let me be sure I understand your question. Are you asking have we started discussions around unitization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, or have you started those discussions and how long do you think they're going to last or how long will it be before you to get a decision on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have started discussions; we've had numerous discussions. It's hard for us to give you an estimate of when we might reach agreement on unitization because that would be associated with reaching the milestone I mentioned earlier with having the reserves certified. I think both the government and the partners are going to need to be able to demonstrate they've got certified reserves behind any particular train.</p>
          <p>So, we answered that question earlier saying it'll probably be late this year, early next before both of the two complexes, in the Golfinho/Atum complex or the Prosperidade field itself would actually have certified reserves. It's probably on the backside of having certified reserves from our perspective in both the Golfinho/Atum and Prosperidade and seeing what is in the other block that ENI is the operator for on the certified reserves before you should likely expect there to be some conclusion reached by the government on how that field would be unitized.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi, some quick ones for me. With Heidelberg and Vito, would you consider doing a Lucius-like development carry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Bob Gwin. I think the short answer to that is yes. But obviously, as we move forward and the economics take more shape and we look at how it fits into the broader portfolio, we'll make that decision in the future. But the deal we did at Lucius, very, very attractive. Obviously enhances our economics very, very significantly and so replicating that type of a structure certainly is on the short list of things we'd consider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, the only thing I would add to that is that at Heidelberg, we have &#x2013; we're working with a little more working interest there to be able to promote down and still have a meaningful working interest. So, unless we were able to do a player trade at Vito, I think our focus would probably be at Heidelberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine now. Are you finding that you're getting unsolicited offers from domestic players or global or both?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, it's both. These &#x2013; coming across resources like this of this kind of scale is a relatively difficult thing to do and our team has done it well and there are several folks out there that are attracted to relatively shorter-term oil coming on line and willing to pay a marginal premium in order to buy it from us given our willingness to work out an attractive economic deal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, John, let me add to that. I think it's probably fair to say that non-domestic companies today have a very bullish view of oil and it's probably because of that that they are a better promotees here than maybe a domestic company. Because it seems like as we talk to people, there is a very strong view about future prices that they don't want to be on the other side of. And so, it seems like that's why a lot of our activities have been with more non-U.S. companies when we promote.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With Mozambique, your test results were very strong. Would you be considering changing kind of your design capacity in terms of LNG or is it still way too early days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Chuck. Yeah, those results were exceptional. In fact, you saw when we flowed 100 million cubic feet a day from several of our DSTs and very low drawdowns. So, the well design itself will certainly make for larger bore completions, so we get more rate out of every well. And we're approaching our FEED for both Golfinho and Prosperidade complexes looking at what the optimum economics that we could generate based upon the combination of wellbores and output from the LNG train. So, all of that's in the mix right now and we're evaluating that. Our early work has said that 5 million ton type plant is about where we ought to be but we're still open to do evaluations on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, Chuck. Last one from me is on Wattenberg; you're getting better results, what about processing capacity? Are you going to have to ramp that up or you're just trying to be more oily, shall we say, so you're not having to deal with any sort of capacity issues until you do upgrade in Wattenberg?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John. I'm not sure you got it but we're doing a lot of expansion out there. We are actually installing a 300 million cubic feet a day processing plant called the Lancaster plant. And then we're actually participating in two significant pipeline projects down in Mont Belvieu, the Front Range Express and the Texas Express, which will allow us the evacuation of those NGLs from Wattenberg, which you know it's a very rich gas. That's where we get a lot of good, heavy NGLs. And we'll be pushing those down to Mont Belvieu into some premium markets, and &#x2013; so, all that's underway right now. The plan and the pipelines will be in service late next year, early 2014, and we're really excited about the economics that will add to our Wattenberg program.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Second and probably the eighth time this question's been asked, but if you can maybe characterize a bit more, for the guidance, weather versus growing pains, is there a way to do that without providing numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not in real good detail. I guess the &#x2013; I think you guys' concern about the guidance is overblown, frankly. We're having exceptional performance from our oil reservoirs and it's just the &#x2013; it's a combination of effects that we're taking into account, what we are seeing in having predictions on a heavy hurricane season. And we take that into account, so we give you a risk-weighted guidance. And I'm sorry we've said three or four times, but that's what we do. And the other things are just the types of things that happen when you're growing and that's shut-ins to make tie-ins. The expansion projects that we have for our oil exports at Wattenberg and in the Maverick and the growth we're seeing in the Permian, all that has consequential impacts on a quarterly basis but the reality is those things are growing and they're growing explosively.</p>
          <p>I mean it's big time growth with exceptional economics in all those plays and so that's what's going on and we're getting the benefit in the Algerian TP resolution to boot, so you'll see our oil volumes spike up considerably as we move forward. It's unfortunate, I guess based upon the timing that all this kind of collides in the third quarter which is when we have a lot of weather downtime historically and we're just taking that into account.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough and final question I guess. In Mozambique in your LNG project, how do you look at your ability to operate LNG business and possibly build that out as a long-term portfolio &#x2013; in terms of say human resource and capital requirements and time value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you need to break it down into a couple of components. Let's just talk offshore first. What you're going to see offshore Mozambique is a cluster of wells, probably 10 wells to 15 wells per train to start out with. It's very similar to the development we had in IHUB. IHUB was about a Bcf a day of production, it will take around 750 million to 800 million per train to produce into these facilities.</p>
          <p>So, we've done that. I think we've done it well and we're very familiar with the kit and the water depth and we have the right equipment to take that to conclusion. I also think that our project management team that we've put together on this project and has historically been working on our Gulf projects is just top-notch. And they've delivered projects of this offshore similar to this on time and on budget for a decade now. And you all have seen all the IPA comparisons to that. So, I feel really strongly that we've got this offshore licked.</p>
          <p>When you move onshore and you think about this LNG project, to put it in perspective, my sense is that the train is about the equivalent of doing an El Merk and a half, something along those &#x2013; that's the kind of intensity, the capital, the manpower, the hardware that's involved in that. And so, we're in the middle of El Merk now, we're 93% complete, and we're coming in &#x2013; we'll have first production year-end. So, I think we have the basic skill set that we need to complete this project, put it together. We're fortunate in that with the folks on El Merk, the folks that worked on Ghana, the folks that worked on Caesar/Tonga within our company are available to us to put on Mozambique right now.</p>
          <p>And so, we're moving that talent in that direction and they're very experienced; they've done an exceptional job in those projects and I feel comfortable that we'll pick good FEED. We've got a good FEED contractor list and as we go further and further and deeper and deeper into this project, we'll continue to hone that list and the combination of world-class contractors and our project management team along with the partner participation that we have, we'll deliver you a great project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and I'm sorry, one last one. In Algeria, the staggering the barrels out for the balance of the year, how do you see that happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on that one really, Subash, you're just going to have to follow our guidance because we contract every two months for our forward sales out there so it just falls in based upon the tranching in of the different owners.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Just had a quick one regarding the Wattenberg; as you shift towards 10 horizontal wells, I just wondered if you could elaborate on what the mix will be or what that means for the vertical program?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what we're essentially doing is taking new horizontal rigs, putting &#x2013; put them to work in Wattenberg and diminishing our vertical program by about the equivalent amount. So, by the end of the year, we may have one vertical rig working but it's going to be late this year, early next year that the vertical program will essentially go away and then we will be drilling strictly 100% horizontal wells.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there may be a few exceptions here and there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as we think about 2013, you &#x2013; at the Analyst Meeting you talked about perhaps drilling up to 270 wells on the horizontal program next year. Does that &#x2013; does your thought process change given how you're accelerating up to 10 wells a little bit faster than we were anticipating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes. The actual rig count as I can't comment on it yet because &#x2013; I'm sorry the actual well count, we're still working through them. But I think the combination of moving to 10 rigs and the efficiency we're seeing in the program by getting these things knocked out quicker will lead to a higher actual well count drilled next year.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.</p>
