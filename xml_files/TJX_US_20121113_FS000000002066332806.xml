          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to The TJX Companies Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, November 13, 2012.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Carol Meyrowitz, Chief Executive Officer of The TJX Companies, Inc. Please go ahead, ma'am.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. And before we begin, Sherry has a few words.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sherry. And joining me and Sherry on the call are Ernie Herrman and Scott Goldenberg. So before we talk about the third quarter, I want to say that on behalf of TJX, our hearts go out to everyone who was affected by Hurricane Sandy. The combination of our own donations and the fund-raising effort we held in the U.S. stores this past weekend to come to about $1.5 million going to the Red Cross Disaster Recovery Fund for the natural disaster.</p>
          <p>So, turning to our results, I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter performance. Our strong momentum continued, and once again we demonstrated our ability to post strong comps and profit margin gains on top of challenging year-over-year comparisons. Comps increased 7%, significantly exceeding plan, over a 3% increase last year. Earnings per share increased 17%, also above plan and on top of three consecutive years of double-digit EPS growth in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our momentum continued to be broad-based, with all of our businesses delivering excellent results. Customer traffic continued to drive the comp increases at all of our divisions. We believe this speaks to the staying power of our value proposition: great fashions, great brands and, of course, extreme values.</p>
          <p>What I want to emphasize on this call is that, as excited as we are about our business for the holiday season and fourth quarter, we are more excited about the long term. In fact, as CEO of this company, I have never been more excited about the future of TJX. I believe our long-term opportunities are quite astounding.</p>
          <p>And before I continue, I'll turn the call over to Scott to recap our third quarter consolidated results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carol, and good morning everyone. Now, to recap our third quarter results, net sales reached $6.4 billion, an 11% increase over last year. Consolidated comparable store sales were up a very strong 7%, well exceeding our expectations and achieved over a 3% increase last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.62, a 17% increase over a last year's $0.53 and above our plan.</p>
          <p>These results were achieved on top of EPS growth rates in the last three years of 15%, 12%, and 41% in the third quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on EPS, compared to a $0.01 positive impact last year.</p>
          <p>In our press release today, we called out the impact of certain third quarter items on third quarter EPS and pre-tax margins. As we've discussed on prior sales calls, we recorded a non-cash charge for pension accruals for prior periods. In addition, we recorded an adjustment to our reserve for former operations related to closed stores. Neither of these items affected our core business nor were anticipated in our original guidance. Combined, these two items reduced third quarter EPS by $0.03 and consolidated pre-tax margins by 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>The consolidated pre-tax margin was 11.7% for the quarter, a 20-basis-points increase over last year and up 40 basis points, excluding the impact of FX. So, between the negative impact of FX and the 60 basis points from the third quarter items I just mentioned, the underlying improvement was significantly higher than the numbers imply.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margin increased by 70 basis points over last year, entirely driven by merchandise margin improvement, which was partially offset by the negative impact of mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory-related hedges.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense increased by 50 basis points, primarily due to a combination of factors, which together had a 110-basis-points unfavorable impact: first, the third quarter items I just mentioned; second, our increased incentive compensation accruals arising from our above-plan results; and third, investments to support our growth, including talent and infrastructure.</p>
          <p>As to inventories, at the end of the third quarter, consolidated inventories on a per-store basis, including the warehouses, were down 14%, versus a 14% increase last year. We are extremely happy with our inventory levels, and enter the fourth quarter in an excellent position to continue shipping fresh merchandise selections to our stores throughout the holiday season.</p>
          <p>In terms of share repurchases during the third quarter, we retired 8.9 million shares, buying back $400 million worth of TJX stock. Year-to-date, we have retired 22.5 million shares, buying back $950 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back a total of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of TJX stock this year.</p>
          <p>Even after reinvesting in our business and returning excess cash to shareholders through our dividend and buyback program, we still expect to end the year with $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in cash, which is more than our most recent guidance.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call back to Carol. I will provide details of our fourth quarter guidance and recap our full-year guidance at the end of the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Scott. And before moving to our future opportunities, I'll recap some divisional numbers, which speak for themselves. At Marmaxx, segment profit margin was up 70 basis points, and at HomeGoods, it increased 50 basis points. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, adjusted segment profit at TJX Canada was up by 40 basis points, and at TJX Europe, adjusted segment profit margin increased 360 basis points. Clearly, we are particularly pleased with our increasingly strong trend in Europe.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight the major factors for our confidence in our having a strong holiday season and fourth quarter before I get into why we are just as excited about the longer term. First, I believe our gift-giving selections will be better than ever this holiday season. Second, we are already seeing that our stores will be even fresher than last year, offering our customers a constantly changing mix of giftable merchandise. Third, we'll be leveraging our global marketing abilities more than ever, getting more bang for our advertising dollars, with just a modest increase in marketing spend in the fourth quarter. We started on air last night. Fourth, we will be more aggressive with our gift card business this year. And fifth, our remodeled stores are offering customers an upgraded shopping experience which we believe will continue to lift sales. Above all, we will be offering consumers extremely sharp values, and we are convinced consumers will continue to seek value this holiday season.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to address the question we hear out there about the sustainability of our sales and margin growth over the long term. Let me start by explaining why I'm confident that our ability to growth our top and bottom line is so far from over. What we constantly think about is how to leverage our flexible business model and how we can improve even further on our execution, while having a keen focus on long-term planning.</p>
          <p>While we obviously plan for the next year and for the next three on a rolling basis, our strategic vision is for where this company can be well beyond that, and we see great growth in front of us. We believe we have many ways to plant seeds to successfully grow TJX for many years to come. Let me share some of the reasons I'm as excited as I am about the future of TJX.</p>
          <p>First, we have huge opportunities to attract more U.S. and international customers with our values. Over the last three years, our customer traffic is up mid-teens, and it continued to be up in the third quarter. Also, we have significantly widened our demographic reach over this same period. While we've made substantial market share gains, our penetration levels remain well below those of most department stores and enormous opportunities remain.</p>
          <p>We are also gaining traction with younger customers. We are offering better junior brands and contemporary categories and are marketing more aggressively to this group, engaging them through social media. In order to continue to gain share, we're targeting a wider audience with powerful marketing, and we keep working to make the shopping experience better and better. We have many in-store initiatives underway.</p>
          <p>The next major factor in our confidence in top- and bottom-line growth is our supply chain opportunities. As efficient as our supply chain is, we are making significant investments designed to let us run with even leaner and faster-turning inventories, and to become even more precise in delivering the right goods to the right stores at the right time. We are being very deliberate with these initiatives, so we still have several more years before we anticipate realizing the full benefit.</p>
          <p>The third major long-term opportunity is store growth. We believe we have the potential to grow our store base by up to 50% with just our existing banners in our existing geographies alone. As our banners become bigger, we gain even more ability to leverage these businesses for our customers.</p>
          <p>I'm going to begin by talking about our international opportunities because, as department stores have begun branching into off-price, I believe we have a huge leg up in this space, not only because we are the leading off-pricer in North America, but because we have a strong foothold in Europe, with a lot of open space in which to grow.</p>
          <p>It's difficult enough to execute the off-price model in this country, let alone what it takes to succeed at off-price retailing outside the U.S., something I believe is underestimated by many. We see TJX as the only company in the world with a deep understanding and experience in how to enter different countries with our off-price concept, and we believe we will continue to maintain our off-price leadership status.</p>
          <p>I just got back from Europe, and I see our opportunities there are staggering. We see the potential to grow up to 875 stores with just our current banners in our current countries. We see tremendous opportunity to gain greater leverage in all of our current European geographies, and may tweak our store growth model upwards in the future. It is important to note that TJX Europe reached a 9% segment profit in the third quarter, and we are estimating it to be nearly 9% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Further, TJX Europe achieved record third quarter segment profit margin this quarter, and performance was consistent across its geographies. We are very pleased with the progress TJX Europe is making. We believe we have only scratched the surface in terms of this business's potential.</p>
          <p>One of our greatest strengths is learning from our mistakes to become an even stronger business, sharing ideas across divisions, and testing new ideas and feeds. We are doing this at TJX Europe, and everywhere we look in Europe, we see opportunity.</p>
          <p>Key to our confidence in TJX Europe is that we have a strengthened and more seasoned organization. We are marketing more aggressively, and our customer traffic increases tell us our values are resonating with our consumers. We believe the opportunity for future growth of Europe is vastly underrated by others.</p>
          <p>Further, our view is that, if executed well, the off-price concept can work in almost any country where brands and value matter. We believe that we're the only off-price retailer with the international experience to say that.</p>
          <p>Moving to North America, at TJX Canada, we see plenty of growth ahead. We're very pleased with our Marshalls stores in Canada, which we believe can be a 100-store chain. In the U.S., we are far from finished with growth. Our broad customer demographic reach, as well as TJX's universe of over 15,000 vendors and $25-billion-plus buying pencils gives us tremendous confidence.</p>
          <p>We are not done leveraging Marmaxx, our largest division. We've been achieving tremendous results for the last several years against the backdrop of a difficult economy and the growth of online retailing. We are convinced Marmaxx will continue to deliver strong performance and become an even bigger business.</p>
          <p>New store performance has been phenomenal over the last three years, and we are doing well in many kinds of demographic and geographic markets, including urban and rural. We also have the ability to go into many types of locations with different configurations. All this gives us confidence in Marmaxx's potential to grow to at least 2,400 stores. We'll be discussing Marmaxx's growth potential further on the year-end call in February.</p>
          <p>We believe HomeGoods can grow to 750 stores, nearly double its size, and potentially larger long-term. The strong new store performance in markets we opened last year is extremely encouraging, and other U.S. home retailers are more than twice the size of HomeGoods, speaking to the size of our opportunities to this chain.</p>
          <p>In terms of e-commerce, we see online as another growth catalyst and an additional way to increase our customer base for the future. We're not talk timing today, but we will have more to say about e-commerce on our year-end call.</p>
          <p>Before closing, just a few words on our full-year guidance, which we further raised today. On a 52-week adjusted basis, our new guidance for full-year EPS is in the $2.38 to $2.41 range. That represents a 20% to 21% increase over an adjusted $1.99 last year, well above our growth model of 10% to 13% annual EPS growth. Scott will discuss our guidance in more detail in a moment. As always, we will strive to surpass our goal.</p>
          <p>So, summing up, in the short term, our year-to-date performance is significantly above plan and demonstrates once again our ability to deliver strong comps and margin growth over challenging comparisons. We enter the fourth quarter with tremendous momentum in all our businesses, and we will be aggressively pursuing the plentiful opportunities for the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Our inventories are turning even faster than last year, and consumers will be seeing a constantly changing, exciting merchandise mix every time they shop us throughout the holiday season. I believe our gift-giving selections, brand offerings, and marketing campaigns, and our values are more compelling than ever this holiday selling season. I am convinced we will drive more new customers to our stores and keep them coming back long after December.</p>
          <p>Long-term, I see our growth opportunities as truly remarkable. I hope that what I have shared with you today helps you understand the passion of this management team and organization to constantly execute even better and capitalize on our opportunities. One of our greatest opportunities for the future is our leadership position and off-price experience.</p>
          <p>Importantly, as a management team, we are focused on fewer bigger businesses, all with a very wide demographic reach and very strong short- and long-term economics. Further, we don't believe the drivers of our substantial sales and margin growth are going away. Rather, we will build upon them.</p>
          <p>I'll end by reiterating what I said at the top of this call, which is, as CEO of this company, I am so excited about the future of TJX.</p>
          <p>And now I'll turn it back to Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Carol. Now, to fiscal 2013 guidance, beginning with the full year, we are further raising our guidance for the full-year earnings per share to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.48, which would represent a 23% to 25% increase over the adjusted $1.99 last year. As a reminder, we had previously raised our full-year EPS guidance when we announced October sales a couple of weeks ago.</p>
          <p>Let me recap the key changes versus the guidance we provided on the second quarter earnings call in August. We now estimate consolidated comp store sales growth of 5% to 6% for the full year, compared to our prior guidance of 4% to 5% growth. We also expect pre-tax margins of 11.6% to 11.7%, which is 90 to 100 basis points higher than last year's adjusted margin of 10.7%.</p>
          <p>Now, a few reminders about our full-year guidance; we have a 53rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar, which we expect will benefit the full year and fourth quarter by approximately $0.07 per share. On a 52-week basis, excluding the $0.07 benefit, adjusted full-year EPS guidance would be $2.38 to $2.41, up 20% to 21% over the adjusted $1.99 in fiscal 2012. Our plan assumes a $0.02-per-share negative impact from the higher tax rate of 38.4%.</p>
          <p>Our full-year outlook continues to assume fourth quarter EPS in the range of $0.72 to $0.75, up 16% to 21% over $0.62 last year.  Again, this range includes an estimated $0.07 benefit from the 53rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar. On a 13-week basis for the fourth quarter, excluding the $0.07 benefit, adjusted fourth quarter EPS guidance would be $0.65 to $0.68, up 5% to 10% over $0.62 in fiscal 2012.</p>
          <p>To reiterate what Carol stated, as always, we will strive to exceed our goals. Please note that the numbers I'm about to discuss all include the positive impact of the 53rd week in our fiscal 2013 calendar this year, which, for modeling purposes, represents about 50 basis points in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, to further details on the fourth quarter; we are assuming fourth quarter sales in the $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion range. This is based on estimated comp sales growth of flat to up 2% on both a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group.</p>
          <p>Before I give you our monthly comp guidance, let me update you on the impact of Hurricane Sandy. At the height of the storm, we had several hundred stores closed, but now, fewer than 10 stores are closed, and we expect less than a handful could be closed for an extended period of time. In regions that weren't impacted by the storm, sales trends have been continuing to comp up mid-single-digits. Further, as life became more normalized for people in the impacted areas, our sales returned to our recent solid trends.</p>
          <p>Our comp guidance for November reflects these factors and the unusually warm weather on the West Coast in the beginning of the month, which has now eased. So, for November, we're expecting comps to increase 1% to 2% on a consolidated basis and to be flat to up 1% at The Marmaxx Group.</p>
          <p>In both December and January on a consolidated basis and at The Marmaxx Group, we expect comps to be flat to up 2% over high-single-digit comps last year. Pre-tax margins for the fourth quarter are planned in the 11.6% to 11.9% range, up 30 to 60 basis points over the prior year. We're anticipating fourth quarter gross profit margins to be in the range of 27.5% to 27.7%, up 30 to 50 basis points versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>In terms of SG&amp;A as a percent of sales for the fourth quarter, we are anticipating a rate of 15.7% to 15.8%, flat to 10 basis points better than last year. Foreign exchange rates, assuming current levels, are expected to have a neutral impact on EPS in the fourth quarter, the same as last year.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we're anticipating a tax rate of 38.4% in the fourth quarter, up 110 basis points versus last year and $0.01 negative impact to EPS. Net interest expense is estimated to be approximately $7 million, and we anticipated a weighted average share count of approximately 740 million. Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.</p>
          <p>Now we are happy to take your questions. To keep the call on schedule, we are going to continue to ask you to please limit your questions to one per person. We appreciate your cooperation with that, and thanks, and we will now open it up for questions.</p>

          <p>Great. Thank you so much. Carol, your European business is obviously one of the shining stars in the portfolio, and I'm wondering how you're thinking about the eventual -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly, one of them. It's hard when you have so many proud, proud children. How are you thinking about the eventual expansion of that business, and what is the timeframe under which you might consider pursuing some additional countries for that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Kimberly, I think what Ernie and I see is so much potential in our current countries today. So we've learned how to enter new countries, so we're getting better and better at that. We know how we will position ourselves when we do go to the next country. But more importantly, we don't know where the end game is in our current European businesses, and we really have to understand that before we leap into the next country, because we want to leverage all of that. And very similar to Marmaxx, we think to keep upping our store count and don't know where the end game is, so over time, we'll understand that better. But we're just extremely pleased with the business.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Carol, wondering if you could talk a little bit about the 14% drop in inventory. Do you &#x2013; I presume you do feel comfortable with that level, but given the rate of sales growth that you've seen,  is there any concern that you might potentially have some inventory shortages in the fourth quarter?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>No, in fact, I've recently done a temperature check, and if anything, like Carol said, there's so many goods in the market, we are just really trying to hold ourselves back from buying too much too soon. So &#x2013; and that's from a recent &#x2013; going out there. I try to stay in touch with what the buyers and merchandise managers are feeling, and that's pretty much what we're experiencing right now.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Congratulations and good morning. I'm going to ask one clarification and one question. First, the clarification, Scott, could you provide us with your updated comp and segment margin assumptions for the year? And then my question is &#x2013; I would agree, Carol; I don't think that you guys have too little inventory. I actually think that the stores look better with less inventory. But could you talk about what your in-store inventory turns have been doing &#x2013; I assume that they're accelerating, but kind of like where they are now versus where they were a couple years ago? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Scott has those numbers, but it's pretty staggering, the changes in our inventory. And I'm glad that you noticed that we have a lot of inventories in our store, because I agree with you; I think we can lean them up a bit more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first, Jennifer, to answer your question on the store turns, if you go back a few years at the TJX level, we were turning at the nine times a year, and we've been &#x2013; at the end of last year, we were at fiscal &#x2013; for fiscal 2012, we were between 10 and 11. And right now we're trending, with our current inventory projections, to be approximately 12, so &#x2013; and that improvement has really come across by all the divisions increasing proportionally as we've increased those turns in the last three to four years.</p>
          <p>Now, to your question on the division full-year guidance, so before I review that, just want to point out again, all the numbers I'm giving out are on a 53-week basis. So now let me start with Marmaxx, comps for the full year are 5% to 6%, with the pre-tax margins of 14.4%; again, an 80-basis-points improvement over last year. HomeGoods, 6% to 7% comps; pre-tax margins, 11.9% to 12.05%, 130 to 140 basis points better than last year. TJX Canada, 13.6% to 13.7% ex-FX, or an 80- to 90-basis-points improvement ex-FX -</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, the comp, 4% for Canada. TJX Europe, 8% to 9% comp, 6.0% to 6.2% ex-FX, on again, a 53-week basis; 360 to 380 basis points better ex-FX; and just to repeat what we gave out earlier, 5% to 6% comp for TJX, 90 to 100 basis points better on 11.6% to 11.7% ex-FX.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. One other comment I just want to make, Jennifer, in terms of the inventory is that our biggest investment is still in IT in our supply chain, and this is where we're investing for the future. So we believe that we still have a long way to go, and we can be a lot better at executing. So, again, it's a tremendous opportunity for us. But that's where our money is being invested.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and my congrats as well. One clarification first, I guess from Scott, on the gross margins, I thought you said that all of the gains were from the merchandise margin side, so just curious why there wasn't any occupancy leverage on a 7% comp. And then maybe for Carol, if you talk about the traffic gains or the customer acquisition you talk about, where do you think the share is coming from? I think you've said previously that JCPenney, not really where you're thinking the gains were coming from. So just curious, obviously, the category is growing. You guys are the category, so just wondering where you think from other channels you guys are gaining customers, both here and in Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really across the board, and I think we are just so strong on educating the consumer in terms of the value and the brands and really just, again, coming back to educating the consumer to what off-price is all about. So we're really seeing an increase in all segments. As you all know, we've been going after the younger customer, which really bodes well for our future, and a big chunk of our new customers are younger customers, and we're pursuing this very aggressively. So that's really where the gain is coming from. But it's really across the board. It's not in any specific &#x2013; coming from any specific store or competitor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I would just jump in that we've also talked before about how we trade fairly broadly. So, to what Carol's saying, I don't think we get market share from just one or two retailers specifically, because we are not trying to go to a specific sector of the market with our business. So, again, we do, I think, get from many different marketplaces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, the last piece that you talked about, that why we didn't leverage more in the gross profit margin due to occupancy; again, a common theme here for last quarter, this quarter, our above-plan results, as we have higher incentive accruals that are offsetting some of the gains that we would have seen &#x2013; normally have seen there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is Nancy Hilliker filling in for Oliver Chen. Our question is actually back to the inventory and the micro-merchandising strategies with the new technology. We're really excited about it, and again, congratulations. We'd like to know a little bit about how much data you've seen so far from your investment in this IT technology, whether you've seen that product mixes across different areas are different, and just kind of whether you plan to change the store mix depending on those popular categories, and maybe when we might see more of an impact &#x2013; you said over the next few years, but maybe little more detail on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, we really haven't reaped the benefits of almost everything we're working on yet, and we see that in the future. But we're still all about flexibility, and we're all about off-price, and we're all about the brands, and we'll continue to be that in the future. It will just help us really drive sales per store up. And it doesn't mean that we're changing our concept at all. It's just that we can really take advantage of each store and what's going on in each store. So we haven't really touched benefits of it yet. And the next few years are going to be &#x2013; they are investing. As we said, this year was a big year and we start to flatten out in the future, but that's where our dollars are going.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit more detail about what you talked about, the &#x2013; seeing more traffic from a younger demographic. I think, in the past, you've given some statistics along the lines of about 25% of U.S. shoppers had visited your stores in the last year. Can you compare that to what you see from department stores? Can you also compare that to where it may have been a year ago, what kind of growth you're seeing here? But really the crux of my question is, where is the younger demographic? I assume that's a lower number for younger demographics, but can you talk about the growth that you're seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really &#x2013; I can't compare to what's going on in individual department stores and their statistics. I can only tell you that every year we're increasing additional traffic coming to our stores, so even though &#x2013; that 75% number, each year it just gets a little bit stronger. And of that percent increase, we have a higher percent of younger customers, so as our average age is &#x2013; we are growing, our average age is becoming a little bit lower, and that tells us that we're getting a much younger demographic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you think that's because of the advertising that you're putting behind it, or is that a function of different brands that you're bringing in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's a function of the merchandise is a big part of it. You can sometimes easily just think it's the advertising. I think it's multiple fronts. The advertising does a piece of it. I think the way we've, in the advertising, tried to make use of social media; certainly, that is going to appeal to younger customers. If you look at actually what we've physically done in some of the stores, we've talked about the different things in the stores, The CUBE; clearly, that would appeal to a younger customer. And then just from the &#x2013; which I wouldn't give specifics on, but some of the nature, some of the categories we've gone after also really lines up with the younger audience. So I think, from all those different perspectives, we've been able to capture a younger new customer, specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Michael, like everything else, we are learning how to connect with that consumer. And as we get more information, and it's the same thing as we learn from our mistakes, we're really learning how to connect with that younger customer, and I'm hoping that only improves over time. So we have some very interesting things for holiday up our sleeves to take it even further, so it's pretty exciting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it sounds it. One other follow-up, if I could, just on the e-commerce business, what are you learning in the international business where that's been rolled out, and how do you think that'll help you make some of your decisions in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>We're learning a lot. We're learning a lot. And we're learning about categories, we're learning about how the customer responds, we're learning about value, we're learning about how far we can take it; I can go on and on. But, as everything else in this company, we leverage each other and we learn, and that's why we've put that in place. It's small, but we're learning, and it's going to really help us in the long term.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, great quarter. Just one kind of short-term-oriented question, which is I believe, last year in the fourth quarter, you had particularly strong sales, and some of it came, I guess, from moving some relatively more promoted winter apparel, for example, so the gross margin comparison seems not as challenging, for example, as the sales comparison. Would you tend to agree with that? And I guess the follow-up related to that is, if you were to generate upside in the fourth quarter this year, where do you think the biggest opportunity could be? Is it more sales or is merchandise margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I would hope it's sales. It's always &#x2013; we're being conservative, hopefully. We're going out with a 0% to 2% for the quarter and a 0% to 2% for December. Our trend has obviously been stronger than that, and we're pretty excited about our mix. That's &#x2013; we think, as every year we get better and better at it, so we're hoping that there's certainly upside on the sales, but we will see.</p>

And just to follow up on your comment regarding remodeled stores, could you give us a sense of how many stores have been done, the pace of remodels for 2013, the impact it has to the business, either quantitatively or qualitatively, and the cost involved in a store remodel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I will give you the number, but we don't really discuss the increases quantitatively. We have not put those numbers out. But this year we did a little over 300. At the end of the year, we'll update next year. We probably have pretty similar next year, and we have some other in-store initiatives, even in our remodeled stores, where we are finished with stage one, we certainly have some ideas for stage two and three for the future. So I don't want people to think that we remodeled and we're all done and that's the end of it. I think we have a little over 75% of Marmaxx done today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct, Carol, and almost 70% of &#x2013; as we &#x2013; the last few years, big emphasis on Marmaxx, and now we're &#x2013; this year and the last year we've focused again on Canada as well, and almost 70% of the Canadian stores will be remodeled to the new prototype. And again, that's on top of the &#x2013; what Carol said, the 339 we expect to do this year is on top of almost 400 in the two previous years.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk about, a little bit, how your thinking has evolved, or if it's evolved, in terms of moving beyond some of the core categories where you've obviously excelled &#x2013; apparel, footwear, accessories, home? Have you started at all to think about how to leverage the business in your existing distribution and the framework you've set up with the buyer network in some of the other great categories that are out there, like beauty, cosmetics, skin care? I don't know if there's other ways to think about your business model long term, where it could go.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Well, I think all the categories you just talked about are in our stores. So the idea, obviously, is we have the most flexible floor in the world, and any category that's hot, we're going to go after. So if you look in our stores today &#x2013; and we don't talk about it &#x2013; again, we have many new ideas, new initiatives, and we're open to any category. As you all know, we can take a whole department off the floor one day and put something else on it. That's what's so wonderful about our business. So, hopefully, we're ahead of it all, and I think we are.</p>

          <p>Well, I think we target anywhere between 4% and 5% square footage growth, and hopefully, TJX will keep growing way beyond when &#x2013; on in the 80%s and 90%s. But I think our business is all about finding new ways to continue to grow at a really good, steady pace, and make sure that we're bringing those dollars to the bottom line. So there really isn't a tremendous need for us to start to go 6%, 7%, 8%. We'll talk in the future more about e-commerce and what that means, but we just see that how do we continue 10, 15 years from now to grow this business at the same kind of level, and that's what we're excited about.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks, guys. Carol, you mentioned department stores entering off-price, just wondering if you're seeing anything from a competitive perspective that kind of makes you call that out. Are you seeing them gain any traction in any particular regions or impact any part of your business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really. We sit with the Rack, and we love them as a partner. Most of them &#x2013; we sit next to all our competitors, be it Ross, Burlington. So we like it. It's a mecca. It brings people there. It's not a negative to us in any way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. And then just one follow-up, as you turn inventories faster, are there any parts of your organization that you would consider strained and maybe in need of more investment, or has that groundwork already been established, which is allowing you to turn faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's our investment. When we talk about talent and we talk about systems and IT, systems and logistics, that's where all our investment is going. So we've worked very hard the last many years to increase our talent pool and our bench strength, and that is where our dollars are going. So we're hopefully ahead of it in setting ourselves up for the future. And that's why we think long-term. It's an interesting business, because obviously we're worried about tomorrow, we run and gun every day, we have all that flexibility, but we also want to look many years out and say, what can we be, and are we setting ourselves up for that. So we do a lot of short-term, medium, and long-term planning.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations, everyone, on the terrific results. Couple quick things; can you talk a little bit about the enhancements that you've been making &#x2013; the new stores have done great, the marketing investments are paying off &#x2013; are there more opportunities for more costs to come out of new stores and generate higher returns? And as you see average price point within the store, just as your customer mix is changing, could the average price point move &#x2013; could we see it move higher over time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We want to give extreme value. So I'll never sit there &#x2013; our average price point today and our average ticket is pretty flat, and we love that because what we think we have done is upgraded our mix, but given the customer even better value. So, Dana, my goal wouldn't be to go and increase our ticket. My goal would be to increase the mix and make it a better mix, and still give the customer absolutely incredible value.</p>
          <p>In terms of leveraging costs, we want to drive sales, so our goal is not to pull out the cost of servicing our customer in the stores. You want to service your customers and you want to keep doing a better job, but with that, where we want to invest is to drive sales even harder. So we'll leverage by driving sales a lot harder. We still have our cost initiatives in place. We're still going after a certain goal, and we'll talk about it at the end of the year as we always do when there's still places where we feel that we can cut a bit, but it's not going to be at the expense of the customer for our in-store service.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a follow-up question regarding the hurricane impact, wondering if you are seeing any impact on rising transportation costs in the area impacted by the hurricane, and also, have you seen an uptick in opportunistic buys? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, we haven't really had any increases in the costs in terms of the logistics piece of it. What can I say? When things are disruptive, it usually does benefit TJX. I don't really want to go into detail there. But we will see &#x2013; I just &#x2013; there is a &#x2013; from a vendor perspective and from certain areas of the country, it has been more difficult for people to move goods around, so that usually yields opportunity for us, but we'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I would just say that we were seeing the availability probably building a little even before the hurricane. So it gets &#x2013; so what happens is you don't necessarily know &#x2013; as now, there's even more today. I don't know how much of that's hurricane or just the trend from seeing more availability before the hurricane, so just a lot of goods out there.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh thanks, guys. Just be curious to hear your thoughts on the overall promotional environment, like what you're seeing out there maybe relative to last year and what you're hearing is going to happen for the holiday season.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think every year we hear &#x2013; every year things get more promotional, every year you hear things get more promotional, and I'm going to come back to we will maintain our gap between whatever the prices are out there to give extreme value to the customer. And that's what's wonderful about our business. It's always the gap between where everyone else is and where we are, and Ernie and his team are being very methodical. Again, as he expressed, there's so much &#x2013; so many goods and brands out there that we're excited about that our job is really to do it right and keep our guys home a bit and buy it right and give the customer outrageous value. So we don't get ourselves caught up in worrying about what's promotional out there. We worry about giving our customer the best value we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you, Howard, one thing we've talked about with these &#x2013; earlier on the call with the fast turns, and Carol was talking about how we watch the environment on that. The fast turns and the closer-in buying we're doing allows us even better to handle any type of promotional environment changes. So, again, it goes back to the model is so flexible, and we're even a little bit more flexible and close-in than we've been in the past, so that really helps us with any type of change in the promotional activity around us to ensure that we're always giving the out-the-door values that we should be.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, congratulations. I had two quick questions. On the marketing you've talked about for the fourth quarter, I was just curious if you were planning on spending more this year versus last year and if the impressions were going to be up this year versus last year. And then can you just touch on &#x2013; you've talked about, briefly, The CUBE, and I think you mentioned The RUNWAY, but can you just talk about some of the smaller segments or some not-so-small segments like shoes &#x2013; the footwear segment, which has been a big push on your side, and then personal care and jewelry, which personal care in particular looks fantastic in your stores, just any insights there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marni, we don't talk about our individual categories and initiatives. That's our secret sauce, so to speak, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're still happy those segments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're very happy. We've got few things up our sleeve, so. In our marketing, we're up slightly on the cost, and our impressions are up. They're up about the 10% in Marmaxx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Ernie has a couple of marketing numbers. You want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So, Marni, basically what it is, is our TV impressions are up, like Carol said, pretty significantly. Overall, our impressions are up only a little bit, but we're strategically going where we think the money is going to give us a better payback on the messaging that we're trying to get out there. You had also asked about the spend. You asked in the fourth quarter. Our spend is up &#x2013; we won't give the exact number, but it's up a decent amount, I would say, for fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I hope everybody &#x2013; we went on TV yesterday. I think everyone's going to be blown away when they see our TV ads, our campaigns, because we are really excited about it. We think that it's quite breakthrough. So -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have you changed any of the shows that you're putting the television ads on, to target some of the younger customers you keep talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Let me add my congratulations on a terrific quarter. Carol, I appreciated your proactiveness and comments in addressing why you think comps and margin growth is going to continue over the long term. So just a follow-up on that, as we head into 2013 and anniversary exceptionally strong comp and margin growth, how do you feel about your ability to grow margins if your comp was to moderate to a low-single-digit level, as you're guiding to in 4Q? It's clear that there is a long-term merchandise margin opportunity through many of the initiatives that you've laid out, but how much room do you think there is for merchandise margin in 2013, and how does your fixed cost leverage point look like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll talk about that at the year-end call when we talk about next year, but every year &#x2013; you know what our model is, it's a 10% to 13% growth, and we certainly strive to beat that. And the guys have a lot of things in place, and we're certainly working on next year, and we're pretty excited about it &#x2013; more to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, just seeing that you've already achieved a peak margin in Europe in the third quarter, how do you feel about the potential for upside to your targets in Europe longer-term for profit margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I think in the past we've talked about peak margins in Marmaxx quite a few times, and we kept beating it. I think in the last three years we've increased their segment profit like 400 basis points. So we don't know the end game in Europe. And Ernie was just over there. I was just over there. I think the two of us get a little giddy at the possibilities and the opportunity. So I don't know what the end game is. I just know that we see a lot, and we're very excited about it. So we'll use the word peak today. Hopefully, next year, we'll use a new peak.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I've got a question about how you're thinking about the incremental costs from healthcare legislation next year, and what the scenarios are, and whether or not you think that'll be a material impact on the results next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, we have &#x2013; we're certainly staying on top of it, and as Carol said, we don't think it's a material amount, and we'll certainly address it more in the February conference call.</p>
