        <plist>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I think we could start. Good morning altogether. I hope you all had a good night in Munich after our dinner event yesterday evening. I would like to welcome you all to the financial analyst meeting for the business year 2008. Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, Board Member for Finance at BMW AG will be speaking to you about the company's business and financial performance in 2008. Let's first take a look at today's agenda. First Dr. Reithofer will be speaking to you about what the company has done so far in handling the current situation and our management plans to guide the BMW Group through these exceptional times.</p>
          <p>Dr. Reithofer will also give an update on the role the BMW Group will have as a premium car company in the future. Afterwards, Dr. Friedrich Eichiner will be speaking to you about the financial and business performance during 2008 and what business steps we are taking to secure our solid financial position for 2009 and onwards. Afterwards, you are invited to join us for lunch. To have some more time for the Q&amp;A session, both Dr. Reithofer and Dr. Eichiner will only speak for 10 &#x2013; for 20 minutes each. So I think we could start. Dr. Reithofer, please the podium is yours.</p>
          <p>Dr. &#x2013; Ing. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management Short speeches today because we thought it doesn't make sense to give you the same information like yesterday. Ladies and gentlemen, once again good morning and welcome to BMW world. I'm sure you have followed our annual press conference and the media coverage from yesterday. Today, Mr. Eichiner and I would like to give you just a brief overview of the main facts. This way we will have more time to discussion, Mr. Sch&#xF6;berl mentioned that.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to concentrate on three main topics. First, what is important to consider in the current situation? Second, how does strategy Number ONE secure our future success? And third, how do we view the business development for the rest of the year? Let's get straight to the first point.</p>
          <p>Without a doubt, the global economic crisis poses exceptional challenges. How has the BMW Group stayed the course? First in 2008, the BMW Group achieved an EBIT of 921 million. Without the additional provisions, our 2008 results would have been significantly higher. But fact is that we are in a strong operating position. Second, the Group's financial footing is absolutely sound. At the end of 2008, our liquidity was about &#x20AC;8.1 billion. Obviously, liquidity and free cash flow are top priorities in such economic times as these.</p>
          <p>Third, we are able to reduce costs, investments and capital expenditure per car. Our fixed and material costs declined significantly. It is already clear that we will considerably exceed our goal for 2012 to reduce material costs by &#x20AC;4 billion. Fourth, we are able to reduce our fourth quarter inventory below the third quarter level. Compared to 2007, our inventories remained stable while competitors' stocks increased noticeably. Fifth, in 2008, we sold more than 1.43 million cars. This is the second-best result in our company's history. We still remain the number one in the premium segment. Our goal is to strengthen and expand our market share in the individual markets.</p>
          <p>Sixth, we are the industry leader in terms of CO2 emission reductions. In 2008, we invested less than the year before. However, we are now harvesting the fruits of our previous &#x20AC;1.2 billion investment in environmentally friendly technologies. EfficientDynamics is now working for us. Seventh, as regards of jobs reductions, we exceeded our target. I mean you can remember last year, a lot of people thought, "Will BMW achieve the target?"</p>
          <p>Yes, we were able to achieve the target. Between the end of 2007 and the end of 2008, our head count decreased by 7,498 to 100,041. By December 31, 2008, approximately 4,000 employees had signed mutual termination agreements. In other words, we managed to streamline all areas of our company. In the headquarters alone, we were able to eliminate 500 positions. We also made best use of the flexibility temporary work offers and reduced a total of 6,000 jobs in this area. If you add both together, we have a figure of 10,000. If you add on top that we sold our IT company, we are roughly, we have a figure of 12,000. That means clearly, we overachieved our target of 8,100. On the other hand, we will continue to hire new staff, primarily engineers in 2009.</p>
          <p>Eighth, for the business year 2008, we will not pay out a profit-sharing bonus for all employees, including management. All of us at BMW AG have to make financial sacrifices during such times. The amount increases according to salary group and management level within the company. It's for us in such a situation a logical step.</p>
          <p>Our business activities are and will remain focused on the long term. This brings me to my second point. How can we guarantee our future success in light of the changes and new challenges in this current business environment? Our strategy Number ONE gives us a clear vision for the year 2020. We have implemented specific projects supporting all four pillars. First pillar, growth. The global car market will continue to grow, and along with it, the demand for premium products and services. The real question, that is at least how we see it, the real question is how will premium be defined in the future? Sustainability will definitely play a key role in defining premium. This applies to both environmentally friendly drive systems and of course production processes. The BMW Group is already the world's most sustainable car company. 2008 marks the fourth consecutive year the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes ranked us as the global industry leader and we have been in this index since its birth in 1999.</p>
          <p>In the automotive markets, there seems to be an interest in smaller and highly efficient cars. This is only part of the full picture. Our premium brand MINI is highly successful in the small car segment. The BMW 1 Series has been our premium offering in the compact class for a few years now. In 2008, sales of the BMW 1 Series increased by about 36%. Today, the BMW 1 Series makes up almost 19% of our portfolio. And 2009, we will see the launch of a new model in the compact class, the BMW X1.</p>
          <p>Another trend is innovation. Our new BMW 7 Series is a clear statement for the further innovation development of automobiles in general. The new BMW 7 Series is already the segment leader in Europe. In 2009, we are launching a versatile and highly variable car, the BMW 5 Series GT. Once again, we are defining an entirely new segment.</p>
          <p>Design is, and will remain, a key factor in people's buying decision. We plan to strongly focus on design in the years to come and continue to be a trendsetter in the area of design. The new BMW Z4 is a perfect example for the direction we want to take.</p>
          <p>Our strategy's second pillar, shaping the future. Shaping the future of the individual mobility, this can only be achieved by reducing fuel consumption and emissions. We even exceeded the ACEA voluntary commitment. We show you figures today, and we will be able to meet the new EU emission performance requirements for 2012, and of course 2015. Excess penalties are not and will not be an issue for the BMW Group. That means we don't have to pay neither in 2012 nor in 2015.</p>
          <p>The Federal Motor Transport Authority in Germany has confirmed our lead in the field of emission reduction. In Germany, our cars' average fuel consumption is 5.9 liters per 100 kilometers, with CO2 emissions of 158 grams per kilometer. The average of cars in Germany is on the level of 165 grams per kilometer in the year 2008. I mean here, you can see the picture and you can compare the different car companies, where they are, and if you have in mind what we invested, you know what lies ahead for the one or the other car company, if 2012 and 2015 will come. If we begin to compare horsepower to horsepower, along with CO2 emission levels, there is not a single engine from our competitors that can beat our engines when it comes to performance and fuel economy.</p>
          <p>This is EfficientDynamics at work. 49 models comply with the EU5 emission requirements. The BMW 330d with the optional BluePerformance technology even meets the EU6 standard taking effect in 2014. Hybrid technology allows us to tap further efficiency potentials of up to 20%. This is another step in our EfficientDynamics program. BMW's first two hybrid cars will go into serious production this year, the new BMW 7 Series and the X6.</p>
          <p>Our long-term goal is sustainable mobility and Project i is our tool to reach this goal. The MINI E is the first result of Project i. 500 customers are currently testing the MINI E. This makes us a carmaker with the largest fleet of electric cars. The second specific result of Project i will be our so-called Megacity Vehicle. This car will be the first of an entire range of close to near-zero emission cars available with a fully electric drive or a high-efficiency combustion engine. Large-scale production could start in the first half of the next decade. With the Megacity Vehicle, we are also pursuing a radical approach toward establishing a truly sustainable value chain from development to production and sales.</p>
          <p>Next pillar, profitability. Once again we will focus strongly on improving our profitability this year. Our long-term profitability targets for 2012 remain unchanged despite the current weakness of the market. In 2012, we want to post a return on capital employed of 26% in the Automobile segment and an EBIT-based return on sales of 8 to 10% in the Automobile segment.</p>
          <p>The next pillar is access to technologies and customers. And then in our current situation, if you see the supply industry, it is a very important pillar in our opinion. As laid down in strategy Number ONE, we continue to put the customer first. The fourth pillar of our strategy is about guaranteeing access to technologies and customers. We want to offer our customers a wider range of mobility services and generate new businesses. Let me give you an example, our after-sales business. Services and spare parts accounted for a contribution to operating income of &#x20AC;90 million in 2008, of course on top. Our goal is to increase after-sales revenues by 20% by 2014.</p>
          <p>We will continue to cooperate with other carmakers in the future, whenever necessary and reasonable. The objective is to achieve a win-win situation. At present, we are developing our MINI engines together with PSA and we entered into a purchasing cooperation with Daimler a while ago. This cooperation will be expanded, as we will gradually increase the share of parts and components we purchase together. Ladies and gentlemen, the successful implementation of our strategy shows that in these difficult times the BMW Group is setting the course for long-term growth and maintaining its independence. The activities launched in the course of the past weeks and months will have positive effects on our business development in the medium term. Last but not least, my third point for the day, what is our forecast for the business year 2009?</p>
          <p>2009 will be a transition year. This is why we have clear priorities, clear priorities, liquidity, free cash flow and working capital, fixed costs and investments. We expect the recovery period to start in 2010. Unfortunately, the current downturn in business still continues. And as a result, there still exists uncertainty in the overall market. Therefore, it makes no sense to offer a reliable forecast for 2009 right now. For this reason, we have developed several action plans on market development. At present, we expect automotive sales to decline by 10 to 20% in 2009. We do not expect to match our 2008 sales volume this year. However, from 2010 on, our sales will pick up pace, thanks to our new products. This momentum will increase with the high profit contribution models to be launched between 2010 and 2012. So we remain confident and our profitability targets for 2012 remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our strategy Number ONE is a clear roadmap to the future and because of this, the BMW Group is well positioned to stay the course and meet successfully the challenges ahead. And this is why we will continue to be a strong and sustainable company with three outstanding brands: BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce. Thank you for your attention.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer, and now Friedrich Eichiner.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to the BMW Group's financial analyst meeting 2009 as well. Let me start by making two important statements. First, a decline in retail and unusually high charges characterized 2008 for the BMW Group and the entire industry. We accrued substantial additional risk provisions, recognized substantial one-off expenses for our voluntary personnel reduction. Second, management focused on cutting cost, adjusting production, reducing inventories and resolutely managing liquidity. We thus prepared the company with foresight for the challenging business we see in this year. We worked hard on our cost structures and improved our efficiency even further.</p>
          <p>Let me start with our Group earnings in 2008. Group revenues nearly &#x20AC;53.2 billion. This represents a 5% decrease compared to the previous year. Net of currency effects, Group revenues would have dropped by only 0.8%. Despite the high one-off charges caused by the financial crisis, we achieved a Group EBIT of &#x20AC;921 million. This corresponds to a profit before tax that was clearly positive at &#x20AC;351 million, but was 91% down year-on-year. This was caused by the decline in retail and the unusually high charges mentioned earlier, which amounted to more than &#x20AC;2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let me review the one-off charges that had the largest impact on our earnings. We accrued additional risk provisions for our Financial Services business. More than &#x20AC;1.97 billion were additionally recognized for residual value and credit default risks. I will say more on this shortly. We spent some &#x20AC;455 million on personnel measures as part of our severance program. We expect this to result in &#x20AC;500 million annual savings moving forward.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at their core, the Group's operating activities were very successful. The following adjustments show the company's operational strengths. Without the aforementioned additional charges, Group EBIT would have totaled &#x20AC;3.3 billion. On this basis, the EBIT margin would have been 6.3%. This proves that the company fared well and demonstrated its operating strengths in a very challenging business environment. Initiatives from strategy Number ONE made a major contribution to this. They enabled us to optimize costs even further. By taking action early on, we improved the company's performance once again. This brings me to a particular item on the income statement. Researching and developing new technologies and options to meet customer wishes is extremely important when it comes to securing our company's future, especially now.</p>
          <p>Research and development costs according to IFRS amounted to &#x20AC;2.8 billion. They were thus &#x20AC;95 million lower year-on-year. The ratio of R&amp;D costs to revenues according to IFRS was 5.3%. This puts us in the R&amp;D ratio target range of 5 to 5.5%, which we aim to achieve by 2012. The capitalization ratio was 42.7%. We continued to invest in future technologies and efficient drive systems. In the process, we benefited from significant improvements in efficiency in research and development. We want to maintain our technology lead, especially as regards efficient and alternative drive technologies, lightweight construction and active safety systems. They give us a clear competitive advantage. In the future, we will leverage more synergies and make significant improvements in enhancing efficiencies.</p>
          <p>We will change the structure of our income statement from the interim report in the first quarter of 2009 onwards. The change relates to the separate statement of our research and development costs. Since we adopted IFRS in 2001, you have seen them as a separate item on the income statement in our financial statements. We were asked by the German Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel to disclose research and development costs under sales costs in the future. We decided to comply with the request from fiscal 2009 onwards. In addition, we will make sure that research and development costs are transparent to you through relevant commentary in the notes.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group is maintaining stakeholder-oriented approach and considering shareholder interests appropriately despite the difficult environment. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are proposing a dividend of &#x20AC;0.30 per share of common stock and a &#x20AC;0.32 per share of preferred stock. The dividend payment totals &#x20AC;197 million.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, building on the initiatives and objectives of our Number ONE strategy, we realized further cost savings and improved our efficiency in 2008. This enabled us to partially compensate for the negative effects. For instance in 2008, we reduced fixed costs compared with the previous year. This is reflected in the sales costs and administrative costs adjusted to exclude the one-off expense presented in the company statement.</p>
          <p>We also realized substantial savings in material costs. We optimized our value-added chain lastingly in terms of costs, quality and innovations. In addition, we achieved substantial productivity improvements in our in-house manufacturing. Furthermore, we will benefit even more from the use of industrial construction kits and increased component sharing between our model series in the future.</p>
          <p>But cost structures were not the only area we worked on in order to prepare ourselves for the difficult environment. We strengthened our robust financial position even further. Despite the turmoil on capital markets, we managed to strengthen our liquidity and expanded proactively for 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the Group had &#x20AC;8.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. I will come back to this point shortly.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, now I would like to comment on the financials of our individual segments. Let me start with the Automobile business. In this segment, we posted revenues of &#x20AC;48.8 billion, falling 9.4% short of the high level achieved in the previous year. At &#x20AC;690 million, EBIT was &#x20AC;2.76 billion down year-on-year. ROCE of the Automobile segment was 4.9% compared with 24.7% a year earlier. Net of the one-off charges I mentioned earlier, ROCE would have amounted to 14.6%.</p>
          <p>The significant decline in earnings reflects the substantial burdens experienced in the last financial year. This slide shows some of the causes of the sharp decline in earnings. The decline in retail, as well as mix and price-related effects reduced earnings by &#x20AC;1.45 billion. The additional risk provision for residual values decreased our earnings by &#x20AC;911 million. The additional currency charge of &#x20AC;387 million foreshadowed over the course of the year primarily stems from the U.S. dollar and the British pound. The severance payment mentioned earlier had a negative effect of &#x20AC;452 million in the Automobiles segment. Depreciation and amortization had a further adverse effect on earnings of &#x20AC;16 million. Raw material price increases had an earnings-reducing impact of &#x20AC;196 million.</p>
          <p>Conversely, efficiency enhancements had a positive effect of &#x20AC;801 million. What I said regarding the Group as a whole also applies to the Automobiles segment. Our overall operating performance improved. We succeeded in becoming even more efficient and reducing fixed costs even more. We improved efficiency by &#x20AC;450 million compared with 2007.</p>
          <p>We increased productivity by 7 to 8%, although we manufactured far fewer units than originally planned. Therefore, this rise should be viewed even more positively. Moreover, we stepped up efforts to manage working capital efficiently very early on. Our proactive and foresighted management activities involved decreasing production, optimizing receivables management and reducing inventories in good time. This decreased our net current assets by nearly &#x20AC;1.2 billion. In light of the significant decline in retail, the Automobiles segment had a moderate level of free cash flow of minus &#x20AC;81 million as of December 31. Free cash flow was only marginally negative in the fourth quarter as well. In sum, this development is proof of our solid finance management. We are better positioned in this area than many competitors.</p>
          <p>Our &#x20AC;9 billion in net financial assets in the Automobiles segment give us a solid position from which to tackle the challenges of 2009. Due to the introduction of new segment reporting from the 2008 annual financial statements onwards, we now report net financial assets for the Automobiles segment and no longer do so for the Industrial Operations sub-group. The method for calculating net financial assets was adjusted to the practices common in the auto sector. Now, only internal receivables and liabilities from financing activities are netted against each other. The positive development in 2008 was driven by the higher level of cash and cash equivalents and the rise in internal net financial receivables of the Automobiles segment companies.</p>
          <p>Net financial receivables of the Automobiles segment now equals &#x20AC;8.2 billion. It includes some &#x20AC;4.7 billion of receivables from Other Entities, which are primarily due to the reassignment of subsidiaries as part of an internal restructuring. The internal loan to the Financial Services business amounts to some &#x20AC;3.5 billion and is on a level of the third quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Financial liabilities also grew year-on-year, increasing to about &#x20AC;4.8 billion. The rise stems from capital market borrowings by companies that belong to the Automobiles segment. Therefore, in 2008, our net financial assets totaled &#x20AC;9 billion. Given the difficult business environment, our financial management focused especially on maintaining a high level of liquidity and widely diversified financing. Furthermore, we strengthened our cash and cash equivalents substantially in 2008. This was achieved through successful capital market transactions with international investors and the expansion of the customer deposit business.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the Financial Services segment. We concluded just under 1.2 million new contracts with end customers, 10.3% more than a year earlier. Contracts on hand with customers and dealers thus rose by 15.2% to a total of 3.03 million units. The business volume based on balance sheet carrying amounts rose 12.3% to &#x20AC;57.6 billion. We steered growth more towards credit financing via our proactive management in this area. The lease penetration rate was thus essentially flat. In total, the penetration rate rose to 48.5% in the year under review. The Financial Services segment recorded a negative profit before tax of &#x20AC;292 million.</p>
          <p>The main reason for the drop in earnings was the negative impact of the additional risk provision of &#x20AC;1,057 million. The rise in refinancing costs also played a role. Credit risks had a negative impact of &#x20AC;363 million. The risk provision for the leasing portfolio's residual value losses was the single largest item. Expenses for the entire volume of leases on hand totaled 694 million. Contractual risks were primarily in the USA, UK, Germany and Canada. We accrued an additional risk provision of &#x20AC;580 million in the fourth quarter alone.</p>
          <p>Without these additional charges, our EBT for 2008 in this segment would have amounted to &#x20AC;768 million, which would have been a year-on-year improvement of 3.4%. On this basis, the return on equity would have been 19.1%.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, from our current perspective, we have sufficiently considered the foreseeable exposure of all our contracts to residual value risks with the risk provision we have built in both segments. We observed a marginal improvement on the U.S. used car market in January and February. The average residual value loss per vehicle declined slightly. This is in line with our forecasts. Based on our assumptions, the situation on this market should stabilize and eventually improve over the medium term.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are aware of the volatility of this business field. Therefore, we cannot completely rule out further residual value risks in 2009. In the end, this will depend on the development of the markets. Last year, we further made a proactive move to reduce the number of lease agreements in the USA in favor of credit financing. This will result in a significant decline in lease returns in 2011 compared to 2008. As a precautionary measure, we significantly lowered the residual values included in those lease agreements concluded last year. This reduces the residual value risk for new contracts.</p>
          <p>In the last few months, we have taken a series of measures on the U.S. market in order to bolster our residual values. We adjusted monthly lease installments in order to take the residual value trend and the rise in refinancing costs into account. We refined our used car strategy for the American market. Its measures support the marketing of returns. Our successful CPO program is one of the elements. CPO stands for Certified Pre-Owned. We offer these cars with an extended warranty once they have gone through an extensive maintenance procedure. Last year, we delivered more than 104,000 CPO cars in the USA, 14% more than in 2007. We see strong demand for our CPO vehicles at present. This enabled us to reduce inventories in the USA and the number of our vehicles in stock at dealerships substantially.</p>
          <p>BMW and MINI currently rank among the top five brands with the lowest number of days in inventory in the USA, the source is Autodata, February. In addition, we reduced the risk of credit losses even further by making our credit award process even stricter. Our rigorous creditworthiness checks ensure that we are only exposed to manageable risks when entering into new credit arrangements. The credit loss rate rose to 0.59% compared with 0.46% in the previous year. However, we cannot rule out a further increase in credit defaults due to the global economic situation.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, despite these effects, the field of Financial Services is attractive to the BMW Group, both now and in the future. Leasing gives us the opportunity to put a well-to-excellently equipped car into the hands of our customer every three years. In contrast, vehicles purchased with cash are usually kept by the first owner by an average of over five years. On average, extras ordered for purchased cars are 40% lower than those for leased cars. The loyalty rates for leased cars are encouragingly high, at over 75%. All in all, the environment on the leasing market has changed because a number of competitors have abandoned the business. Leasing is and will remain a good tool for the BMW Group to ensure customer loyalty over the medium term. Despite higher refinancing costs and the additional risk provisions, the Financial Services segment is profitable in organic terms and is an important element of our Group strategy.</p>
          <p>The dependence on money and capital markets becomes especially evident in light of the world financial market crisis. The BMW Group has managed to refinance itself without a problem since last September, but at much higher cost. In light of the more favorable basis, interest rates caused by the interest rate cuts implemented by the central banks, we expect that the rise in financing costs will remain within limits.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, we diversified our refinancing tools. This included the customer deposit business in Germany and the U.S., as well as the issuance of benchmark bonds, private placements, commercial paper, ABS and bank loans. These instruments and our numerous contacts with investors will enable us to secure seamless financing going forward as well. Financial Services now account for about two-thirds of total assets. Therefore, we are looking into the further development of the structure of the Financial Services business. In so doing, we aim to make progress in optimizing refinancing and improve risk management.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, what awaits us in 2009 and how we will react to the challenges? This year, we expect the market to shrink by 10 to 20% compared to 2007. We have initiated measures that will help minimize the negative effect on earnings. And we will maintain this course with resolve. Processes to prioritize costs have been introduced successfully across all levels. Cost control will be a top priority in the next few months as well. We are consistently continuing the efficiency enhancement measures introduced by strategy Number ONE.</p>
          <p>We expect our cooperation with Daimler AG to result in cost advantages as well. We will leverage economies of scale when purchasing jointly developed parts. We have been regularly holding talks on pooling purchasing volumes with Daimler AG. Both parties have identified a double-digit number of suitable components. None of these components help differentiate between the brands or are relevant from a customer perspective. Both companies will benefit from this in the foreseeable future. We are making a huge effort to further optimize the use of our capital. We have identified the potential to reduce capital expenditure in 2009 to less than &#x20AC;4 billion compared with 2008. In light of the large number of vehicle projects, this is an ambitious goal, which we will achieve through efficiency improvements and optimization measures. Nevertheless, we will continue to invest in our future.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our strategy Number ONE, we are looking into the future with confidence. We are certain of having the right strategy and the best products also and especially given the difficult global environment. This forces us to make some significant cuts. Cost management is our top priority today and in months to come. Our staff understands how necessary this is. We will continue to chart our existing course for cost reduction and efficiency optimization on this basis. We continue to actively manage net current assets and free cash flow. Safeguarding and increasing our liquidity is also extremely important. In so doing, we are setting the stage for giving the BMW Group the best possible position for the financial year and afterwards.</p>
          <p>The Board of Management of the BMW Group and all its employees will fight for every vehicle sold, for every cent saved and for every cent earned. If the economic environment should worsen,</p>
          <p>we will reassess the situation and work on the basis of a new scenario if needed. We view the current situation as an opportunity, as a fitness program for our company. We'll use this year to optimally align the BMW Group for the challenges we face today and prepare for the growth opportunities we will have tomorrow. We continue to invest in our future-oriented areas since they are the key to our future success. With our strategy Number ONE, we are charting the</p>
          <p>right course, also in light of the challenges in 2009. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you very much, Friedrich Eichiner. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have enough time for our Q&amp;A session until 12 o'clock, look. Okay, I think we start with Arndt Ellinghorst. I don't know and then the other, Michael Raab, Horst Schneider, okay Arndt Ellinghorst, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks a lot. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse. Dr. Reithofer, I think we talked many times about BMW's practices in selling cars, especially with leasing for many years now. And the one major criticism from the financial market has been that there's always been sort of a sense that you've been selling above natural demand by using very cheap leasing rates and also financing rates. Now it appears that a car company like BMW, not just BMW, but many others as well are still just charging not the real cost of capital really by using Financial Services. So, isn't it really the case that you have to increase leasing rates, financing rates to really reflect the level of your cost of capital in future? And if you do that, to get to a better pricing level, how much could that hurt your volumes in the long run? In other terms, aren't you just &#x2013; aren't your products just probably 30% too expensive, your customers can't really afford it. So you offer cheap leasing financing, and in real terms, your products would have to be probably 30% cheaper in the longer run. And secondly, a more technical question, your 4.7 billion receivables to the other Group companies, I mean firstly, what are the other Group companies, what are the 4.7 billion for, and when is this cash coming back, and where should it come from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we'll start with Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you asked about the leasing business. Now let me take the example of the U.S. market. Over years, we really achieved a very profitable leasing business there, although it's &#x2013; the U.S. market contributed by, with 40% of the profit of the Financial Services business there. And we achieved to really stabilize very solid and high residual values. So, I think from this perspective, the business model was okay. Now what's happened in the last year, the problem is that the used car market has fallen down significantly, as well as the new car market. And now, as you know, we have now the possibility to stop maturities coming out of contracts, as we are able to stop production, the demand on used &#x2013; on the new car side is going &#x2013; going down. So those maturities came out, and the market was not prepared, the market was not there. Demand was low, and then the prices went down. That is the situation we went into &#x2013; in the last &#x2013; especially in the last quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, asking for the interest rate charges, we are touching interest rates, and we are working on arm's length principles. And we increased in the meantime our leasing rates in the U.S. as well, and we are &#x2013; we started rebalancing the amount of leased cars against our loan portfolio in the U.S. And so the outcome will be that in 2011, the maturities will be significantly lower with a middle two-digit number in, against the high volumes we see in 2008 and possibly in 2009. So that, we did some rebalancing, and I think we increased leased rates. It was one of the countermeasures we've taken in 2008 in order to come to the right approach for the leasing business. So that is for me one point. Now the question about the holding companies and the financings there, though, we have &#x2013; in the other companies, we have pressured the holding companies to a big part of the financing business for us. And that is where the receivables are. And we, on the other hand, as I mentioned to you, only 3.5 &#x2013; 3.5 billion of those receivables are directly in the Financial Services business. We are now on our way to think about certain restructuring, as I mentioned, how we in the future can shape a kind might be of a finance holding in order to come to a better organizational approach to the whole funding business. And one of the targets of this attempt is to get a better consolidation and better, I would say, risk management in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may just ask another question there. So if you're saying within the other companies there are Group financing companies as well, I mean on to 4.7 billion, then really sort of money to a Financial Services subsidiary that you put into the other segment, but is really Financial Services of nature.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, many of you are aware that the major part of our &#x2013; of the refinancing funding is for Financial Services business; it's very clear. So, the other companies are still working to achieve good financing for the Financial Services business as well. That's true, I agree.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the leasing, just one more thing on the leasing side, it's not just the U.S. in my view. It's also, if you look at Europe or Germany, we talk about 70, 80% of your business to corporate customers, which is basically a legal thing in Germany. And my observation is just that this business has turned more and more towards somehow getting the new cars into the market with the leasing financing deal and private customers then buying the car after a year or two with a 30, 40% discount. Isn't that really the practice where we are right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have a bit to differentiate. So, if you look into the lower segments of our business, if you look at the MINI business, if you look at 1 Series business, right, there's a different picture that we see there. We have much more cash power there. But if you go up, look at 7 Series business, 5 Series business, usually, you have business people buying those cars and they try to finance. So that is part of their model. And put it the other way around, if BMW would not be able to offer attractive leasing or financing, we are absolutely clear the customer would move to another brand. So that is the competition we are in. So it's not for me an opportunity to step out of leasing business or step out of financing. It's the question how we balance the business and how we manage the risk in that business and the cost. That is what we try to tackle now with &#x2013; what I said to you with the restructuring effort we are on our way to undertake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; another point is important, our market performance and Norbert Reithofer will give you some information.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I would like to tell you again what happened in the year 2008. I mean if I see the worldwide luxury car market, we had in principle two halves last year. The first half of 2008 minus 2% from a volume point of view, luxury car market declined. And in November, December, only to give you the two numbers, minus 25 and minus 26%. I mean from September onwards, something happened in the market. I mean and we all know what happened in September in the United States of America.</p>
          <p>So, and that was something, I am more than 20 years in the car industry. I &#x2013; in 20 years, I have not seen such a thing happen, that we lose 25% volume in the luxury car market. That is one thing in my opinion. So and then, if you see the markets in 2008, then you can see it started in the United States of America. By the way it started already last year in January. I mean I was in the United States in September 2007. And we were together with our dealers. And our dealers said, "Be happy with cars, you can sell still in the year 2007 because 2008 will be not such a nice year for the car industry." And we thought, "Can it be the case?" It was the case. That means in the United States it started.</p>
          <p>What is the biggest car market of BMW? It was the United States of America. That means we were affected first because of our pure volume in the United States. Then, what is our second biggest car market, Germany, and our third biggest car market, the United Kingdom. So it means, our three big car markets were affected one market after the other. We have to see that. So, and if I see the volume losses and the volume gains in the United States of America, we told you during the quarterly conference calls that we took out cars out of the United States of America, 45,000 units in total in the year 2008. As you know, we started early to do so, and we were able to gain on the volume side, for example in a market like China or in a market like Russia. The real challenge for the car industry at the moment that the volume reductions are a worldwide challenge. So, in the year 2008, we were happy that in the first half of the year, Europe was still as a car market, intact, it was okay. So, but in the meantime, we all know that Europe is not okay anymore. So, and that is a real challenge what we face at the moment. Only, and we all face that challenge. And Mr. Ellinghorst, if it comes to volume, you know my opinion. For me, volume is not everything for a premium car manufacturer. We have to balance cost of retail, we have to balance mix and we have to balance volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question comes from Michael Raab and then Horst Schneider. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Michael Raab from Kepler. I've got two questions. First of all, you're claiming that you've made good progress in the fourth quarter in de-stocking and reducing inventories. Apparently, this should have helped your automotive free cash flow in a positive way. On the other hand, it's noticeable that your dealer financing increased over-proportionately. Is it fair to assume that you moved inventories from your own stock to dealers? And the second thing talking about dealers, walking around seeing a couple of dealers talking to them, it's quite interesting to find that apparently, you've started to do now in the cash market what you've only, say, more or less renowned for in the Financial Services segment; that is offering very aggressive discounts. My question is, coming back on residual values, if you discount a 5 Series in the cash market with like 17 to 20% initially, aren't you creating your residual value problem of tomorrow because you're diluting your brand image and your pricing perception in the eyes of the customer? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's Eichiner, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, if you look at our numbers and you find out that we've not increased our stock because we produced exactly the level of costs we've sold in 2008. So there is a balance in unit production. We are not in a position that we really increased heavily production over the retails we had in 2008. So we secured the level that we achieved at the end of 2007. And so, that is, I think very different to some competitors who pushed heavily over the retails in 2008. So having said this, it means that dealer inventory is nearly on the same level. Now of course the demand is going down on the dealer side as well. In January and February, we see demand slipping down, and we have to adjust the production accordingly. And this is &#x2013; I think a process is going on and we are still trying to keep the balance between sales and production, and that is the part-time work we've now introduced in order to achieve this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe following up on that one, I have one dealer in Frankfurt telling me that he was supplied about 500 pre-produced vehicles, which is quite unusual because actually, I would think you guys are billing to order. So apparently, in doing so, you are increasing &#x2013; re-increasing capacity utilization. But my question is what is the cost of opportunity of doing so? I mean apparently, you will have to discount those vehicles if you want to sell them off nowadays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you should do the following exercise. I mean to move away now from one single dealer, you should do the following exercise. You should compare car companies and you should compare retail and registrations, and then look into the different car companies and have a look at the retail figures and the registrations of the cars. And you will see between the car companies, for example in January and February 2009 differences. And retail means the end customer, a real customer. Registrations can &#x2013; and on the football field as we all know, and then can go into a market as a young used car. So look into the figures and compare registrations and retail, it's very interesting. At least it was for me very interesting. And if it comes to dealer, our figures for 2008 shows &#x2013; show us that we were able to reduce our own stock compared to end of 2007 and that we were able to reduce the dealer stock as well. So, and please have in mind we were able to cut production compared to 2007 by 100,000 units. And it was, and let me really use that word, the toughest cut in the premium car industry, what BMW has done. Otherwise, the inventory management, free cash flow, working capital, would not have been possible. So in my opinion, I don't want to say we have done a good job. But that was in actual terms a good job on the inventory side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to supply with some numbers. So in quarter four, our retail was at 321,900 cars. The production was down to 285,636 cars. So the difference is a reduction of 36,268 cars. This demonstrates what I said. We refuse production in order to avoid high-risk stocks. That is &#x2013; that was the target. And on the other hand, you really have to consider that on a single dealer level, that could be a bit different also. It's a question how the sales performance was in December, how it was in January. And we are very, really closely looking at this because we want to keep our dealers in place. And for us, it's absolutely clear if they are overstocked, they are running a financial risk. And as we are financing them, it is in our interest to make sure that this is not happening. So this is something we are really following up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question Horst Schneider and then Adam Jonas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Horst Schneider from HSBC. I would like to come back first of all to the cooperation with BMW and Daimler. Could you give us maybe here more details on that? What you have got precisely in mind, so that means how &#x2013; can you reap any benefits? Will that be visible already in 2009? Can you give any indication, what amount you are going for? I only remember to the words of your competitor here, Mr. Winterkorn. Last week he said, just combining purchasing, the potential benefits are really limited here. You need to work together on project like aggregates, engines, then you can reap larger benefits. So maybe you can give also some insight where the benefits are precisely coming from.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I have got additional question on the free cash flow. If I understood you yesterday right in the press conference, you are going for a positive free cash flow in 2009. And in that context, I would be interested if you &#x2013; which amount of cash-out you expect from the charges you have taken in 2008, and if you can expect any one-off cash-outs also here in 2009? And then regarding inventories, do you believe you can reduce your inventories further, and do you believe you can cut your production to a larger extent or production will fall more than you expect sales to decline? And last question then is on the mix and the earnings outlook. Do you expect the mix to deteriorate further in 2009? Will that be an ongoing trend in the face of the sales decline and then can we expect again a mix improvement; also in 2010, or is it rather a structural change what we are seeing here on the premium market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Horst Schneider. I think we would start with the Presidenten question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you see me smile. I mean it was a very good question in my opinion. I mean, does it mean, or had Mr. Winterkorn in his mind to put more and more Volkswagen parts into the Audi brand. He said what he means. But then you can buy a Volkswagen. You should not pay a higher price for an Audi if that is the case. This is my comment to that one. Of course, it's a mixed design of a premium brand and of a mass manufacturer brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, but it's a decision of the consumer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, of course. And Daimler and BMW, I mean you could see during the last couple of weeks that we are not just talking with each other, that we decided things as well on the purchasing side. And I mean you know our cooperation on the hybrid side. And we will definitely develop our cooperation in the field of purchasing further. And if we have something to say, and there is really an agreement between Mr. Zetsche and myself, we will do it together. Please understand that, but we have very good ideas in our minds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when can we expect and when is the first result. Or can you &#x2013; when can you give any indication what is the state of the project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean look from a result point of view, if you would like to go one step further, of course, you have to have in mind model cycles as well. Because one thing is right, you cannot just say I put part A, what is in a BMW into a Daimer model as well. First, you have so-called modular systems and they have to fit for the different cars. So, and of course you have to wait until certain points in time of model cycles as well. And then you have a real big advantage if you do that, you cannot say, now we have a current 3 Series or a current C class. And now let's exchange parts, it does not work. I mean what you have to do, you have to start with commodities. And that is what we have done. We started with commodities. And the next step is you have to look of course into development of cars as well. But if we have results, then we tell you together that is our agreement. And I think it's fair enough.</p>
          <p>And I would like to say one additional word. It was not your question, but I think it's important as well. I mean if you compare at the moment BMW with other premium car manufacturers, you can see our 5 Series BMW is in the sixth year of production. I mean Mr. Ellinghorst you asked the question as well. And our current 3 Series cars are in the fourth year of production. And we had in the year 2008 the situation that we had to challenge us with brand-new cars in the volume segment, that means in the 3 Series segment. And what we will do, more than 50% of our volume cars we will launch between 2010 and 2012, then we will have the advantage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second part, Friedrich Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, cash flow management is one of our number one priorities. And as I said before, what we did in '08, we try to do the same now for the first quarter, second quarter to balance really production and demand. That's what we are trying to do. Now having said this, the question is what is the volatility on the demand side. So we are proactively now reducing production in order to balance. And we think this is good workout for first quarter, but I mean we have to see &#x2013; especially March is a very important retail month for BMW. We have always traditionally high volumes there, and we have to see what the fluctuation is, what is really the outcome and if it works out. But having said this, our target is to balance supply and demand and therefore to &#x2013; in order to manage our cash flow in the right way. That is the same with the dealers. So, we try to really look at the whole stock; it doesn't matter where it is, it's on the dealer side or on the Group side.</p>
          <p>Now, you've been asking for extra charges. We think that with the provisions we've taken in 2008 for the Financial Services business, we have done the right step forward, and it should be sufficient for this year to protect this year, the portfolio this year. And the first results we see now in January and February on the Financial Services business is supporting this view and supporting what we've done so far. So, if I looked at the United States, residual value losses are actually a bit lower than we've planned, but we don't know what the forthcoming months are bringing now. It seems to be that we are on the right side. So, that's a &#x2013; I think it was second question about the charges, come again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sorry, it was also about the cash-out from the charges taken in 2008?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I mean we had &#x2013; of course we had a cash-out in 2008 as well, but the number I've told you, the extra charges, the 1.9 billion, they went into the portfolio as a provision for '09, '10, '11. That was the number, and the charges we had in 2008 are part of our Financial Services result, as well as of our result in our automotive business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>There we go. Hi, Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Three pretty simple questions. First, for Dr. Reithofer, a production guy. I hope you can answer this one for us. If we assume that in 2009 that your production is down within the midpoint of your 10 to 20% range, down 15% just for sensitivity, what would your capacity utilization be globally for the year? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is for Mr. Eichiner on the concept of arm's length. Now, you mentioned that if BMW did not provide the attractive leasing or financing deals, I believe your words were, "We would likely lose the customer to another, to a competitor." I want to tie that into something that Dr. Dieter Zetsche said to analysts in London a couple of weeks ago when he was asked, "How important is your finance sub for your car sales?" And he replied, "If we did not offer sales and financing activities right now," he estimated and of course nobody knows this, but he estimated he could lose one-half of the customers that currently lease or borrow money from Mercedes to buy car. Do you agree with that Zetsche rule in principle as far as BMW is concerned? If you do, then I do struggle with the concept that you said that you really are borrowing and lending at arm's length.</p>
          <p>And the third question is on new equity, okay. Many of the people in this room, myself included, many people on this call, work for institutions that have acquired new equity in recent times. We &#x2013; and this is a very, this is a world where equity is very precious. Your dividend cut was, I think most people would believe, is a very wise way to kind of start to preserve equity. It was a good move. Your stock price has been a very good performer. I think, to your credit, bringing to the forefront the issues that are facing the industry in a very transparent way. Your stock has been the best performing stock of the comparable universe, with the exception of Volkswagen, which I think we argue is not a stock. Why don't we take &#x2013; you currently do not have a provision to issue new equity, I believe. What is your opinion on this? Why can't you strike preemptively while you still have a strong financial position and issue equity when you don't have to, as many successful companies have done in this environment, or do you not foresee any circumstance where that is required at all?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert Reithofer. Some time, it's an advantage to be a production guy. For example in the year 2008, I think as well in the year 2009, it has to with inventories of course. What we use, Adam, we use different models and if it comes to plant utilization. Let me use the example Leipzig. I mean, we used, in Leipzig as you know, a lot of temporary workers and we said in the current situation we would like to reduce the temporary workers if it is possible in Germany to zero, or let me say to a very low number, 500 or something like that.</p>
          <p>And we had in Germany more than 8,000, you should know, at the beginning of 2008. So and we said okay, we would like to reduce in Leipzig as well and we said we will not run the plant in five days, in a two-shift operation we will run the plant in six days with a extended shift and we will use our own people only, and we will reduce our temporary workers nearly to zero. We have a couple of, 50 I think or 60. So that was the plan behind Leipzig.</p>
          <p>I mean, as you know we will launch a new product in our plant in Leipzig, the X1. The X1 will be a volume product and the launch will be in the second half of 2009, so and to use the plant in the current situation like I said it and reduce the temporary staff nearly to zero was in my opinion a very intelligent step. So if I see plants from a capacity utilization point of view, we used for example Regensburg in an ABC shift operation.</p>
          <p>So and if you reduce in such a difficult time a plant to a AB shift operation of course, then you have to reduce people. And as you all know, we decided at the end of 2007 to reduce people and of course we reduced people in our production plants as well. So and what we will do now in the current difficult session, we will move from ABC shift models to AB shift models and afterwards if we are in a better situation again from a market condition point of view, we can move the plants up again. But if we do so, we will use in future again temporary workers to do so. So I think, it gives us a lot of flexibility.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I appreciate, you can't answer that &#x2013; this question saying like 69.5% utilization, but if you had to boil it down in terms of a rough number of fixed capacity not the labor issue, I know you have flexibility there to make fixed cost variable, but of your installed capacity, roughly what would that number be, are we talking 65, 70%?</p>

          <p>We don't ask questions such a way; we don't ask us that in such a way. Look, if you can reduce 1.5 million cars and you will reduce, let me say 1.35 million cars then you under-utilize your capacity of 150,000 units. Is that a fair answer?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Dr. Eichiner will answer the second part of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, coming back to what Mr. Zetsche said, so as I said basically, we agree with the view in principle because I think if you look at markets like the U.S., the U.K., and Germany, if we could not offer attractive financing, we would lose volume definitely because the cash buyers would not be there to replace those customers and it's part of our competition as well. In other parts of the world especially in Asia, it doesn't play such a significant role. So we have, in those areas, very low penetration rates; and therefore it's not a big issue. It's really more or less focused on those three markets but they are the biggest markets. So that is one thing.</p>
          <p>Then your question about the equity, I mean, if you look at the equity, we have in the Group, we have more than 20 billion, the ratio for the Automotive segment is 42.3% and we think that we have sufficient equity and with a financing capabilities we have and the flexibility we have, we didn't see a need now to come up with a request to new equity and especially form market point, the share price is not on the right level for this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Christian Breitsprecher of Oppenheim. I would like to come back to the issue of net interest-bearing assets in the automotive division. First of all, is there any chance to derive that number from the assets, from the balance segment, balance sheet. Second point, when I look at your work down year-over-year change in terms of net interest-bearing assets, you say that they are basically eight or an increase in internal net finance receivables from 6.8 to &#x20AC;8.1 billion.</p>
          <p>When we look at the segment cash flow statement, you actually show a cash inflow from internal financing of &#x20AC;2.7 billion. And I just like to understand how these numbers fit together. Also in that respect when we look at the cash flow statement for this segment, &#x20AC;2.7 billion internal financing inflow, and 2.8 billion cash in flow from change in other financial liabilities. I do not see how these cash inflows from increasing liabilities pair up with the segment numbers in the balance sheet, in terms of financial liabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so now it's a balance sheet number and it is consistent &#x2013; it consists of liquidity in parts, and I mean if you say you cannot get a consistent view and your question is going in direction to the new segmentation we set up, I would ask you that we have a intense talk to one of our experts that can demonstrate a little bit more in detail because here it's a bit difficult for me to do it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sabine Bl&#xFC;mel from Creative Global Investments. I'd like to come back on Daimler and BMW because if I understand it correctly, Daimler has been much more proactive and eager to work closely together with yourselves rather than you with Daimler. We understand that you can't legislate existing models and you shouldn't. But surely in the long lead times, you could now sort of start working together for the next MINI replacement. Why not? Because I mean last year, you even contemplated using a Fiat platform or an Alfa platform for the MINI. Surely, to cooperate with another premium manufacturer is a little bit more desirable.</p>
          <p>The other thing I don't understand is you are one of the few win-win situations, Daimler and BMW. Your brands are clearly distinguished and you could, especially internationally, have a strong position together. And yesterday, you talked very much about 2009. What's your outlook for 2010? The consensus seems to be there is no clear recovery; it will be rather U or L-shaped recession? How are you and the whole industry positioned for that?</p>
          <p>And the last one in inventories, if I understand you correctly, your inventory levels are, in absolute numbers, the same year-end 2008, year-end 2007. But, surely in selling days, you should be the same level, so that means the absolute levels should be lower to adjust for the lower demand levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we start with Norbert Reithofer. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I would like to start with your 2010 question. I mean, if I should be honest to you, and I think we should be honest with each other, and Adam, you said we reported in a very honest way during the year 2008. Nobody of us knows what will happen in the year 2010. That is an honest answer. We can recover quicker than we think at the moment. It can take another year, at the moment. An honest answer, we don't know.</p>
          <p>If you look in the support figures, I mean they decreased from a volume point of view in the year 2009, for example. They think at the moment that we will lose volume, 18% compared to 2008, the luxury car market. So 2010 a lot of unsecurity if you ask institutes, "Come on, give me an indicator where we will be in 2010." But from a BMW point of view, I would like to mention one important point why we are confident if it comes to 2010, '11 and '12.</p>
          <p>As I said, the market, we don't know will it to recover and in what a rate it will recover. So, but BMW will launch the new 5 Series, BMW will launch the new 5 Series Touring, BMW will launch the new BMW 6 Series. BMW will launch the new BMW 1 Series. BMW will launch the 3 Series derivatives and all between 2010 and 2012. And if you know the percentage of these models of our total volume, then you know that BMW will be from a pure new model point of view, especially between 2010 and 2012 in a very good shape. So that gives us confidence. And from the year 2011 on, we have nearly these volume models launch-after-launch. So that is the second part of my answer.</p>
          <p>The first part, if I am honest, we all don't know what will happen in the year 2010. But I have a personal opinion. I don't know the colleagues from the United States of America. I think United States of America will be the first country who will take off. So that is my personal opinion, but it's only my personal opinion. And it's our strongest market; it wouldn't appear disadvantage for the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>So Daimler and BMW, I mean, as I said, we started already projects on the purchasing side if it comes to commodities. I can only say you if you would like to do more things, you have to wait for the launch of new products and it takes times. Even if you would like to use a gearbox together in a car, you have different body invites; the gearboxes doesn't fit in. So you have really to wait until the launch of new products; otherwise it will not work. So by the way, the same is true and with one or the other of you I discussed the issue, the same is true for BMW.</p>
          <p>If we would like to make big steps forward if it comes to cost reductions on the material cost side, it will happen with the new 1 Series, it will happen with the new 3 Series, it will happen with the new 5 Series because the cars are designed to have lower material costs. So and that is what we have to have in mind. I mean, we are, an industry with seven-year cycles, and you cannot just say now the 3 Series Sedan is three-and-a-half years old. I'd start now to redesign the car. So it is not possible; it was a very straight answer. So and as I said, we have an agreement; the two gentlemen, Zetsche and Reithofer, we said if we have to announce something, then we will do it together. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the question about the inventory and selling days. I just want to, first of all, explain a bit how we manage this process of production planning and sales, and allocation in sales. So we have a monthly cycle and based on sales forecast, we adjust production on a monthly basis. And for all the markets, we have inventory targets in selling days; so not in absolute numbers. And now if the volume is going down, it's absolutely all right what you had said then, the total stock has to go down as well. And we try to adjust within the production accordingly to the sales forecast. That's the process we run over years, as I said on a monthly basis. And we need to use the flexibility in production and short-term working in order to really do so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question Adam Hull. Thank you very much and then Jochen Gehrke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Adam Hull from Execution Limited. Three questions. And it really goes back to the walk-down you showed on the Automotive segment EBIT earnings breakdown. Firstly, just on the pricing, where is the price impact within that breakdown? And just in broad terms, you've talked about the arm's length with regard to the pricing of Financial Services to Automotive. With the borrowing costs we're seeing being much higher, I presume in 2009, the effective pricing impact there will be clearly negative. I was wondering if you can expand a little bit on that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, when I look at that breakdown, the walk-down, you showed volume mix 1,446 million negative. And BMW brand sales I think down 6% last year. It looks like it's two to three times this year. So if we're talking about 3 to 4.5 billion negative, is there anything particular that I might be missing within that?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the cash flows, your Automotive cash flows for 2008 were down 81 million. That of course includes your working capital inflow, which was an impressive achievement. But it means that excluding working capital, your cash flow was minus 1.3 billion in 2008. And given the headwinds we've got, if we put working capital aside for a moment, it strikes from the outside as if it could be something of the order of three billion, something of that kind of number possibly more as an outflow overall on the underlying terms. I don't know if you can just help us sort of reconcile some of these broad numbers. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Adam, the answers will come from Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, we work on an arm's length principle in &#x2013; when it comes down to Financial Services. You have to see that it's not only the prices we have to pay, on the bond side the spreads are relevant for cost of capital. We have other instruments that we are using; commercial paper programs that are much more favorable when it comes down to cost of capital as well as deposits. So it depends on a mix that we are using. And I can tell you we already adjusted our charges in direction to Financial Services based on the principle I mentioned. So that is how we operate this business.</p>
          <p>Now, your second question about the losses we had with the mix, we have to consider first that we had extremely high support, sales support as well in the last quarter, and we are not calculating that we have to move forward the support in this level in the year 2000 &#x2013; in the whole year of 2009. Then as you've seen, we are on our way to adjust our cost base, and we are really rigorous moving costs down, and there is another compensation that we wan to bring in to the equation.</p>
          <p>And the third thing is that we are expecting better mix coming from the ramp up now of our new 7 Series; and it has a much better contribution and will give us additional positive effect in major markets like China, Russia, and so on and so forth, where we really have a good position with this car. So those are the elements; but at the end of the day, it's absolutely clear, the question is how far will the market drop and when will it recover and there is still a lot of uncertainty in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jochen Gehrke and Albrecht Denninghoff, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I have two areas of questions. First of all, for Mr. Eichiner, I want to come back to this net liquidity for the Automotive business if I can for a second. Just very two broad simple questions. You're showing 9 billion of net cash and yet even if I strip out the impact of pensions on your net financial interest for the Automotive segment, you've paid broadly 200 million net negative interest, how is that possible?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the same subject walking from 2008 to 2007, you've increased net liquidity by &#x20AC;1.7 billion, you paid dividend. You generated no cash and you funded your pensions. What am I missing? And isn't it fair to say that comparability now with this new reporting from BMW to other companies is absolutely of little value to us who try to make a comparison between Daimler, Volkswagen, BMW and other carmakers of the world with this number that is almost impossible to reconcile.</p>
          <p>And the second area, Mr. Reithofer more strategically, I think most in this room and on the call will agree with that you've managed so far the business very well operationally and very evolutionary. Don't you think that in 2009, the shock could be so high that evolutionary is not enough anymore, and you might have to do more drastic steps, i.e., cut capacity in a more dramatic way, step away from some expansion plans and stuff like that? Is this something that you would decide on in 2009, no matter how bad markets are, or is this something where you are saying, this is such a shock that we would have to wait for a bit of a longer period of time to look out and make a more drastic decision on that side? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We start with Norbert Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean for a company like BMW, to cut more than 10,000 jobs including temporary workers was already a real shock, trust me. And we had big debates in the company, especially, if you can imagine, at the end of 2007, to do so. So, and of course we will carry on. First of all, we will not replace the jobs of people if people leave us; then we will not hire additional people. That means we can say already at the moment, we will reduce further 1,500 &#x2013; 1,500 positions in the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>As I said, 4,000 people signed last year contracts. On top, we had about 1,600, 1,700 people. They left the company on their own. That means both together was 5,700 and 5,800 if you add on top the 6,000 that was a number of close to 12,000. Excluding the former Cirquent Company, if you added on top even more. That was a BMW big step, because it never ever happened in such a way. So if you ask me a view into the future, I mean if you would like to grow as a company and you can now say we disagree with you Mr. Reithofer, but in my opinion, if a company is not able to grow anymore, then the company will soon be dead. That is my crystal clear opinion. Everything else is in my opinion naive.</p>
          <p>So that means of course our target is to grow. And I mean we will launch volume products starting already this year; the X1 for example. We will launch the 5 Series GT this year. We will launch as you know a new MINI convertible this year. And as I said, we will launch volume car per volume car between 2010 and 2012. And of course even if we say, and I said it yesterday during the annual press conference, I don't think that we can achieve a volume of 1.8 million cars in 2012. We will be 100,000 units lower. But if we are 100,000 units lower, then you need, Adam, a capacity of 1.7 million cars to grow to that volume figure.</p>
          <p>So that means you see me here in a very confident, in a very confident position. I am absolutely sure that we will grow to a level of more than 1.6 million cars in the year 2012. So 1.8 I said yesterday is not realistic anymore because you cannot go down that way, and then think you can go up like that. Then you will again destroy your residual values. I agree with all of you who have that in mind. So it will be a parallel line to our original plan. But of course we will grow. And even if we enter into a cooperation with other car manufacturers, by the way, I see more than one possible partner for a cooperation for BMW, then of course, you have to grow. That means two very important pillars are, on the one side, efficiency, and you saw on the cost side, minus 801 million last year.</p>
          <p>And I remember very well, when we were together the first time in the year 2006, I think, Adam it was even you, you asked me the question and can you carry on to gain efficiency? And I said yes. And it didn't take more than one second to say yes. So we showed you that we are able to gain. And I mean, 800 million is a lot for a medium-sized car company like BMW. So are we able to drastic steps? Yes, we are able to drastic steps. We cut the salaries of our Board by 40%. We cut the salaries of our Bereichleiter, the Senior Vice Presidents, by one-third and down the ladder to our normal staff by 10%. So you have to see both together with our job cuts; that was not evolution anymore.</p>

          <p>Now your question about the interest result of Automotive business, now basically the negative effects overcompensated the positive ones. And you have to think about, for example, the reversal of discounted pension obligations and other provisions that we have to bring in to this interest result. And now it seems to be that some of you are really struggling with the new segment reporting, while the comparability with our companies was not possible in the past, that what we saw because with the rules for subgroups, it was difficult to compare. It seems to be that we need some time and more discussions on that. And as I said a quarter of an hour ago, our experts are really ready to go with you into the segmentation and answer your questions and feel free to ask them, we're prepared to do this after this session here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Dr. Reithofer maybe can I just have a quick add-on on what you said, a parallel development would mean that this is basically just a one-time shock to the economy. I think many in this room at least debate whether we are not just seeing a more structural shift in global economies and the way we do business. If so, I think most of us don't feel that BMW is a 1.6 million unit company, but more 1.3, or whatever the number is. Your leasing business has been such a driver of growth that I think that most of us debate that 2007 is the real basis for comparison. Your residual values have dropped much more than anybody else's in the world. Isn't this changing the brand perception and the way you can distribute cars in the future much more than just a one-time hit and then growth parallel to current plans? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I can only say what our personal belief. So in my opinion, we will start to grow again because, of course we were looking into the crisis situations as well. I mean 1973, 1992, 1993, after the IT bubble in the year 2001, 2002, 2003. We analyzed the situation and we are confident that we will go back to growth path in total in the car industry. But I would like to go back and I mean you are the analysts, you normally analyze a company and you ask yourself what is the profit-loss situation and so on.</p>
          <p>But I give you an answer unusual for your group. In my opinion, we have a social responsibility as well, as companies, especially in these days. So, and the DAX 30 companies were asked by the federal government in Germany, please can you keep your staff in 2009, please can you use more short-time work during the course of 2009? And we said, yes, because if all companies worldwide say we just cut jobs, then it can be the case that from a country point of view, we can be challenged with totally different questions. And I don't know if we would like altogether these questions. That was unusual answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay next question. Albrecht Denninghoff and then Frank Biller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Albrecht Denninghoff from BHF. First question regards just a housekeeping, why did you pay a dividend at all if cash is so valuable at this time and if refinancing costs are so high? And aren't transaction costs higher than the &#x20AC;0.30 you paid per share?</p>
          <p>Second question is, in your walk-down on the profit, this big volume number of 1,446 million from volume mix, is it fair to assume also pricing is included there? And could you give us a spread-out in between, is it fair to assume that it's one-third volume, one-third price, one-third mix or is mix and price going to be more than one-third of the past year? And it's still a high number, if one assumes because it's a full-year number, and the market really was good, as you said, in the first half. And so, I'd say that somewhat in an order of magnitude of 2.5 or 3% of sales, is it &#x2013; well, just the double number on the fourth quarter deterioration, and if the double or three times that proportion of sales number would reflect the market conditions of the first quarter we're likely to experience now. So just to have a better feeling for the headwinds coming up to you.</p>
          <p>And could you give indications of the order of magnitude of the positive ones you indicated? In your speech, you said yesterday that you're going to cut CapEx for property, plant and investments, and that you're going to cut or reduce the R&amp;D expenses. Is there really a big potential to reduce these cash outflows already in this year and then the next year, given that you're entering a new, a stronger model renewal phase in the next years where normally outlays go higher? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you asked about the dividend. I think we really have a stakeholder approach that we are following in the company. And we think this is valid for our shareholders as well. And so the decision was made to really pay a dividend in this &#x2013; for this very difficult year. Continuity is a driver of our dividend policy, and that is a sign we want to give. Now if you walk through the profit and the extraordinary burdens we had to take in 2008, I would say, as I mentioned already, the biggest part was risk provisions in 2008. And we actually are holding the opinion that we won't see a risk provision burden in 2009 as we've seen it in 2008.</p>
          <p>Then the currency effect in 2008 have been around 400 million. We are very well hedged this year on the major currencies, and we think that there is a burden left because we are still a bit struggling with the development of the currencies in countries like in Russia and in South Africa, where we are not able to do proper hedging. So there is some headwind coming from there and &#x2013; but it will not be in the same order. Then raw materials, it was a burden last year, roundabout 200 million, we are awaiting tailwinds now this year. We think with the drop of material prices, they will help us to achieve our financial targets. So it will be a tailwind this year. We are yet to &#x2013; still to evaluate how far this goes, but it will clearly be a mid three-digit million number, as I will see it. Depreciation will be nearly the same; that is the expectation.</p>
          <p>And now we talk about volume mix and market. Well, if you come &#x2013; if you look back to our result in the fourth quarter, clearly the price effect was the major one there. As I said, as the markets have really fallen down on an unexpected level, there was too much production in place from all competitors. And everybody had to try to clean up stock, and this led to a very high sales support and that's what you see on the pricing side. And we are not prepared to continue at those levels of sales support our business in the course of this year. So that's why we don't think that the fourth quarter is really something you can put as a basis for your assumptions, how we will develop our business in the course of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Frank Biller and John Buckland [MAN Securities], yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Frank Biller from LBBW. Just coming back on your leasing business again, am I right in this assumption that your provisions are also going for the leasing fleet coming back in 2010? I misheard some sort of things, just the calculation if leasing residual values, car residual values are staying as we are today, is there an additional provision coming in the course of this year for 2010 leasing fleet? And the other thing is in credit default rates here, additional provisioning in 2009, what default rates you are calculating or what's the magnitude of your provisions and are you calculating this default rate of 2% roughly or is it lower?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, coming back to provisions, clearly, as I said, the provisions are allocated for the whole portfolio. So also for contracts that will mature in 2010 and 2011. So in order to give you a clue, just take a &#x2013; I mean it's different from market to market, just to give you an example of the biggest market, the leasing market, U.S. We calculated the provisions for 2009 based on the results, on the losses we had to consider at the end of 2008, so both November and December numbers. And they were extraordinarily high. So this is the basis for the provision calculation for this year. Now for 2010, we are calculating certain improvement on the residual values, but it's still extraordinary high. And if you look at the long-term average, I would say, it's three times higher than the long-term average. And now if you look at 2011, there we see two effects that we had to take into consideration. First is, we lowered our leasing &#x2013; contractual lease prices in &#x2013; the contractual residual values in the leasing contracts we had in 2008, so we now have a lower basis and this is another step forward in order to manage the risk there. Second with the shift from leasing to financing the maturities, the volume in 2011 will go down significantly. And it will be a mid two-digit number. So both effects should help us really to stabilize the business. And I mean nobody knows how this price will move forward, but with everything we can judge now, we think it should be sufficient, it should be the right order of magnitude.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think we have time for two more questions, John and then Philippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. You seem very confident about your profitability target 2012 and there's been debate about what the volume will be when you come to that year. But you also said you're very confident that raw material costs will be significantly more than you had previously planned. Are you &#x2013; can you say with some certainty that you will meet these 2012 profitability targets, irrespective of what the volume is going to be? I mean obviously, you can't be completely independent, but can you categorize how &#x2013; what is the minimum volume? Can you run at current production levels with the new models, with the raw material cost and meet those targets? I mean is that something that's been in your back pocket there? And the other &#x2013; going back to this &#x2013; the provisions and you've made &#x2013; in the fourth quarter did you make a change in policy, In other words, more conservative compared to what you did for 2008 because the words that you're using now about we can't rule out more provisions is basically what you'd said at the beginning of 2008. In every quarter, you made another provision and you got the &#x2013; the biggest one was at the end of the year. So have you made a real change to, say, we've looked at everything, we've looked forward sufficiently such that we are in a position to say unless there's an absolute catastrophe, there won't be more of this drip-drip on the residual value or the loan loss as well. And then on the &#x2013; just on the final quick question on the production, we are in the middle of March. You must know what your production is going to be for the full first quarter of this year. How does the production volume look compared to the fourth quarter? Can you actually give us a number of production volumes for the first quarter or close to. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, John. Norbert Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, first let me start in the year 2008 again, only to explain to you why we are confident for the year 2012. I mean if you see additional &#x2013; let me say costs for residual values for, that we had to, for our personnel reductions what we needed, residual values, credit loss is two billion. As we all know in the meantime, head count reduction 0.5 million. Then if you add on top 0.6 million for higher raw material prices and currency effects in the year 2008, then you are far over three billion. And if you're still able as a company to make an EBIT of more than 900 million, then you were able to make progress on the cost side definitely. So are we well on track on the cost side? Yes, we &#x2013; in my opinion, we are very well on track on the cost side. And that gives us confidence that we have to hold cost side under control.</p>
          <p>And let me say, we launched, as I mentioned, the new 1 Series, the new 3 Series products starting in the year 2011. 5 Series will come in the year 2010, and we will have launch, launch after launch and you can trust us. We turned around every screw, we calculated component for component, we calculated sub-assembly for sub-assembly. Different compared to the past, totally different with, let me say, a total cost focus. That means these products will move us further if it comes through the cost structures of our company. So that is my first answer. Why we are confident? And that, as I said, we have 100% under our control. We cannot have excuses. That is what we can influence 100%.</p>
          <p>So let me now come again to the year 2012 from a volume point of view. I mean, I said we cannot achieve 1.8 million cars anymore. And I said, yes, it can be 100,000 units less. I don't know yet the real figures because we don't know what will happen until the year 2012. And I would be a very rich man if I would know what will happen in the year 2012 now because then I would buy the right shares. So that means we don't know yet what will be the volume, but I'm very confident that we can achieve between 1.6 and 1.7 million cars. So, and &#x2013; but I don't know, to be honest. So will we focus on our profit targets? Yes, because from a cost structure point of view, we should be able to achieve it even if we have only a volume of 1.6 million cars because what we have to do in our company, we have to lower our breakeven in any case. And Mr. Eichiner said the current situation is a very good fitness training for our company. I mean if you have volume drops of 25%, you can have no better fitness program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Friedrich Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, your question about the provisions, are they sufficient, do we have to expect another hit, yes or no? I mean, basically I have to say we cannot rule out now that there will be no further risk on horizon. And nobody can, because this would mean, I don't know exactly how these crisis will come to an end and how it would proceed into the future. So I don't know it. But what I can say it that we really had covered all foreseeable risks from the day's perspective. That's what we really tried to do. If for example, a crisis is taking longer or it's going even deeper as levels we see today, I mean this could then give a different picture. But from today's perspective, I said we've done everything to cover foreseeable risk and that is now in the books. If you look at the actual development and what it says today, I mean I explained what we see in the U.S., the U.S. development on residual value losses is supporting our view today, that's what I can say. So with January and February, I mean it's online or even better than we've planned. So that is positive, but we don't know how the crisis will proceed. And if you go to &#x2013; if you look at the credit risks, now if there is another bank going down and things are getting worse, then dealers have more trouble than we anticipated, then I mean you have further risks. That's all I can say at that point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But can you not say whether you looked more critically in the fourth quarter than you did in the previous quarters because in 2008, you &#x2013; each quarter they said, oh, we've looked at it, this is the view we have today. But the view is wrong. And you can have two ways. You can look at it what the market is now, and say I make decisions on what market is now or you can say we make a much more conservative assumption about the future, let's say, it continues to go down as the rate it's been going down, and we project that forward, and we make the provisions on that basis, which is completely different philosophy, and then therefore you have a sort of cushion for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I don't get the impression you got a cushion for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we understand it, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean I explained that of course. We took our learnings out of the development on residual value losses side over the course of autumn last year. That was very clear, and it goes into our back testing, it goes into our risk management, that is all taken into consideration. And I already explained, for example, that we brought the contractual residual values down now by a significant step is another sign that we are more conservative in this business. And the second thing is that, as I explained already, that we shifted from the leasing business to the financing business and that is still something that we are now following up this year.</p>
          <p>So, we try to come to a better balance in '09, '10 with the new contracts for leasing and loan in order to take some risk out of the business. And the third thing is that we try to improve our processes and especially our used car channels. So for example in U.S., U.S. dealers were not prepared to market used cars in &#x2013; to the certain extent that was &#x2013; usually those were independent used car dealers doing though. Now we are building up this channel even strongly in order to stabilize our used car values as well. So there's a lot going on now in order to really come to a structurally better business model in the area of Financial Services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we are on time; it's 12 o'clock. Last question, Philippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'll try to be quick. And sorry to go back to this issue of the FinCo, but it's on everybody's mind I think. To help us understand some of these issues, I think we've seen your financing costs go up gradually, which is fine. We see that in the market, you're trying to re-price your leasing offers, your loans and it's not as easy as you'd like it to be of course, keep on lose too many customers. But my question there is, at what point do you get to a situation if you can no longer increase the interest rate you charge your customers and your financing costs continue to increase on a trend we've seen recently, at what point you'll start operating the FinCo on negative spreads? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second question would be on this issue of re-capitalization of FinCo, which is on everybody's mind, and I'm sure you're going to have meetings with Moody's, S&amp;P, etcetera over the next few weeks. I'm looking at your new segmentation and how different it is, etcetera. Can you give us an idea of what kind of metric the rating agency will look at to determine that you need to put more equity in the FinCo? I think I'm comfortable you can do it internally, but what kind of leverage ratio, what kind of indicators do you need to satisfy the rating agencies or will they either touch you or they will force you or require that you put more equity in the FinCo? If you can help us understand, that will be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming back to the last question, I mean we are in discussion with the rating agencies. And I think it's not so much the equity questions that we have to answer. I mean they are looking at our cash flow, they are looking at our liquidity position, and of course at our earnings and ratios. And as we can, could demonstrate so far, we have, besides the reduction in profits, we have some good news on the liquidity side that we can offer. If it's enough, we don't know. We are in the middle of the process. And on the other side, there is a negative trend in the industry; and this is something that have to &#x2013; that we have to consider as well. So, we work with them, and there's &#x2013; we don't know the outcome yet at that point in time.</p>
          <p>Now the question again about the leasing and how we &#x2013; and the spreads, we have to see two points. I think all the car manufacturers who compete in the market have the same situation now. Right? They'll have to rebalance their &#x2013; the leasing business. I cannot see that BMW is the only one who is struggling with leasing. Everybody does, but some aren't showing it. They have it in other cost positions. You don't see the risk provision that we've clearly made transparent, and we have to come to the right approach there. We are not prepared to really sort of get away from our arm's length principle, but we have &#x2013; of course we have tactical spendings in our sales where our sales people are trying to balance their offers against those of the competition. Then you have maybe a discussion in cost of sales on the pricing side, but we are not going away from our arm's length principle when it comes down to financing of Financial Services.</p>
