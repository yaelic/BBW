          <p>Welcome to the Wesfarmers Full Year 2010 Results Briefing. Your lines will be muted during the briefing. However, you will have an opportunity to ask questions immediately afterwards and instructions will be provided on how to do this at that time. This call is also being webcast live on the Wesfarmers website and can be accessed from the home page of wesfarmers.com.au.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand the call over to the Managing Director of Wesfarmers Limited, Mr. Richard Goyder. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome everyone to this call on the group performance for 2009-2010. I'm joined in Perth by the Divisional Managing Directors and Terry Bowen and each of those starting with Ian McLeod, Coles, who will go through their divisional performance, and then we'll all be available for questions after conclusion of the presentation.</p>
          <p>So if you are following, we'll try and sort of give you slide numbers as we're going through the presentation. So I'll kick-off just with an overview of the group performance on slides four and five. And we are pleased to report a full year net profit of $1.565 billion for the 2009-10 financial year up 2.8% on last year, on revenue of $51.8 billion. It's a gratifying result as we had the impact of significantly lower export coal prices on the Resources Division, which reduced that division's earnings by 720 million on the previous year. And the result also includes $137 million after tax of non-trading items. If you exclude the impact of the Resources Division, our EBIT increased by over 31%, with our retail businesses up by nearly 16%, once again showing the strength of diversity of Wesfarmers.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flow was strong, up 9.3% and the Board's declared a full-franked final dividend of $0.70 per share, which takes the full year dividend to $1.25 per share.</p>
          <p>Our businesses are running well and we achieved earnings improvements across most divisions last year, with good progress in our turnaround business of Coles, Kmart and Officeworks. Coles achieved encouraging earnings growth and continues to meet our expectations and has made good progress in improving the in-store offer, customer service and trust. Supply chain improvements are well underway and that's enabled us to significantly improve our fresh offer, which is being reflected in sales.</p>
          <p>Bunnings had another strong year with earnings and sales growth, and a strong focus on improving customer offer. We've got a very strong pipeline of new stores to open. Officeworks had good sales and earnings growth. Kmart's profit improvement for the year has been very pleasing, and a very strategic reset of the business, which Guy will go through, is well underway. Target's performance was very good, particularly given the more challenging trading conditions in the second half.</p>
          <p>In our Industrial businesses, we had a significant fall in resource earnings that I referred to, but importantly all three mines performed well operationally and well placed to take advantage of growth opportunities and higher export prices.</p>
          <p>The energy, chemicals and fertilizers division had a better year with strong demand for chemicals, offset to some extent by a difficult year in fertilizers, while most of the energy businesses performed well.</p>
          <p>And our Industrial Safety division finished the year well after a difficult first half and that business carries good momentum into this financial year.</p>
          <p>Insurance Division had a much better year, notwithstanding some significant claims events, storms, particularly in West Australia and Victoria, with good improvement in the underwriting businesses.</p>
          <p>If you move to slide six, that gives you an overview of the Group results. On slide seven, it gives you an understanding of the makeup of EBIT and the increase in retail and industrials and insurance, offset by the fall in resources.</p>
          <p>On slide eight is earnings per share and that is lower as a consequence of the higher number of shares on issue effectively, but also shows a dividend payout ratio, which this year is 92%.</p>
          <p>On slide nine, I think it demonstrates that we do have a portfolio of strong cash generating businesses and very strong operating cash flow, and strong cash realization for the year, which we are very pleased about and has continued to be a very strong focus in the organization.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 has the EBIT numbers for each business, and you can see some really pleasing performances, a double-digit in a number of the businesses over last year, which I've sort of already referred to.</p>
          <p>And on slide 11, I'm particularly pleased of the 10 reporting entities there. Eight of the ten improved return on capital for the year. And the Industrial &amp; Safety business is pretty much line ball with the previous year. So again, there continues to be a very strong focus in the Group on return on capital, which is both the earnings and capital employed line in our businesses.</p>
          <p>So overall pleased with the performance for that 12 months. I'll talk about outlook at the end of the presentations. But I'll now hand over to Ian McLeod to talk about Coles.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Richard. Starting on page 13, as we move from Phase-I into Phase-II of the five-year turnaround plan, we are pleased with our progress and believe this year's financial performance is further evidence that the strategy for Coles is the right one and the turnaround is on track.</p>
          <p>Revenue for food and liquor and convenience has exceeded $30 billion for the first time, a 4.2% increase on last year. Full year EBIT was 962 million, up 15.8%. In the second half, EBIT increased 21% as we start to see the benefits of our program to improve efficiency.</p>
          <p>For the year, our return on capital improved from 5.5% to 6.5%. Our prudent use of capital demonstrated our sustainable approach for the Coles turnaround. As a result, our EBIT to cash conversion was strong with cash flow for the year of $929 million.</p>
          <p>Within food and liquor, despite the transfer of 22 stores to FoodWorks at the start of the year, headline sales still grew by 5.6%. Encouragingly despite a challenging retail environment comparable store sales grew by 5%, faster than the prior year and outperforming the industry.</p>
          <p>Given the turnaround strategy is sales-led, this performance is encouraging. However, we also need to recognize the need to improve our costs of doing business and improve profitability both in cash dollars and percentage terms. I am therefore pleased to report a 16.7% increase in food and liquor EBIT and a year-on-year improvement of 40 basis points in EBIT margin to 3.7% for the year.</p>
          <p>Within convenience, total store sales grew 5.5% and a combination of fuel and shop sales generated revenue of $6.2 billion, marginally down on last year driven by fuel price deflation. Volumes remain positive. Costs are well controlled, as was the margin mix with EBIT cash dollars increasing to $77 million during the year.</p>
          <p>I will now move to slide 14. This years results gives us renewed confidence in our turnaround strategy. In phase 1 we have not only built a solid foundation for future growth for the business, we have also built genuine strength and depth across our senior team with a much higher caliber than 2 years ago.</p>
          <p>Further refinement to the operating model will continue, but we are now moving to phase 2 of our plan, delivering consistently well. We have over 100,000 team members, over 2,200 retail outlets across a landmass the size of Europe. The challenge of phase 2 delivery, therefore, is likely to be as tough if not tougher than the improvement performance delivered in the last 2 years. Even though the organization is in a stronger position now to respond to the significant challenge, it will still not be easy.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn to slide 15. At the commencement of the turnaround, we knew that we had to engender higher levels of customer trust and value, but we still have more work to do. We have generated strong traction on this dimension. Through a combination of aligning state-based pricing, price repositioning on popular brands, fewer but deeper promotions, redevelopment of Coles brand, and the offer of value meal solution for under $10, value perception at Coles have improved significantly.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to slide 16. Although value alone will not drive sales unless we improve quality especially of our fresh produce, we've continued to focus heavily on our supply chain, improved product sourcing, quality control, speed to market and fresh food product care in store.</p>
          <p>Food and vegetables for example lands in store an average of 18 hours faster now than they did a year ago. Each of these factors have combined to engender higher levels customer confidence in the quality of our fresh food where sales are now going faster than the average. This is particularly evident in our renewal stores. Standout departments have been fresh produce and in-store bakery and across fresh food we are developing craft skill programs to enhance our skills further.</p>
          <p>Sponsorship has also played its part in increasing awareness of the improved quality of our fresh food offer. The fact that MasterChef contestants cooked the fresh ingredients supplied by Coles adds to our growing credibility as a fresh food retailer. Improving in-storage experience is also a key thrust of our strategy as can be seen on slide 17.</p>
          <p>Much better focus has been placed on improving our operating standards, offering growth opportunities for enthusiastic and capable managers. 50% of our store managers are new or changed role in the last 2 years. Investing in cleaner, better presented stores better availability, fewer queues aided by roster changes and self-scan checkouts in 78 stores.</p>
          <p>Wherever possible we have endeavored to give you the chance as we continue to grow our own internal capability. Our renewal program also continues to provide encouraging results. We have now landed 56 new store formats in just 18 months. And through a combination of new stores and refurbishments, we'd expect that number to almost treble during the course of the new financial year. While the initial emphasis has been on fresh food, we are also introducing new concepts in grocery such as, health and beauty concepts and also books and magazines.</p>
          <p>I now turn to slide 18. While our turnaround approach is focused on growing sales momentum, we also recognize that we need to improve our cost of doing business. We are continually seeking ways to improve our operating efficiency and redeveloping our ways of working. Cutting cost is expedient but is not a sustainable option. Our store replenishment program was postponed in the early days of the turnaround as the impact on both working methods and people had not been fully considered.</p>
          <p>The rollout of easy ordering began in earnest in the second half of this year and 80% of our volume as a business will be integrated by the end of FY11. Indeed by the end of the month half a fleet will have converted to easy ordering.</p>
          <p>We expect to see improved productivity, reduced inventory, improved availability and lower waste and markdowns as a result. In addition, better training improved rosters and changes to contracts have resulted in 22% reduction in absenteeism, and more than 700,000 additional hours worked by our team members at no additional cost.</p>
          <p>I'll now move to slide 19 to discuss our liquor and convenience businesses. I will now look briefly at our liquor and convenience businesses. Our liquor business continues to perform well despite the challenge of a contracting liquor market we experienced solid growth in both sales and profit during the year, and encouraging growth in market share. Within our convenience business as a result of fuel price deflation revenues from fuel and convenience softened slightly but investment in forecourts, improved mix of fuel sales such as Shell V-Power and Diesel saw volumes grow in a competitive market.</p>
          <p>I'll now like to turn to slide 20 for an overall outlook. In summary, we are encouraged that turnaround plan remains on track, but the job is far from over. Economic conditions remain challenging and whilst food inflation is likely to remain at low levels there are signs that global food commodity prices could be rising.</p>
          <p>As we move into phase 2 of our plan, the challenge of delivering consistently well will only get tougher but is a challenge to which we are still determined to rise and look forward to Coles making further progress during the next financial year.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to John Gillam.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ian. I'll start at slide 23 and comment firstly on Bunnings headline results. Bunnings traded pleasingly across the full year achieving operational revenue growth of 10.4%. That drove an uplift of over 10% in earnings and our trading margin remain strong at 11.4%.</p>
          <p>We continue to reinvest both in new stores and in land banking sites for future development. Reinvestment levels into existing stores remain strong. As a result CapEx for the full year exceeded 410 million. And given the CapEx level we were really pleased to maintain our ROC above 30%.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 24, you can see we've reported good cash sales growth for the year of 10.3% with store-on-store cash sales growth of 7.3%. Trade sales lifted by a healthy 10.8%. Growth was achieved from a number of sources; strong work on consumer and merchandizing initiatives, a continued focus on commercial customers, network expansion activities and business improvements.</p>
          <p>I'd like to quickly repeat to the supplementary information pack and specifically slide 11 on our comparative sales methodology. Going forward we will be reporting comp sales on a total store basis as opposed to our current reporting of just the cash sales component of a total store performance.</p>
          <p>The current method does not take into account the level of trade sales purchase in-store with cash and growth in trade sales activity in our stores is skewing this proxy. That's why we need to change.</p>
          <p>Returning to slide 24, the Bunnings network continued to expand across 2009 and '10. We opened 22 trading locations during the year including 11 new warehouse stores, 3 smaller format stores and 9 trade centers. Since year-end we've opened a further 3 warehouse stores as well as new small format store by acquisition.</p>
          <p>And as we reported at the May Investor Briefing our new store pipeline is in very good shape. Slide 10 in the supplementary pack contains more detail on network activity.</p>
          <p>In terms of outlook for Bunnings, slide 25, we expect continued sales growth with positive contributions from retail and trade. Headline sales growth will be tempered to some extent by the strong focus we have on driving value in the business through our range reset work, which will have some deflationary impact.</p>
          <p>Our strategic agenda remains aimed at leveraging 5 growth drivers: Service, category expansion, network expansion, trade presence and business fitness. The rollout of our network in 2010, '11 will continue at the higher end of our stated annual range of 10 to 14 warehouse stores, 2 to 4 smaller format stores, and 4 to 8 trade centers. At the same time we will also maintain a significant investment in the new store pipeline for the longer term.</p>
          <p>I'll turn now to the Officeworks performance and status, slide 26. Officeworks' trading revenue for the year was 1.4 billion, an uplift of 8%. Earnings growth of 13% resulted in earnings of 74 million at a better EBIT margin of 5.3%. ROC also improved up by 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>Looking at the slide 27, there are a number of highlights for the Officeworks' team across the year. Headline sales growth for the Officeworks retail store network was 9%, a pleasing result. Strong lifts in transaction numbers continue to underpin sales growth as strategic initiatives improving the overall offer continue to gain transaction.</p>
          <p>Business channel sales also gained in momentum across the course of the year. What the past 12 months have shown is that we are well on track with the work needed to reinvigorate Officeworks. This has included returning the business to a category killer format with a clear value focused pricing policy supported by stronger service, new branding, a new wide store format and new merchandising categories that include new control LIBOR ranges.</p>
          <p>During the year, we opened five Officeworks stores and 12 stores underwent full upgrades with a much larger number of stores receiving minor upgrades. Around one-third of the Officeworks store network is now trading with the new store format. At year-end there were 128 Officeworks stores and 5 Harris Tech business centers operating across the country.</p>
          <p>There's also been good progress on actions to improve operational effectiveness. Key achievements across the course of the year included the rollout of the new point of sales system into stores, transition to a new cross-dock PC provider and implementation of a new labor scheduling system.</p>
          <p>Looking now at slide 28 and the outlook for Officeworks, sales growth is expected in 2010, '11, an environment of continued competitive pressure on margins and costs. The primary focus remains on good quality execution of our strategic agenda. Ongoing improvements in the customer offer will underpin sales growth. Investments to expand and upgrade the store network may be accelerated and there is still more to do to reduce costs and remove operational complexity. The Officeworks team led by Mark Ward are very well placed to successfully tackle this agenda.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Launa Inman.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd now like you to go to slide 30 and I'll take you through Target's highlights for the year.</p>
          <p>Our operating revenue was 3.8 billion, up 1% on last year, with comparable stores sales down 0.9%, as we cycle the Australian government stimulus. However, despite the difficult trading conditions, the team delivered an EBIT of over 381 million and an EBIT margin of 10%. We anticipated that this financial year would be challenging and competitive; and our margins grew through ensuring that our merchandise mix reflected customers' expectations.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had a strong focus on managing our inventory and expenses, which paid off, and hence this result. Our core destination, high margin departments being ladies wear, children wear and baby related products all delivered positive growth for the year. However, sales of electrical items, an area that was a major beneficiary of the stimulus package declined over the previous year.</p>
          <p>As many of you know, consumer sentiment was and continues to be affected by potential increased interest rates and the higher cost of everyday living through increases on utilities like electricity and petrol prices. As a result, customers are more focused on value than ever, and as a consequence we have responded particularly in the last 8 months by reducing over 50% of our retail price points on like-for-like product from the previous year. This has been across all our core categories of clothing, footwear and homewares. However, I would like to emphasize though that we have not reduced our quality as that is the key part of our strategy.</p>
          <p>In October and May, in the strategic briefings, I am glad to see the work we have doing in improving our supply chain efficiencies. These have been completed and resulted in substantial cost savings, better service to stores and improvements in speed-to-market from point of manufacture. It has also assisted us in using this money saved to reinvest in prices. Although we didn't open as many stores as we would have liked, we did put 7 new stores on the ground during the year, including 1 replacement. However, we did close 3 three stores such as like Box Hill and Reservoir.</p>
          <p>We have refurbished 24 stores to bring them up to our company standard and another 13 store refurbishments were commenced and will be basically completed in the next month or so. This financial year we will look to open 5 new stores and refurbish 57. 30 of these refurbishments will be our Target Country stores which are often the major retail stores that they operate, and many of them are due for freshen-up.</p>
          <p>As discussed at the May strategic update, we are re-engineering our buying processes. The implementation of these new product design and development capabilities have commenced and will ensure our continued differentiation with the focus being on our core categories particularly clothing. We see this disciplined approach across the business, the key to maintaining our position in the market, which is all about differentiation. And this will really start to be evident in winter 2011.</p>
          <p>Aligned to these opportunities to communicate in different ways to our customers, we've planned to increase the use of digital technology including online retailing. The last 6 months have been challenging and competitive and we don't in fact see this improving much before December. As we have responded to customers being extremely value-driven, we are experiencing price deflation across all the categories within our business. Of course this comes with challenges as we need to process and sell more units to achieve the same dollars as last year. So, as a consequence we remain cautious.</p>
          <p>However, for all that going on, we will stay true to our strategy as a mid-tier big box retailer offering star value and quality to a broad cross-section of the population, and differentiation is never more essential to our strategy than it is right now and going into the future. So with that, I would like to say thank you and hand over to Guy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Launa. And I'll start on slide 34. For the year ending 30 of June, Kmart recorded revenue of $4 billion representing a 0.5% increase over the previous year and 0.1% decline in comparative store sales. We're very pleased with the EBIT for the year of 190 million, which was 74% higher than last year, bringing the EBIT margin to 4.7%. Also I'm pleasing with the return on capital of 21.8% was reached in comparison with 10.5% in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Slide 35 depicts our journey of discovery, renewal and growth.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 36, showing our core strategies around the six P&amp;C and our vision of where families come first for the lowest cost on everyday items.</p>
          <p>On slide 37. As we progressed with our strategy, it has very pleasing to see that our customers are responding to the changes that we're making. The shift to lowest prices and the changes customer see in service and in-store environment are all contributing to a lift in transactions. For the second half comparative sales growth of 1.9% was recorded.</p>
          <p>Throughout the year, focus through renewal has remained on fixing the underlying financial metrics of the business. The improvement in profitability represents the efforts of exist &#x2013; of exiting from unprofitable products, rationalizing ranges, reducing the skews and moving away from our previous deep discounting model. Benefits have also been achieved through reduced cost in supply chain and control of non-stored administrative cost.</p>
          <p>A continued focus on controlled inventory levels has also helped to improve our working capital management, all contributing to healthy growth in return on capital. Also the Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto business again delivered a strong sales and profit result for last year.</p>
          <p>Slide 38; going forward, renewal will still remain very active. Focus will continue on delivering improved customer service, clean and tidy stores and fast and friendly checkouts. Cost benefits achieved today will also be leveraged to ensure we maximize efficiencies in these areas.</p>
          <p>As the business transitions to growth, we'll continue to invite our customers through 'Expect Change' with customer engagement being the key priority. Our message is clear and will remain targeted, lowest prices for families on everyday items.</p>
          <p>So, whilst we continue to reset Kmart through renewal and growth, there will be challenges along the way. Shifting to less skews of high volume, everyday items will clearly place an emphasis on choosing the right everyday items for our customers.</p>
          <p>We will cycle through last year's high-low discounting model for the next six months, which we felt. Increasing sourcing costs and raw material prices will place greater pressure on margins and we expect the retail environment to remain competitive and challenging.</p>
          <p>However, we are focused on resetting Kmart for long-term success and remain confident that providing lowest prices on everyday items families will help achieve a successful platform for the future.</p>
          <p>Thank you and now I'll hand over to Stewart.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Guy. Now I refer you to slide 40. Earnings before interest and tax at $165 million, was 81% lower than last year. This decrease is due to reduced revenue as a result of significantly lower coal prices, lower sales volumes, locked-in hedge losses of $85 million and Stanwell rebate of $156 million.</p>
          <p>Depreciation and amortization increased due to increase in asset base following the commencement of the Curragh expansion and the successful completion of Blackwater Creek.</p>
          <p>Coal production for the year decreased by 6.6% to 14.1 million tons. Importantly, our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate at 2.1% was significantly lower than last year due to our continuing commitment to creating an injury free workplace.</p>
          <p>I'll refer you to slide 41. Resources highlights for the year included the $286 million Curragh expansion to eight to 8.5 million tons of export metallurgical coal is underway. The Blackwater Creek diversion achieved practical completion, on ahead of budget and time.</p>
          <p>And in Q4 financial year '10 Curragh was successful in achieving strong pricing outcomes. 25% of Curragh's volumes remains on annual contracts. Annual contract negotiations resulted in a 78% increase in price. The remaining 75% of volume is now on quarterly pricing with an increase of 70% in Q4. Curragh's cost reduction program is on track with year-on-year cost reductions of 9%.</p>
          <p>I'll now refer you to slide 42. As previously stated, the Curragh expansion to eight to 8.5 million tons per annum of export metallurgical coal is underway. A two-week shutdown to tying the new Coal Handling and Preparation Plant to the old Coal Handling and Preparation Plant will occur in early 2011. The expansion is due for completion in Q4 calendar year '11.</p>
          <p>I'll now refer you to slide 43. Separate to the existing expansion of Curragh to 8.5 million tons of export coal announced in November last year. We have commenced the feasibility study to further expand Curragh to 10 million tons per annum of exports. This expansion with Curragh side with commissioning of Wiggins Island coal export terminal and Curragh is a foundation member of this terminal.</p>
          <p>Coal to underpin this expansion would come from remaining reserve of Curragh plus additional reserves at Curragh West, an exploration program to better delineate these reserves will commence shortly.</p>
          <p>Now I'll refer you to slide 44, Bengalla expansion feasibility study. This feasibility study to expand the Bengalla mine is nearing completion. It is proposed to expand Bengalla to 8.5 million tons per annum. 10.7 million tons ROM through two stages. We expect to be in a position to make a development decision on Stage One going to 7.5 million tons per annum in the second half of this calendar year.</p>
          <p>I'll now refer you to slide 45 resources outlook. Q1 financial year '11 pricing negotiations have completed with 11% increase on Q4 financial year '10 quarterly pricings. Shipping performance from the existing customers remained strong. We are experiencing the re-emergence of a tight labor market and industry cost pressures. From the 1, of July this year, Premier coal is the sole supplier to Verve Energy.</p>
          <p>Curragh's metallurgical sales for this financial year 2010-'11 is forecasted to be in the range of 6.5 to seven million tons and I expect significantly improved earnings from the resources division in financial year '11.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Stewart. I'll start on slide 47. In 2010, we increased EBITDA by 27% to 131 million or 34% to 122 million on an EBIT basis. This was driven by a strong turnaround in underwriting profitability. Most of our businesses had a positive finish to the year, which resulted in an improved second half result.</p>
          <p>Underwriting GWP was slightly down on last year as a result of portfolio remediation and a greater focus on profitable underwriting. Total revenue was marginally below the prior year due to lower interest revenue and FX movements on UK and New Zealand revenues.</p>
          <p>The improved underwriting result is reflected in the combined operating ratio improving 4.5 points to 97.9%. Broking operations reported a profit margin of 27.8%, which was slightly down to prior year. It was very pleasing for us that our return on capital improved by 2.3% to 9.1% or 9.8 before amortization of intangibles.</p>
          <p>Moving to the highlights, the underwriting result improved by 47 million from a loss of 25 million in the prior year, this was really encouraging for our team given the changes undertaken in recent years to strengthen management, improve risk selection and exit unprofitable arrangements.</p>
          <p>A number of headwinds impacted our result for the year. This included severe weather events in Australia, particularly the two major hailstorms, lower investment returns, and losses from the run-off of our builders' warranty portfolio.</p>
          <p>It was a year of consolidation in our broking businesses, as we invested in management and systems. Our broking commission and fee revenue increased 3% in local currency terms and was in line with the prior year in Aussie dollars.</p>
          <p>During the year, we made some good progress on new growth initiatives. This included a new insurance premium funding solution for OAMPS, the launch of a new corporate underwriting team and EDI solution, both of which are generating good new business volumes for Lumley.</p>
          <p>And we've also launched a private major insurance offering through retail partners Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto and Coles. This truly differentiated offer is starting to generate some good interest amongst customers.</p>
          <p>Now turning to slide 49 with the outlook; we are focused on maintaining the positive momentum in our Lumley businesses and see opportunities to further improve margins. We've remained very focused on reinforcing the underwriting and claims disciplines that have helped to improve our results to-date.</p>
          <p>We are budgeting to increase our investment in IT and to support profitable growth and improve business processes. Lumley New Zealand will go live on a new policy admin system Guidewire, this financial year following the successful implementation of the Claims System.</p>
          <p>Commercial premium rate environment remains still quite competitive. Broking earnings will be subject to business confidence and premium rate trends both OAMPS and Crombie Lockwood are well positioned given their scale and resources in what is the fragmented market. We continued to review bolt-on acquisitions of insurance brokers and have a number of prospects under evaluation.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your time. I'll now hand over to Tom O'Leary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rob. Looking first to Chemicals and Fertilizers, the EBIT at 121 million was the combination of the strong earnings contribution from most of the chemicals businesses, partially offset by weak earnings in fertilizers.</p>
          <p>In fertilizers, we saw they returned to more normal rate to the applications and sold over 900,000 tons for the year. So notwithstanding the changes to distribution channels, I mentioned back in May, we haven't seen a material change to our market share. And in that respect it lays to a place with the outcome. ROC recovered to 11% from last year's 4.3%, remembering that the last year's earnings were significantly affected by the Varanus Island gas interruption.</p>
          <p>Turning to highlights on the next slide; we were able to meet increased demand from the resources sector with production from our ammonia and ammonium nitrate plants increased into record levels. We also had strong sodium cyanide sales particularly of solution into the local market on the back of higher gold prices and increased gold production in Western Australia.</p>
          <p>The fertilizers business had been adversely impacted by the rapid decline in fertilizer prices in 2009 and a higher than normal level of stock carried over into 2010. That ultimately led to the 25-million write-down in inventory that was reported at the half. It also led to low margins as we sold through that highly priced inventory.</p>
          <p>Moving to Energy on slide 53. The safety performance was disappointing in some areas, so that's a key priority. And change of financial performance, whole energy business units other than Coregas reported improved earnings, contributing to EBIT of 102 million and a recovery of in ROC to 13%, remembering again that the 2009 was affected by Varanus Island.</p>
          <p>LPG production was up on last year, and if we turn to the highlights on the next slide 54. It was driven by higher flow rates through the plants with LPG content pretty similar to last year, which I should add though was higher than we'd expected, and higher than we expect this financial year.</p>
          <p>In our industrial gas businesses, in WA we benefited from improved conditions, while economic conditions in market demand for Coregas in the East remained challenging. Coregas reported earnings below expectations and the carrying value of that business has been written-down by $48 million. Finally enGen benefited from a full year's contribution from its LNG power stations and is performing well with good growth prospects.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 55 on outlook for the combined division. We are expecting continued strong performances from all our businesses exposed to the resources sector, particularly ammonium nitrate and sodium cyanide, notwithstanding to the sodium cyanide business will face higher gas prices this year.</p>
          <p>We're on track to complete our FEED study from ammonium nitrate expansion early next year, and in at this stage that expansion continues to look viable. In claim rate, we're facing increased gas prices in the west from October and we're doing all we can to mitigate that impact.</p>
          <p>In fertilizer, we're off to a reasonable start this financial year, despite having been a pretty dry winter in the west. So in terms of outlook, while stronger wheat prices have improved the terms of trade to farmers are returned to more normal levels of fertilizer earnings is still dependant on weather conditions, both over the remainder of this calendar year as well as in the seasonal break in the second half.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Tom and good afternoon. I refer you first to slide 57; Industrial and Safety delivered a solid performance this year in a challenging economic environment. Operating revenues for the full-year of 1.3 billion were 1.3% up on last year. Our earnings before interest and tax were 111 million down 2.6% on last year. And our return on capital of 13.9% compared to 14.1 last year and is up from 12.1 at the end of the first half. Thanks to strong capital management across the division. Pleasingly, Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate was 1.6, a good improvement on previous years.</p>
          <p>Moving to the highlights on slide 58 and starting with revenues. Our first half revenues were impacted by the slowdown in business activity during the GFC and were down 7.3% on the previous year.</p>
          <p>The second half, however, was marked by good sales momentum with revenues up 11% on last year. Improvement in revenues was driven by strong project activity, contracts successes with key customers particularly in the resources sector, very pleasing growth in eBusiness and services as well as increasing industry diversification.</p>
          <p>In terms of earnings, our business is facing margin pressures and during the first half our earnings were down 25% on the previous year.</p>
          <p>During the second half, however, the pickup in activity and good expense management delivered earnings up 30% on last year. The division also continued to strengthen its capabilities this year, particularly in regards to supply chain and sales effectiveness as well as sustainability.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the outlook for the Industrial and Safety division on slide 59. The market conditions have improved and while we are facing ongoing margin pressure, tighter labor market and some global uncertainty, the division is very much focused on growth. Growth is expected to come from four areas, increasing our share of customers' spend in industrial supplies and services, resources and infrastructure based activity, synergies with Coregas as well as acquisition opportunities in a fragmented market.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now I'd like to hand over to Terry Bowen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Olivier, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll discuss the performance of the group's other businesses, as well as key elements of the group's capital management during the year.</p>
          <p>So turning to slide 61, profit from associates was $77 million for the year and that compared to a loss last year of $60 million. The major drivers of this result were upward revaluations of the group investment in Gresham Private Equity as the underlying business earnings improved against the prior period.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had an improved contribution from the group's investment in Bunnings Warehouse Property Trust. Interest revenue of $65 million was ahead of last year and this reflected the increased funds on deposit in the first half of the year in particular. We recognized a $112 million of non-trading items for the year. These are primarily non-cash in nature and I'll cover those in detail in the next slide.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of this slide, other includes the performance of the group's self-insurance program, as well as a number of other small investments. This area record a loss of $27 million compared to a loss last year of $50 million. The result again was driven by self-insurance outcomes and really related to a number of large claims following the significant weather events in Melbourne and Perth in particular.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 62. During the first half, we recognized $33 million and that was related to Kmart DC closure and supply chain restructuring provisions. We recognized over the year $21 million in relation to Coles freehold property impairment, so this included some surplus lease provisions. The group recognized in the end $5 million in relation to the restructure of chemicals, energies and fertilizers into a single division.</p>
          <p>As Tom mentioned, we have recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $48 million in relation to Coregas. This impairment charge really reflects our view that the industrial gas markets in Eastern Australia, post the global financial crisis, have remained challenging and are expected to continue to be that way for a while. Primarily, this is driven by lower growth from Coregas' manufacturing based customers and in particular smaller manufacturers.</p>
          <p>In addition to these non-trading items, as flagged earlier in the year, the group incurred additional borrowing costs of $58 million and this was associated with the early repayment of debt during the year. And it was primarily brought forward interest rate hedge closeout costs.</p>
          <p>Turning to working capital on slide 63. Working capital management again was a highlight for the group. So working capital released for the year was $415 million. If we segment that, the retail business has again recorded lower working capital despite the business growth occurring in our retail businesses. And this brings now the total working capital released from the group's business, retail businesses over the past two years to in excess of 700 million or to around $700 million. This is a pleasing result, particularly when you consider the growth that's occurred in both networks and general business over that two-year period. Inventory across the retail businesses continues to be very well managed, and improvements have also been made progressively in the supplier terms.</p>
          <p>The non-retail businesses turnaround, you can see there, this year really reflects a decrease in fertilizer inventories as tonnage and prices returned to lower levels. The group continues to target further working improvements in working capital across its businesses, albeit, we expect now probably at a slower rate than that achieved over the last two years.</p>
          <p>Turning now to capital expenditure on slide 64. The group maintains a strong capital &#x2013; a strong return on capital focus as we invest in our businesses to drive future growth, and Ian referred to this. Total capital expenditure for the year was $1.656 billion and this was a $153 million ahead of last year.</p>
          <p>All the retail businesses continued to invest in store infrastructure and improving store standards. We invested significantly during the year in our store standards particularly &#x2013; in our store networks particularly within Coles and Bunnings and in resources we completed the Blackwater Creek diversion and commenced work on the expansion of Curragh.</p>
          <p>If we look forward, we expect capital expenditure in this financial year to increase to between 2.2 to $2.4 billion. This will be again contingent on freehold property purchases. Driving this increase from this year will be the Curragh expansion, the accelerating retail store refurbishment programs and further retail network expansion.</p>
          <p>Turning to debt financing on slide 65, the group's gross debt at the end of the year was $5.4 billion and net debt was $4 billion. During the year, the group was proactive in diversifying and lengthening its debt maturity profile with two significant bond issuances during the year. The first of these was $500 million domestic corporate bond issue, which we did in September and the second in March was an inaugural issue of Eurobond notes, which raised 755 million.</p>
          <p>The proceeds of both of these issuances as well as some cash over the year was used to pay down short-term debt and our total debt repay during the year was in the order of $2.2 billion. In relation to hedging, our interest rate hedging specifically, the majority of the group's debt still remains hedged. And we expect our all-in cost of debt for this financial year to be between 8.8 and 9%. And that's broadly in line with our cost of debt for this year.</p>
          <p>Quickly to slide 66, you can see our debt maturity profile now. And this highlights a low level of debt due in this financial year and reduced debt obligations in both financial year F'12 and F'13. The group's strong liquidity position is further supported by $1.3 billion in committed but not as yet undrawn facilities and a further $1.3 billion that &#x2013; remaining in cash on deposit. The cash on deposit in the short-term will be actively managed and used to fund dividends, seasonal working capital requirements as we build up to Christmas, short-term debt maturities as they come due and there is a small one in October and increasing capital expenditure requirements.</p>
          <p>So turning to the balance sheet then and dividend on page 67, as I said, good operating cash flows for the year resulted in further improvements in the group's gearing and liquidity ratios and our balance sheet is very strong. Reflective of this strength Standard &amp; Poor's has put the group on a positive outlook from previously what was a stable outlook in relation to its rating.</p>
          <p>As Richard mentioned earlier, the group will pay a final dividend of $0.70 per share, fully-franked, and this takes our payout ratio to 92% for the year. Given that a number of the group's shareholders value the dividend investment plan, we'll again offer this option. As has been our recent practice, the group though will acquire the required numbers of shares on market to neutralize any dilutionary effect of the share under the debt. No discount will apply to the allocation process and the program will not be underwritten. And the shares will be transferred to those that elect to participate on the 30th of September.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll now hand back to Richard.</p>

          <p>Well, thanks, Terry. And briefly on outlook on slide 69, Wesfarmers is well placed to benefit from further &#x2013; any further upturn in the Australian economy. And our businesses are running well and in good shape. We are, however, cognizant of the fragility of what's going on in global markets and there is a degree of uncertainty in domestic consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>We are optimistic about the group's retail businesses, particularly, the opportunity to extract further improvements from the turnaround businesses of Coles, Kmart and Officeworks over the longer-term. Our resources earnings for this financial year, outlook is positive compared to the last year. And our industrial divisions are focused on growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>The insurance division is expected to benefit from positive momentum and the strategic initiatives which Rob outlined. As Terry just went through, we'll have a strong focus on return on capital in our businesses, cash flow, and maintaining a strong balance sheet so that we can continue to invest in growth in our businesses.</p>
          <p>And with that, we're happy to turn over to you for questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon. Just in terms of operating cash flow, obviously your cash utilization was quite strong. Terry, you made the point that the rate of working capital reduction going forward will slow a little bit. Should Coles not have a lot more working capital to remove given that &#x2013; we understand that they operate at around 50% more inventory than Woolworths. And it looks as though some of your retail businesses can get a bit sharper on inventory. So we should see better operating cash flow results going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, Shaun, we take a view going forward that Coles certainly, I mean is doing a lot of work across its business including working capital. And further improvement is expected there. But we've got a number of businesses now in terms of Bunnings, Target, Officeworks, Kmart that are all in good working capital positions and with further growth it becomes more difficult to see net dollar reductions. And it's the degree to which Coles will release enough to pay for what probably will be working capital increases from bigger businesses across the broader group. So that's where our caution comes in. I mean the cash realization for the group has been very strong in terms of working capital. And I guess at this stage while we target it we're loathed to guide towards it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. Just I guess in regards to Coregas, the write-down of some $48 million, can you just talk a bit about &#x2013; I mean you guys have had this business for I think sort of three, four years now. It's always disappointed in terms of on an earnings perspective. You seem to have called it out many times that it's been a little bit softer than expected. Are you confident that the 48 million write-down is sufficient and what do you need to see an improvement in the earnings profile of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Shaun, I'll handle that. I mean the performance last year was disappointing. Coregas is of course centered in New South Wales and its major customers are manufacturing businesses. So &#x2013; and its market reaches across the eastern seaboard. So if you think about that, certainly its customers have been in a difficult space and not as profitable as they would have liked and that puts pressure on Coregas as a supplier.</p>
          <p>So it was really the performance last year that caused us to have a look at the carrying value in the business. I am confident that by putting it in the Industrial and Safety division and with the synergies that we think can occur across the customer base of that business, the Coregas business, and through better management which we brought into the business that that we'll get better improvement &#x2013; a better performance from Coregas into the future. And I continue to believe it can be a very good business for us.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, a question on the Coles business, particularly the easy order program. I was wondering &#x2013; you've listed off the benefits, some relate to costs and some relate to sales, could you give us sort of a bit more of a flavor as to whether that initiative will be a big cost driver than a sales driver? And then maybe how far away you think you are from sort of world's best practice on the supply chain?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we expect some benefits coming through on the cost, but the overall challenge with easy ordering that we are looking to do is improve our overall service to our customers, to improve levels of availability and consistency. And that's what it targets to do.</p>
          <p>But having done so, based on the fact that we will be ordering based on demand rather than ordering to fill, we'd anticipate seeing a reduction in inventory and also in our daily business, an improvement in our waste and markdown performance. So we're starting to see evidence of that coming through in the initial stores. But it's still fairly early days in the program.</p>
          <p>Although we've got a switch over of half the state coming through by the end of this month, it's a cascade model. So it tends to expand quite quickly. So the core stores that we've got thus far, we're encouraged by their performance and we expect more to come.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe as a follow up question, then you've had pretty good margin expansion in the second half, I know you're not going to give exact numbers but could we get some sort of feel as to whether that was more absolute cost driven or gross margin driven through a mix or what have you? If you could give some color around that, it would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a combination, but it's the net effect. And you can't really &#x2013; well, I wouldn't be prepared to sort of separate them out as you specify. But clearly what we want to do is improve our overall cost of doing business. And negotiating more effective deals and improving the margin mix is part of the program as well. And that offers us some headroom to invest in price and deliver better value to our customers, driving new volume growth and customer transactions. So that's part of the overall plan.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so what we've put in the update today hasn't changed our view on when that expansion will be completed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of financial year '12 do you expect to get, Stewart, from that expansion? Do you expect a pick up or is it just going to be sort of like neutral for financial year '12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think half the year, the second half of financial year '12 will be at the expanded volumes. The first half, what we're saying to you is that the expansion will not be completed until Q4. And I really don't want to give too much more impression in terms of Q4 next year. I think it will be finished in the last quarter and it's on schedule at this stage, but we'll update as we get closer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And, Terry, the step up in CapEx to 2.2 to 2.4, is that a wish list or is that realistic? And is that big step up in CapEx, one thing that I was pleased to see is the EPS and the DPS starting to converge, which was a trait of Wesfarmers where dividends equal earnings. That big step up in CapEx, that won't dilute dividends approaching earnings, will it? And can you give some light as to what that CapEx is going to go to, a bit of a breakdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll try and answer a number of those elements, David. If we start with the $1.6 billion this year, we saw a strong network expansion, particularly by Coles and Bunnings. And we're expecting that will continue and hence caveats around opportunities that come up in freehold land and building purchases is something we put around our guidance. But if we just look at the 2.2 and you start with 1.6, we've got most of the capital expenditure this year for Curragh, which will be around 286 million less a bit for this year, which is broadly we've spent around the 30 mark at the moment.</p>
          <p>If we then look towards Coles, we've guided towards an accelerated store rollout program in terms of renewals, so that's got a capital cost associated with it. And then we're guiding towards, if you like, more work in both &#x2013; all of our retail businesses, but particularly Target and Kmart as they continue to renew their stores as well. And we've also got within that some work being done in chemicals and fertilizers a bit ahead of last year, so there's bits and pieces. But if you strip out the two big issues it's accelerating Coles and Curragh expansion. And then we've obviously got Bengalla, which is kind of subject still to approval, but that could come in. So you could see above 2.2. But again, we typically at this stage of the year over &#x2013; overshoot, so I say all of that with that caveat, but that's where we're at, at the moment.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of what that means for dividends, our dividend policy is very much one around looking at the future profitability of the group, looking at the cash that we've got on hand, and the cash that we expect to generate and making sure that we can provide over time a growing &#x2013; over time growing dividend profile. And so that means there could be years, potentially, where you'll get a lower payout ratio, but over time you'd expect it to be equalized out a bit, so that they might be guilty.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, sorry, just to finish on that capital thing. You've known Wesfarmers for a while and the way we budget capital is that divisions' budget capital forecasts, they don't budget anything around acquisitions and we subsequently approve capital as it then comes through each of the Boards or at a group level. I think there's probably been one year in the last six or seven where we've outspent our budget in terms of capital expenditure and that's why we're giving you a sort of a guidance range for this year and we'll keep updating you as the year unfolds.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to touch on the working capital improvement, one of the big features in FY '10 was an increase in payables, obviously not the working capital improvements, if there were improvements they were on inventory. But can you just talk about what happened there and where you see creditors going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll cover that, Craig. There was inventory, it was looked relatively flat on a cash basis, but there's obviously movements within various divisions, which I won't go into. But clearly if you look across the retail business, we saw growth, so that's a good outcome on inventory.</p>
          <p>In relation to creditors, it reflects two things; one, it reflects bigger businesses, which is the opposite of the inventory that I've just gone into. And then on top of that we are seeing some better terms develop in particularly from some of our overseas sourcing that we've been doing in the likes of Kmart and we've seen some good, if you like, better supply relation &#x2013; better supply negotiations across both margin and terms in all of the Coles businesses. But particularly that impacts some of the Coles' supermarkets business. So it's across the board a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so just to be clear on that &#x2013; that comment about the working capital improvement, I guess fading a little bit FY '11 &#x2013; that suggests that the inventory improvements may come through, but it's also going to be a fading of payables improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that would be an element and that would be a fair call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on Kmart, I'm interested in exploring a bit further the commentary around input cost pressures. Certainly Kmart's got a fairly high profile strategy of low price points and some of them are very headline price points like $19 or $29. How do you see that strategy playing out in the face of rising input costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Craig. Yeah, as I mentioned, we are really &#x2013; we've just launched our new vision about being focused on families with everyday items at lowest price. The last two pieces out of everyday items at lowest price will take some time as we work with our suppliers overseas to make sure that we bring down the product cost as unit volume increases significantly. So Kmart's new model that I mentioned at the last time we spoke was only launched in January of this year and it will take a good two to three years before we really bed it down properly. So it's important that we get the right items, as we've reduced SKU count significantly, and then that same challenge of making sure you get the right items at the right price, now that we have a model that's no longer focusing on a high/low strategy and wanting to ensure that our volume increases and selling to consumers are a daily event versus a cycle of what was used to be a four-week event. So I'm just pointing out that it will be challenging to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And talk about cotton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay, so in China and in Asia they've announced about a 30% increase in cotton prices, which are starting to flow through our businesses at the moment. And most of you would be aware that wage increases in Asia and China are also &#x2013; are discussing anywhere between a 30 to 50% increase. So those two hurdles are taken into account as we still negotiate with suppliers on trying to bring down our prices that we used to buy from them at because we're leveraging our significantly higher volume that we're ordering from 12 months ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just clarify then, because in second half EBIT margin expansion was only about 40 basis points, first half it was obviously hundreds of basis points. Is that because of the change in price point strategy was from January onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. We were very pleased with our results in the second half because we switched to the new strategy in the second week of January, where we lowered our prices to the everyday items at lowest price for the whole box in January without having achieved a reduction in cost. So the switch was to benefit the consumer immediately and then we spend our time over the next six months and the next 12 to 18 months of reducing cost. So the costs weren't there but the price benefit to the consumer was.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How's it going, guys? Just a question on Coles. Previously, you've spoken a lot about the key focus near term was driving sales and then the next few years you'll see costs following through. But today the focus really tended to be around how you've reduced your overhead quite significantly. Should we take that, that really the big driver of the margin expansions is half what overhead? And then just in the context of going forward, is this going to be the key focus, around costs and taking cost out and the like from here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we always said is that the turnaround program is going to be a sales-like program and that won't change. But we're out here to deliver better value to our customers and drive our sales and therefore our profitability through growing customer count and improving transactions and improving the overall margin mix through improving participation in fresh food. So it's encouraging signs that we're heading in that direction.</p>
          <p>We do recognize that there are efficiency improvements that we need to put into the business and we're working on that as well. So we'd expect to see further benefits of that come through. And then the extent to which we further invest in price to drive more volume and overall profitability will come as we move through the strategy in the next couple of years.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions further to the question on easy ordering. I note that the easy ordering rollout has occurred a little bit faster than what you expected. I'm just wondering how you look at that given the full cost benefit flows through when you can rationalize the DC network? So just wondering if you're rolling out easy ordering on a more state-by-state basis so you can pull through some of those benefits faster?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does tend to operate on a state-by-state basis, but the easy ordering rollout plan has been planned over many months. And we've exercised caution in terms of the number of stores that we were planning on developing publicly because when you're doing anything like this, in many organizations it's the one thing that people do. We're doing a multiple of different initiatives and programs to improve the business. So we're very pleased with the process that we've taken.</p>
          <p>You have to bear in mind that we did initially pull the plug on rolling this in the early days of the turnaround because we did feel that team members' changes in work methods weren't fully being considered. So we've gone for a cascade model. We think it's working for us and that enables us to kind of accelerate the development program later on in the program than we did do earlier.</p>
          <p>So we're pleased with progress so far. There's still a lot of work to be done in this particular area and we have to exercise caution in making sure that we continue to keep focused and make sure we land stores and land stores well. But we're very pleased with progress so far.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just secondly, a question for John. In terms of the accelerated rollout of some of the trade stores, I'm just wondering how you look at the retail trade mix going forward and if that's changing at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Emily. How we view the trade market opportunity hasn't really changed. And I tried to articulate that in the May Investor Relations presentation, outlining what trade centers are focused on and what stores are focused on. The stores we've really set ourselves up over the last five years, we've pulled out all of the heavy delivered trade and focused our stores on the sort of commercial items that people who are maintaining homes and gardens and buildings and gardens, and working around those sort of businesses, the sort of materials and products that they want. And our stores have been focused on and are continuing to focus on what we can do to service that pickup, sort of smaller business, smaller to medium commercial enterprise type business, better and better.</p>
          <p>And the trade centers are focused on what needs to be loaded onto trucks and delivered out to those that are building large numbers of detached, semi-detached or even apartment style developments. And the network development that we've done, particularly the innovation around the trade center concept, has really given us this total market capability that allows us to push on several fronts at the same time.</p>
          <p>So we're pleased to open 22 locations. And as I said, we're looking to be at the top end of that range that I outlined in this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just had a question for Stewart in regards to the met coal pricing. Can you just reconcile the 11% increase that you've seen in the first quarter this year with the softness in the spot market? Just noticed that some of the recent contracts being written around PCI have been done at $130, which would be a small reduction on the fourth quarter. So yeah, some additional color there would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you for that Daniel. Look, I'm not going to speculate on what the next quarter pricing will be. But I'll make some comments there. From a color point of view, we're still seeing very strong shipping, but as you said, there appears to be a little bit of softening in the spot price for coking coal and PCI. We expect to be settling Q4 pricing over the next couple of weeks. So once that settlement is made, we'll make an announcement to the ASX and you'll have the numbers then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a question on Bunnings for you, John. You mentioned that construction activity is helping the trade sales at the moment. In your experience, how long does that typically take to translate to improved sales activity in the broader business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Daniel. I'm not sure I mentioned specifically about construction activity, it's just that how we've set our trade centers up to focus on that. The trade center business is the one that will be most leveraged to the building cycle in terms of new homes. And, going way back, our business was very, very cyclical. I'm going right back into the '80s to make that comment.</p>
          <p>The sort of commercial trade business we're focused on in our stores is far less cyclical and less exposed to what's going on inside new housing. It's really driven around the maintenance and the upkeep and landscaping and renovation style trends that are supported by professional businesses, particularly the smaller to medium enterprise.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the sensitivity, obviously, if we get very wet sites, as has happened in the first few weeks of this financial year, then builders of new homes struggle to be able to get work done and the orders drop off immediately. But that's just the nature of that business.</p>
          <p>But the trade centers are set up specifically to be focused more on the new housing construction of all sorts, detached, semi-detached and apartments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the comment that you made was in the fourth quarter sales announcement. There was a one line there that construction activity had been the driver of stronger trade sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so I thought you were referring to that. Yes, across the second half we have been pleased to see an uptick in construction activity. And that, combined with all the other things we've been doing in trade, is really behind why our trade business has been performing better.</p>
          <p>In the year that we're now in, we won't be enjoying for the first nine months of the year the insulation activity that was supported by a government scheme. So there are pluses and minuses and it's one of those games that is a very cyclical one and we've positioned it now in our business where the cyclicality isn't as dramatic on our overall sales performance and we've set ourselves up to actually be a very strong supplier into this part of the overall economy.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. I've got a question for Stewart on resources. You did well in getting your cash costs down by 9% in FY10. Would we be looking at cost pressure increasing in FY11 as pricing goes up and therefore more mines become viable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, looking &#x2013; clearly, last year we were able to achieve a 9% reduction in cost structure at Curragh, which is a commendable performance. As we move forward, as I said in the outlook, we are going to see pressure on costs and labor as we move into the next 12 months. As you know, the mining industry is going through an upswing, a commodity price upswing. That does put pressure on inputs to our business. So our challenge is to run as hard as we can on reducing our costs at the same time where we're clearly cycling against higher cost coming through into the business as well.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and the other thing that we're clearly focusing on is looking at how we can run our businesses better in terms of processes and procedures, getting productivity out of our machines, the right procurement in terms of maximizing that advantage. And as I've indicated back in the May update, the Investor Relations Update, Curragh continues to remain in the bottom quartile of Australia's export of hard coking coal producers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Stewart, just a follow-up on that, is there a risk that you could be mirroring the '09 type increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's far too early to make that call. Back in '09 the commodity prices for hard coking coals spiked up to $300 a ton. We're nowhere near that. So the real issue is maybe not in our segment, in terms of the export metallurgical coal segment. It's what's happening in other segments such as the coal seam methane, what's happening in the Gladstone area, particularly in Queensland and what's happening in WA in terms of the resources sector?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. Just first on Kmart please. A number of trial stores, the product mix is quite different. I was wondering whether you could comment on the learnings with respect to sales and profit performance coming through those stores?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. So we only have about three trial stores that are down on the ground at the moment spread across Australia, Victoria, Northern Territory and Queensland. And it's early days I would still suggest. What we're trying to deliver here is how we can deliver a much better experience for the consumer. They're not really product tests. They're more experiences around improving the shopping experience for customers to give them wider aisles and not only around the store but also in between departments, as we understand that our main consumer is a mother with children, so taking the consideration giving her the space for the pram and also the shopping trolleys. So we're quite happy about how all three of them are going. But it's too early days in a fleet of nearly 180 to make any decision on which one will work best.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we still intend to open probably between 10 and 20 stores a year for the coming years. What's important, though, to us is more the quality of those sites rather than the quantity of them. You've taken a fairly prudent view on returns on capital and therefore want to make sure when we put down sites then we're going to get that effective return for them. But there's a definite intent within the business to not only improve our existing stores but to open new ones as well.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Couple of questions. Firstly, on margin pressure, and I think you specifically stated in the outlook statement that Target and Officeworks would experience margin pressure. If trading conditions continue as they are right throughout the year, is it inevitable that margins will be down in both of those businesses?</p>
          <p>And the second question, one of the themes across a number of your retail businesses was new product categories. I was just wondering how extensive those opportunities might be across the Coles, Bunnings and Officeworks businesses? I think they were the three businesses you specifically mentioned new product categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, maybe if I kick-off and deal with two parts of the question that deal with Officeworks and Bunnings and then hand to Launa for the margin bit and then on to Ian for category expansion. So we all know who's going to say what.</p>
          <p>In terms of Officeworks, it's not inevitable that margins will decline. And net margins are a result of what you're able to achieve on costs and on your supply side and obviously what you can do from a volume perspective. So there's no inevitability. Certainly some of the segments that Officeworks play in, very fiercely competitive, particularly electronics. So that's really what we were highlighting, that there's an intensity of competition in some of the areas.</p>
          <p>In terms of the categories, from a Bunnings point of view there are some very low share categories from a home improvement and outdoor living perspective that we're focusing on. Electrical and plumbing are two that we're very keen to see improvements in and landscape is another one we're pushing very hard on. And from an Officeworks' point of view, I think we'd love to see print services and furniture really continue to do well. They've shown some very good trends across the last year and we're working very hard on elements inside those to get them to run harder than they are at the moment and grow at a faster rate than the overall rate of growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, I think this kind of reflects on the last year. If you think about it, our first half was particularly outstanding. I mean we had a phenomenal margin percentage growth there, as such. And realistically, we're not anticipating that we're going to be able to achieve that EBIT margin for the first half of this financial year. I mean, we believe it's going to return to more normalized return for the first half of FY11. So &#x2013; and then thereafter it's really about trying to contain our costs and get better prices. But that first half of this financial year was unusual. Ian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Product category opportunities within the Coles business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we've tended to focus on is actually the whole store concept rather than specific categories. Clearly, we were selling fruit and veg before the turnaround and after the new renewals came in we were selling fish as well. But the way that we're doing it now has far greater customer appeal than it had before. So it's a situation where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and we'll continue to do that. There are some elements of things that we've been trying and rolling quite successfully. The Curry Pot idea that we had has been developed into more stores now. And it also gives opportunity to develop further with smaller suppliers. So that's had encouraging results.</p>
          <p>Even in the grocery areas, looking at what we've been doing but how we can do it better. So you're developing a better range of products in health and beauty and merchandising, presenting it in a better way to customers. So if it's worked in renewal stores then we've looked to expand that. So we've got 550 stores across the company now with a new health and beauty concept in the last year or so.</p>
          <p>The same with things like entertainment and paper shop. There's opportunities in books, magazines, DVDs, even mobile phones. So expanding that into over 50 stores as well through both renewal stores and existing estate are ways in which we can see developments perhaps outside the norm.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I've got a question that follows on from what Grant was asking around the number of new stores. Presumably, the new stores will be bigger on average than the existing portfolio? Could you talk about that a little bit, Ian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, I mean that's part of what I was mentioning. I think that we'd be looking for stores that were larger than the ones that have previously been opened maybe some two or three years ago. Because we believe that we can operate those stores more effectively and put together a better offer that's more appealing to the customer. And we want to make sure that we land those in a way which is going to optimize the model overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you're refurbishing the stores what sort of retail space increase are you able to achieve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in some it's basically a rework of existing space and trying to make that space work better for you and more efficiently. You know if we can change the GLA to SLA ratio we'll look at that as well. And some of it is bringing the back of house into the store as well, where we're opening up areas like bakery and opening up areas like fresh meat. So I wouldn't put a figure on the overall expansion. But generally we'd expect to see, if we've got an average of 2,500 square meters at the moment, we'd be looking to open stores that are ahead of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in an ideal world, Ian, what proportion of your shoppers' baskets would include products from the fresh category and how far away would you say you are from achieving this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've still got improvements to make and, again, I wouldn't want to put a figure on it. But I think that we &#x2013; traditionally we've underperformed in terms of fresh and we're pleased with the operation that we've put in place. We focus very much on getting the product quickly through the supply chain, educating team members in store to care for the product more effectively and ensuring that we have good quality presentation to the customers that delivers well for them when they get it home. And that's where we're seeing improvements coming through, because customers are actually buying more, trusting it more, having a good experience in coming back and buying it again. So we're seeing more Fresh items in the basket than we saw a year ago and we're seeing more customers, our existing customers buying Fresh and actually new customers coming in and buying Fresh as well. So we're encouraged with the performance that we've got, but we think we can do better.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Ian, I've got a question for you just in relation to the EBIT margin expansion in Coles. There's been a few moving parts but it looks like in the second half you've achieved something in the order of 50 basis point expansion compared to the 40% basis point expansion for the full year. When you consider the conditions that were prevailing in the market at that time, it was pretty low volume and inflation growth. What sort of stopped Coles from being able to drive greater margin expansion than, say, 50 basis points when conditions improved both in terms of inflation and volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure that you can necessarily rely on high levels of inflation that have existed in supermarkets previously. I'd expect inflation levels to remain relatively low, notwithstanding the broader global changes that might exist in commodity prices. And that's certainly what we'd expect. I mean, we generally want to deliver better value for our customers because we believe we can engender higher levels of customer trust, we grow sales, grow customer account and improve overall profitability. The more that we can improve our overall footfall into our stores, the better we can fractionalize cost in stores as well. I also believe that by leveraging the improvements that we might make in the supply chain, we can lower our cost of doing business, A, by becoming more efficient and also by fractionalizing those costs as well. But we still want to make sure we deliver strong value and continue to invest in it and grow sales overall. And as I said before, it's a sales led turnaround.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And just in relation to the resource divisions, you said that you're going to be supplying 100% of those now. What kind of an impact does that make compared to previously?</p>
          <p>And also the potential expansion at Curragh; is the met coal ratio is going to be similar to the current expansion that's underway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just in terms of Premier and our deliveries to Verve, we'll see about a 25% increase in volume over the next 12 months, and we expect that will continue into the future and into the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>In terms of the expansion of Curragh post the existing one to 8.5 million tons per year, that's something we'll come back and report to the market once that feasibility study is completed. And we're targeting about middle of next year for that work to be completed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Richard if I could just squeeze one last one in for you. We put out a piece recently, just going back to what the strategy was for Wesfarmers at the start of your acquiring Coles.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought it was a well-written thing. The definition of a core business in Wesfarmers is one that's worth more to the shareholders of Wesfarmers than it's worth to someone else, and that's always been the case. And we think Coles has got enormous growth opportunities into the future. You're right in your piece where you talked a bit about that. That was at a time when we were a part of the consortium and we made a decision in the middle of 2007 to go it alone. And one of the benefits of that is that we'll be able to extract the benefits of the turnaround of Coles and Kmart over time for our shareholders, and that's very much the way we're looking at things at the moment.</p>

          <p>Afternoon all. Just a question on margins at Coles. The message has been really around price and value. Can we take that to mean that gross margins are falling and have fallen this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't comment on gross margins overall. I think that what we're trying to do is manage our position such that we recognize the internal expectations on overall margin expansion and there are a number of moving parts to that. Some of that is improving trading terms, other elements of our investing in price, and other aspects of it are going to be improving our efficiency programs in store to lower our cost of doing business. So we're watching very carefully all aspects of those lines within our P&amp;L to deliver the right result, both in terms of sales growth and profit expansion.</p>

So we're comfortable with that. And it is important for us, because then we have to be able to cost at the beginning of the season and really know what things are going to land at.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Ian, the fingers are pointing at you as the engineer of price deflation in the Australian marketplace in your categories. And the trade says you and Durkam consider Australian consumers pay too much for their groceries. So my question is how much more are consumers paying and do you want to give us some category examples where you think prices are too high?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I think that what we've noticed since we came to Australia is that there's quite a heavy consolidation in individual markets through the supply base and in actual fact that contraction is &#x2013; has probably exacerbated since we got here. What you've got in some markets, for example, in milk supply, you have suppliers who have about 80% market share in individual states and if the demand for overseas milk grows they can freeze, dry it and restrict supply here which will cause the price to rise which you don't have an alternative source of supply the way you have elsewhere in Europe.</p>
          <p>In some areas where you've got larger suppliers, global suppliers, they &#x2013; if you dig into their report and accounts you'll probably find that where you can get the information you will find that they make more money out of Australasia than they might make in other areas of the world. Now, what they will argue is they don't have the fractionalization of cost benefit because they still got to produce the infrastructure and invest in the capital but it's for a lower level of consumers and therefore prices need to be higher on the top of it. You may choose to believe that or you may not. Certainly, we believe that in many instances that prices are higher than they need to be and that's something we'll continue to discuss with them.</p>

          <p>Okay. And Terry, you're running a business with a debt-to-equity of 16% and interest cover of six times. Should we consider that normality now for Wesfarmers?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think debt-to-equity, I'd always be cautious given that equity is very different to the previous equity for the Group so that it's more we look more at our liquidity ratios like cash interest cover. And we're comfortable with where they are in terms of, one, giving us strength and, two, giving us potential ability to do things if they became attractive. So at this stage, it's not something that's causing us a lot of sleep one way or the other.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rob Blythe from Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="25" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, guys. Just one from me. A question on Curragh. I know the owners of the tenement that sits between your Curragh and Curragh North, I think it's MDL162, say that they anticipate developing in the future. What impact do you think this will have on Curragh?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe I should make some comments about Curragh and the MDL without necessarily going into what their plans, because we're not privy to what their plans are. But all I'd say is that Curragh is already through &#x2013; Curragh and Curragh East and Curragh North &#x2013; already mining the best reserves in the Blackwater area.</p>
          <p>And as part of the MDL162 bid, we submitted a very, very full bid. We used all the synergies available from Curragh including four drag lines, prep plan and rail loop, at cost. And we weren't successful with our bid but we believe the successful bidder was five to six times higher than that.</p>
          <p>So we don't sort of have any insight into what their plans are but clearly we're very focused on our business, running our business efficiently and moving forward with the existing expansion and setting ourselves up for a further one in the next 12 months or so.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The train line, the rail loop, we contribute capital to that with QR. Our wash plant, we need all the wash plant capacity for our own expansion requirements. And the Curragh North conveyor that goes from Curragh to Curragh North goes right through the middle of half their reserves they're purchasing as part of this acquisition.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I just want to ask you, there's been talk in the media of Bunnings stopping Woolworths setting up their hardware super stores in various locations around Australia. Are any of those reports true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, no, that was quite a poorly put together story, I thought. We've land banked sites, we've always land banked sites and I think the article was focused on a site in Hervey Bay. We've got existing tenure on a store at the moment and if that area continues to grow, we might need a bigger store and we can't make a bigger store where we are, so we bought some land. End of story. We're very focused on using our capital in a positive way, not in a defensive way.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys, this is in regards to Coles. Can you just tell us what the provision release was this year in terms of the meat contract?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And just in regards to Target, Launa made the point that you've reduced your prices by 50%. Is that not just pass &#x2013; I'm sorry, pardon me, 50% of your SKUs. Is that not just passing through the tariff and the currency sort of now coming through? So, I guess, the question is, is that the main source of that? And then secondly, I guess where does that see you sit relative to competitors?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Where does it see you sit relative to competitors, given that reducing prices by discretionary retailers has been pretty common?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, I think what you'll see right across the retail industry, whether it's start with Myer or whether it be in the bottom-end feeders, we've already lowered our prices. I think everyone's experiencing deflation. We've been very promotionally driven, a lot of retailers. But with us trying to establish just better prices we have passed that on to the consumers because that's what they're asking for: value.</p>
          <p>And some of it has come through from the dollar. Some of it has come through from the benefits of the lower duty. And then of course, it's also trying to negotiate with our suppliers to get better prices. So it's a combination of all three of them. But realistically, the deflation is not just exclusive to Target. It's right throughout the industry.</p>

      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one question on the FoodWorks debt, if you have any color around where that's at but more importantly leases, that you might have to take back leases given what's going on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I might handle that one, Phil. In terms of the debt, we've got limited exposure to FoodWorks now. We've effectively got a provision against any debt that we've got. And so our view is on that basis that nothing material will come of that. And in terms of leases, again, we don't see any material exposure either.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, just one question for you. You've got a couple of major OpEx programs coming through in FY11, one being the store roll out, the other being the rest of the easy order rollout. Can we expect the first half margin growth to be anywhere like what we saw in the second half of FY10?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't give guidance on where overall margins are going to go, but clearly, we know what needs to be done from an OpEx perspective. And we've got our targets for the current financial year and we are working hard to make sure that we achieve those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one question for you again, Stewart, just with the upgrades for Curragh and Bengalla, the feasibility studies, when would that extra tonnage hit if they were to go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of Bengalla, as you would see in the information pack, the timing of the announcement of the approvals for development that we're targeting in the second half of this year, if that takes place then coal will come on at the back-end of 2013. In terms of the Curragh expansion, the existing expansion that we're doing, it will be second half of 2011/12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the further 1.5 million tonnes in Curragh?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we're still doing that feasibility study. We will update you as we go through that study over the next 12 months. And as part of that update, we'll give you further information in terms of if and when additional tonnage becomes available.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But more likely to be beyond FY13?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've said there that the likely timing of that additional volume is to coincide with Wiggins Island coming online. Wiggins Island is targeted to come online in 2014, so that will be the earliest that additional volume with this expansion to 10 million tonnes would come online.</p>
